It is licensed for the first- and second-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and second-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia on the basis of BCR-ABL inhibition, but the activity of dasatinib against additional molecular targets may enable treatment of other hematologic disorders. Potential targets for dasatinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) include Lyn (a Src family kinase), ABL, and the associated CD40 pathway. Although dasatinib monotherapy has modest clinical activity in CLL, ongoing studies are evaluating combination treatment. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3, Lyn, c-Kit, and BCR-ABL are expressed in a subpopulation of patients. To date, clinical responses to dasatinib in patients with unselected AML have been mixed and larger studies are needed, particularly correlating clinical response to molecular markers. Imatinib has been used successfully to treat patients with chronic eosinophilic disorders with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase; limited clinical data indicate that dasatinib could be active in imatinib-resistant disease. Ongoing clinical studies should further define the value of dasatinib in these disorders.",

A minimum dose (200 mg) required for effective BCR-ABL inhibition in imatinib resistant/intolerant leukemia was determined. The pre-clinical activity profile of nilotinib against mutant BCR-ABL was largely confirmed. Substantial differences between peripheral blood baseline pCRKL/CRKL ratios were observed when comparing chronic myeloid leukemia with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, rapid BCR-ABL-reactivation shortly after starting nilotinib treatment was seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with progressive disease carrying the P-loop mutations Y253H, E255K, or mutation T315I.

Since these proteins are only expressed in Ph1 positive cells, they are per definition tumor-specific. In this report we describe the reactivity of polyvalent antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the tumor-specific bcr-abl junctions.

Currently, specific genetic rearrangements can be identified in as many as 50% of children with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. The genes p16 (or MTS1) and TEL/AML1 are now respectively recognized as the most common tumor suppressor and fusion genes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Increasingly, contemporary protocols for the acute leukemias are relying on genetic information to guide treatment decisions. Examples include the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the BCR-ABL fusion gene or MLL rearrangement, and for acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7; antimetabolite-based therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with hyperdiploidy of more than 50 chromosomes (DNA index > or = 1.16); and retinoic acid and anthracycline-containing regimens for the acute promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia subtype with PML-RARA fusion. Other efforts are being made to reduce the long-term sequelae of treatment. Indeed, extended intrathecal therapy and intensive systemic chemotherapy will, in all likelihood, replace cranial irradiation as subclinical central nervous system therapy for patients with intermediate-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and perhaps even for those with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia and SUP B-15 Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were used as positive controls for p210 and p190 BCR-ABL mRNAs, respectively. HL60 cell line was used as a negative control. After the leukemia cells were fixed and permeabilized, without extracting nucleic acids, the mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs, and the cDNAs were amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent primers specific for p190 and p210 BCR-ABL mRNAs. After transfer onto glass slides by cytospin, the amplified cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy after propidium iodide or 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindone counterstaining showed that the positive K562 cells exhibited a yellow-green fluorescent cytoplasm around a red nucleus, and that the positive SUP B-15 cells exhibited an orange cytoplasm around a blue nucleus. Only the red or blue nucleus was visible in respective negative HL60 cells. The specificity of amplification was confirmed by the absence of a signal when control experiments were performed either with RNase digestion of mRNA or without reverse transcriptase/Taq polymerase.

In contrast, a significant fraction of healthy humans have been found to have BCR/ABL-positive hematopoietic cells. To bridge the gap between the information derived from current mouse models and nonleukemic humans with the BCR/ABL oncogene, we generated a knockin model with BCR/ABL p210 expressed from the Bcr locus. Unlike previous models, expression of BCR/ABL from the knockin allele did not induce leukemia. BCR/ABL mutant cells did exhibit favorable bone marrow engraftment compared to control cells. These data suggest that BCR/ABL expression alone is insufficient to induce disease.

The P190 form of BCR-ABL is rarely observed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but is present in 50% of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In contrast, the P210 form is observed both in CML and 50% of Ph-positive ALL. Methylation of the proximal promoter of the ABL1 gene has been shown to be a nearly universal event associated with clinical progression of CML. This raises the question of whether methylation of the ABL1 promoter is an epigenetic modification also associated with Ph-positive ALL. To study this issue, we used methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing to determine the methylation status of the ABL1 promoter in 18 Ph-positive ALL samples. We report here that gene-specific ABL1 promoter methylation is associated mainly with the P210 form of BCR-ABL and not the P190 form. While six out of the seven P210-positive ALL samples had ABL1 promoter methylation, none of the 11 P190-positive ALL samples demonstrated ABL1 promoter methylation. In addition, we estimated the extent and relative abundance of ABL1 promoter methylation in several Ph-positive ALL samples and compared it to the methylation pattern in chronic, accelerated and blastic crisis phases of CML.

In contrast, Atm, a signaling molecule that interacts with c-Abl and is required for c-Abl activation, served a totally different function. The significance of these findings is discussed here in the context of aging and tumorigenesis and their links to reactive oxygen species. c-Abl and its derivatives BCR-ABL and v-Abl were discovered more than twenty years ago. BCR-ABL and v-Abl acquire elevated tyrosine kinase activities by fusing to BCR and gag respectively and are capable of transforming myeloid and fibroblast cells. BCR-ABL is also the underlying cause in the development of most cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in humans.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tyrosine kinases are commonly mutated and activated in both acute and chronic myeloid leukemias. Here, we review the functions, signaling activities, mechanism of transformation, and therapeutic targeting of two prototypic tyrosine kinase oncogenes, BCR-ABL and FLT3, associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. BCR-ABL is generated by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a chimeric oncogene in which the BCR and c-ABL genes are fused. The product of this oncogene, BCR-ABL, has elevated ABL tyrosine kinase activity and transforms hematopoietic cells by exerting a wide variety of biological effects, including reduction in growth factor dependence, enhanced viability, and altered adhesion of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) cells. Elevated tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is critical for activating downstream signalling cascades and for all aspects of transformation, explaining the remarkable clinical efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (STI571). By comparison, FLT3 is mutated in about one third of all cases of AML, most often through a mechanism that involves an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of a small number of amino acid residues in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. As is the case for BCR-ABL, these mutations activate the kinase activity constitutively, activate multiple signaling pathways, and result in an augmentation of proliferation and viability. Transformation by FLT3-ITD can readily be observed in murine models, and FLT3 cooperates with other types of oncogenes to create a fully transformed acute leukemia. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and may be very useful therapeutic agents in AML.",

However, it is unclear whether imatinib is sufficient to eradicate the disease because of primary or secondary resistance of leukemic cells. Therefore, targeting Bcr-Abl with an alternative approach is of great interest. We demonstrate that RNA interference (RNAi) with a breakpoint-specific short-interfering RNA (siRNA) is capable of decreasing Bcr-Abl protein expression and of antagonizing Bcr-Abl-induced biochemical activities. RNAi selectively inhibited Bcr-Abl-dependent cell growth. Furthermore, bcr-abl-homologous siRNA increased sensitivity to imatinib in Bcr-Abl-overexpressing cells and in a cell line expressing the imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutation His396Pro, thereby antagonizing 2 of the major mechanisms of resistance to imatinib.",

Imatinib is highly effective at treating human Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase but not Ph(+) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and CML blast crisis. We find that SRC kinases activated by BCR-ABL remain fully active in imatinib-treated mouse leukemic cells, suggesting that imatinib does not inactivate all BCR-ABL-activated signaling pathways. This SRC pathway is essential for leukemic cells to survive imatinib treatment and for CML transition to lymphoid blast crisis. Inhibition of both SRC and BCR-ABL kinase activities by dasatinib affords complete B-ALL remission. However, curing B-ALL and CML mice requires killing leukemic stem cells insensitive to both imatinib and dasatinib.

The Src-family kinases (SFKs) are one such pathway and have been implicated in imatinib resistance. Additionally, these kinases are key to the progression of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitor dasatinib is now clinically available and has markedly greater potency compared with imatinib against native BCR-ABL and the majority of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Therefore, this agent, as well as other dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitors under development, could provide added therapeutic advantages by overcoming both BCR-ABL-dependent (i.e. BCR-ABL mutations) and -independent forms of imatinib resistance and delaying transition to advanced phase disease.

Dysregulation or aberrant activation of such cascades can lead to inappropriate cell survival and abnormal cell proliferation in leukemia. Successful treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL fusion gene is a prime example of effectively inhibiting intracellular signaling cascades. However, even in these patients resistance can develop via emergence of mutations or feedback activation of other pathways that cause refractory disease. Constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been observed in different types of leukemia, including CML, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Abnormal mTOR activity may contribute to chemotherapy resistance, while it may also be effectively targeted via molecular means and/or development of specific pharmacological inhibitors.

Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib is currently standard for chronic myelogenous leukemia, which is also caused by Bcr/Abl. However, Imatinib has shown limited efficacy for treating Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In our study, we have investigated the effect of Imatinib therapy on murine P190 Bcr/Abl lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Three of four cultures were very sensitive to treatment with 5 mumol/L Imatinib. Significant cell death also initially occurred when the same cultures were treated in the presence of stromal support. However, after 6 days, remaining cells started to proliferate vigorously. The Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase present in the cells that were now able to multiply in the presence of 5 mumol/L Imatinib was still inhibited by the drug. In concordance with this, the Abl ATP-binding pocket domain of Bcr/Abl in the resistant cells did not contain point mutations which would make the protein Imatinib resistant. The effect of stroma in selecting Imatinib-resistant lymphoblasts did not require direct cell-cell contact. SDF-1alpha could substitute for the presence of stromal cells. Our results show that stroma selects Imatinib-resistant Bcr/Abl P190 lymphoblasts that are less dependent on Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, therapy for Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aimed at interfering with the protective effect of stroma in combination with Imatinib, could be of benefit for the eradication of the leukemic cells.",

Lack of P-selectin resulted in early release of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors from bone marrow, appearing to alter the biologic properties of leukemic cells rather than their growth rate by increasing their homing to the lungs, causing fatal lung hemorrhages. These results indicate that adhesion of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors to marrow stroma through P-selectin and ICAM1 play an inhibitory role in the development of CML-like disease, suggesting that improvement of adhesion between BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitor cells and bone marrow stroma may be of therapeutic value for human CML.",

We depleted BTK in Ba/F3 and 32D cells expressing native and kinase domain (KD) mutant (E255K and T315I) Bcr-Abl, using shRNA. BTK levels were reduced to <10% of controls. However, no differences in viability and cell proliferation were observed and the response to imatinib was not altered. Consistent with this, proliferation and viability were unaffected by inhibition of BTK with reversible (PC-005) and irreversible (PCI-31523) small molecule inhibitors.

Discovery of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein as the molecular abnormality causing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) paved the way for the development of a targeted anticancer therapy. The substantial activity of imatinib mesylate (STI571, Glivec) in CML and Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) changed the therapeutic approach to Ph+ leukemia and rang the bell for a new era of anticancer treatment. However, when the phenomenon of relapse occurred despite continued imatinib treatment, we had to learn the lesson that imatinib can select for a resistant disease clone. If such a clone still depends on Bcr-Abl, it either carries a BCR-ABL point mutation that prevents binding of the drug or expresses the fusion protein at high levels. Alternatively, leukemia cells that harbor secondary genetic alterations resulting in Bcr-Abl-independent proliferation are selected for their growth advantage in the presence of imatinib. Point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain prevent binding of imatinib but still allow binding of ATP, thus retaining Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Mutated BCR-ABL is frequently detected in cases of imatinib-resistant Ph+ leukemia and therefore represents the main challenge for the investigation of alternative strategies to either overcome resistance or to prevent the emergence of a resistant leukemic clone.",

Depending on the localization of the breakpoint in the bcr gene different chimeric bcr-abl genes are generated, each encoding their own tumor-specific protein: e1-a2P190bcr-abl, b2-a2p210bcr-abl, or b3-a2P210bcr-abl. Especially in ALL, the presence of such a tumor-specific protein is highly associated with a poor prognosis. Detection of these proteins therefore has a strong clinical significance.

The specificity of BP-2 for the bcr-abl joining region in b3-a2P210bcr-abl is demonstrated by means of peptide inhibition studies in combination with immunoprecipitation. In addition we show the reactivity of BP-2 with bcr-abl proteins in leukemic cells of a Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL patient.",

The common B-cell phenotype is a feature of the SK-9 cell line. Cells have the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) with many structural abnormalities, as well as the T315I mutation in the BCR-ABL gene. Insertion of SK-9 cells into athymic nude mice induced the formation of tumors in the lymph node that infiltrated into the spleen and bone marrow. We examined the drug sensitivity of imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib using a cell proliferation assay and an immunoblot assay. Cell proliferation did not decrease after imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib treatment as compared to the BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. Because phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L did not decrease after imatinib and dasatinib treatment, it is suggested that SK-9 is resistant to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib.;This cell line may provide a useful model for in vitro and in vivo cellular and molecular studies of BCR-ABL-positive ALL with T315I mutation.",

To evaluate the accuracy of this new technique, we tested 70 patients with hematological diseases using the CBA system, cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Most of the results obtained by the CBA system were concordant with those by cytogenetic analysis, FISH and RQ-PCR. In the CBA system, dilution experiments with positive control samples revealed sensitivities of at least 1%. The statistical analysis revealed that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of the BCR-ABL fusion proteins from mononuclear cells (MNCs) were higher than those from WBC or BM samples. The MFI values of cells were not dramatically reduced after 24 hours of storage at room temperature. The CBA technique detected all types of BCR-ABL proteins in leukemic cells with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, CBAs will contribute to the fast and easy diagnosis of leukemias, the classification of leukemias and the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD).",

Therefore, we tested the efficacy of discontinuous dexamethasone against continuous dexamethasone in murine models bearing human acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts (n = 8 patient samples) or murine BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma dexamethasone concentrations (7.9 to 212 nM) were similar to those achieved in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using conventional dosages. The median leukemia-free survival ranged from 16 to 59 days; dexamethasone prolonged survival from a median of 4 to 129 days in all seven dexamethasone-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemias. In the majority of cases (7 of 8 xenografts and the murine BCR-ABL model) we demonstrated equal efficacy of the two dexamethasone dosing regimens; whereas for one acute lymphoblastic leukemia sample, the discontinuous regimen yielded inferior antileukemic efficacy (log-rank p = 0.002).

However, rottlerin inhibited neither PKCdelta nor BCR/ABL in these cells. On the other hand, rottlerin, previously characterized also as a mitochondrial uncoupler, transiently but significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and gradually induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Moreover, two other mitochondrial uncouplers, FCCP and DNP, very similarly induced apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing cells in a synergistic manner with imatinib. Imatinib synergistically enhanced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization induced by mitochondrial uncouplers, which led to release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and activation of caspases-3 and -9. Rottlerin also enhanced the cytotoxic effect of imatinib in leukemic cells from patients with CML blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL or a cell line expressing the imatinib-resistant E255K BCR/ABL mutant.

Since a clear distinction between de novo BCR-ABL+ AML and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis is challenging in many cases, the existence of de novo BCR-ABL+ AML has been a matter of debate for a long time. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that BCR-ABL+ AML is in fact a distinct subgroup of AML. In this study, we analyzed all published cases since 1975 as well as cases from our institution in order to present common clinical and molecular features of this rare disease. Our analysis shows that BCR-ABL predominantly occurs in AML-NOS, CBF leukemia, and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. The most common BCR-ABL transcripts (p190 and p210) are nearly equally distributed. Based on the analysis of published data, we provide a clinical algorithm for the initial differential diagnosis of BCR-ABL+ AML. The prognosis of BCR-ABL+ AML seems to depend on the cytogenetic and/or molecular background rather than on BCR-ABL itself. A therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib is reasonable, but-due to a lack of systematic clinical data-their use cannot be routinely recommended in first-line therapy. Beyond first-line treatment of AML, the use of TKI remains an individual decision, both in combination with intensive chemotherapy and/or as a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In each single case, potential benefits have to be weighed against potential risks. ",

The Philadelphia chromosome occurs in 95% of people with chronic myeloid leukemia. ABL is the cellular homologue of the oncogene found in murine Abelson leukemia virus, and BCR refers to breakpoint cluster region. The Bcr-Abl oncoprotein exhibits elevated protein-tyrosine kinase activity, which is strongly implicated in the mechanism of development of chronic myeloid leukemia. STI-571 is effective in the treatment of the stable phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The c-Abl protein kinase domain exists in an active and inactive conformation. STI-571 binds only to the inactive state of the enzyme as shown by X-ray crystallography. The drug binds to a portion of the ATP-binding site and extends from there into adjacent hydrophobic regions. STI-571 is a competitive inhibitor of Abl kinase with respect to ATP. Resistance to STI-571 is often the result of mutations in residues of the Bcr-Abl kinase that ordinarily bind to the drug. Inhibition of target protein kinases represents an emerging therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.",

At the molecular level, the t(9;22) leads to the fusion of the BCR gene (on chromosome 22) to the ABL gene (translocated from chromosome 9); this fusion gene BCR-ABL with its elevated tyrosine kinase activity must to be central to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Three different breakpoint cluster regions are discerned within the BCR gene on chromosome 22: M-bcr, m-bcr, and mu-bcr. Ph + leukemia cell lines are important tools in this research area. More than 20 ALL-and more than 40 CML-derived Ph + leukemia cell lines have been described. Furthermore, three Ph + B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, established from patients with Ph + ALL or CML, are available. Molecular analysis has documented BCR-ABL fusion genes in three apparently Ph chromosome-negative cell lines, all three derived from CML. Nearly all Ph + ALL cell lines have the m-bcr e1-a2 fusion gene (only two ALL cell lines have a b3-a2 fusion) whereas all CML cell lines, but one carry the M-bcr b2-a2, b3-a2 or both hybrids. The mu-bcr e19-a2 has been detected in one CML cell line. Four cell lines display a three-way translocation involving chromosomes 9, 22 and a third chromosome. Additional Ph chromosomes (up to five) have been found in four Ph + ALL cell lines and in 18 CML cell lines; though in some cell lines the extra Ph chromosome(s) might be caused by the polyploidy (tri- and tetraploidy) of the cells. Another modus to acquire additional copies of the BCR-ABL fusion gene is the formation of tandem repeats of the BCR-ABL hybrid as seen in CML cell line K-562. Both mechanisms, selective multiplication of the der(22) chromosome and tandem replication of the fusion gene BCR-ABL, presumably lead to enhanced levels of the fusion protein and its tyrosine kinase activity (genetic dosage effect). The availability of a panel of Ph + cell lines as highly informative leukemia models offers the unique opportunity to analyze the pathobiology of these malignancies and the role of the Ph chromosome in leukemogenesis.",

The stem and progenitor cell potential of these cultures at different times of incubation in relation to BCR/Abl(protein) expression and sensitivity to imatinib-mesylate was explored by transferring cells to growth-permissive secondary cultures in normoxia, according to the Culture-Repopulating Ability assay methodology.;Hypoxia-resistant cells maintained BCR/Abl(protein) expression until glucose was no longer available in primary hypoxic cultures, where glucose availability appeared to regulate cell number and the balance between the enrichment of cells with kinetic properties typical of stem or progenitor cells. Cells surviving merely hypoxic conditions were, upon transfer to secondary cultures, immediately available for numerical expansion due to the maintained BCR/Abl(protein) expression, and were consequently sensitive to imatinib-mesylate. Instead, BCR/Abl(protein)-negative cells selected in primary cultures under oxygen/glucose shortage underwent a delayed numerical expansion in secondary cultures, which was completely refractory to imatinib-mesylate. Cells with the latter properties were also found in primary chronic myeloid leukemia explants.;Glucose shortage in hypoxia was shown to represent the condition selecting BCR/Abl(protein)-negative cells refractory to imatinib-mesylate from either chronic myeloid leukemia lines or patients.

However, almost all CML colonies that grow in the presence of 1.0 micromol/L CGP57148B are BCR-ABL-positive, which may reflect the fact that residual normal clonogenic myeloid precursors are infrequent in most patients with CML.

CML is clinically characterized by three distinct phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Blast crisis is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), with secondary chromosomal abnormalities present. We report a case of myeloid blast crisis of CML resistant to imatinib mesylate and chemotherapy. By use of cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and comparative genomic hybridization methods, we identified a cluster of BCR-ABL amplification on inverted duplication of the Ph chromosome with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and increased genomic levels of the RUNX1 gene (previously AML1). The t(3;21)(q26;q22) is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in some cases of CML blast phase and in treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.

Our study indicated that the progenitor of CML was BCR-ABL dependent through the amplification of Ph chromosome as a mechanism of resistance to imatinib therapy.

Knocking down Jak2 in Bcr-Abl+ cells reduced levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also the phosphorylation of Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl, and Jak2 overexpression rescued these knockdown effects. Treatment of Bcr-Abl+ cells with Jak2 inhibitors for 4-6 h but not with IM also reduced Bcr-Abl protein and pTyr177 levels. In vitro kinase experiments performed with recombinant Jak2 showed that Jak2 readily phosphorylated Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl (a Jak2 consensus site, YvnV) whereas c-Abl did not. Importantly, Jak2 inhibition decreased pTyr177 Bcr-Abl in immune complexes but did not reduce levels of Bcr-Abl, suggesting that the reduction of Bcr-Abl by Jak2 inhibition is a separate event from phosphorylation of Tyr177. Jak2 inhibition by chemical inhibitors (TG101209/WP1193) and Jak2 knockdown diminished the activation of Ras, PI-3 kinase pathways and reduced levels of pTyrSTAT5.

P190 BCR-ABL1 is found in the remaining two thirds of t(9;22)-positive adult B-ALL cases but only exceptionally in CML. We describe here the first case of t(9;22)(q34;q11) associated with t(10;11)(p13;q14) in acute monocytic leukemia. The recurrent t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation, usually found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-ALL, merges PICALM to MLLT10. RT-PCR enabled identification of PICALM-MLLT10 and BCR-ABL1 e1-a2 fusion transcripts; in the context of chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, the latter usually has a monocytic presentation. We also identified overexpression of HOXA9, a gene essential to myeloid differentiation that is expressed in PICALM-MLLT10 and MLL-rearranged acute leukemias. This case fits with and extends a recently proposed multistage AML model in which constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases by mutations (BCR-ABL1) are associated with deregulation of transcription factors central to myeloid differentiation (HOXA9 secondary to PICALM-MLLT10).",

Whereas imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, is now used in frontline therapy for CML, second-generation inhibitors of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase such as nilotinib or dasatinib have been developed for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease. In the current study, we generated nilotinib-resistant cell lines and investigated their mechanism of resistance. Overexpression of BCR-ABL and multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) were found among the investigated mechanisms. We showed that nilotinib is a substrate of the multidrug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein, using verapamil or PSC833 to block binding. Up-regulated expression of p53/56 Lyn kinase, both at the mRNA and protein level, was found in one of the resistant cell lines and Lyn silencing by small interfering RNA restored sensitivity to nilotinib. Moreover, failure of nilotinib treatment was accompanied by an increase of Lyn mRNA expression in patients with resistant CML. Two Src kinase inhibitors (PP1 and PP2) partially removed resistance but did not significantly inhibit Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, dasatinib, a dual Bcr-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor, inhibited the phosphorylation of both BCR-ABL and Lyn, and induced apoptosis of the Bcr-Abl cell line overexpressing p53/56 Lyn. Such mechanisms of resistance are close to those observed in imatinib-resistant cell lines and emphasize the critical role of Lyn in nilotinib resistance.",

This oncoprotein expresses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that is crucial for its cellular transforming activity. In this study, we evaluated the antineoplastic activity of CGP57148B, which is a competitive inhibitor of the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase.;Nude mice were given an injection of the Bcr/Abl-positive human leukemia cell lines KU812 or MC3. Tumor-bearing mice were treated intraperitoneally or orally with CGP57148B according to three different schedules. In vitro drug wash-out experiments and in vivo molecular pharmacokinetic experiments were performed to optimize the in vivo treatment schedule.;Treatment schedules administering CGP57148B once or twice per day produced some inhibition of tumor growth, but no tumor-bearing mouse was cured. A single administration of CGP57148B caused substantial (>50%) but short-lived (2-5 hours) inhibition of Bcr/Abl kinase activity. On the basis of the results from in vitro wash-out experiments, 20-21 hours was defined as the duration of continuous exposure needed to block cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis in these two leukemia cell lines. A treatment regimen assuring the continuous block of the Bcr/Abl phosphorylating activity that was administered over an 11-day period cured 87%-100% of treated mice.;These data indicate that the continuous block of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase of Bcr/Abl protein is needed to produce important biologic effects in vivo.",

A series of bcr/abl genes were constructed in which nested deletions of the bcr gene were fused to the c-abl gene. The fusion proteins encoded by these genes were assayed for autophosphorylation in vivo and for differences in subcellular localization. Our results demonstrate that bcr sequences activate two functions of c-abl; the tyrosine kinase activity and a previously undescribed microfilament-binding function. Two regions of bcr which activate these functions to different degrees have been mapped: amino acids 1 to 63 were strongly activating and amino acids 64 to 509 were weakly activating. The tyrosine kinase and microfilament-binding functions were not interdependent, as a kinase defective bcr/abl mutant still associated with actin filaments and a bcr/abl mutant lacking actin association still had deregulated kinase activity.

First, the results demonstrate that the ectopic expression of the p185 Bcr-Abl fusion protein induced hemoglobin in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells. Exposure to low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; 10 nmol/L) increased hemoglobin levels in HL-60/Bcr-Abl and in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis K562 cells, which express the p210 Bcr-Abl protein. As compared with HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by Ara-C, doxorubicin, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which was associated with reduced processing of caspase-8 and Bid protein and decreased cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c (cyt c). Exposure to CGP57148B alone increased hemoglobin levels and CD11b expression and induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. CGP57148B treatment down-regulated antiapoptotic XIAP, cIAP1, and Bcl-x(L), without affecting Bcl-2, Bax, Apaf-1, Fas (CD95), Fas ligand, Abl, and Bcr-Abl levels. CGP57148B also inhibited constitutively active Akt kinase and NFkappaB in Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Attenuation of NFkappaB activity by ectopic expression of transdominant repressor of IkappaB sensitized HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells to TNF-alpha but not to apoptosis induced by Ara-C or doxorubicin. Importantly, cotreatment with CGP57148B significantly increased Ara-C- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. This was associated with greater cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and PARP cleavage activity of caspase-3.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate have changed the clinical course of chronic myeloid leukemia; however, the observation that these inhibitors do not target the leukemia stem cell implies that patients need to maintain lifelong therapy. The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear: the question of whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors are inactive inside leukemia stem cells or whether leukemia stem cells do not require breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-Abl signaling is currently under debate. Herein, I propose an alternative model: perhaps the leukemia stem cell requires Bcr-Abl, but is dependent on its kinase-independent functions. Kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor and Janus kinase 2 possess kinase-independent roles in regulation of gene expression; it is worth investigating whether Bcr-Abl has similar functions. Mechanistically, Bcr-Abl is able to activate the Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and/or the Src-kinase Hck/Stat5 pathways in a scaffolding-dependent manner. Whereas the scaffolding activity of Bcr-Abl with Grb2 is dependent on autophosphorylation, kinases such as Hck can use Bcr-Abl as substrate, inducing phosphorylation of Y177 to enable scaffolding ability in the absence of Bcr-Abl catalytic activity. It is worth investigating whether leukemia stem cells exclusively express kinases that are able to use Bcr-Abl as substrate. A kinase-independent role for Bcr-Abl in leukemia stem cells would imply that drugs that target Bcr-Abl's scaffolding ability or its DNA-binding ability should be used in conjunction with current therapeutic regimens to increase their efficacy and eradicate the stem cells of chronic myeloid leukemia.

Dasatinib has a generally acceptable safety profile, with most adverse events (AEs) proving manageable and reversible. Cytopenias are commonly observed with dasatinib, and some nonhematologic AEs including pleural effusion have been consistently reported.;Dasatinib is an effective treatment option for patients with CML.",

Only 19 cases of ETV6/ABL1-positive hematological malignancy have been published, diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, other types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study reports three new cases (aged 8 months, 5 years, and 33 years) of ALL with the ETV6/ABL1 fusion found by screening 392 newly diagnosed ALL patients (335 children and 57 adults). A thorough review of the literature and an analysis of all published data, including the three new cases, suggest poor prognosis of ETV6/ABL1-positive acute leukemias. The course of the disease in the two pediatric patients is characterized by minimal residual disease monitoring, using quantification of both the ETV6/ABL1 transcript and immunoreceptor gene rearrangements. Eosinophilia could not be confirmed as a hallmark of the ETV6/ABL1-positive disease. Studies of neonatal blood spots demonstrated that, in the child diagnosed at five years, the ETV6/ABL1 fusion initiating the ALL originated prenatally.",

Many different signal transduction pathways are activated by Bcr-Abl, but little is known about their downstream targets in specific cell lineages. We show here that Ph-positive cell lines as well as primary cells derived from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis or from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) consistently express high levels of cyclin D2, whereas expression of this protein is low or absent in comparable Ph-negative lines and Ph-positive myeloid lines. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl with STI571 resulted in down-regulation of cyclin D2 and reduction of the number of cells in S phase, although complete G1 arrest was not induced. The expression of cyclin D2 in Ph-positive lymphoblasts was mediated via the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase pathway. Analogous results were seen in murine BaF/3 cells transfected with a BCR-ABL expression vector. In contrast to the human cell lines, murine Baf/BCR-ABL cells exposed to STI571 inhibitor were all arrested in G1. This arrest could be abrogated by exogenous expression of cyclin D2 from a transfected cDNA construct. We conclude that a direct connection exists between Bcr-Abl PTK activity and cell cycle progression in which cyclin D2 plays a critical role. However, cell cycle progression in human Ph-positive lymphoid cells is not entirely dependent on Bcr-Abl PTK, and additional genetic lesions must be present.",

The aberration results from a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a BCR-ABL fusion gene. There are two major forms of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, involving ABL exon 2, but including different exons of BCR gene. The transcript b2a2 or b3a2 codes for a p210 protein. Other fusion gene leads to the expression of an e1a2 transcript, which codes for a p190 protein. Other less common fusion genes are b3a3 or b2a3 (p203) and e19a2 (p230). The incidence of one or other rearrangement in chronic myeloid leukemia patients varies in different reports. In general, fusion transcripts are determined individually, a process which is labor- intensive in order to detect all major fusion transcripts. The objective of this study was to set up a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection and to determine the frequency of different fusion genes in 75 Iranian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.;Peripheral blood samples were analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR from 75 adult Iranian chronic myeloid leukemia patients to detect different types of BCR-ABL transcripts of the t(9;22).;All patients examined were positive for some type of BCR/ABL rearrangement. The majority of the patients (83%) expressed one of the p210BCR-ABL transcripts (b3a2, 62% and b2a2, 20%), while the remaining showed one of the transcripts of b3a3, b2a3, e1a2 or co-expression of b3a2 and b2a2. The rate of co-expression of the b3a2 and b2a2 was 5%.;In contrast to other reports, we did not see any co-expression of p210/p190.

Their role in the aetiology of human leukemia remains to be defined. We have previously shown that the tumorigenic effect of BCR-ABL oncogenes is mediated by Bcl-2. In addition to Bcl-2, is a protein essential for transformation by BCR-ABL. However, it is not known how Bcl-2 and Ras fit together in cell transformation by BCR-ABL. The data presented here establish that Bcl-2 is a downstream target gene of the Ras signalling pathway in cells transformed by BCR-ABL, and that constitutive Ras activation results in constitutive expression of the gene. Conversely, a truncated form of the BCR-ABL, which lacks a critical BCR region required for activation of the Ras signalling pathway, failed to induce Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that BCR-ABL prevents apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 through a signalling pathway involving Ras and links constitutive Ras activation and Bcl-2 gene regulation. Hence, these results further imply that Ras is involved in both mitogenic signals and survival signals.",

Donor lymphocyte infusion and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) are generally ineffective in such ALLs, whereas GVL is highly active against bcr/abl(+) CML, which does not have a lesion in the INK4A/ARF locus. The mechanisms for the ineffectiveness of GVL are not fully known, and it is possible that intrinsic resistance of acute lymphoid leukemias to immune effectors associated with allogeneic GVL may contribute to ineffectiveness. This work tested the hypothesis that INK4A/ARF mutations that are associated with transformation of bcr/abl(+) CML to an ALL phenotype, and that are associated with increased resistance to apoptosis render ALL cells insensitive to allogeneic immune responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA). Murine acute pre-B ALLs were induced by transfer of the human p210 bcr/abl gene into bone marrow of INK4A/ARF null mice. These ALL lines were then studied in a murine model of MHC-matched, mHA-mismatched allogeneic BMT. In vivo growth of these ALLs was inhibited in allogeneic transplants characterized by active allogeneic immune responses compared to their behavior in syngeneic transplants. In vitro ALLs with INK4A/ARF, p210 bcr/abl, or p190 bcr/abl mutations remained sensitive to anti-mHA cytolytic T cells. In addition, the ALLs were capable of inducing primary immune responses to mHAs in vivo. Thus, ALLs with INK4A/ARF or bcr/abl mutations are not intrinsically resistant to allogeneic T cell responses, suggesting that active immunotherapies against mHA have the potential to control such acute lymphoblastic leukemias.",

It is therefore of great importance to find new therapies, possibly as drug combinations, which can overcome drug resistance. In this study, we identified eleven candidate anti-leukemic drugs that might be combined with imatinib, using three approaches: a kinase inhibitor library screen, a gene expression correlation analysis, and literature analysis. We then used an experimental search algorithm to efficiently explore the large space of possible drug and dose combinations and identified drug combinations that selectively kill a BCR-ABL+ leukemic cell line (K562) over a normal fibroblast cell line (IMR-90). Only six iterations of the algorithm were needed to identify very selective drug combinations. The efficacy of the top forty-nine combinations was further confirmed using Ph+ and Ph- ALL patient cells, including imatinib-resistant cells.

However, suboptimal medication adherence has been observed with these agents affecting clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. In order to raise awareness of the problem of adherence, and before developing pragmatic strategies to enhance medication adherence, a deep understanding of the best approaches for measuring adherence in chronic myeloid leukemia patients and identifying non-adherence is required. A systematic literature review on the prevalence, measurement methods, consequences and risk factors for non-adherence to BCR-ABL inhibitors and adherence-enhancing interventions was performed and critically appraised. Of the 19 included articles, 9 were retrospective. Average adherence varied from 19% to almost 100% of the proportion of prescribed drug taken, but it was measured through various different methods and within different study groups. Suboptimal adherence was associated with a negative impact on both clinical and economic outcomes. There is a lack of supportive evidence demonstrating a difference in adherence across BCR-ABL inhibitors and even contradictory results between the 2(nd) generation inhibitors. Drug-related adverse events and forgetfulness were common reasons for intentional and unintentional non-adherence, respectively, but further research is required to identify additional reasons behind non-adherence or patients at risk of non-adherence. Non-adherence in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors is common and associated with critical outcomes. However, this review highlights important existing gaps, reveals inconsistent definitions, and a lack of standardized methods for measuring adherence in chronic myeloid leukemia.

More sensitive PCR methods are required to assess whether these patients have a long-term continuing decline in residual disease.;We used random pentadecamer (R15) primers for reverse transcription in RQ-PCR and compared the results with our established method that uses random hexamers. An increase in assay sensitivity would be detected as an increase in the number of BCR-ABL transcripts.;BCR-ABL transcripts increased by 86% with R15 primers. We used R15 primers to retest 19 samples from selected CML patients who had no BCR-ABL transcripts recently detectable with hexamer primers and detected BCR-ABL transcripts in 68% of the samples. Use of R15 primers showed variable increases in the transcripts for control genes BCR (breakpoint cluster region), ABL1 (c-abl oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase), and GUSB (glucuronidase, beta), depending on the gene examined. The reported BCR-ABL/control gene ratio was affected, and the estimated detection limit of the assay, which was based on increased control gene copy number, was different for each control gene.;This simple modification to the reverse transcription methodology improved the detection limit of the RQ-PCR assay for BCR-ABL transcripts.

However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have been developed to override imatinib resistance mechanisms such as overexpression of Bcr-Abl and point mutations within the Abl kinase domain, are currently competing. Inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP non-competitive inhibitors. Moreover, ATP-competitive inhibitors are fall into two subclasses, i.e. the Src/Abl inhibitors, and 2-phenylaminopyrimidin-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606 and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors while AMN107 and NS-187 (INNO-406) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Among these agents, clinical studies on dasatinib and AMN107 had started earlier than the others and favorable results are accumulating. Clinical studies of other compounds including NS-187 (INNO-406) will be performed in rapid succession. Because of its strong affinity, most ATP competitive inhibitors may be effective against imatinib-resistant patients. However, to date, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. To address this problem, ATP non-competitive inhibitors such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796 have been developed. It may be necessary for the improvement of CML and Ph(+)ALL treatment to be taken into consideration of the combination therapy with novel ATP-competitive inhibitors and these agents.",

The mechanism by which BCR-ABL blocks apoptosis remains unclear, although recent data are beginning to shed light on the signaling pathway. As with other antiapoptotic signals, BCR-ABL induces cellular resistance to a wide spectrum of cytotoxic antitumor agents. However, apoptosis induced by both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer or lymphokine-activated killer cells is not blocked by BCR-ABL. A substantial number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia can now be cured, and the prognosis has improved even for those patients who are not cured. Interferon-alpha has emerged as the treatment of choice for patients who do not undergo an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The availability of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been increased by the ability to find unrelated donors, although graft-versus-host disease remains a major problem.

Of 13 ALL cases tested, 1/10 with p190 and 1/3 with p210 precisely recapitulated the forward BCR-ABL breakpoint and 1/10 with p190 precisely recapitulated the reciprocal breakpoint.

Antisense strategies aiming to suppress the expression of BCR/ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia cells have been studied by several research groups over the last decade. In the present study, the effect of  Morpholino Oligo Antisense in BCR/ABL oncogene silencing was evaluated. To examine the hypothesis, K562 was used as a BCR/ABL fusion gene positive cell line using a Jurkat cell line as a control. The capacity of Morpholino Oligo Antisense in inhibiting the translation of p210(bcr-abl)  protein by a western blotting technique, inhibition of cell proliferation, and stimulation of apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis after 24 and 48 hours was studied. Prolonged exposure of K562 cell line to Morpholino Oligo Antisense targeted against BCR-ABL showed proliferation inhibition  as the main feature. Following western blotting, we found that complete silencing of BCR-ABL had been achieved but flow cytometric analysis showed no significant apoptosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) is most often due to point mutations in the Bcr-Abl fusion gene. T315I mutation (resulting in substitution of Ile for a Thr residue at the \"gatekeeper\" position 315) raises particular concern, because it also provides resistance to second-generation kinase inhibitors already approved for clinical use (nilotinib and dasatinib). Much effort is therefore focused on alternative molecular-based strategies. Previous studies proved that binding to 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins leads to cytoplasmic compartmentalization and suppression of proapoptotic and antiproliferative signals associated with Bcr-Abl protein kinase, hence contributing to leukemic clone expansion. Here we investigated the effect of 14-3-3 inhibition disruption on hematopoietic cells expressing the IM-sensitive wild type Bcr-Abl and the IM-resistant T315I mutation. Using a virtual screening protocol and docking simulations, we identified a nonpeptidic inhibitor of 14-3-3, named BV02, that exhibits a remarkable cytotoxicity against both cell types. c-Abl release from 14-3-3σ, promoting its relocation to nuclear compartment (where it triggers transcription of p73-dependent proapoptotic genes) and to mitochondrial membranes (where it induces the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential) combined with c-Abl enhanced association with caspase 9 (a critical step of sequential caspase activation further contributing to c-Abl pro-apoptotic function) has a prominent role in the effect of BV02 on Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. In conclusion, BV02 may be considered as a treatment option for CML and, in particular, for more advanced phases of the disease that developed IM resistance as a consequence of Bcr-Abl point mutations.",

ARG is a widely expressed tyrosine kinase that shares substantial sequence identity with c-ABL in the kinase domain and cooperates with ABL to regulate neurulation in the developing mouse embryo. As described here, ARG has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia as a fusion partner of TEL. A TEL/ARG fusion was constructed to determine whether ARG can be inhibited by STI571. When expressed in the factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3, the TEL/ARG protein was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, and induced factor-independent proliferation. The effects of STI571 on Ba/F3 cells transformed with BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, or TEL/ARG were then compared. STI571 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, and TEL/ARG with an IC(50) of approximately 0.5 microM in each case, but it had no effect on untransformed Ba/F3 cells growing in IL-3 or on Ba/F3 cells transformed by TEL/JAK2. Culture of TEL/ARG-transfected Ba/F3 cells with IL-3 completely prevented STI571-induced apoptosis in these cells, similar to what has been observed with BCR/ABL- or TEL/ABL-transformed cells.

Two different FISH probes (Vysis Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA) were used: the LSI BCR/ABL dual color extra signal (ES) and the dual color dual fusion BCR/ABL probe (D-FISH). Our results show that most BCR/ABL+ patients (83%, including 88% of all CML, 61% of ALL and one of two AML) displayed typical iFISH patterns of either Major (M) BCR/ABL (87% of CML, 13% of ALL and one of the two AML) or minor (m) BCR/ABL gene rearrangements (1% of all CML and 48% of ALL cases) with the two probes. Further molecular and cytogenetic studies confirmed the presence of such typical rearrangements in all except one of these ALL cases who had coexistence of an MBCR/ABL and an mBCR/ABL gene rearrangement together with monosomy 9. In the remaining 29 cases (17%), up to five different atypical iFISH patterns were detected with the ES probe. Atypical iFISH patterns were most frequently due to additional numerical changes--most often supernumerary Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (7%) but also gain or loss of chromosome 9 (1%) or 22 (1%). Deletion of 9q sequences proximal to the breakpoint were also frequently observed with the ES probe (8%). Application of the D-FISH probe showed that in most of these latter cases (5%) deletion of 22q sequences distal to the breakpoint also occurred. The remaining cases with atypical iFISH had cryptic insertion of BCR in 9q34 (1%). Exact interpretation of each iFISH pattern was supported by FISH on metaphases and molecular determination of the BCR breakpoint. In summary, our results indicate that despite the high incidence of typical iFISH patterns of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements, atypical patterns are also found in BCR/ABL+ acute leukemias; the precise definition of the alteration present in individual cases is dependent on metaphase studies and molecular definition of the breakpoint.",

Here, we aimed to define the molecular basis for the increased drug resistance and searched for novel strategies to circumvent it. The situation in CLL LN could be mimicked by prolonged in vitro CD40 stimulation, which resulted in up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 proteins, and afforded resistance to various classes of drugs (fludarabine, bortezomib, roscovitine). CD40 stimulation also caused ERK-dependent reduction of Bim-EL protein, but ERK inhibition did not prevent drug resistance. Drugs combined with sublethal doses of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 displayed partial and variable effects per individual CD40-stimulated CLL. The antiapoptotic profile of CD40-triggered CLL resembled BCR-Abl-dependent changes seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which prompted application of c-Abl inhibitors imatinib or dasatinib. Both compounds, but especially dasatinib, prevented the entire antiapoptotic CD40 program in CLL cells, and restored drug sensitivity. These effects also occurred in CLL samples with dysfunctional p53. Importantly, ex vivo CLL LN samples also displayed strong ERK activation together with high Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 but low Bim levels.

CRKL, an adaptor protein consisting of SH2 and SH3 domains in the absence of a catalytic domain, is one potential in vivo substrate of BCR/ABL. Previous experiments have shown that CRKL is phosphorylated on tyrosine in the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and that CRKL is a substrate for ABL and for BCR/ABL in COS-1 cells. In the current study, we show that in peripheral blood cells a direct correlation exists between the presence of BCR/ABL and the phosphorylation status of CRKL. In Ph- peripheral blood cells, CRKL is present only in the nonphosphorylated form. In contrast, all BCR/ABL+ CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples examined showed clear tyrosine-phosphorylation of CRKL.

We report the discovery of three new BCR/ABL mutations, L248R, T315V, and F317R identified in two patients with CML (L248R and T315V) and in one patient with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (F317R). Mutations were screened against second-generation (bosutinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib), as well as third-generation TKIs (ponatinib/AP-24534 and DCC-2036). Furthermore, the activity profile of ponatinib and DCC-2036 against a panel of 24 clinically relevant BCR/ABL mutants is presented and compared to the other TKIs. The IC50 values for each TKI against the mutants and the IC50 increase over wild type BCR/ABL (relative resistance, RR) were calculated to define four resistance levels: sensitive (RR ≤ 2), moderately resistant (2 < RR ≤ 4), resistant (4 < RR ≤ 10), or highly resistant (RR > 10). L248R and T315V showed high resistance to imatinib, bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, intermediate resistance to ponatinib, but were sensitive to DCC-2036. Interestingly, F317R showed a moderate resistance to imatinib and nilotinib, but is resistant/highly resistant to dasatinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, and DCC-2036.

CML, a myeloproliferative disorder, progresses through three phases--chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis. Current therapies include drug regimens such as interferon alpha, hydroxyurea, busulfan or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the only curative treatment for CML, which is, however, limited to younger patients with a suitable donor. INHIBITION OF BCR-ABL AS EFFECTIVE AND SELECTIVE TREATMENT IN CML: In vitro studies and studies in animal models have shown, that Bcr-Abl is the molecular cause CML. Therefore inhibition of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is expected to be an effective and selective treatment modality for CML. STI571 was shown to be a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and c-kit tyrosine kinases. It shows effects on proliferation and survival of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells without affecting normal cells or Ph-negative leukemic cells. DRUG RESISTANCE TO STI571: Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified from in vitro studies with Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines. Mechanisms include amplification or overexpression of Bcr-Abl or an increased expression of P-gly-coprotein. In a mouse model the binding of STI571 to acidic alpha 1 glycoprotein (AAG) has been proposed to be involved in the development of STI571 resistance. Recent studies with clinical samples from resistant patients have shown that point mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl play a role in the development of resistance to STI571.;STI571 is a promising example of a moleculary targeted therapy directed towards the molecular cause of CML. To maximize the therapeutic value and to avoid the induction of resistance, a combination of the drug with other chemotherapies should be considered. According to its pharmacological profile, STI571 could also be useful in the treatment of tumors with deregulated PDGF receptor or c-kit signaling, e.g., in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with a t(5;12) chromosomal translocation or in cases with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

        "Doc_abstract":"The advent of imatinib has been a major breakthrough in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment. A few patients treated with imatinib are either refractory to imatinib or eventually relapse. Resistance is frequently associated with mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Over 100 point mutations coding for single amino acid substitutions in the BCR-ABL kinase domain have been isolated from CML patients resistant to imatinib treatment. Most reported mutants are rare, whereas 7 mutated residues comprise two-thirds of all mutations detected. BCR-ABL mutations affect amino acids involved in imatinib binding or in regulatory regions of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, resulting in decreased sensitivity to imatinib while retaining aberrant kinase activity. The early detection of BCR-ABL mutants during therapy may aid in risk stratification as well as molecularly based treatment decisions.",

Flow cytometry (FCM) and Annexin-V-Fluos/PI staining kit were used to evaluate the apoptosis of leukemic cells; FCM and cytoperm/cytofix plus Caspase-3-McAb-PE were employed to measure the leukemic cells with activated Caspase-3. Phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein in the leukemic cells were assessed by a combination of immunoprecipitation (IP) with c-abl antibody and Western blotting with p-Tyr (pY99) antibody. The protein levels of p210 bcr/abl, Hsp90 and Hsp70 in the leukemic cells were determined by Western blotting with antibodies to c-abl, Hsp90, and Hsp70 respectively.;After treatment with berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 48 h, the percentages of leukemic cells expressing activated caspase-3 and apoptotic cells were 45.69% and 48.43% respectively. IP and WB results showed that berbamine at low concentration markedly inhibited phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein in the leukemia cells, and the amount of phosphorylated p210 bcr/abl in the leukemia cells exposed to berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 6 h were only 8.41% of that of untreated leukemia cells without the protein levels of p210 bcr/abl down-regulated. Significantly, berbamine also down-regulated chaperone Hsp90 protein, and the amount of Hsp90 protein in the leukemia cells treated with berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 48 h accounted for 18.37% of that of the untreated leukemia cells. Berbamine at 8 microg/ml had no obvious effect on chaperone Hsp70 protein expression associated with the resistance of leukemia cells to apoptosis.;(1) Berbamine induces caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of Ph+ leukemia cells through inhibiting phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein and down-regulating its chaperone Hsp90 protein. (2) Unlike Hsp90 inhibitor GA that upregulates Hsp70, berbamine has no obvious effect on chaperone Hsp70 protein expression in leukemia cells, suggesting that berbamine may be a novel class of Hsp90 inhibitor, and further study is required.",

In this article, we demonstrate that emodin inhibited the growth of K562 cells harboring BCR-ABL in vitro and in vivo, and induced abundant apoptosis, which was correlated with the inhibition of PETN/PI3K/Akt level and deletion of BCR-ABL. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising agent to kill K562 cells harboring BCR-ABL.",

Over-expression of Aurora kinases, particularly Aurora A, has been demonstrated in a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Not surprisingly, these serine/threonine kinases have become attractive small molecule targets for cancer therapeutics, with several inhibitors currently in early-phase clinical trials. A small number of compounds developed to date are highly selective for either Aurora A or Aurora B, while the majority inhibit both Aurora A and Aurora B; many of these compounds exhibit 'off-target' inhibition of kinases such as ABL, JAK2 and FLT3. It is currently unclear whether the therapeutic activity of these compounds in leukemia is primarily due to selective Aurora or multi-kinase inhibition. The most promising application for Aurora kinase inhibitors to date appears to be in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia/Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly when caused by the T315I mutation.

Although ABL kinase inhibitors have shown great promise in the treatment of CML, the persistence of residual disease and the occurrence of resistance have prompted investigations into the molecular effectors of BCR-ABL. Here, we show that BCR-ABL stimulates the proteasome-dependent degradation of members of the forkhead family of tumor suppressors in vitro, in an in vivo animal model, and in samples from patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML or ALL. As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway, we also show that inhibition of this pathway, using bortezomib, causes regression of CML-like disease. Bortezomib treatment led to inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced suppression of FoxO proteins and their proapoptotic targets, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and BIM, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular effects of proteasome inhibitor therapy. We additionally show sensitivity of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL T315I cells to bortezomib.

Stability, cellular uptake of oligonucleotides and effect on cell growth were studied in two CML cell lines, BV173 and LAMA-84.

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, C3G, binds constitutively to Crkl. Here, we report that Crkl mediates the formation of protein complexes that include C3G and Bcr/Abl. These complexes contain highly elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated C3G and P130Cas, a scaffolding protein. Moreover, the presence of Rap1 further promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and Cas. Co-expression of Crkl and C3G with Bcr/Abl generated increased levels of activated Rap1. In addition, lysates from leukemic cells of P190 BCR/ABL transgenic mice and of the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 contained tyrosine-phosphorylated C3G and activated Rap1.

Using deFuse and TopHat‑fusion programs with improved filtering methods, we identified two reliable gene fusions in a blood sample obtained from the CML patient, including extremely low expression levels of the classic BCR‑ABL1 gene fusion. In addition, a novel gene fusion involving the ring finger protein 213 (RNF213)-solute carrier family 26, member 11 (SLC26A11) was identified and validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that specific domains of SLC26A11 were damaged, which may affect the function of sulfate transportation of the normal gene.

Based on the pharmacophore modeling approaches, it is possible to decipher the molecular determinants to inhibit BCR-ABL. We conducted a structure based and ligand based study to identify potent natural compounds as BCR-ABL inhibitor. First kinase inhibitors were docked with the receptor (BCR-ABL) and nilotinib was selected as a pharmacophore due its high binding efficiency. Eleven compounds were selected out of 1457 substances which have mutual pharmacopohre features with nilotinib. These eleven compounds were validated and used for docking study to find the drug like molecules.

The aim of this article was to investigate the possibility of combating the resistance to apoptosis caused by Bcr-Abl by inducing an alternative cell death process. As a model of chronic myeloid leukemia, we employed Bcr-Abl-transfected mouse progenitor 32D cells with low and high Bcr-Abl expression levels corresponding to drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, respectively. The drug curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a known potent inducer of cell death in many cancer cells, was investigated for efficacy with Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Curcumin strongly inhibited cell proliferation and affected cell viability by inducing apoptotic symptoms in all tested cells; however, apoptosis was a relatively late event. G(2)-M cell cycle arrest, together with increased mitotic index and cellular and nuclear morphology resembling those described for mitotic catastrophe, was observed and preceded caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Mitosis-arrested cells displayed abnormal chromatin organization, multipolar chromosome segregation, aberrant cytokinesis, and multinucleated cells-morphologic changes typical of mitotic catastrophe. We found that the mitotic cell death symptoms correlated with attenuated expression of survivin, a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, and mislocalization of Aurora B, the partner of survivin in the chromosomal passenger complex. Inhibition of survivin expression with small interfering RNA exhibited similar mitotic disturbances, thus implicating survivin as a major, albeit not the only, target for curcumin action. This study shows that curcumin can overcome the broad resistance to cell death caused by expression of Bcr-Abl and suggests that curcumin may be a promising agent for new combination regimens for drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.",

The hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which is a shortened chromosome 22 (22q-) resulting from a reciprocal translocation involving chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, designed t (9;22) (q34;q11). This translocation juxtaposes parts of two genes; ABL on chromosome 9 and BCR (breakpoint cluster region) on chromosome 22. Transcription of the BCR/ABL fusion gene results in an hybrid mRNA that is translated into a 210 kDa or 190 kDa protein, depending on the location of the breakpoint in the bcr region. This protein plays a key role in CML: its tyrosine-kinase activity, that differs from the normal ABL product, may be involved in leukemic cell growth. Nonetheless, the loss of the negative cell growth regulation by c-ABL, or BCR/ABL fusion protein interaction with other cellular genes (such as RAS or c-MYC) could also be involved in CML pathophysiology. A better understanding of the molecular mecanisms of CML could lead to specific treatment, such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, or site-specific DNA-binding proteins designed against BCR/ABL oncogenic fusion sequence.",

The c-Abl F-actin-binding domain contains a consensus motif found in several other actin-crosslinking proteins. Mutations in the consensus motif are shown to abolish binding to F-actin. Bcr-Abl proteins unable to associate with F-actin have a reduced ability to transform Rat-1 fibroblasts and to abrogate the requirement for interleukin-3 in the lymphoblastoid cell line Ba/F3.

To examine whether the leukemia is still Bcr-Abl-dependent in patients who have responded to imatinib mesylate but have relapsed, a quantitative assay that directly measures enzymatic activity of Bcr-Abl toward one of its major signaling substrates has been developed. This assay allows monitoring both of the imatinib mesylate sensitivity of patient cells in vitro, and of the endogenous inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity during imatinib mesylate treatment and relapse. Studies show that imatinib mesylate resistance is associated with restored activation of the Bcr-Abl signal transduction pathway in the majority of cases, indicating that Bcr-Abl remains a valid target for therapeutic intervention.

Taken together, these findings indicate that in addition to overexpression or mutations in Bcr-Abl, resistance to Gleevec may also develop due to a loss of Bcr-Abl expression. These findings also support the rationale to test the in vivo efficacy of 17-AAG and PD180970 against STI-571-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive acute leukemias.",

Interestingly, the two p210 samples were somewhat less sensitive to imatinib than the p190 samples. Daunorubicin, prednisolone and cytarabine showed the largest benefit from combination with imatinib compared to the most active single agent.

In previous studies, we found significant telomere shortening in Ph+ cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Interestingly, imatinib treatment was found to lead to a normalization of previously shortened telomere length in CML patients. Based on recent reports demonstrating that c-ABL phosphorylates hTERT and thereby inhibits hTERT activity, a direct effect of imatinib on hTERT activity leading to telomere elongation in BCR-ABL-positive cells has been proposed by others. Such an effect could be of potential importance for telomere maintenance in Ph+ cells by facilitating clonal selection and progression of the disease to blast crisis.;We investigated the impact of imatinib on telomere length and telomerase activity of the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cell line BaF3 and the BCR-ABL-positive, IL-3-independent transfectant BaF3p185 in vitro.;When BaF3 and BaF3p185 cells were treated with imatinib (the latter being rescued with IL-3), no effect on either telomerase activity or telomere length was observed. These findings can be explained by the cytoplasmatic localization of BCR-ABL found in BaF3p185 as compared to the nuclear localization of telomerase (and c-ABL).;As opposed to recent reports for c-ABL, we do not see evidence for a functional interaction between BCR-ABL and hTERT in this model system arguing against imatinib-mediated upregulation of hTERT as a crucial factor for clonal selection and disease progression of CML.",

Cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) is a newly designed transduction peptide that carries molecules across the cell membrane with a preference to localize in the cytoplasmic compartment and is, therefore, applicable for cytoplasmic targeting. The Bcr-Abl fusion protein, playing major causative role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is a cytoplasmic oncoprotein that contains an N-terminus oligomerization domain (OD) mediating homodimerization of Bcr-Abl proteins, and an intact OD in Bcr-Abl is required both for the activation of its transforming activity and tyrosine kinase. Therefore, disrupting Bcr-Abl oligomerization represents a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting Bcr-Abl oncogenicity. In this study, we explored the possible homodimerization-disrupting and tyrosine kinase inhibiting effect of the transduction of OD in Bcr-Abl positive K562 cells. By expressing in Escherichia coli a CTP-OD-HA fusion protein followed by Ni+-NTA affinity purification, immunoblot identification and enterokinase cleavage, we showed that the CTP-OD-HA protein was structurally and functionally active in that it potently transduced and primarily localized into the cytoplasmic compartment, heterodimerized with Bcr-Abl, and potently inhibited the phospho-tyrosine pathways of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein at a low concentration of 4 microM. These results delineate strategies for the expression and purification of therapeutic molecules for intracytoplasmic protein based therapeutics and the CTP-OD-HA-mediated killing strategy could be explored as a promising anti-leukemia agent or an adjuvant to the conventional therapeutic modalities in chronic myeloid leukemia, such as in vitro purging.",

Although various mechanisms to explain leukemia cell persistence have been proposed, the critical question from a therapeutic standpoint--whether disease persistence is BCR-ABL dependent or independent--has not been answered. Here, we report that human CML stem cells do not depend on BCR-ABL activity for survival and are thus not eliminated by imatinib therapy. Imatinib inhibited BCR-ABL activity to the same degree in all stem (CD34+CD38-, CD133+) and progenitor (CD34+CD38+) cells and in quiescent and cycling progenitors from newly diagnosed CML patients. Although short-term in vitro imatinib treatment reduced the expansion of CML stem/progenitors, cytokine support permitted growth and survival in the absence of BCR-ABL activity that was comparable to that of normal stem/progenitor counterparts.

Using this strategy, we identified BCR-ABL-expressing LSCs in all patients. Interestingly, long-term culture-initiating cell assays with MS-5/HOXB4 stromal feeders increased detected numbers of LSCs in 3 patients. The relation between LSC persistency and a potential risk of disease relapse for patients with durable UMRD (on or off tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy) warrants further investigation.",

A third type of BCR/ABL (with e1a2 type of junction) has been identified in approximately 50% of the Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) cases and results in the production of a BCR/ABL protein of 190 kD (P190). The presence of this transcript has been associated almost exclusively with the presence of an acute leukemia phenotype. By contrast, here we describe that in addition to transcripts with the b2a2 and b3a2 types of junction corresponding to the P210 proteins, virtually all CMLs at diagnosis bear also BCR/ABL transcripts showing the e1a2 type of junction, which correspond to the acute leukemia-associated P190 protein. With a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay we found that the amount of the e1a2 mRNA present in CMLs in chronic phase, although in absolute amount much lower than that present in Ph+ ALLs, represents in most cases approximately 20% to 30% of the total BCR/ABL transcripts.

Most commonly these deletion mutants lack a significant portion of the kinase domain that includes the P-loop. We describe a screen for such mutations in patients with CML and demonstrate that they are not oncogenic and are catalytically inactive. We hypothesized that coexpressing BCR-ABL deletion mutants has a dominant-negative effect on the native form through heterocomplex formation. However, upon coexpression of native and deletion mutant BCR-ABL in Ba/F3 cells, growth factor independence is maintained and signaling is activated normally. Despite this, these cells have increased imatinib sensitivity compared to cells expressing only native BCR-ABL.

Studies of the disease pathology revealed that the molecular consequence of the Philadelphia translocation is a BCR-ABL chimeric gene, which encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase with wholesale range of biological activities. Animal models have validated the direct role of the BCR-ABL protein in malignant transformation and subsequent research confirmed that its enhanced tyrosine kinase activity is essential and sufficient for the leukemogenesis. The very existence of a single genetic abnormality, presented in essentially all patients with the disease, made it an effective target for molecularly designed therapeutic approaches for the disease.

Constitutive expression of BCR-ABL leads to the unregulated production of mature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and their subsequent release into the blood. Untreated, CML will progress from a chronic to accelerated phase over a number of years before quickly proceeding to a terminal blast crisis phase, reminiscent of acute leukemia. The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to much improved management of the disease, but these drugs do not provide a cure as they are unable to eradicate the most primitive, quiescent fraction of CML stem cells.

Here, we report on a novel kinase inhibitor PHA-680626 exhibiting strong inhibitory activity on both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinases. Significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were observed in human BCR-ABL positive cell lines and murine BaF3 cells ectopically expressing wt BCR-ABL or the Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants M351T, E255K and, T315I. Treatment with PHA-680626 decreased phosphorylation of CrkL and histone H3. As CrkL represents a typical downstream target of Bcr-Abl while histone H3 phosphorylation is an indicator for Aurora kinase B activity, these findings indicate that effects of PHA-680626 are mediated via inhibition of both pathways. Moreover, high anti-proliferative activity of PHA-680626 was observed in primary CD34+ cells derived from CML patients at diagnosis or in blast crisis as well as from an individual harbouring the T315I mutation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Together, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) make up approximately one-third of all pediatric cancer diagnoses. Despite remarkable improvement in the treatment outcomes of these diseases over the past several decades, the prognosis for certain high-risk groups of leukemia and for relapsed disease remains poor. However, recent insights into different types of 'driver' lesions of leukemogenesis, such as the aberrant activation of signaling pathways and various epigenetic modifications, have led to the discovery of novel agents that specifically target the mechanism of transformation. In parallel, emerging approaches in cancer immunotherapy have led to newer therapies that can exploit and harness cytotoxic immunity directed against malignant cells. This review details the rationale and implementation of recent and specifically targeted therapies in acute pediatric leukemia. Topics covered include the inhibition of critical cell signaling pathways [BCR-ABL, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Janus-associated kinase (JAK)], proteasome inhibition, inhibition of epigenetic regulators of gene expression [DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and disruptor of telomeric signaling-1 (DOT1L) inhibitors], monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugated toxins, bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE) antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells.

Various intracellular signaling intermediates become activated and/or associate by/with Bcr-Abl, including the Src family kinase Hck. To elucidate some of the structural requirements and functional consequences of the association of Bcr-Abl with Hck, their interaction was investigated in transiently transfected COS7 cells. Neither the complex formation of Hck kinase with Bcr-Abl nor the activation of Hck by Bcr-Abl was dependent on the Abl kinase activity. Both inactivating point mutations of Hck and dephosphorylation of Hck enhanced its complex formation with Bcr-Abl, indicating that their physical interaction was negatively regulated by Hck (auto)phosphorylation. Finally, experiments with a series of kinase negative Bcr-Abl mutants showed that Hck phosphorylated Bcr-Abl and induced the binding of Grb2 to Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl. Taken together, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl preferentially binds inactive forms of Hck by an Abl kinase-independent mechanism. This physical interaction stimulates the Hck tyrosine kinase, which may then phosphorylate the Grb2-binding site in Bcr-Abl.",

Here, we report that the novel triterpenoid methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-diene-28-oate (CDDO-Me) potently induced cytotoxicity in imatinib-resistant KBM5 cells expressing the T315I mutation of bcr-abl (24-h EC50, 540 nmol/L). In long-term culture, CDDO-Me abrogated the growth of human parental KBM5 and KBM5-STI cells with 96-h IC50 of 205 and 221 nmol/L, respectively. In addition, CDDO-Me rapidly decreased the viability of murine lymphoid Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type p210 as well as the imatinib-resistant E255K and T315I mutations of bcr-abl. The low-dose effects of CDDO-Me are associated with inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, whereas the cytotoxic effects appear to be mediated by a rapid and selective depletion of mitochondrial glutathione that accompanies the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, the mitochondriotoxic effects of CDDO-Me are followed by the rapid autophagocytosis of intracellular organelles or the externalization of phosphatidylserine in different cell types. We conclude that alterations in mitochondrial function by CDDO-Me can result in autophagy or apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia cells regardless of the mutational status of bcr-abl. CDDO-Me is in clinical trials and shows signs of clinical activity, with minimal side effects and complete lack of cardiotoxicity. Studies in leukemias are in preparation.",

Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was detected by PCR. The results showed that all of the B-ALL patients were positive for CD19.

The alternative, downstream ABL promoter (Pa), which is usually retained in this chimeric oncogene, was reported to be methylated in many CML patients, but there has been controversy as to whether this methylation is a frequent change in bone marrow (BM) in early chronic phase (CP) or only past this stage. Also, the relevance of Pa promoter methylation to BCR-ABL expression in CML is unclear. We examined methylation of the ABL Pa promoter in uncultured BM samples and in colonies derived from their hematopoietic precursor cells by bisulfite and PCR-based assays (combined bisulfite restriction analysis and methylation-specific PCR). BM from seven CP CML patients at diagnosis had about 20-60% of the copies of the ABL Pa promoter methylated. No Pa methylation was detected in normal BMs or colonies derived from them. In contrast, most colonies from CP CML patients had Pa methylation. Surprisingly, 18-49% of the CML-derived colonies with this methylation reproducibly had no detectable BCR-ABL RNA on nested reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, the percentage of BCR-ABL RNA-positive colonies was almost same among the colonies not displaying Pa methylation as among the colonies in which this methylation was found. We conclude that ABL Pa methylation is often an early marker of CML in hematopoietic precursors and in total mononuclear BM cells but that it is not associated with an increased frequency of BCR-ABL RNA-positive cells. This methylation might be emblematic of cancer-associated hypermethylation elsewhere in the genome with the consequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes seen in many malignancies.",

Identification of the BCR-ABL kinase fusion protein and its central role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop rational molecular targeted therapies. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and imatinib mesylate resistance, leading to the development of new targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors for managing CML. Imatinib, a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, represents a major success in the era of target-directed cancer chemotherapy. However, patients with advanced CML have been less sensitive to therapy and responses have been short. In addition, treatment resistance is an emerging problem at all disease stages. Insight into factors involved in imatinib resistance and disease progression has highlighted a role for such BCR-ABL-dependent factors as amplification and overexpression of the BCR-ABL gene and the emergence of mutant isoforms of BCR-ABL. However, BCR-ABL-independent factors, including leukemogenic pathways involving kinases other than BCR-ABL, also play a part. In light of the limitations of imatinib against these factors, newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including dasatinib (a multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and Src family kinases) and nilotinib (AMN107, a selective BCR-ABL inhibitor), may provide promising treatment options for patients with CML.",

To accomplish this, we generated dendritic cells (DC) in vitro and electroporated them with various sources of RNA harboring the chimeric bcr-abl transcript. These genetically engineered DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells for the induction of CTLs. By applying this approach, we found that the CTLs induced by DCs transfected with RNA extracted from bcr-abl-positive K-562 cells or CML blasts lysed DCs transfected with the corresponding RNA, but failed to recognize epitopes derived from the chimeric BCR-ABL fusion protein in (51)Cr-release assays. In contrast, they were able to lyse autologous DCs electroporated with RNA isolated from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, indicating that antigens shared among these malignant cells are involved and recognized by these CTLs. In patients with CML in complete cytogenetic remission during IFN-alpha treatment, we detected some reactivity of CD8(+) T cells against BCR-ABL in IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays, which was weaker as compared with proteinase 3 (PR3)- or prame-directed responses, suggesting that the BCR-ABL protein is less immunogenic as compared with other CML-derived antigens.",

BCR/ABL renders hematopoietic cells independent from exogenous growth-stimulatory signals by continuously engaging signaling pathways including JAK-STAT signaling and the MAPK pathway.

To determine whether BCR-ABL kinases are inefficient in transforming T lymphocytes, BCR-ABL-expressing retroviruses were injected intrathymically into mice. Thymomas that expressed BCR-ABL kinase developed after a relatively long latent period. In most thymomas, deletion of 3' proviral sequences resulted in loss of tk-neo and occasionally caused expression of kinase-active carboxy-terminally truncated BCR-ABL oncoprotein. In contrast, deletion of 3' proviral sequences was not observed in thymomas induced with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). BCR-ABL viruses induced distinct patterns of disease and involved different thymocyte subsets than A-MuLV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). While Mo-MuLV only induced Thy-1+ thymomas, v-abl- and BCR-ABL-induced thymomas often contained mixed populations of B220+ and Thy-1+ lymphocytes in the same tumor. In most v-abl and BCR-ABL tumors, Thy-1+ lymphoid cells expressed CD8 and a continuum of CD4 ranging from negative to positive. Conversely, Mo-MuLV thymomas contained distinct populations of CD4+ cells that were either CD8+ or CD8-. A-MuLV-transformed T-lymphoid cells did not express the CD3/T-cell receptor complex, while BCR-ABL tumors were CD3+. Thus, BCR-ABL viruses preferentially induce somewhat more differentiated T lymphocytes than are transformed by A-MuLV. Furthermore, rare B220+ lymphocytes may represent preferred v-abl and BCR-ABL transformation targets in the thymus.",

In the RNA of one patient without a detectable bcr rearrangement, only the normal c-abl mRNA transcripts are present.

The amounts of Bcr-Abl mRNA and protein in cells from patients in blast crisis (BC) are higher than in those chronic phase (CP), indicating that their expression rises with disease progression. In order to study this phenomenon on cells with the same genetic background, we transfected the 32D cell line with the BCR-ABL transgene and selected clones with graded expression of Bcr-Abl within the range found in cells from CP to BC. In vitro, we found that Bcr-Abl exerted dose-dependent effects upon growth factor dependence, clonogenicity and migration. However, the relationship between Bcr-Abl expression and cellular adhesion to fibronectin was more complex: rather than a direct positive correlation, clones that expressed low, but not high, levels of Bcr-Abl were less adhesive than growth factor stimulated, parental BCR-ABL-negative 32D cells. This finding parallels the situation with normal and CML-CP progenitors where the latter exhibit defective adhesion to fibronectin. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate reversed the adhesion deficient phenotype of clones expressing low levels of Bcr-Abl. When injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice, cell lines expressing high levels of Bcr-Abl rapidly induced tumors, whereas low-expressing clones led to tumor formation only after a prolonged latency. These findings suggest that the level of Bcr-Abl may be essential in determining the phenotype of the leukemic clone at different stages of the disease.",

Recently, the LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) was identified as a component of a six gene signature that is strongly predictive for disease progression and relapse in CML patients. However, the underlying mechanisms why LASP1 expression correlates with dismal outcome remained unresolved. Here, we identified LASP1 as a novel and overexpressed direct substrate of BCR-ABL in CML. We demonstrate that LASP1 is specifically phosphorylated by BCR-ABL at tyrosine-171 in CML patients, which is abolished by tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Further studies revealed that LASP1 phosphorylation results in an association with CRKL - another specific BCR-ABL substrate and bona fide biomarker for BCR-ABL activity. pLASP1-Y171 binds to non-phosphorylated CRKL at its SH2 domain. Accordingly, the BCR-ABL-mediated pathophysiological hyper-phosphorylation of LASP1 in CML disrupts normal regulation of CRKL and LASP1, which likely has implications on downstream BCR-ABL signaling. Collectively, our results suggest that LASP1 phosphorylation might serve as an additional candidate biomarker for assessment of BCR-ABL activity and provide a first step toward a molecular understanding of LASP1 function in CML.",

A limiting log(10)-dilution RT-PCR was used to semiquantify BCR-ABL-positive cells. All autografts appeared to be significantly contaminated with residual leukemic cells. The BCR-ABL-specific titers ranged from 1:10(3) to 1:10(6) (median 1:10(4)) above the limit of detection. This was the rationale to purge the grafts using two cycles of IgM anti-CD10, CD19, and AB4 MoAbs-coated immunomagnetic beads (IMB).

To inhibit the expression of the bcr-abl gene, and to try to eradicate Philadelphia-positive cells, different methods can be used: 1) the introduction into the cells of antisense oligonucleotides, 2) the use of specific ribozymes, or 3) the transduction, using retroviral vectors, of stably integrated sequences coding for antisense RNA.

Bcr-Abl/T315I is the predominant mutation that causes resistance to Imatinib. In the present study, we synthesized a novel Bcr-Abl inhibitor, HS-543, and investigated its effect on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing Bcr-Abl/T315I (BaF3/T315I) or wild-type Bcr-Abl (BaF3/WT). HS-543 showed anti-proliferative effects in the BaF3/WT cells as well as the BaF3/T315I cells with resistance to Imatinib and strongly inhibited the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it significantly increased the sub G1 phase associated with early apoptosis, with increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3, as well as the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. In addition, we found that HS-543 induced apoptosis with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by decreasing the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin, together with increasing that of Bax. In BaF3/T315I xenograft models, HS-543 significantly delayed tumor growth, unlike Imatinib. Our results demonstrate that HS-543 exhibits the induction of apoptosis and anti-proliferative effect by blocking the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in the T315I-mutated Bcr-Abl cells with resistance to Imatinib.

IM resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, in many instances, there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance mechanisms, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen and identified IM-sensitizing genes (IMSGs) whose knockdown renders BCR-ABL(+) cells IM-resistant. In these IMSG knockdown cells, RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is sustained after IM treatment because of up-regulation of PRKCH, which encodes the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCη, an activator of CRAF. PRKCH is also up-regulated in samples from CML patients with BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MEK inhibitor, synergistically kills BCR-ABL(+) IMSG knockdown cells and prolongs survival in mouse models of BCR-ABL-independent IM-resistant CML. Finally, we showed that CML stem cells contain high levels of PRKCH, and this contributes to their intrinsic IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib synergistically kills CML stem cells with negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our results identify a therapeutically targetable mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance in CML and CML stem cells. ",

Among the 19 proteins found to be differentially expressed, we detected the down-regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), a protein essential for cell proliferation. eIF5A represents the only known eukaryotic protein activated by posttranslational hypusination. Hypusination inhibitors (HIs) alone exerted an antiproliferative effect on BCR-ABL-positive and -negative leukemia cell lines in vitro. However, the synergistic dose-response relationship found for the combination of imatinib and HI was restricted to Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Furthermore, this synergistic effect was confirmed by cytotoxicity assays, cell-cycle analysis, and CFSE labeling of primary CD34+ CML cells. Specificity of this effect could be demonstrated by cotreatment of K562 cells with imatinib and siRNA against eIF5.

To overcome this particular resistance, several different strategies have been explored and many molecules have been investigated as capable of potently inhibiting Bcr-Abl T315I. Herein, this review reports on some predominant examples of third generation inhibitors of Bcr-Abl active against the T315I mutation, and special attentions are paid to the \"hybrid-design\" strategy for creating type-II class ATP-competitive inhibitors.",

The first case was a 27 years old man with CML. Molecular studies (RT-PCR) revealed the rearrangement in the major-BCR region and expression of chimeric BCR/ABL mRNA of b3a2 configuration. By classical cytogenetic studies (G-banding) karyotype 46,XY was found in short-term cultivated bone marrow cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. FISH studies revealed the BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and green BCR signals on both chromosomes 22 in all mitoses studied. Detection of the alleles of ABL1 intragenic STR locus by fluorescence PCR followed by fragmentation analysis in the patient and his parents provided no information about transmission of the ABL gene. Quantitative assessment of BCR/ABL transcript level by RT-PCR showed 60 and 70% BCR/ABL positivity in two peripheral blood samples at 6,5 and 10,5 months after diagnosis, respectively, which does not correspond to the expression from two identical BCR/ABL hybrid genes. Therefore, the possible mechanism of the origin of two BCR/ABL fusion signals present on both chromosomes 9 could not be resolved and remains speculative. The second case was a 53 years old male with diagnosis of chronic phase of CML, with first sign of acceleration one month after diagnosis and death because of sepsis in blastic phase within four months. The cytogenetic findings were identical to those in case No. 1., i.e. karyotype 46, XY by G-banding, two BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and RT-PCR molecular studies proved b3a2 breakpoints. It is generally accepted that prognosis of the patients with fused BCR/ABL gene located on chromosome 9 is poor. The presence of two fused genes could be anticipated as two Ph chromosomes in accelerated and blastic phases of the disease. However, in our study, quantitative findings of BCR/ABL transcripts did not corresponded to the expression of two BCR/ABL genes originating from duplication. If this assumption is correct then the expression of both fused genes BCR/ABL was in case No. 1 equally suppressed and total expression reached about the level of one BCR/ABL gene.",

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of expressing BCR-ABL on the myeloid differentiation of murine M1 leukemic cells, which cease dividing and differentiate into macrophages in the presence of the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or interleukin (IL)-6. We found that BCR-ABL induced macrophage differentiation in M1 cells, accompanied by increased expression of macrophage cell surface markers and the acquisition of phagocytic ability. interestingly, clones of M1 cells which expressed BCR-ABL remained in cell cycle and were refractory to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by IL-6 or LIF in parental M1 cells. These cells also expressed inappropriately high levels of c-MYC mRNA for their degree of differentiation, which may have been important in maintaining cellular proliferation.

Although beta-catenin can be tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylated, the occurrence and biological relevance of this covalent modification in Bcr-Abl-associated leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that Bcr-Abl levels control the degree of beta-catenin protein stabilization by affecting its Y/S/T-phospho content in CML cells. Bcr-Abl physically interacts with beta-catenin, and its oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is required to phosphorylate beta-catenin at Y86 and Y654 residues. This Y-phospho beta-catenin binds to the TCF4 transcription factor, thus representing a transcriptionally active pool. Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl antagonist, impairs the beta-catenin/TCF-related transcription causing a rapid cytosolic retention of Y-unphosphorylated beta-catenin, which presents an increased binding affinity for the Axin/GSK3beta complex. Although Bcr-Abl does not affect GSK3beta autophosphorylation, it prevents, through its effect on beta-catenin Y phosphorylation, Axin/GSK3beta binding to beta-catenin and its subsequent S/T phosphorylation. Silencing of beta-catenin by small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells, in synergism with Imatinib. These findings indicate the Bcr-Abl triggered Y phosphorylation of beta-catenin as a new mechanism responsible for its protein stabilization and nuclear signalling activation in CML.",

Cancer cells efficiently use limited energy sources, and drugs targeting cellular metabolism improve the efficacy of therapy. In this study, we characterized the effects of novel anti-cancer fatty-acid derivative AIC-47 and imatinib, focusing on cancer-specific energy metabolism in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. AIC-47 and imatinib in combination exhibited a significant synergic cytotoxicity. Imatinib inhibited only the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL; whereas AIC-47 suppressed the expression of the protein itself. Both AIC-47 and imatinib modulated the expression of pyruvate kinase M (PKM) isoforms from PKM2 to PKM1 through the down-regulation of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1). PTBP1 functions as alternative splicing repressor of PKM1, resulting in expression of PKM2, which is an inactive form of pyruvate kinase for the last step of glycolysis. Although inactivation of BCR-ABL by imatinib strongly suppressed glycolysis, compensatory fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) activation supported glucose-independent cell survival by up-regulating CPT1C, the rate-limiting FAO enzyme. In contrast, AIC-47 inhibited the expression of CPT1C and directly fatty-acid metabolism. These findings were also observed in the CD34(+) fraction of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. These results suggest that AIC-47 in combination with imatinib strengthened the attack on cancer energy metabolism, in terms of both glycolysis and compensatory activation of FAO. ",

Prior work has identified the adapter protein CRKL as a major substrate of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. CRKL can also bind via its first SH3 domain [SH3(1)] to specific sequences in Bcr-Abl. Cell-penetrating peptides were developed that bind with high affinity and selectivity to the SH3(1) domain of CRKL. They disrupt Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes and strongly reduce the proliferation of primary CML blast cells and cell lines established from Bcr-Abl-positive patients. Activation-specific antibodies against phosphorylated MAP kinase (MAPK) showed that MAPK activity is down-regulated in blast cells treated with the CRKLSH3(1) blocker peptides. We conclude that the Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes are largely dependent on the CRKLSH3(1) domain, that the central mitogenic cascade is down-regulated as a consequence of the disruption of CRKLSH3(1) interactions, and that CRKL therefore contributes to the proliferation of CML blast cells.",

No alteration in the organization of v-abl-homologous sequences was detected in the genomic DNA of the Ph'-positive CML patient. Karyotypic analysis of the Burkitt-type B-lymphoblastic leukemia patient revealed the presence of an 8,14 translocation together with a number of other chromosomal aberrations.

Hence, the observed increase in c-abl transcription is not consistently associated with either gross gene rearrangement or presence of the Ph'.

Studies of patients with acquired imatinib resistance revealed that Bcr-Abl signaling is reactivated at the time of resistance, predominantly because of mutations that interfere with drug binding in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl. The knowledge that Bcr-Abl remains the optimal target for treating imatinib-refractory CML has driven an already highly successful search for alternative approaches to restore target inhibition. Here, we review the current state of affairs in the realm of controlling drug resistance in CML, including cutting-edge strategies to reign in Bcr-AblT315I, which is cross resistant to imatinib, as well as the \"next generation\" Bcr-Abl inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib.

BCR-ABL is a functional oncoprotein p210 that exhibits constitutively activated tyrosine kinase causing genomic alteration of hematopoietic stem cells. BCR-ABL specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) successfully block CML progression. However, drug resistance owing to BCR-ABL mutations and overexpression is still an issue. Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) function as molecular chaperones facilitating proper folding of nascent polypeptides. Their increased expression under stressful conditions protects cells by stabilizing unfolded or misfolded peptides. Hsp90 is the major mammalian protein and is required by BCR-ABL for stabilization and maturation. Hsp90 inhibitors destabilize the binding of BCR-ABL protein thus leading to the formation of heteroprotein complex that is eventually degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Results of many novel Hsp90 inhibitors that have entered into various clinical trials are encouraging.

Here we report a novel BCR (breakpoint cluster region)-ABL (c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase)/GATA1/microRNA-138 (miR-138) circuitry in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). miR-138 expression is downregulated in K562 cells and primary CML samples, which is restored after imatinib treatment. The tumor suppressor activity of miR-138 is demonstrated by the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, inhibition of cell proliferation and colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage colony formation and enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in K562 and Ku812 cells overexpressing miR-138. Moreover, overexpression of miR-138 led to the downregulation of BCR-ABL. Based on luciferase assay, ABL and BCR-ABL are shown to be the target genes regulated by miR-138. Furthermore, miR-138 binding to ABL was shown to localize to the coding region instead of 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of ABL mRNA. In addition, CCND3 is another target of miR-138, which represses CCND3 expression by binding to its 3'-UTR. Finally, upregulation of miR-138 upon imatinib treatment is associated with the enhancement of GATA1 activity, which binds to the miR-138 promoter. In conclusion, miR-138 is a tumor suppressor miRNA underexpressed in CML. miR-138 represses expression of both BCR-ABL and CCND3 via binding to the coding region and 3'-UTR, respectively. miR-138 expression is activated by GATA1, which in turn is repressed by BCR-ABL. Therefore, miR-138, by virtue of a BCR-ABL/GATA1/miR-138 circuitry, is a tumor suppressor miRNA implicated in the pathogenesis of CML and its clinical response to imatinib. ",

The GFI1B gene was mapped to chromosome 9 and is, therefore, located downstream of the BCR-ABL translocation in CML cells. Co-transfection of BCR-ABL siRNA and GFI1B siRNA dramatically decreased cell viability and significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in K562 cells (P<0.0001) and primary advanced phase CML cells (P<0.0001) versus controls. Furthermore, combining of BCR-ABL siRNA and GFI1B siRNA significantly modified the expression of several relevant genes including Myc, MDR1, MRP1 and tyrosyl-phosphoproteins in primary CML cells.

The molecular abnormality in the former group is similar to that found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. To characterize the abnormality in the breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged form, we have mapped a 9;22 translocation from the Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SUP-B13 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and have cloned the DNA at the translocation junctions. We demonstrate a BCR-ABL fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. The breakpoint on chromosome 9 is within ABL between exons Ia and II, and the breakpoint on chromosome 22 is approximately equal to 50 kilobases upstream of a breakpoint cluster region in an intron of the BCR gene. This upstream BCR breakpoint leads to inclusion of fewer BCR sequences in the fusion gene, compared with the BCR-ABL fusion gene of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Consequently, the associated mRNA and protein are smaller. The exons from ABL are the same. Analysis of leukemic cells from four other patients with breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a rearrangement on chromosome 22 close to the breakpoint in SUP-B13 in only one patient. These data indicate that breakpoints do not cluster tightly in this region but are scattered, possibly in a large intron. Given the large size of BCR and the heterogeneity in breakpoint location, detection of BCR rearrangement by standard Southern blot analysis is difficult. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis should allow detection at the DNA level in every patient and thus will permit clinical correlation of the breakpoint location with prognosis.",

Here, we explored the functionality of NK cells in CML patients and in a transgenic inducible BCR-ABL mouse model. Compared with controls, NK-cell proportions among lymphocytes were decreased at diagnosis of CML and did not recover during imatinib-induced remission for 10-34 months. Functional experiments revealed limited in vitro expansion of NK cells from CML patients and a reduced degranulation response to K562 target cells both at diagnosis and during imatinib therapy. Consistent with the results in human CML, relative numbers of NK1.1+ NK cells were reduced following induction of BCR-ABL expression in mice, and the defects persisted after BCR-ABL reversion. Moreover, target-induced degranulation by expanded BCR-ABL+ NK cells was compromised. We conclude that CML is associated with quantitative and functional defects within the NK-cell compartment, which is reproduced by induced BCR-ABL expression in mice.

Protein kinase CK2 is known to phosphorylate PTEN thereby driving PTEN protein stabilization and concomitant PTEN functional inactivation. In agreement, we found that adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples show significantly higher CK2 kinase activity and lower PTEN lipid phosphatase activity than healthy controls. Moreover, the clinical-grade CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 (Silmitasertib) reversed PTEN levels in leukemia cells to those observed in healthy controls, and promoted leukemia cell death without significantly affecting normal bone marrow cells.

Current thinking holds that BCR-ABL forms a multi-protein complex that incorporates several substrates and adaptor proteins and is stabilized by multiple direct and indirect interactions. Signaling output from this highly redundant network leads to cellular transformation. Proteins known to be associated with BCR-ABL in this complex include: GRB2, c-CBL, p62(DOK), and CRKL. These proteins in turn, link BCR-ABL to various signaling pathways indicated in cellular transformation. In this study we show that a triple mutant of BCR-ABL with mutations of the direct binding sites for GRB2, CBL, p62(DOK) and CRKL, is defective for transformation of primary hematopoietic cells in vitro and in a murine CML model, while it retains the capacity to induce IL-3 independence in 32D cells. Compared to BCR-ABL, the triple mutant's ability to activate the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways is severely compromised, while STAT5 phosphorylation is maintained, suggesting that the former are crucial for the transformation of primary cells, but dispensable for transformation of factor dependent cell lines. Our data suggest that inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia by disrupting protein interactions could be possible, but would require blocking of multiple sites.",

In the current study, we have compared the transforming activity of p190 BCR/ABL, p210 BCR/ABL and a mutant that lacks GEF activity (p210 BCR/ABL(S509A)). In cell-based, ex vivo, and murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays the transforming activity of p210 BCR/ABL(S509A) mimics p190 BCR/ABL, and is distinct from p210 BCR/ABL. Thus, in the BMT assay, the p190 BCR/ABL- and p210 BCR/ABL(S509A)-transplanted mice exhibit a more rapid onset of disease than mice transplanted with p210 BCR/ABL. The reduced disease latency is associated with erythroid hyperplasia in the absence of anemia, and expansion of the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP), common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) populations, producing a phenotype that is similar to acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M6). The disease phenotype is readily transplantable into secondary recipients. This is consistent with ex vivo clonogenicity assays, where p210 BCR/ABL preferentially supports the growth of colony forming unit (CFU)-granulocyte-macrophage (GM), whereas p190 BCR/ABL and the mutant preferentially support the growth of burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E).

Previously, we showed an abundance of inactive GSK-3 in the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line. CML is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by an oncogenic Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. In Bcr-Abl signaling, the role of GSK-3 is not well defined. Here, we report that enforced expression of constitutively active GSK-3 reduced proliferation and increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced apoptosis by nearly 1-fold. Bcr-Abl inhibition activated GSK-3 and GSK-3-dependent apoptosis. Inactivation of GSK-3 by Bcr-Abl activity is, therefore, confirmed. To reactivate GSK-3, we used glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor PDMP to accumulate endogenous ceramide, a tumor-suppressor sphingolipid and a potent GSK-3 activator. We found that either PDMP or silence of GCS increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced GSK-3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, PDMP sensitized the most clinical problematic drug-resistant CML T315I mutant to Bcr-Abl inhibitor GNF-2-, imatinib-, or nilotinib-induced apoptosis by >5-fold. Combining PDMP and GNF-2 eliminated transplanted-CML-T315I-mutants in vivo and dose dependently sensitized primary cells from CML T315I patients to GNF-2-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. The synergistic efficacy was Bcr-Abl restricted and correlated to increased intracellular ceramide levels and acted through GSK-3-mediated apoptosis. This study suggests a feasible novel anti-CML strategy by accumulating endogenous ceramide to reactivate GSK-3 and abrogate drug resistance.",

The present study examined whether cell lineage and BCR-ABL expression influenced OCT-1 activity.;The OCT-1 activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression was assessed in pure populations of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes recovered from chronic myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis, in cytogenetic remission and normal individuals. The role of BCR-ABL on OCT-1 activity and differentiation was examined in a cell line model of ectopic BCR-ABL expression.;The OCT-1 activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression was highest in the neutrophil population and lowest in lymphocytes (P<0.05). This was observed for patients at diagnosis, in cytogenetic remission and normal individuals. Interestingly, neutrophil OCT-1 activity was not significantly different between patients at diagnosis, in remission and normal donors. This was also observed for monocytes and lymphocytes. Furthermore, OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells was significantly correlated with the OCT-1 activity in neutrophils (P=0.001). In a cell line model in which BCR-ABL was ectopically expressed, we found no evidence that BCR-ABL directly affected OCT-1 expression and function.

Imatinib has revolutionized the management of patients with CML, and at a dose of 400 mg daily has become the current standard therapy for newly diagnosed patients with CML even when they have HLA-matched family donors. Although imatinib therapy has only a 5-year history, it is hoped that CML will be cured with this drug and with forthcoming second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as by allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients who have become resistant to these drugs.",

We identified down-regulation of a novel gene, CCN3, as a direct consequence of BCR-ABL kinase activity. CCN3 has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor gene in solid tumors. Northern and Western blotting plus immunocytochemical analysis confirmed CCN3 expression is decreased and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in BCR-ABL kinase active FDCP-Mix cells. Decreased cellular CCN3 correlated with increased CCN3 secretion in BCR-ABL kinase active cells. In vitro treatment of human CML cell lines with imatinib or siRNA directed against BCR-ABL significantly reduced BCR-ABL while increasing CCN3 expression. Cells from patients responding to imatinib showed a similar decrease in BCR-ABL and increase in CCN3. CML CD34+ cells treated with imatinib in vitro demonstrated increased CCN3 protein. Transfecting CCN3 into BCR-ABL+ cells inhibited proliferation and decreased clonogenic potential. CCN3 plays an important role in internal and external cell-signaling pathways.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib block the BCR-ABL protein and prevent activation of the transformation pathways. Molecular monitoring, the most sensitive approach currently available to assess treatment response, measures BCR-ABL messenger RNA levels and serves as a surrogate marker of disease. Further, molecular responses are predictive of patient outcomes. It is important for advanced practitioners to become familiar with the technology and interpretation of molecular monitoring results as well as efforts to standardize this type of testing so they can educate their patients and aid their understanding of test results. Undetectable BCR-ABL levels can bring feelings of relief, whereas an increasing level can lead to anxiety.

In vivo studies combining HDACIs and KW2449 were carried out by using a systemic IM-resistant ALL xenograft model.;Coadministration of HDACIs synergistically increased KW-2449 lethality in vitro in multiple CML and Ph(+) ALL cell types including human IM resistant cells (e.g., BV-173/E255K and Adult/T315I). Combined treatment resulted in inactivation of Bcr/Abl and downstream targets (e.g., STAT5 and CRKL), as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage (γH2A.X). The latter events and cell death were significantly attenuated by free radical scavengers (TBAP). Increased lethality was also observed in primary CD34(+) cells from patients with CML, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Finally, minimally active vorinostat or SNDX275 doses markedly increased KW2449 antitumor effects and significantly prolonged the survival of murine xenografts bearing IM-resistant ALL cells (BV173/E255K).;HDACIs increase KW-2449 lethality in Bcr/Abl(+) cells in association with inhibition of Bcr/Abl, generation of ROS, and induction of DNA damage. This strategy preferentially targets primary Bcr/Abl(+) hematopoietic cells and exhibits enhanced in vivo activity. Combining KW-2449 with HDACIs warrants attention in IM-resistant Bcr/Abl(+) leukemias.",

Conventional cytogenetics revealed a t(9;22)(q34;q11) in six of them, but was either unsuccessful, or not done in the other two. Seven of the eight positive cases (88%) showed a breakpoint at the minor breakpoint cluster region (m-BCR), which was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To conclude, the frequency of BCR/ABL translocation in Chinese patients with de novo ALL is comparable to patients in the Western hemisphere, in contrast to a previous report. The predominance of m-BCR/ABL fusion among these Chinese patients with BCR/ABL translocation is also similar to patients in the Western population.

In mouse and human cells, two sets of N-terminal amino acids encoded by 5'-variable exons are found in c-abl proteins. To assess the importance of N-terminal deletion in the activation of c-abl tyrosine kinase, a full length or an N-terminal deleted c-abl protein was expressed in bacteria and in monkey COS cells. Measurements of the autokinase activity of these two c-abl proteins showed that deletion of the N-terminal amino acids led to a three to five fold increase of the c-abl tyrosine kinase activity.

Nilotinib is a selective Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor related to imatinib, which is widely used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. Because Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia only responds transiently to imatinib therapy, we have used mouse models to test the efficacy of nilotinib against lymphoblastic leukemia caused by the P190 form of Bcr/Abl.;After transplant of 10,000 highly malignant leukemic cells into compatible recipients, untreated mice succumbed to leukemia within 21 days, whereas mice treated with 75 mg/kg nilotinib survived significantly longer. We examined cells from mice that developed leukemia while under treatment for Bcr/Abl kinase domain point mutations but these were not detected. In addition, culture of such cells ex vivo showed that they were as sensitive as the parental cell line to nilotinib but that the presence of stromal support allowed resistant cells to grow out. Nilotinib also exhibited impressive anti-leukemia activity in P190 Bcr/Abl transgenic mice that had developed overt leukemia/lymphoma masses and that otherwise would have been expected to die within 7 days. Visible lymphoma masses disappeared within six days of treatment and leukemic cell numbers in peripheral blood were significantly reduced. Treated mice survived more than 30 days.;These results show that nilotinib has very impressive anti-leukemia activity but that lymphoblastic leukemia cells can become unresponsive to it both in vitro and in vivo through mechanisms that appear to be Bcr/Abl independent.",

An inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase, imatinib mesylate, is rapidly becoming the first-line therapy for CML. However, the development of resistance to this drug is a frequent setback, particularly in patients in advanced phases of the disease. Several mechanisms of resistance have been described, the most frequent of which are amplification and/or mutations of the BCR-ABL gene. To overcome resistance, several approaches have been studied in vitro and in vivo. They include dose escalation of imatinib, combination of imatinib with chemotherapeutic drugs, alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitors, inhibitors of kinases downstream of Bcr-Abl, farnesyl and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase, proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, arsenic trioxide, hypomethylating agents, troxacitabine, targeting Bcr-Abl messenger RNA, and immunomodulatory strategies. It is important to understand that these approaches differ in efficiency, which is often dependent on the mechanisms of resistance.

Here, we show that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis at much lower concentrations in Ton.B210 cells when driven by inducibly expressed BCR/ABL than when driven by interleukin-3. The increased sensitivity to sorafenib was also observed in cells inducibly expressing BCR/ABL with the imatinib-resistant E255K or T315I mutation. Sorafenib-induced apoptosis in these cells and Ph+ leukemic cells was synergistically enhanced by rottlerin, bortezomib, or ABT-737 and inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-d-fmk or the overexpression of Bcl-XL. It was further revealed that sorafenib activates Bax and caspase-3 and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential specifically in BCR/ABL-driven cells. Sorafenib also inhibited BCR/ABL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its cellular substrates and its autophosphorylation in Ton.B210. It was finally shown that sorafenib inhibits the kinase activity of BCR/ABL as well as its E255K and T315I mutants in in vitro kinase assays. These results indicate that sorafenib induces apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing cells, at least partly, by inhibiting BCR/ABL to activate the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, sorafenib may provide an effective therapeutic measure to treat Ph+ leukemias, particularly those expressing the T315I mutant, which is totally resistant to imatinib and the second generation BCR/ABL inhibitors.",

However, its role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a malignant counterpart of normal progenitor B cells, is not fully understood. Here we show that SOX4 is highly expressed in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To systematically study the function of Sox4 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we established a genetically defined mouse leukemia model by transforming progenitor B cells carrying a floxed Sox4 allele and inducing deletion of the allele by the self-excising Cre recombinase. This model allowed us to work with two groups of leukemic cells that had either one copy or both copies of Sox4 deleted. We found that depletion of Sox4 in transformed cells in vitro reduced cell growth in vitro and the progression of leukemia in vivo. Moreover, depletion of Sox4 in leukemic cells in vivo prolonged the survival of the mice, suggesting that it could be a potential target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Our microarray and bioChIP studies revealed that Tcf7l1 was the key gene directly regulated by Sox4. Knockdown of Tcf7l1 reduced cell proliferation, just as did knockout of Sox4, and ectopic expression of Tcf7l1 could reverse the effect of Sox4 knockout on cell proliferation. These data suggest that Sox4 and Tcf7l1 form a functional axis that promotes the progression of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ",

Accordingly, there is now molecular justification for grouping PV, ET, and MF together in a distinct MPD category (i.e., classic, BCR-ABL(-) MPD) that is separate from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), MDS, and atypical MPD. To date, JAK2V617F has not been described in patients with reactive myeloproliferation, lymphoid disorders, or solid tumor. Therefore, the presence of JAK2V617F strongly suggests an underlying MPD and it is therefore reasonable to consider JAK2V617F-based laboratory tests for the evaluation of polycythemia, primary thrombocytosis, unexplained leukocytosis, bone marrow fibrosis, or abdominal vein thrombosis. Current information on disease-specific prognostic relevance of JAK2V617F is inconclusive and confounded by inter-study differences in the performance of mutation screening assays.

CML is a multistep disease, which evolves as a chronic phase and progresses to blast crisis. This progression has been associated with the appearance and accumulation of new cytogenetic anomalies and mutations. The mechanisms underlying the genomic instability promoted by BCR-ABL remain obscure. Through comparative analysis of different DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms as a function of the BCR-ABL status in human megakaryocytic and CML cell lines, we found that BCR-ABL upregulates error-prone DSB repair pathways [single-strand annealing (SSA) and non-homologous end joining] rather than the high-fidelity mechanism of homologous recombination. Intriguingly, expression analysis of DSB repair pathway choice determining factors revealed increased levels of the protein CtIP in BCR-ABL-positive cells, particularly in response to irradiation. Moreover, treatment with the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, Imatinib Mesylate, abolished CtIP accumulation. When we silenced CtIP expression in cells with functional BCR-ABL, SSA enhancement by BCR-ABL was completely abrogated. Importantly, we also provide evidence that BCR-ABL stimulates DSB end resection, which is mediated by CtIP. Briefly, BCR-ABL promotes mutagenic DSB repair with the DSB end-processing protein CtIP acting as the key mediator downstream of BCR-ABL.",

Stem cell transplantation, an accepted curative option for which extensive experience has been gained, is limited by high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in older patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL are widely used and induce remission in a high proportion of patients, but resistance and incomplete response to these agents portends eventual relapse and disease progression. Although BCR-ABL inhibitors eradicate most CML cells, they are largely ineffective against the reservoir of quiescent leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Thus a strong medical need exists for therapies that effectively eradicate LSCs and is currently a focus of extensive research. To date, evidence obtained from in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical CML specimens suggests that an effective approach may be to partner existing BCR-ABL inhibitors with compounds targeting key stem cell molecular effectors, including Wnt/β-catenin, hedgehog pathway components, histone deacetylase (HDAC), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Janus kinase 2, promyelocytic leukemia protein, and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5).

Nuclear localization and proper nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling are crucial for PTEN's tumor suppressive function. In this study, we show that BCR-ABL enhances HAUSP-induced de-ubiquitination of PTEN in turn favoring its nuclear exclusion. We further demonstrate that BCR-ABL physically interacts with and phosphorylates HAUSP on tyrosine residues to trigger its activity. Importantly, we also find that PTEN delocalization induced by BCR-ABL does not occur in the leukemic stem cell compartment due to high levels of PML, a potent inhibitor of HAUSP activity toward PTEN. We therefore identify a new proto-oncogenic mechanism whereby BCR-ABL antagonizes the nuclear function of the PTEN tumor suppressor, with important therapeutic implications for the eradication of CML minimal residual disease.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we applied a systems-level approach comprising phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and chemical proteomics. Data integration revealed that both compounds targeted Mapk pathways downstream of BCR-ABL, resulting in impaired activity of c-Myc. Using pharmacological validation, we assessed that the relative contributions of danusertib and bosutinib could be mimicked individually by Mapk inhibitors and collectively by downregulation of c-Myc through Brd4 inhibition.

A cohort of 72 patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis (BC) (n = 34), lymphoid BC (n = 2), accelerated phase (AP) (n = 16), CP (n = 18), and BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 2) resistant to imatinib were investigated. Median levels of BCR-ABL transcripts, determined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were not significantly changed at the time of resistance, but seven of 55 patients showed a greater than 10-fold increase in BCR-ABL levels. Genomic amplification of BCR-ABL was found in two of 32 patients evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additional chromosomal aberrations were observed in 19 of 36 patients and point mutations of the ABL tyrosine kinase domain resulting in reactivation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase were detected in 29 of 72 patients. Resistance may be caused by BCR-ABL-independent or BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms. A thorough evaluation of resistant cases is required to suggest therapeutic measures in the individual case.

Small molecule inhibitors, such as imatinib, are effective for P210(bcr/abl) gene mediated CML, but drug resistance may occur. The unique fusion junction of P210(bcr/abl) gene is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention using RNA interference (RNAi). This study was purposed to constructed the BaF3 cell line by viral vector which can stably express P210(bcr/abl) shRNA and P210(bcr/abl) mRNA at the same time, and investigate the effect of lentiviral-victor-delivered shRNA on P210(bcr/abl) gene expression. The infective rate of lentiviral vector on BaF3 cells with P210(bcr/abl) gene was assayed by fluorescent microscopy; the cell proliferation ability was determined by trypan blue exclusion; the P210(bcr/abl) mRNA and protein expressions were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. The results found that stable expression of the P210(bcr/abl) shRNA resulted in obvious inhibition of P210(bcr/abl) mRNA and protein expression and increased sensitivity of these P210(bcr/abl) gene transformed Ba/F3 cells to imatinib. The IC(50) to imatinib in these cells decreased < 50% as compared with Ba/F3-P210(bcr/abl) cells which did not express P210(bcr/abl) mRNA. The survival time of the lethal dose irradiated mice induced by intravenous injection of these Ba/F3 cells was longer than the other group induced by Ba/F3-P210(bcr/abl). It is concluded that stable expression of shRNA targeting the P210(bcr/abl) gene fusion junction may potentiate the effects of conventional therapy for CML.",

There is agreement that TKIs do not kill CML stem cells; however, it is controversial whether this is because of a lack of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition in CML stem cells or because CML stem cells do not require BCR-ABL for survival. In this issue of the JCI, Corbin and colleagues provide definitive evidence that BCR-ABL is kinase active in CML stem cells and that TKIs inhibit this kinase activity without affecting CML stem cell survival. Rather, CML stem cells revert to a normal dependence on cytokines for survival and proliferation.

The resulting network revealed a high degree of interconnection of 7 \"core\" components around Bcr-Abl (Grb2, Shc1, Crk-I, c-Cbl, p85, Sts-1, and SHIP-2), and their links to different signaling pathways. Quantitative proteomics analysis showed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors lead to a disruption of this network.

While novel therapies such as treatment with interferon-alpha or bone marrow transplantation have successively improved the outcome of CML treatment, hope for future progress in the therapy of CML lies in an almost unique feature of this hematological malignancy. In contrast to many other forms or subforms of leukemias which display a great diversity in chromosomal alterations, most cases (>95%) of CML seem to be caused by an almost invariably found cytogenetic aberration, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), resulting in the bcr-abl fusion gene. Its gene product, p210bcr-abl (Bcr-Abl), is believed to be essential for hematopoietic cell transformation and seems to exert its effects by interfering with cellular signal transduction pathways, normally involved in the control of cell death and proliferation. Several partially interacting pathways have been shown to be induced by Bcr-Abl. The role of most of them is still unclear and, as understanding their biological functions should lead to novel therapeutic strategies on a molecular basis, much effort is spent on identifying their precise roles in CML.

Dramatic results from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) clinical trials spurred the development of TKIs for other malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia as well as kidney and lung cancer. In CML, imatinib resistance led to the rapid development of dasatinib and nilotinib, more potent second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors that can often overcome imatinib resistance. While the clinical efficacy of TKIs in CML is well established, a number of important questions remain about the optimal dose and duration of therapy. Even the best initial dose for imatinib is still under investigation. Although laboratory and clinical studies had led to the prevailing view that continual inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase was required for optimal efficacy, recent data on dasatinib have upended this notion and have led to a change in the recommended dosing schedule. The availability of dasatinib and nilotinib also begs the question of whether they might be superior to imatinib as first-line agents. Finally, the question of whether it may be possible to stop TKI therapy at least in some patients with CML has attracted considerable attention.

The BCR-ABL(T315I) mutant is highly resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, and is frequently detected in relapsed patients. This critical gap in resistance coverage drove development of DCC-2036, an ABL inhibitor that binds the switch control pocket involved in conformational regulation of the kinase domain. We evaluated the efficacy of DCC-2036 against BCR-ABL(T315I) and other mutants in cellular and biochemical assays and conducted cell-based mutagenesis screens. DCC-2036 inhibited autophosphorylation of ABL and ABL(T315I) enzymes, and this activity was consistent with selective efficacy against Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (IC(50): 19 nmol/L), BCR-ABL(T315I) (IC(50): 63 nmol/L), and most kinase domain mutants. Ex vivo exposure of CML cells from patients harboring BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL(T315I) to DCC-2036 revealed marked inhibition of colony formation and reduced phosphorylation of the direct BCR-ABL target CrkL. Cell-based mutagenesis screens identified a resistance profile for DCC-2036 centered around select P-loop mutations (G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255K/V), although a concentration of 750 nmol/L DCC-2036 suppressed the emergence of all resistant clones. A decreased concentration of DCC-2036 (160 nmol/L) in dual combination with either nilotinib or dasatinib achieved the same zero outgrowth result. Further screens for resistance due to BCR-ABL compound mutations (two mutations in the same clone) identified BCR-ABL(E255V / T315I) as the most resistant mutant. Taken together, these findings support continued evaluation of DCC-2036 as an important new agent for treatment-refractory CML.",

The expansion of mutant BCR-ABL-positive clones under selective pressure of tyrosine kinase inhibition is referred to as clonal selection; there are few data on the reversibility of this phenomenon.;The changes of expression of mutant BCR-ABL-positive alleles after cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment were examined in 19 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia harboring different mutations in a longitudinal follow-up. The proportion of mutant alleles was quantified by amplification of rearranged ABL sequences followed by mutation-specific restriction digestion, electrophoresis and densitometry. The size of mutant clones was established as a measure of the absolute amount of mutant cells considering the proportion of mutant BCR-ABL transcripts and the total level of BCR-ABL obtained by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.;The median proportion of mutant transcripts was 97% before and 8% after cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment indicating a relative decline of 88% within a median of 6 months. The relative decrease in the size of the mutant clones was 86%. Repeated selection and deselection of the mutant clone after resumption and second cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was observed in individual patients.;Deselection of mutant BCR-ABL-positive clones after cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment might be a common, rapid and reproducible phenomenon, although some patients harboring the T315I mutation showed no deselection. Cessation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment may lead to the regression of T315I mutant clones to a level under the limit of detection, offering the therapeutic option of resumed tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment under close surveillance of the mutation status.",

Most notable is the inhibitor imatinib, which produces remissions in all phases of CML and is the current standard of care. However, imatinib resistance occurs in a significant proportion of patients, mainly through the development of mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain that impair imatinib binding. Attempts to circumvent resistance to imatinib led to the discovery of nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis AG), a novel, potent and selective oral Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor. Preclinical and clinical investigations have demonstrated that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance. Efficacy has been observed in models of CML and other myeloproliferative disorders that are driven by Bcr-Abl and related kinases. In a phase II clinical trial in CML, major cytogenetic response rates were 52 and 33% for chronic- and accelerated-phase disease, respectively. Nilotinib has been filed for approval in the US and EU for use in Philadelphia-positive leukemias in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Nilotinib is undergoing clinical trials in patients with newly diagnosed CML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, among other indications.",

The response to MI-219 is associated with the downregulation of c-Myc and the induction of p21(WAF1). The p53 target and pro-apoptotic proteins PUMA, Noxa and Bax are induced, whereas full length Bid protein decreases with increased activity of pro-apoptotic cleaved Bid, and decrease of Mcl-1 is observed by increased caspase activity. CD95/FAS (FAS antigen) receptor is also induced by MI-219, indicating that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic responses are transcriptionally induced. In addition, p53 protein accumulates in the mitochondrial fraction of treated cells involved in transcription-independent induction of apoptosis.

PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling also plays an important role in cell metabolism. The Warburg effect is a well-recognized hallmark of cancer energy metabolism, and is regulated by the mTOR/c-Myc/hnRNP/PKM signaling cascade. To develop a new strategy for the treatment of CML, we investigated the associations among bcr-abl, the cascade related to cancer energy metabolism, and autophagy induced by a fatty-acid derivative that we had previously reported as being an autophagy inducer. Here we report that a fatty-acid derivative, AIC-47, induced transcriptional repression of the bcr-abl gene and modulated the expression profile of PKM isoforms, resulting in autophagic cell death. We show that c-Myc functioned as a transcriptional activator of bcr-abl, and regulated the hnRNP/PKM cascade. AIC-47, acting through the PPARγ/β-catenin pathway, induced down-regulation of c-Myc, leading to the disruption of the bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP signaling pathway, and switching of the expression of PKM2 to PKM1. This switching caused autophagic cell death through an increase in the ROS level. Our findings suggest that AIC-47 induced autophagic cell death through the PPARγ/β-catenin/bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP/PKM cascade. ",

We have studied the molecular dynamics simulations and calculated solvated interaction energies of native and fourteen mutant BCR-ABL kinases (M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253F, Y253H, E255K, E255V, T315A, T315I, F317L, F317V, M351T, F359V and H396P) complexed with ponatinib. These studies revealed that the interactions between ponatinib and individual residues in BCR-ABL kinase are also affected due to the remote residue mutations. We report that some residues, Met244, Lys245, Gln252, Gly254, Leu370 and Leu298 do not undergo any conformational changes, while the fluctuations in residues from P-loop, β3-, β5- strands and αC- helix are mainly responsible for ponatinib binding to native and all mutant BCR-ABL kinases.

The high affinity of dasatinib for the protein is currently assumed to result from its ability to bind both the active and inactive conformations of the BCR-ABL kinase. In the present work, using state of the art molecular simulation techniques we prove that dasatinib exhibits a highly selective preference for the active (open) BCR-ABL conformation. By using three different BCR-ABL conformations (active, inactive, and intermediate inactive) we show that, from a thermodynamic standpoint, the affinity of dasatinib for BCR-ABL drastically decreases in the order: active > alternative inactive > inactive, as a result of differential contributions from the single residues lining the kinase binding pocket and the concomitant stabilization/destabilization of the kinase hydrophobic spine. Molecule-pulling experiments also corroborate this trend as significantly lower forces and smaller times are required to extract dasatinib from its inactive BCR-ABL complexes with respect to the active complex counterparts. Importantly, our results support recent NMR solution results demonstrating no evidence of dasatinib bound to the inactive form of BCR-ABL.",

Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript level by quantitative RT-PCR is of the high prognostic value. High or increasing BCR-ABL transcript number signalizes bad response to treatment and a bad prognosis. On the contrary RT-PCR negativity, low level, or decreasing BCR-ABL transcript number denotes good response to treatment and good prognosis.

Philadelphia chromosome is an essential finding for CML diagnosis. Generally, a clinical diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET) can be established from isolated marked thrombocytosis in peripheral blood. However, Philadelphia chromosome-positivity or bcr/abl rearrangement with isolated thrombocytosis should be diagnosed as CML, not ET, according to World Health Organization diagnostic criteria. Therefore, CML should not be excluded before confirming the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome or bcr/abl rearrangement in cases of isolated thrombocytosis in peripheral blood.

Our results show that amino-terminal deletions are sufficient for oncogenic activation of c-abl and high levels of oncogenic activities were generated by a deletion of 114 codons from the 5' end that deleted the SH3 region. A deletion of 53 codons from the 5' end (inclusive of deletions seen in Hardy-Zuckerman 2 feline sarcoma virus and BCR-ABL gene products) that retains the SH3 region of c-abl resulted in the generation of low levels of transforming activity. This transforming potential was substantially increased with the introduction of a G----A point mutation in codon 832 that is present in v-abl.

We analyzed these regions for the prevalence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes by an advanced reverse immunology procedure. Seventeen novel BCR-ABL fusion peptides were identified to bind efficiently to the human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-A68, HLA-B51, HLA-B61 or HLA-Cw4 HLA class I molecules. Comprehensive enzymatic digestion analysis showed that 10 out of the 28 HLA class I binding fusion peptides were efficiently excised after their C-terminus by the proteasome, which is an essential requirement for efficient cell surface expression. Therefore, these peptides are prime vaccine candidates. The other peptides either completely lacked C-terminal liberation or were only inefficiently excised by the proteasome, rendering them inappropriate or less suitable for inclusion in a vaccine. CTL raised against the properly processed HLA-B61 epitope AEALQRPVA from the BCR-ABL e1a2 fusion region, expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), specifically recognized ALL tumor cells, proving cell surface presentation of this epitope, its applicability for immunotherapy and underlining the accuracy of our epitope identification strategy.

Inhibition of BCR-ABL with tyrosine kinase inhibitors proved to be an efficient therapy of CML in the chronic phase. Unfortunately, the impressive success of BCR-ABL inhibitors as front-line therapy in CML has been tempered by problems of disease persistence or relapse arising from different mechanisms, including mutations in the kinase domain of the enzyme BCRABL and mechanisms independent from BCR-ABL activity. Growing evidence has also suggested a pivotal role of persistent leukemic cancer stem cells, characterized by high self-renewal and pluripotency, in CML maintenance and/or relapse. The present review deals with the most recent advances in this challenging field and focuses on the development of new drugs and therapeutic approaches to eradicate the subtle and dangerous leukemic stem cells responsible for maintaining and sustaining tumor growth.",

We report the outcome of 45 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent myeloablative single unit cord blood transplantation from unrelated donors within the GETH/GITMO cooperative group. Conditioning regimens were based on combinations of thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophospamide or fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. At the time of transplantation, 35 patients (78%) were in first complete remission, four (8%) in second complete remission and six (14%) in third or subsequent response. The cumulative incidence of myeloid engraftment was 96% at a median time of 20 days and significantly better for patients receiving higher doses of CD34(+) cells. The incidence of acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease was 31%, while that of overall chronic graft-versus-host disease was 53%. Treatment-related mortality was 17% at day +100 and 31% at 5 years. The 5-year relapse, event-free survival and overall survival rates were 31%, 36% and 44%, respectively. Although the event-free and overall survival rates in patients without BCR/ABL transcripts detectable at time of transplant were better than those in whom BCR/ABL transcripts were detected (46% versus 24% and 60% versus 30%, respectively) these differences were not statistically significant in the univariate analysis (P=0.07).

In Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive leukemias such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), both of which express bcr-abl fused gene products (P210bcr-abl or P190bcr-abl protein kinase) with augmented tyrosine kinase activities, herbimycin A markedly inhibited the in vitro growth of the Ph1-positive ALL cells and the leukemic cells derived from CML blast crisis. However, the same dose of herbimycin A did not inhibit in vitro growth of a broad spectrum of Ph1-negative human leukemia cells, and several other protein kinase antagonists also displayed no preferential inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that herbimycin A has an antagonizing effect on the growth of transformed cells by a transfection of retroviral amphotrophic vector expressing P210bcr/abl into a murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent myeloid FDC-P2 cell line. This inhibition was abrogated by the addition of sulfhydryl compounds, similar to the reaction previously described for Rous sarcoma virus transformation. The inhibitory effect of herbimycin A on the growth of Ph1-positive cells was associated with decreased bcr/abl tyrosine kinase activity, but no decrease of bcr-abl mRNA and protein, suggesting that the inactivation of bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity by herbimycin A may be induced by its binding to the bcr-abl protein portion that is rich with sulfhydryl groups.

As the mitogenic and transforming activities of tyrosine kinases involve stimulation of the Ras pathway, we analyzed Bcr-Abl oncoproteins for interactions with cytoplasmic proteins that mediate Ras activation. Such polypeptides include Grb2, which comprises a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two SH3 domains, and the 66, 52 and 46 kDa Shc proteins which possess an SH2 domain in their carboxy-terminus. Grb2 associates with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins through its SH2 domain, and with the Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein mSos1 through its SH3 domains. mSos1 stimulates conversion of the inactive GDP-bound form of Ras to the active GTP-bound state. In bcr-abl-transformed cells, Grb2 and mSos1 formed a physical complex with Bcr-Abl. In vitro, the Grb2 SH2 domain bound Bcr-Abl through recognition of a tyrosine phosphorylation site within the amino-terminal bcr-encoded sequence (p.Tyr177-Val-Asn-Val), that is common to both Bcr-Abl proteins. These results suggest that autophosphorylation within the Bcr element of Bcr-Abl creates a direct physical link to Grb2-mSos1, and potentially to the Ras pathway, and thereby modifies the target specificity of the Abl tyrosine kinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Understanding the molecular basis of CML has led to the development of highly effective targeted therapies that block Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib, the current first-line therapy for CML, induces durable treatment responses in most patients. However, patients may develop imatinib resistance, which is often due to BCR-ABL mutations. With the availability of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, an effective therapeutic option other than stem cell transplantation is available following imatinib failure. Randomized trial data suggest that dasatinib treatment is superior to imatinib dose escalation in patients with imatinib resistance. Nilotinib, a recently approved analogue of imatinib, has also demonstrated encouraging treatment responses in patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Other agents (including bosutinib and INNO-406) are in clinical development. With the potential availability of multiple treatment options for patients with CML, it may be possible to tailor treatment according to individual patient or disease characteristics, for example, BCR-ABL mutations.

The detection limit of the method, assessed using serial dilutions of ALL/MIK cells, was found to be 1:10(5), similar to what is observed for the conventional RT-nested PCR method. The e1a2 BCR-ABL values were normalized with respect to those of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The decrease in the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio after remission induction chemotherapy reflects well the response to chemotherapy and consequently correlates with the prognosis. Although molecular remission was achieved by chemotherapy alone, some patients relapsed, and the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratios in these cases progressively increased to the levels seen prior to hematological relapse. Long-term hematological complete remission (more than 30 months) could be achieved in cases in which a more than 4.0 log decrease in the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio was obtained by chemotherapy alone, and BMT was then performed. In conclusion, real-time RT-PCR allows for an evaluation of the kinetics of e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH expression during the various phases of chemotherapy or after BMT and may be effective for the indication and control of disease relapse in Ph-positive ALL patients.",

Other fusion tyrosine kinases (FTK), such as TEL/ABL, TEL/JAK2, TEL/PDGFβR, and NPM/ALK also elevate WRN. BCR/ABL induces WRN mRNA and protein expression in part by c-MYC-mediated activation of transcription and Bcl-xL-dependent inhibition of caspase-dependent cleavage, respectively. WRN is in complex with BCR/ABL resulting in WRN tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of its helicase and exonuclease activities. Activated WRN protects BCR/ABL-positive cells from the lethal effect of oxidative and genotoxic stresses, which causes DSBs. In addition, WRN promotes unfaithful recombination-dependent repair mechanisms HRR and SSA, and enhances the loss of DNA bases during NHEJ in leukemia cells. In summary, we postulate that BCR/ABL-mediated stimulation of WRN modulates the efficiency and fidelity of major DSB repair mechanisms to protect leukemia cells from apoptosis and to facilitate genomic instability.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents the first human malignancy successfully treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; imatinib). However, early relapses and the emergence of imatinib-resistant disease are problematic. Evidence suggests that imatinib and other inhibitors may not effectively eradicate leukemic stem/progenitor cells, and that combination therapy directed to complimentary targets may improve treatment. Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi-1)/AHI-1 is a novel oncogene that is highly deregulated in CML stem/progenitor cells where levels of BCR-ABL transcripts are also elevated. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of Ahi-1/AHI-1 in murine and human hematopoietic cells confer growth advantages in vitro and induce leukemia in vivo, enhancing effects of BCR-ABL. Conversely, RNAi-mediated suppression of AHI-1 in BCR-ABL-transduced lin(-)CD34(+) human cord blood cells and primary CML stem/progenitor cells reduces their growth autonomy in vitro. Interestingly, coexpression of Ahi-1 in BCR-ABL-inducible cells reverses growth deficiencies exhibited by BCR-ABL down-regulation and is associated with sustained phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and enhanced activation of JAK2-STAT5. Moreover, we identified an AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction complex and found that modulation of AHI-1 expression regulates phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and JAK2-STAT5 in CML cells. Importantly, this complex mediates TKI response/resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells. These studies implicate AHI-1 as a potential therapeutic target downstream of BCR-ABL in CML.",

AMN107 is a new higher-potency inhibitor of BCR-ABL. To identify mutations in BCR-ABL that could result in resistance to AMN107, a cDNA library of BCR-ABL mutants was introduced into Ba/F3 cells followed by selection in AMN107 (0.125-0.5 microM). A total of 86 individual, drug-resistant colonies were recovered, and the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains of BCR-ABL were sequenced. A total of 46 colonies had single point mutations in BCR-ABL, with a total of 17 different mutations, all within the kinase domain. The other 40 colonies had multiple point mutations and were not analyzed further. Each of the 17 single point mutants were reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis of native BCR-ABL and found to be approximately 2.5- to 800-fold more resistant to AMN107 than native BCR-ABL. The mutations included 6 known imatinib mesylate-resistant mutations, including T315I, which showed complete resistance to AMN107.

The expression levels of miR-23a and BCR/ABL were assessed in 42 newly diagnosed CML patients, 37 CML patients in first complete remission and 25 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis and colony formation assay were used to evaluate changes induced by overexpression or inhibition of miR-23a or BCR/ABL. MiR-23a mimic or negative control mimic was transfected into a CML cell line (K562) and two lung cancer cell lines (H157 and SKMES1) using Lipofectamine 2000, and the cells were used for real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. We found that the downregulation of miR-23a expression was a frequent event in both leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells from patients with de novo CML. The microarray results showed that most of the CML patients expressed high levels of BCR/ABL and low levels of miR-23a. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the BCR/ABL levels in miR-23a-transfected cells were lower than those in the control groups. Ectopic expression of miR-23a in K562 cells led to cellular senescence. Moreover, when K562 cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, BCR/ABL expression was upregulated, which indicates epigenetic silencing of miR-23a in leukemic cells. BCR/ABL and miR-23a expressions were inversely related to CML, and BCR/ABL expression was regulated by miR-23a in leukemic cells. The epigenetic silencing of miR-23a led to derepression of BCR/ABL expression, and consequently contributes to CML development and progression. ",

This mechanism involves the consistent and selective activation of IL-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production and a stimulation of STAT5 phosphorylation in CD34(+) leukemic cells. When these cells differentiate into CD34(-) cells in vivo, IL-3 and G-CSF production declines, and the cells concomitantly lose their capacity for autonomous growth in vitro despite their continued expression of BCR-ABL. Based on previous studies of normal cells, excessive exposure of the most primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells to IL-3 and G-CSF through an autocrine mechanism could explain their paradoxically decreased self-renewal in vitro and slow accumulation in vivo, in spite of an increased cycling activity and selective expansion of later compartments.",

Mechanisms of RUNX1-ETO target gene upregulation remain less well understood. Here we show that RUNX1-ETO9a, the leukemogenic alternatively spliced transcript expressed from t(8;21), upregulates target gene Alox5, which is a gene critically required for the promotion of chronic myeloid leukemia development by BCR-ABL. Loss of Alox5 expression reduces activity of RUNX1-ETO9a, MLL-AF9 and PML-RARα in vitro. However, Alox5 is not essential for the induction of leukemia by RUNX1-ETO9a in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the upregulation of Alox5 by RUNX1-ETO9a occurs via the C₂H₂ zinc finger transcription factor KLF6, a protein required for early hematopoiesis and yolk sac development. Furthermore, KLF6 is specifically upregulated by RUNX1-ETO in human leukemia cells. This identifies KLF6 as a novel mediator of t(8;21) target gene regulation, providing a new mechanism for RUNX1-ETO transcriptional control.",

Curcumin exerted synergetic anti-leukemia effects with imatinib by inhibition of the imatinib-mediated overactivation of AKT/mTOR signaling and down-regulation of BCR/ABL gene expression. In primary samples from Ph+ ALL patients, curcumin inhibited cellular proliferation and down-regulated constitutive activation of growth-signaling pathways not only in newly diagnosed patients but also in imatinib-resistant patients.

The frequency of Δexon7 was investigated in 30 healthy controls and in 76 CML patients at different time points of the disease course by four different molecular genetic methods (direct sequencing, fragment analysis, allele-specific and quantitative PCR). The functionality and viability of the variant protein was tested by bioinformatic prediction. The Δexon7 was abundantly detected with similar frequency in healthy controls, in imatinib naive and resistant CML patients on BCR-ABL and also on the nontranslocated ABL. The detection rate of Δexon7 (varying between 17 and 100%) was highly dependent on the expression levels of BCR-ABL or ABL and the sensitivity of detection method. According to secondary structure prediction by bioinformatic methods, the exon 7 deleted mRNA is a target for nonsense-mediated decay, and the translated protein is likely to be nonfunctional and unstable.

        "Doc_abstract":"Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) was developed as the first molecularly targeted therapy that specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Due to its excellent hematologic and cytogenetic responses, particularly in patients with chronic phase CML, imatinib has moved towards first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. Nevertheless, resistance to the drug has been frequently reported and is attributed to the fact that transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by BCR-ABL is associated with genomic instability. Point mutations within the ABL tyrosine kinase of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein are the major cause of resistance, though overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein and novel acquired cytogenetic aberrations have also been reported. A variety of strategies derived from structural studies of the ABL-imatinib complex have been developed, resulting in the design of novel ABL inhibitors, including AMN107, BMS-354825, ON012380 and others. The major goal of these efforts is to create new drugs that are more potent than imatinib and/or more effective against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clones. Some of these drugs have already been successfully tested in preclinical studies where they show promising results. Additional approaches are geared towards targeting the expression or stability of the BCR-ABL kinase itself or targeting signaling pathways that are chronically activated and required for transformation. In this review, we will discuss the underlying mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and novel targeted approaches to overcome imatinib resistance in CML.",

Responses of P1 were negatively affected by individual aa replacement by alanine at eight aa positions within the 17mer peptide (F4, K5, Q6, K9, L11, Q12, R13, P14). These findings were supported by experiments with a panel of overlapping 11mer b3a2 peptides. Only two of these peptides with an aa sequence encompassing all residues which could not be replaced by alanine induced P1 proliferation.

With progression of CML disease especially in blast crisis stage, cells from CML patients become resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM) and other TKIs, resulting in relapse. Because Bcr-Abl is known to drive multiple signaling pathways, the study of the regulation of stability of Bcr-Abl in IM-resistant CML cells is a critical issue as a possible therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that a new dual-kinase chemical inhibitor, ON044580, induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl+ IM-sensitive, IM-resistant cells, including the gatekeeper Bcr-Abl mutant, T315I, and also cells from blast crisis patients. In addition, IM-resistant K562-R cells, cells from blast crisis CML patients, and all IM-resistant cell lines tested had reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar in the presence of 0.5 µM ON044580. In in vitro kinase assays, ON044580 inhibited the recombinant Jak2 and Abl kinase activities when the respective Jak2 and Abl peptides were used as substrates. Incubation of the Bcr-Abl+ cells with ON044580 rapidly reduced the levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also reduced the expression of HSP90 and its client protein levels. Lysates of Bcr-Abl+ cell lines were found to contain a large signaling network complex composed of Bcr-Abl, Jak2, HSP90, and its client proteins as detected by a gel filtration column chromatography, which was rapidly disrupted by ON044580. Therefore, targeting Jak2 and Bcr-Abl kinases is an effective way to destabilize Bcr-Abl and its network complex, which leads to the onset of apoptosis in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant Bcr-Abl+ cells. This inhibitory strategy has potential to manage all types of drug-resistant CML cells, especially at the terminal blast crisis stage of CML, where TKIs are not clinically useful.",

To investigate the specific role of Abelson oncogene 1 (c-Abl) in imatinib-induced cardiac toxicity, we performed targeted gene inhibition of c-Abl by RNA interference in neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs). Suppression of c-Abl did not lead to cytotoxicity or induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To further dis associate c-Abl from imatinib-induced cardiac toxicity, we designed imatinib structural analogs that do not have appreciable c-Abl inhibition in NCMs. The c-Abl inactive analogs induced cytotoxicity and ER stress, at similar or greater potencies and magnitudes as imatinib. Furthermore, combining c-Abl gene silencing with imatinib and analogs treatment did not significantly shift the cytotoxicity dose response curves. Imatinib and analogs were shown to accumulate in lysosomes, likely due to their physicochemical properties, and disrupt autophagy. The toxicity induced by imatinib and analogs can be rescued by bafilomycin A pretreatment, demonstrating the involvement of lysosomal accumulation in cardiac toxicity. The results from our studies strongly suggest that imatinib induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction through disruption of autophagy and induction of ER stress, independent of c-Abl inhibition.",

The pathogenesis of CML involves the constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, which governs malignant disease by activating multiple signal transduction pathways. The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib, is the front-line treatment for CML, but the emergence of imatinib resistance and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has called attention for additional resistance mechanisms and has led to the search for alternative drug treatments. In this paper, we discuss our current understanding of mechanisms, related or unrelated to BCR-ABL, which have been shown to account for chemoresistance and treatment failure. We focus on the potential role of the influx and efflux transporters, the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and transcription factor-mediated signals as feasible molecular targets to overcome the development of TKIs resistance in CML.",

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571), a Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor, selectively inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of CML cells. Despite the success of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of CML, resistance is observed, particularly in advanced disease. The most common imatinib mesylate resistance mechanism involves Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations that impart varying degrees of drug insensitivity. AP23464, a potent adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-based inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, displays antiproliferative activity against a human CML cell line and Bcr-Abl-transduced Ba/F3 cells (IC(50) = 14 nM; imatinib mesylate IC(50) = 350 nM). AP23464 ablates Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation, blocks cell cycle progression, and promotes apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Biochemical assays with purified glutathione S transferase (GST)-Abl kinase domain confirmed that AP23464 directly inhibits Abl activity. Importantly, the low nanomolar cellular and biochemical inhibitory properties of AP23464 extend to frequently observed imatinib mesylate-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants, including nucleotide binding P-loop mutants Q252H, Y253F, E255K, C-terminal loop mutant M351T, and activation loop mutant H396P. AP23464 was ineffective against mutant T315I, an imatinib mesylate contact residue. The potency of AP23464 against imatinib mesylate-refractory Bcr-Abl and its distinct binding mode relative to imatinib mesylate warrant further investigation of AP23464 for the treatment of CML.",

In this prospective study, samples from 478 patients with CD10(+) B-cell precursor ALL (c-ALL and pre-B ALL) underwent BCR-ABL reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with double testing of positive samples. Patients were stratified according to the PCR result and treated in 2 German Multicenter Trials of Adult ALL. The outcome was followed and the prognostic impact of BCR-ABL was compared to clinical risk features. Of the 478 samples, 432 had an evaluable BCR-ABL result. Thirty-seven percent of the c-ALL and pre-B ALL patients were BCR-ABL(+) (p190, 77%; p210, 20%; simultaneous p190/p210, 3%). BCR-ABL positivity was associated with the high-risk features of older age (45 years versus 30 years median age; P =.0001) and higher white blood cell counts (23 500/microL versus 11 550/microL; P =.0001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed BCR-ABL as the leading factor for a poor prognosis (P =.0001) in comparison to clinical risk criteria. Irrespective of the breakpoint, presence of any BCR-ABL transcript predicted a lower chance of initial treatment response (68.4% versus 84.6%; P =.001) and a lower probability of disease-free survival at 3 years (0.13 versus 0.47; P =.0001). This bad outcome was not influenced by postinduction high-dose treatment stratifications. The results show a high prevalence of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts with predominance of p190. BCR-ABL RT-PCR is confirmed as a sensitive, rapid method to diagnose t(9;22), and p190 and p210 are unequivocally demonstrated as the most important predictors of poor long-term survival despite intensified chemotherapy.",

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is highly effective in the treatment of CML, its continuous administration is associated with development of resistance, particularly in advanced phase or blast crisis. We investigate here whether a feature of disease progression (i.e., elevated expression of Bcr-Abl in CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients in blast crisis) has any bearing on the kinetics of resistance to imatinib. By studying cell lines that exogenously express Bcr-Abl over the range found from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we show that cells expressing high amounts of Bcr-Abl, as in blast crisis, are much less sensitive to imatinib and, more significantly, take a substantially shorter time for yielding a mutant subclone resistant to the inhibitor than cells with low expression levels, as in chronic phase. Our data suggest that the differential levels of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein expressed by CD34+ CML cells may reflect the extent and duration of their response to imatinib; the relatively high levels of oncoprotein in advanced-phase disease may underlie the observed rapid development of resistance.",

In the case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), understanding the relationship between the induction of DC differentiation and the expression of the BCR-ABL oncogene has direct relevance to CML biology as well as the development of new therapeutic approaches. We now report that direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester PMA in the BCR-ABL(+) CML cell line K562 and primary CML blasts induced nonterminal differentiation into cells with typical DC morphology (cytoplasmic dendrites), characteristic surface markers (MHC class I, MHC class II, CD86, CD40), chemokine and transcription factor expression, and ability to stimulate T cell proliferation (equivalent to normal monocyte-derived DC). PKC-induced differentiation was associated with down-regulation of BCR-ABL mRNA expression, protein levels, and kinase activity. This down-regulation appeared to be signaled through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Therefore, PKC-driven differentiation of CML blasts into DC-like cells suggests a potentially novel strategy to down-regulate BCR-ABL activity, yet raises the possibility that CML-derived DC vaccines will be less effective in presenting leukemia-specific Ags.",

We have examined how Bcr-Abl-expressing cells respond to two mechanistically different therapeutic agents, etoposide and Imatinib. We also examined Bcr-Abl expression at low and high levels as elevated expression has been associated with treatment failure. Cells expressing low levels of Bcr-Abl undergo apoptosis in response to the DNA-targeting agent (etoposide), whereas high-Bcr-Abl-expressing cells primarily induce autophagy. Autophagic populations engage a delayed nonapoptotic death; however, sufficient cells evade this and repopulate following the withdrawal of the drug. Non-Bcr-Abl-expressing 32D or Ba/F3 cells induce both apoptosis and autophagy in response to etoposide and can recover. Imatinib treatment induces both apoptosis and autophagy in all Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and populations rapidly recover. Inhibition of autophagy with ATG7 and Beclin1 siRNA significantly reduced the recovery of Imatinib-treated K562 cells, indicating the importance of autophagy for the recovery of treated cells. Combination regimes incorporating agents that disrupt Imatinib-induced autophagy would remain primarily targeted and may improve response to the treatment in CML.",

The archetypical disease in this regard is chronic myeloid leukemia, where abl is constitutively activated by fusion with the bcr gene (bcr/abl). Similarly, the drug has now been shown to display equally impressive therapeutic activity in eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloproliferative disorders that are characterized by activating mutations of either the PDGFRB or the PDGFRA gene. The former usually results from translocations involving chromosome 5q31-33, and the latter usually results from an interstitial deletion involving chromosome 4q12 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA). In contrast, imatinib is ineffective, in vitro and in vivo, against the mastocytosis-associated c-kit D816V mutation. However, wild-type and other c-kit mutations might be vulnerable to the drug, as has been the case in gastrointestinal stomal cell tumors.

Imatinib mesylate is a specific inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl kinase and has shown promising results in clinical studies. The structural relation between the Bcr-Abl oncogene and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has recently been elucidated by an elegant crystal structure analysis, emphasizing the importance of dephosphorylated tyrosine 393 (Tyr393) in Bcr-Abl for access of the inhibitor to the kinase domain. By mutating this tyrosine to phenylalanine and thereby mimicking a constitutively dephosphorylated state, we now show that Ba/F3 cells transformed by this mutant demonstrate an increased sensitivity towards imatinib in vivo. This effect is not due to an impaired kinase activity of Bcr-Abl Y393F, since a synthetic substrate is phosphorylated with similar kinetics. Treatment of Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl wild type with a phosphatase inhibitor diminished the effect of imatinib, but did not influence the growth of Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-AblY393F. The results support the findings of the crystal structure and indicate that Tyr393 indeed plays a significant role for the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl towards imatinib in vivo.

In chronic myeloid leukemia a proliferation of malignant myeloid cells occurs in the bone marrow due to excessive tyrosine kinase activity. In order to maintain homeostasis, natural killer cells, by means of receptors, identify the major histocompatibility complex on the surface of tumor cells and subsequently induce apoptosis. The NKG2D receptor in the natural killer cells recognizes the transmembrane proteins related to major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB), and it is by the interaction between NKG2D and MICA that natural killer cells exert cytotoxic activity against chronic myeloid leukemia tumor cells. However, in the case of chronic exposure of the NKG2D receptor, the MICA ligand releases soluble proteins called sMICA from the tumor cell surface, which negatively modulate NKG2D and enable the tumor cells to avoid lysis mediated by the natural killer cells. Blocking the formation of sMICA may be an important antitumor strategy. Treatment using tyrosine kinase inhibitors induces modulation of NKG2DL expression, which could favor the activity of the natural killer cells. However this mechanism has not been fully described in chronic myeloid leukemia. In the present study, we analyze the role of natural killer cells to reduce proliferation and in the cellular death of tumor cells in chronic myeloid leukemia.",

This effect is dose dependent and occurs faster in transformed cells as compared to their normal counterparts. In addition to the classical features of apoptosis, we observed that Ceramide-treated CML cells display a rapid and sequential activation of the Bcr-Abl and PI3 kinases. We then demonstrated the role of the Bcr-Abl kinase activity in the accelerated response observed in CML cells treated by Ceramide. The PI3 kinase seems to be partly involved in the accelerated Phosphatidyl-Serine exposure observed in Bcr-Abl transformed cells. Finally, we observed that Ceramide-induced apoptosis does not seem to implicate a Bcl2 protein modulation. Taken together these results support the hypothesis of at least two independent signaling pathways initiating programmed cell death: one will be involved in apoptosis mediated by signals such as cytokine-starving is blocked by the Bcr-Abl fusion protein while the other one initiated by Ceramide is accelerated by the Bcr-Abl protein.",

However, although BCR/ABL-expressing cell lines have an equivalent cell survival, they have an increase in chromosomal translocations after DNA repair as compared to control cells. This demonstrates that BCR/ABL expression decreases the fidelity of DNA repair. To see whether this is true in primary CML samples, normal CD34+ progenitor cells and CML progenitor cells were treated with etoposide. CML progenitor cells have equivalent survival but have an increase in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Spectral karyotyping demonstrates new chromosomal translocations in CML cells, but not normal progenitor cells, consistent with error-prone DNA repair. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BCR/ABL enhances the accumulation of DSBs and alters the apoptotic threshold in CML leading to error-prone DNA repair.",

A similar result was obtained with an IgV lambda probe and indicated homozygosity of a significant part of chromosome 22.

The most common mechanism of acquired resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations. Several strategies have been developed to overcome the problem of imatinib resistance, including imatinib dose escalation, novel targeted agents and combination treatments. A second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was developed, which displays increased potency towards Bcr-Abl and is able to target the majority of CML mutant clones. Nilotinib (Tasigna, AMN107, Novartis) is a close analog of imatinib with approximately 20-fold higher potency for BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance, and has induced high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses in CML post imatinib failure, with a good tolerance.

Given that BCR-ABL is the specific target of Gleevec in CML treatment, we investigated the regulation of the catalytic component of telomerase, hTERT, by BCR-ABL at multiple levels in K562 cells.;Molecular techniques such as over expression, knockdown, real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, reporter assay, confocal microscopy, telomerase assays and microarray were used to suggest that hTERT expression and activity is modulated by BCR-ABL at multiple levels.;Our results suggest that BCR-ABL plays an important role in regulating hTERT in K562 (BCR-ABL positive human leukemia) cells. When Gleevec inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, phosphorylation of hTERT was downregulated, therefore suggesting a positive correlation between BCR-ABL and hTERT. Gleevec treatment inhibited hTERT at mRNA level and significantly reduced telomerase activity (TA) in K562 cells, but not in HL60 or Jurkat cells (BCR-ABL negative cells). We also demonstrated that the transcription factor STAT5a plays a critical role in hTERT gene regulation in K562 cells. Knockdown of STAT5a, but not STAT5b, resulted in a marked downregulation of hTERT mRNA level, TA and hTERT protein level in K562 cells. Furthermore, translocation of hTERT from nucleoli to nucleoplasm was observed in K562 cells induced by Gleevec.;Our data reveal that BCR-ABL can regulate TA at multiple levels, including transcription, post-translational level, and proper localization. Thus, suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by Gleevec treatment may be partially due to TA inhibition. Additionally, we have identified STAT5a as critical mediator of the hTERT gene expression in BCR-ABL positive CML cells, suggesting that targeting STAT5a may be a promising therapeutic strategy for BCR-ABL positive CML patients.",

In a conditional cell culture model, we demonstrate that RNAi-mediated reduction of SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 protein expression inhibits BCR-ABL-dependent but not cytokine-dependent proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, colony formation of purified primary CML but not of normal CD34+ colony-forming cells is specifically reduced by inhibition of SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 expression, respectively. In addition, coexpression of both anti-BCR-ABL and anti-SHP2 shRNAs from a single lentiviral vector induces stronger inhibition of colony formation as compared to either shRNA alone.

However, more than 30 % of patients with CML in chronic phase do not respond adequately to Imatinib and the drug seems not to affect the quiescent pool of BCR-ABL positive leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Therefore, despite encouraging clinical results, Imatinib can still not be considered a curative treatment option in CML. We recently reported downregulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in Imatinib treated K562 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of eIF5A by siRNA in combination with Imatinib has been shown to exert synergistic cytotoxic effects on BCR-ABL positive cell lines. Based on the structure of known deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) inhibitors such as CNI-1493, a drug design approach was applied to develop potential compounds targeting DHS. Here we report the biological evaluation of selected novel (DHSI-15) as compared to established (CNI-1493, deoxyspergualin) DHS inhibitors. We show that upon the compounds tested, DHSI-15 and deoxyspergualin exert strongest antiproliferative effects on BCR-ABL cells including Imatinib resistant mutants. However, this effect did not seem to be restricted to BCR-ABL positive cell lines or primary cells. Both compounds are able to induce apoptosis/necrosis during long term incubation of BCR-ABL positive BA/F3 derivates. Pharmacological synergism can be observed for deoxyspergualin and Imatinib, but not for DHSI-15 and Imatinib. Finally we show that deoxyspergualin is able to inhibit proliferation of CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients.

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) against BCR-ABL, imatinib, is the first-line therapy for CML, acquired resistance almost inevitably emerges. The underlying mechanism are point mutations within the BCR-ABL gene, among which T315I is notorious because it resists to almost all currently available inhibitors. Here we took use of a previously generated chimeric ubiquitin ligase, SH2-U-box, in which SH2 from the adaptor protein Grb2 acts as a binding domain for activated BCR-ABL, while U-box from CHIP functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, so as to target the ubiquitination and degradation of both native and T315I-mutant BCR-ABL. As such, SH2-U-box significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in CML cells harboring either the wild-type or T315I-mutant BCR-ABL (K562 or K562R), with BCR-ABL-dependent signaling pathways being repressed. Moreover, SH2-U-box worked in concert with imatinib in K562 cells. Importantly, SH2-U-box-carrying lentivirus could markedly suppress the growth of K562-xenografts in nude mice or K562R-xenografts in SCID mice, as well as that of primary CML cells. Collectively, by degrading the native and T315I-mutant BCR-ABL, the chimeric ubiquitin ligase SH2-U-box may serve as a potential therapy for both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML. ",

Lack of BCR-ABL leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase as observed by decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p21 and p27 cdk inhibitors mRNA. Apoptosis resistance imparted by BCR-ABL is lost in these cells in caspase-dependent or independent manner. Decrease in Bcl-XL is observed along with decrease in mitochondrial membrane integrity. Transient removal of BCR-ABL expression has a profound effect on proliferation and clonogenic capacity also confirmed by long-term silencing using lentiviral vectors. Interestingly, low level of BCR-ABL message leads to enhanced erythroid differentiation and reduced expression of megakaryocytic markers.

CML cell growth in vivo was assessed using a xenograft model in nude mice. Bcr-Abl and β-catenin protein levels were determined using Western blotting. Bcr-Abl messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to determine cell cycle status.;Tetrandrine citrate inhibited the growth of IM-resistant K562 cells, primary leukemia cells, and primitive CD34(+) leukemia cells, and their inhibition concentration that inhibited 50% of target cells (IC(50)) ranged from 1.20 to 2.97 μg/ml. In contrast, tetrandrine citrate did not affect normal blood cells under the same conditions, and IC(50) values were about 10.12-13.11 μg/ml. Oral administration of tetrandrine citrate caused complete regression of IM-resistant K562 xenografts in nude mice without overt toxicity. Western blot results revealed that treatment of IM-resistant K562 cells with tetrandrine citrate resulted in a significant decrease of both p210(Bcr-Abl) and β-catenin proteins, but IM did not affect the Bcr-Abl protein levels. Proteasome inhibitor, MG132, did not prevent tetrandrine-mediated decrease of the p210(Bcr-Abl) protein. RT-PCR results showed that tetrandrine treatment caused a decrease of Bcr-Abl mRNA. FCM analysis indicated that tetrandrine induced gap 1 (G(1)) arrest in CML cells.;Tetrandrine citrate is a novel orally active tetrandrine salt with potent anti-tumor activity against IM-resistant K562 cells and CML cells.

However, the role of lncRNAs in Bcr-Abl-mediated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in human CML cells using an lncRNA cDNA microarray and identified an lncRNA termed lncRNA-BGL3 that acted as a key regulator of Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Notably, we observed that lncRNA-BGL3 was highly induced in response to disruption of Bcr-Abl expression or by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase activity in K562 cells and leukemic cells derived from CML patients. Ectopic expression of lncRNA-BGL3 sensitized leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Furthermore, transgenic (TG) mice expressing lncRNA-BGL3 were generated. We found that TG expression of lncRNA-BGL3 alone in mice was sufficient to impair primary bone marrow transformation by Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, we identified that lncRNA-BGL3 was a target of miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR-106b, microRNAs that repress mRNA of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Further experiments demonstrated that lncRNA-BGL3 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA for binding these microRNAs to cross-regulate PTEN expression. Additionally, our experiments have begun to address the mechanism of how lncRNA-BGL3 is regulated in the leukemic cells and showed that Bcr-Abl repressed lncRNA-BGL3 expression through c-Myc-dependent DNA methylation. Taken together, these results reveal that Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation critically requires silence of tumor-suppressor lncRNA-BGL3 and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia.",

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is an important activator of apoptosis in normal cells; conversely its functional loss may cause drug resistance. The ABL oncoprotein-p53 paradigm represents the relationship between an oncogenic tyrosine kinase and a tumor suppressor gene. Here we show that BCR/ABL oncoproteins employ p53 to induce resistance to DNA damage in myeloid leukemia cells. Cells transformed by the ABL oncoproteins displayed accumulation of p53 upon DNA damage. In contrast, only a modest increase of p53 expression followed by activation of caspase-3 were detected in normal cells expressing endogenous c-ABL. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like protein kinases (ATR and also ATM) -dependent phosphorylation of p53-Ser15 residue was associated with the accumulation of p53, and stimulation of p21(Waf-1) and GADD45, resulting in G(2)/M delay in BCR/ABL cells after genotoxic treatment. Inhibition of p53 by siRNA or by the temperature-sensitive mutation reduced G(2)/M accumulation and drug resistance of BCR/ABL cells. In conclusion, accumulation of the p53 protein contributed to prolonged G(2)/M checkpoint activation and drug resistance in myeloid cells expressing the BCR/ABL oncoproteins.",

Epidemiologic data indicates that almost 5000 new cases are reported every year and 10% of these patients eventually succumb to the disease. The treatment of CML was revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec), a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The clinical use of specific BCR-ABL inhibitors has resulted in a significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens. However, the complete eradication of CML in patients receiving imatinib was limited by the emergence of resistance mostly due to mutations in the ABL kinase domain and to a lesser extent by molecular residual disease after treatment. The second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib (Sprycel), showed significant activity in clinical trials in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib therapy, except in those patients with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation. Identifying key components involved in the CML pathogenesis may lead to the exploration of new approaches that might eventually overcome resistance mediated to the BCR-ABL TKIs. Here, we present an overview about the current treatment of Ph+ CML patients with the TKIs and the obstacles to successful treatment with these drugs.",

However, therapeutic effects of radotinib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that radotinib significantly decreases the viability of AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Kasumi-1 cells were more sensitive to radotinib than NB4, HL60, or THP-1 cell lines. Furthermore, radotinib induced CD11b expression in NB4, THP-1, and Kasumi-1 cells either in presence or absence of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). We found that radotinib promoted differentiation and induced CD11b expression in AML cells by downregulating LYN. However, CD11b expression induced by ATRA in HL60 cells was decreased by radotinib through upregulation of LYN. Furthermore, radotinib mainly induced apoptosis of CD11b+ cells in the total population of AML cells. Radotinib also increased apoptosis of CD11b+ HL60 cells when they were differentiated by ATRA/dasatinib treatment. We show that radotinib induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in CD11b+ cells differentiated from AML cells. Our results suggest that radotinib may be used as a candidate drug in AML or a chemosensitizer for treatment of AML by other therapeutics. ",

Our results show that oral administration of the inhibitor was able to significantly increase the survival of these mice compared to controls treated with vehicle (P<0.005), and caused marked regression of the tumor burden in the treated mice. Upon prolonged treatment, lymphomas re-emerged and a subset of cells from two of such lymphomas tested was able to survive in the presence of increased concentrations of SCH66336. The same cells, however, remained sensitive towards imatinib. A combination of the two drugs, preceded by a therapy to reduce the initial tumor burden, could be very effective in the treatment of Ph-positive ALL.

We tested this hypothesis in eight Ph+ mcr- ALL patients by amplifying the putative hybrid part of the bcr-abl cDNA, using the polymerase chain reaction method. All cases examined showed the same joining of the first exon of the bcr gene to the c-abl oncogene. Thus, the novel bcr-abl fusion in Ph+ mcr- ALL is the result of a molecularly distinct Ph chromosome. This allows the definition of Ph+ leukemias by their respective bcr-abl oncogene activation.

Limitations of this technique include the reported low frequency of normal stem cells in CML and the difficulties in obtaining sufficient BM for manipulation. To address these problems we compared the apheresis product with the diagnostic bone marrow at diagnosis as a source of primitive BCR/ABL-negative progenitors. We analyzed the CD34+ HLA-DR- and CD34+CD38(-) populations in five CML patients to evaluate the frequency of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors and pre-progenitors in these populations. Progenitor analysis was performed by RT-PCR of individual hemopoietic colonies from a standard CFU-GM assay. Analysis of pre-progenitors involved RT-PCR of secondary colonies derived from a stroma-free pre-CFU assay. Our results show variable levels of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors in the 34+DR- population but very low levels of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors in the 34+38- population in blood. Analysis of pre-progenitors from the 34+DR- fraction of peripheral blood (PB) and BM showed 80-100% and 85-100% of colonies were BCR-ABL negative at days 14 and 28, respectively. Analysis of pre-progenitors from the 34+38- fraction of PB and BM showed 23-100% and 42-100% of colonies were BCR-ABL negative at days 14 and 28, respectively. In summary, pre-progenitors from the 34+DR- and 34+38- populations are predominantly BCR-ABL negative in both marrow and blood at diagnosis.

We studied the molecular subtype of the Ph1 chromosome in 11 cases of Ph1-positive ALL, including 2 with a previous diagnosis of CML, using a sensitive method to analyze the mRNA species based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We observed unexpected heterogeneity in BCR-ABL mRNA in this population; in particular, 1 of 6 bcr-rearranged cases and 1 of 5 bcr-unrearranged cases contained none of the known fusion mRNA species, while 1 of the bcr-rearranged cases contained both. This latter case is particularly interesting because it suggests that the acquisition of an additional BCR-ABL fusion species may be a mechanism of disease progression.

The ABL gene on chromosome band 9q34 is a proto-oncogene and is the well-known translocation partner of the BCR gene on 22q11 giving rise to t(9;22)(q34;q11), which is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia and is the most common chromosomal abnormality in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Amplification of ABL is an exceedingly rare event, with only less than 5 cases reported in the literature. The p16(INK4a) (or CDKN2A) gene on 9p21 is a tumor suppressor gene, and deletion thereof is recently recognized as one of the most common genetic abnormalities in ALL. The authors herein describe an 8-year-old male patient with precursor T-cell ALL harboring both ABL gene amplification and p16(INK4a) gene deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using BCR/ABL probes revealed five or more ABL signals, indicating amplification in 51.5% of interphase nuclei. FISH using p16(INK4a) gene probes showed heterozygous p16(INK4a) deletion in 71.0%. On conventional cytogenetic analysis, however, only 10 metaphases were available, which showed the normal karyotype, 46,XY[10], serving no evidence for the findings on FISH. This is the first report of an ALL case with ABL amplification, and the authors speculate that both ABL proto-oncogene amplification and the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor gene deletion have been implicated in leukemogenesis in the present case, although whether the ABL amplification truly contributes to the leukemogenesis or merely an epiphenomenon representing underlying genomic instability remains to be determined.",

BCR-ABL is inhibited by imatinib; however, several mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been proposed that account for loss of imatinib efficacy in patients with CML. Previously, we showed that overexpression of the efflux drug transporter P-glycoprotein partially contributed to imatinib resistance in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells having no BCR-ABL mutations. To explain an additional mechanism of drug resistance, we established a subclone (K562/R) of the cells and examined the BCR-ABL signaling pathway in these and wild-type K562 (K562/W) cells. We found the K562/R cells were 15 times more resistant to imatinib than their wild-type counterparts. In both cell lines, BCR-ABL and its downstream signaling molecules, such as ERK1/2, ERK5, STAT5, and AKT, were phosphorylated in the absence of imatinib. In both cell lines, imatinib effectively reduced the phosphorylation of all the above, except ERK1/2, whose phosphorylation was, interestingly, only inhibited in the wild-type cells. We then observed that phospho-ERK1/2 levels decreased in the presence of siRNA targeting BCR-ABL, again, only in the K562/W cells. However, using an ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, we found that we could reduce phospho-ERK1/2 levels in K562/R cells and restore their sensitivity to imatinib. Taken together, we conclude that the BCR-ABL-independent activation of ERK1/2 contributes to imatinib resistance in K562/R cells, and that ERK1/2 could be a target for the treatment of CML patients whose imatinib resistance is due to this mechanism.",

While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often resistant. In particular, mutation of the T315 residue in the bcr/abl activation loop renders cells highly resistant to imatinib and to second-generation kinase inhibitors such as BMS-354825 or AMN107. Adaphostin is a tyrphostin that was originally intended to inhibit the BCR/ABL kinase by competing with its peptide substrates. Recent findings have in addition implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic mechanism of adaphostin. In view of this unique mode of action, we examined the effects of adaphostin on numerous imatinib-resistant leukemia models, including imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL cell lines, cells harboring point mutations in BCR/ABL, and specimens from imatinib-resistant CML patients, using assays for intracellular ROS, apoptosis, and clonogenicity. Every model of imatinib resistance examined remained fully sensitive to adaphostin-induced cell death.

The percentage of bcr-abl-positive cells by FISH decreased in all patients (pretherapy median, 73%; 3 months median, 47%). Cytogenetic and FISH data defined 2 groups after 6 months of follow-up: 5 patients became negative for bcr-abl by FISH; 8 remained positive, 4 of whom developed signs of clonal cytogenetic evolution. Patients who became negative for bcr-abl had no morphologic evidence of CML at 15 to 24 months of follow-up, whereas patients who remained positive redeveloped morphologic features of CML as cellularity increased. Some bcr-abl-positive patients showed signs of progression, including 2 patients who developed myeloid blast phase. Although all patients demonstrated an initial decrease in bone marrow cellularity after imatinib mesylate therapy, continued follow-up showed that histopathologic findings correlated with genetic response.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The BCR/ABL fusion protein transforms myeloid stem cells. Both chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) are associated with the expression of BCR/ABL proteins. This knowledge has not yet been translated into any specific tool to control ABL driven neoplastic cells growth. CGP57148B is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the ABL protein kinase; it has been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of ABL both in vitro and in vivo and to inhibit the growth of v-abl and bcr/abl transfectants, as well as the in vitro formation of bone marrow (BM)-derived colonies in the presence of growth factors in some CML patients. These studies were performed to investigate the activity of CGP57148B on the spontaneous proliferation of both fresh and cultured, leukemic and normal, BCR/ABL positive and negative cells, and to study its mechanism of action. Six cell lines derived from BCR/ABL+ leukemias (K562, BV173, KCL22, KU812, MC3, LAMA84), thirteen BCR/ABL negative lines, both neoplastic (KG1, SU-DHL-1, U937, Daudi, NB4, NB4.306) and derived from normal cells (PHA blasts, LAK, fibroblasts, LCL, renal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, CD34(+) cells), and 14 fresh leukemic samples were tested using a tritiated thymidine uptake assay. The in vivo phosphorylation of the BCR/ABL protein was evaluated by western blot, while apoptosis was detected by the annexin V/propidium binding test. The induction of differentiation was assayed by immunofluorescence using multiple antibodies. All six BCR/ABL+ lines showed a dose dependent inhibition of their spontaneous proliferative rate, which was not accompanied by differentiation. The treatment caused, within minutes, dephosphorylation of the BCR/ABL protein, followed in 16-24 hours by a decrease in cycling cells and induction of apoptosis. No significant inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed in any BCR/ABL negative normal or neoplastic line at concentrations </=3 microM, with the exception of fibroblasts and CD34 cells. Proliferation inhibition was observed also when using fresh samples obtained from two Ph+ ALL and 12 consecutive CML patients. Induction of apoptosis was observed in these samples too. The activity of CGP57148B can be monitored in ex vivo isolated or cultured cells using a simple and reproducible assay, without the need for exogenously added growth factors. This molecule possibly exerts its effects through the inhibition of the kinase activity of BCR/ABL and the subsequent initiation of apoptosis, without inducing cell differentiation. Some normal cells are also affected. These data support the use of CGP57148B in initial clinical studies; possible toxic effects on BM and fibroblast-derived cells will have to be closely monitored. The in vivo monitoring of patients will have to be focused on the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells.",

Chimerism was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (VNTR [variable number of tandem repeats]-PCR) analysis in highly purified CD19+, CD3+, CD15+, and CD56+ cell fractions, whereas MRD was investigated in whole blood by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of both p210(BCR-ABL) and p190(BCR-ABL) hybrid transcripts. Of 55 patients, 14 (including 6 T-cell-depleted patients) had cytogenetic relapse at 5-80 months and progressed to hematologic relapse, while 41 patients remained in prolonged cytogenetic remission 12-107 months post-BMT. Before leukemia recurrence, patients in the relapse group showed a consistent evolution pattern sequentially featured by persistent p210(BCR-ABL) positivity, increasing mixed chimerism (MC) in myeloid cells, p190(BCR-ABL) positivity, and, finally, cytogenetic relapse. Myeloid MC preceded cytogenetic relapse by 2-12 months, whereas p190(BCR/ABL) was detected 1-6 months prior to cytogenetic relapse in 11 patients and concomitant with cytogenetic relapse in 3 patients. In the remission group, all patients invariably tested negative for p190(BCR-ABL); 10 patients tested positive for p210(BCR-ABL) at variable time-points but showed persistent full donor chimerism (DC), whereas 31 patients tested p210(BCR-ABL) negative and displayed full DC or transient MC due to the persistence of recipient T cells. Two patients in the relapse group were successfully reinduced into molecular remission with donor lymphocyte infusion. Sequential molecular analysis after such treatment showed the inverse pattern to that observed prior to relapse, ie, progressive disappearance of p190(BCR-ABL) transcripts, conversion of myeloid chimerism to donor type, and, finally, p210(BCR-ABL) negativity. We conclude that lineage-specific chimerism and p190(BCR-ABL) messenger RNA (mRNA) analyses contribute a better characterization of CML evolution after BMT and enable early identification of patients at the highest risk of relapse.

The implication of LMO2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia must still be explored.;We measured LMO2 expression by real time RT-PCR in 247 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples with cytogenetic data (144 of them also with survival and immunophenotypical data) and in normal hematopoietic and lymphoid cells.;B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases expressed variable levels of LMO2 depending on immunophenotypical and cytogenetic features.

Additionally, cases with TEL-AML1 or MLL rearrangements exhibited two-fold higher LMO2 expression compared to cases with BCR-ABL rearrangements or hyperdyploid karyotype.

However, Bcr-Abl also modulates Skp2 protein stability in these cells. Treatment of Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib led to G1 growth arrest accompanied with reduced Skp2 expression. Interestingly, reduction of Skp2 protein occurred prior to down-regulation of Skp2 mRNA suggesting a post-translational control. The half-life of Skp2 protein was significantly attenuated in imatinib-treated cells. These effects are not cell line specific because similar results were also found in CML cells obtained from patients. Knockdown of Bcr-Abl similarly caused Skp2 protein instability. The decrease of Skp2 was induced by increased protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Imatinib treatment or Bcr-Abl knockdown reduced Emi1, an endogenous inhibitor of the E3 ligase APC/Cdh1 which mediated Skp2 degradation. We found that Emi1 stability was regulated by phosphorylation and mutation of tyrosine 142 reduced the stability. Our data suggested Bcr-Abl-induced Emi1 phosphorylation might be mediated by Src kinase. Firstly, Src inhibitor SU6656 inhibited Emi1 tyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells. Secondly, transfection of v-Src rescued the reduction of Emi1 by imatinib. Thirdly, mutation of tyrosine 142 to phenylalanine (Y142F) abolished the phosphorylation of Emi1 by recombinant Src kinase. In addition, ectopic expression of wild type but not Y142F mutant Emi1 counteracted imatinib-caused growth arrest. Collectively, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl increases Emi1 phosphorylation and stability to prevent Skp2 protein degradation via APC/Cdh1-induced ubiquitination and to enhance proliferation of CML cells.",

The development of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted against the causative Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in CML, has resulted in hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in all phases of CML. A significant proportion of patients are resistant to imatinib or develop resistance during treatment. This is often a result of mutated forms of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein to which imatinib is unable to bind. Several strategies have been developed to overcome the problem of imatinib resistance, including high-dose imatinib, novel targeted agents, and combination treatments. Novel agents include dasatinib, a potent TKI that inhibits several critical oncogenic proteins and which has recently been approved for patients with CML who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib; and nilotinib, a potent selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor currently in clinical development. Other agents in development include SKI-606 and INNO-406. Stem cell transplantation remains a useful option, although it is not generally used as first-line treatment.

Activation of β-catenin was linked to CML leukemogenesis and drug resistance through its BCR-ABL-dependent Y phosphorylation and impaired binding to GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β). Herein, we show that GSK3β is constitutively Y(216) phospho-activated and predominantly relocated to the cytoplasm in primary CML stem/progenitor cells compared with its balanced active/inactive levels and cytosolic/nuclear distribution in normal cells. Under cytokine support, persistent GSK3β activity and its altered subcellular localization were correlated with BCR-ABL-dependent and -independent activation of MAPK and p60-SRC/GSK3β complex formation. Specifically, GSK3β activity and nuclear import were increased by imatinib mesylate (IM), a selective ABL inhibitor, but prevented by dasatinib that targets both BCR-ABL- and cytokine-dependent MAPK/p60-SRC activity. SB216763, a specific GSK3 inhibitor, promoted an almost complete suppression of primary CML stem/progenitor cells when combined with IM, but not dasatinib, while sparing bcr-abl-negative cells. Our data indicate that GSK3 inhibition acts to prime a pro-differentiative/apoptotic transcription program in the nucleus of IM-treated CML cells by affecting the β-catenin, cyclinD1, C-EBPα, ATF5, mTOR, and p27 levels.

We sought to determine if quantitative PCR measurement of peripheral blood BCR/ABL transcript can be used to monitor response in CML patients with clinically evident disease while receiving the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571. Serial bone marrow cytogenetics and peripheral blood BCR/ABL mRNA levels were measured in 17 patients [9 with chronic phase (CP) and 8 with accelerated phase or blast crisis (AP/BC)] during 1 year of treatment. Overall, quantitative PCR BCR/ABL transcript level decreased by a median of 0.9 log during the first 3 months, and by 1.6 logs by 12 months. Among cytogenetic responders (6 CP and 2 AP/BC), median BCR/ABL copy number was 0.9 and 2.1 logs lower than baseline after 3 and 12 months of treatment, respectively. No patient became PCR-negative for BCR/ABL. Among cytogenetic non-responders, BCR/ABL transcript level decreased by 0.4 logs after 3 months, with no subsequent reductions. At study entry, BCR/ABL expression in cytogenetic responders and non-responders was similar. However, BCR/ABL expression became significantly different 3 months after treatment (p = 0.02), and increasingly different with continued therapy (p = 0.04, 0.005, 0.0008 at 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively). Our results demonstrate that PBMC BCR/ABL mRNA levels correlate well with response to STI-571. This non-invasive, rapid and sensitive PCR-based assay can be used to monitor response to STI-571.",

Chronic myeloid leukemia is a disease of the hematopoietic stem cell that progress in a multistep fashion. The biphasic or triphasic clinical course of the disease exemplies the multistep process of tumor progression from the indolent chronic phase to a more aggressive and terminal blast crisis. CML was the first neoplastic disease shown to be associated with consistent karyotypic abnormality now known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The result of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22)(q34:q11) is the transposition of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22, where it is fused with part of the her gene. The translocation generates a new hybrid bcr-abl gene which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CML. Presently, CML is perhaps the best understood cancer in humans and the model of oncogenesis mediated by the Ph chromosome translocation is one of the best-characterized example of gene activation in leukemia.",

Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has been the mainstay of first-line therapy for CML for 10 years. Although patients with CML-CP respond well to imatinib, those who have delayed reductions in leukemic burden during imatinib therapy, such as not achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 12 months, have an increased risk of disease progression. It has been recognized, with 8 years of observation, that patients who achieve an early major molecular response (MMR) on imatinib have a very low probability of disease progression. Recent randomized phase 3 trials have shown that first-line treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib-more potent BCR-ABL inhibitors-results in significantly higher rates and more rapid achievement of CCyR and MMR in comparison with standard-dose imatinib. These trials suggest that CML treatment can be improved with more potent BCR-ABL inhibition during initial therapy, but further follow-up is needed to confirm that the improved response rates with dasatinib and nilotinib are maintained long term.",

The suppressive role of naturally occurring T regulatory (T-reg) cells in antitumor immunity is well-established, although little is known about their role in modulating the T-cell response to BCR-ABL.;Naturally occurring T-reg cells were characterized and quantified by flow cytometry in 39 CML patients and 10 healthy donors. Their function was studied by observing their effect on responses to purified protein derivative, a recall antigen, and on the response of an autologous T-cell line recognizing BCR-ABL.;T-reg cells were CD4(+), CD25(+), FOXP3(+), CD127(low), and CD62L(high). T-reg numbers in patients in complete cytogenetic remission were significantly lower than in patients not in complete cytogenetic remission (p < 0.01). T-reg cell depletion using anti-CD25 selection enhanced proliferative responses to purified protein derivative. Furthermore, the interferon-γ and/or granzyme-B production of effector cells specific for viral peptides or a BCR-ABL HLA-A3-restricted peptide was inhibited when autologous T-reg cells were present.;Taken together, these data suggest a role for T-reg cells in limiting immune responses in CML patients and this may include immune responses to BCR-ABL.

The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) has improved survival in all phases of CML and is the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase. Despite the very significant therapeutic benefits of IM, a small minority of patients with early stage disease do not benefit optimally while IM therapy in patients with advanced disease is of modest benefit in many. Diverse mechanisms may be responsible for IM failures, with point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain being amongst the most common resistance mechanisms described in patients with advanced CML. The development of novel agents designed to overcome IM resistance, while still primarily targeted on BCR-ABL, led to the creation of the high affinity aminopyrimidine inhibitor, nilotinib. Nilotinib is much more potent as a BCR-ABL inhibitor than IM and inhibits both wild type and IM-resistant BCR-ABL with significant clinical activity across the entire spectrum of BCR-ABL mutants with the exception of T315I. The selection of a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor to rescue patients with imatinib failure will be based on several factors including age, co-morbid medical problems and ABL kinase mutational profile. It should be noted that while the use of targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in CML represents a paradigm shift in CML management these agents are not likely to have activity against the quiescent CML stem cell pool. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pre-clinical and clinical data on nilotinib in patients with CML who have failed prior therapy with IM or dasatinib.",

The exact role of interferon in prolonging the life of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, however, remains to be determined in larger studies of longer duration. Interferon treatment seems to be well tolerated, and the frequency of treatment-limiting toxicity is low. Data to date suggest that interferon alfa may be a new and effective drug for the treatment of the myeloproliferative disorders.",

The changes in bcr/abl gene expression was detected by using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. The results showed that five different concentrations of mangiferin (25 - 200 micromol/L) dose-dependently and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells, and induced apoptosis in K562 cell line. RT-PCR revealed that bcr/abl gene expression was down-regulated when K562 cells had been treated with different concentrations of mangiferin.

To determine the prognostic significance of early Bcr-Abl levels and changes in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), serial samples of 56 patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) ALL treated in phase 2 trials of imatinib were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Imatinib induced a complete hematologic response (CHR) or complete marrow response (marrow-CR) in 40 patients (good responders) and a partial (n = 2) or no (n = 14) remission in the remaining patients (poor responders). Compared with baseline, the median Bcr-Abl/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ratios decreased significantly in PB by 2.65, 2.64, and 3.11 log steps after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and at the time of best response, respectively. In BM, the decline of median Bcr-Abl/GAPDH was 0.75, 1.37, and 2.78 logs, respectively. Thus, Bcr-Abl levels decreased more rapidly in PB than in BM (median time to best level 31 vs 39 days). Low Bcr-Abl/GAPDH ratios below 10(-4) in PB and below 10(-2) in BM after 2 weeks were significantly associated with good responses after 4 weeks.

In chronic myeloid leukemia, changes in the methylation status of the CpG-rich islands at several sites in the proximal ABL1 promoter (Pa) on the Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome have been observed. It remains unclear if the Pa methylation precedes the translocation event (t9;22) that generates the Ph-chromosome or if Pa methylation is a stochastic event in a progenitor cell which will later acquire other mutations, namely t9;22. The present study was conducted to answer two questions: What is the methylation status of Pa in patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD)? Can the study of methylation in patients with Ph-negative MPD shed light on the initial events associated with the translocation? To probe CpG methylation, we used two methodologies; site-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme assay and methylation-specific PCR analysis following modification of genomic DNA by bisulfite. Results showed that 22 of the 97 patients with Ph-negative MPD expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. Seven of the 97 patients possessed methylated Pa, but only 2 of them expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. In some of the patients, Pa methylation was a dynamic event. In conclusion, aberrant methylation in Ph-negative MPD could be an initial event triggering the occurrence of the t9;22 translocation and its clinical expression.

The patient showed a progressive cognitive decline as the main symptom. MRI revealed a hydrocephalus and an increase in cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with around 50% immature blasts in the differential count. A highly elevated BCR-ABL/ ABL ratio was detected in the CSF, whilst the ratio for peripheral blood and bone marrow was not altered. On treatment of the malresorptive hydrocephalus with shunt surgery, the patient showed an initial cognitive improvement, followed by a secondary deterioration. At this time, the cranial MRI showed leukemic infiltration of lateral ventricles walls. Hence, intrathecal administration of cytarabine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone was initiated, which caused a significant decrease of cells in the CSF. Soon after, the patient demonstrated significant cognitive improvement with a good participation in daily activities.

A number of such studies have been published, and now that two inhibitors-dasatinib and nilotinib-are available for the treatment of imatinib-resistant cases, it is tempting for clinicians to reason on the IC₅₀ values to guess, case by case, which one will work best in patients harboring specific Bcr-Abl KD mutations.

These molecular phenomena may occur even in the absence of cytogenetic evidence of the Ph translocation. They are highly specific and sensitive markers for CML, and are presumed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. Surprisingly, we have encountered 11 patients who lacked the Ph translocation, bcr rearrangement, and (in the four patients with available mRNA) a bcr-abl message, and yet had a disease phenotype at diagnosis that was a morphologic facsimile of classic chronic phase CML. These patients presented with high white blood cell counts, neutrophilia, occasional basophilia, splenomegaly, and a hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic hyperplasia and a left shift in myeloid maturation. Despite the striking resemblance between the early stages of bcr-negative and bcr-positive CML, disease progression manifests distinctly in these two disorders. In contrast to the blastic transformation that inevitably complicates bcr-positive CML, the natural history of our 11 Ph-negative, bcr-negative CML patients was characterized by increasing leukemia burden with leukocytosis, pronounced organomegaly, extramedullary infiltrates, and eventual bone marrow failure (anemia and thrombocytopenia) without marked increases in blast cells.

The activities of cellular Abl (c-Abl) and BCR-Abl are stringently regulated and the cellular mechanisms involved in their inactivation are poorly understood. Protein tyrosine phosphatases can negatively regulate Abl mediated signaling by dephosphorylating the kinase and/or its substrates. This study investigated the ability of the intracellular T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP/PTPN2) to dephosphorylate and regulate the functions of BCR-Abl and c-Abl. TCPTP is expressed as two alternately spliced isoforms - TC48 and TC45, which differ in their C-termini and localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus respectively. We show that TC48 dephosphorylates BCR-Abl but not c-Abl and inhibits its activity towards its substrate, CrkII. Y1127 and Y1294 residues whose phosphorylation corresponds with BCR-Abl activation status were the primary sites targeted by TC48. Co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TC48 interacted with BCR-Abl but not with c-Abl, and BCR domain was sufficient for interaction. TC48 expression resulted in the stabilization of Bcr-Abl protein dependent on its phosphatase activity. Inactivation of cellular TC48 in K562 cells by stable expression of a dominant negative catalytically inactive mutant TC48, enhanced proliferation. TC48 expressing K562 clones showed reduced proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to STI571 compared to control clones suggesting that TC48 can repress the growth of CML cells.

The i(17q) hence plays a presumably important pathogenetic role both in leukemia development and progression. This notwithstanding, the molecular consequences of this abnormality have not been investigated in detail. We have analyzed 21 hematologic malignancies (8 CML in blast crisis, 8 myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], 2 acute myeloid leukemias, 2 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia) with i(17q) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig, derived from the short arm of chromosome 17, all cases were shown to have a breakpoint in 17p. In 12 cases, the breaks occurred within the Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) common deletion region in 17p11, a gene-rich region which is genetically unstable. In 10 of these 12 cases, we were able to further map the breakpoints to specific markers localized within a single YAC clone. Six other cases showed breakpoints located proximally to the SMS common deletion region, but still within 17p11, and yet another case had a breakpoint distal to this region. Furthermore, using chromosome 17 centromere-specific probes, it could be shown that the majority of the i(17q) chromosomes (11 of 15 investigated cases) were dicentric, ie, they contained two centromeres, strongly suggesting that i(17q) is formed through an intrachromosomal recombination event, and also implicating that the i(17q), in a formal sense, should be designated idic(17)(p11). Because i(17q) formation results in loss of 17p material, potentially uncovering the effect of a tumor suppressor on the remaining 17p, the occurrence of TP53 mutations was studied in 17 cases by sequencing the entire coding region. In 16 cases, no TP53 mutations were found, whereas one MDS displayed a homozygous deletion of TP53. Thus, our data suggest that there is no association between i(17q) and coding TP53 mutations, and that another tumor suppressor gene(s), located in proximity of the SMS common deletion region, or in a more distal location, is of pathogenetic importance in i(17q)-associated leukemia.",

This report presents the case of a patient with a post-transplant persistent positive BCR/ABL value, who was treated with imatinib and dasatinib before a second allo-HSCT. The patient started taking nilotinib due to a persistent BCR/ABL value and residual mass in her ovaries after a second allo-HSCT. Nine months after introducing nilotinib, the patient achieved complete molecular remission, and despite the continued existence of the residual ovary mass, no hot spot was found in her positron emission tomography scan.

In a murine retroviral bone marrow transduction-transplantation model, a Tel (exon 1-5)-Abl fusion protein induced 2 distinct illnesses: a CML-like myeloproliferative disease very similar to that induced by Bcr-Abl but with increased latency and a novel syndrome characterized by small-bowel myeloid cell infiltration and necrosis, increased circulating endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, and fulminant hepatic and renal failure. Induction of both diseases required the Tel pointed homology oligomerization domain and Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Myeloid cells from mice with both diseases expressed Tel-Abl protein. CML-like disease induced by Tel-Abl and Bcr-Abl was polyclonal and originated from cells with multilineage (myeloid, erythroid, and B- and T-lymphoid) repopulating ability and the capacity to generate day-12 spleen colonies in secondary transplantations. In contrast to findings with Bcr-Abl, however, neither Tel-Abl-induced disease could be adoptively transferred to irradiated secondary recipient syngeneic mice.

The genetic phenotype of myeloid leukemic K562 cells includes the suppression of cytosolic sialidase Neu2. Neu2 transfection in K562 cells induced a marked decrease (-30% and -80%) of the mRNA of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, respectively, and an almost total disappearance of Bcl-2 protein. In addition, gene expression and activity of Bcr-Abl underwent a 35% diminution, together with a marked decrease of Bcr-Abl-dependent Src and Lyn kinase activity. Thus, the antiapoptotic axis Bcr-Abl, Src, and Lyn, which stimulates the formation of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, was remarkably weakened. The ultimate consequences of these modifications were an increased susceptibility to apoptosis of K562 cells and a marked reduction of their proliferation rate. The molecular link between Neu2 activity and Bcr-Abl signaling pathway may rely on the desialylation of some cytosolic glycoproteins. In fact, three cytosolic glycoproteins, in the range 45-66 kDa, showed a 50-70% decrease of their sialic acid content upon Neu2 expression, supporting their possible role as modulators of the Bcr-Abl complex.",

In the present study, using Bcr-Abl-transfected BaF murine cells, LAMA84 human CML cell line and primary CML, we show that NF-kappaB is active downstream of Bcr-Abl. Pharmacological blockade of NF-kappaB by the IKK2 inhibitor AS602868 prevented survival of BaF cells expressing either wild-type, M351T or T315I imatinib-resistant mutant forms of Bcr-Abl both in vitro and in vivo using a mouse xenograft model.

Importantly, the IKK2 inhibitor strongly decreased in vitro survival and ability to form hematopoietic colonies of primary imatinib resistant CML cells including T315I cells. Our data strongly support the targeting of NF-kappaB as a promising new therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of imatinib resistant CML patients in particular in the case of T315I patients. The T315I mutation escapes all currently used Bcr-Abl inhibitors and is likely to become a major clinical problem as it is associated with a poor clinical outcome.",

Using data from the William Beaumont laboratory data registry, we conducted a retrospective review of all the orders for BCR-ABL tests sent to the clinical pathology laboratory between March 11, 2014 and September 12, 2014.

A series of hammerhead ribozymes targeted to a b3a2 bcr-abl transcript has been developed and previously shown to be capable of cleaving the desired sequence with varying degrees of specificity. This study investigated the ex vivo effects of endogenous expression of these ribozymes in a CML cell line, K562.

Phenotypic analysis of this clone also revealed a 63% decrease in colony-forming ability and a 43% inhibition of cell proliferation following ribozyme expression. Morphologic analysis of cells showed there was a slight increase (2.5% to 15%) in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis.

BCR/ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase influencing cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. To what extent and by which mechanism BCR/ABL affects the adhesion of leukemic cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) is controversial. To characterize adhesion of BCR/ABL-transformed 32D cells (32D-BCR/ABL) to the BMSC line M2-10B4, we used washing assays and single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS). Compared to control 32D cells (32D-V), 32D-BCR/ABL developed threefold higher adhesion forces. This enhanced cell adhesion could be reduced to control levels after specifically inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine kinase BCR/ABL using imatinib mesylate (IM). SCFS showed that the adhesion forces of 32D-BCR/ABL were strongest to fibronectin and collagen type I, suggesting that beta1-integrin has a major role in mediating the adhesion of leukemic cells to BMSC. Indeed, the beta1-integrin blocking antibody Ha2/5 abrogated the attachment of 32D-V and 32D-BCR/ABL cells to BMSC. Although 32D-BCR/ABL cells show significantly increased beta1-integrin expression, no significant difference of beta1-integrin mRNA levels could be detected, indicating a post-transcriptional regulation of beta1-comprising integrin heterodimers by BCR/ABL. The data presented here argue that the interaction of beta1-integrin and extracellular matrix components is functionally important in leukemic cells expressing high-levels of BCR/ABL, and could provide a rationale for the development of optimized targeted therapies.",

This phase is followed after 4-6 years by rapid progression, an accelerated phase, and consequently a fatal acute leukemia a blast crisis. The hallmark abnormality of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome that generates a BCR-ABL fusion gene, resulting in the expression of a leukemia-specific oncoprotein, Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl is a potent tyrosine kinase and plays a central role in CML pathogenesis. Recently, the treatment of CML has been revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate(IM). With daily IM treatment, more than 80% of chronic-phase CML patients achieve a complete cytogenetic response. Nevertheless, a small percentage of CML patients are primarily refractory or acquire secondary resistance against IM. Nilotinib is a highly selective Abl kinase inhibitor that possesses greater potency and selectivity for Abl kinase than IM. In addition to being more potent than IM against wild-type BCR-ABL, nilotinib is significantly active against many IM-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. In preclinical studies, nilotinib has produced hematologic and cytogenetic responses in CML patients, with either IM resistance or IM intolerance. As second-line treatment, both nilotinib and dasatinib may be used in case of suboptimal response or failure, which is defined in the efficacy criteria of the European Leukemia Net Consensus. The choice of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be made after the mutation analyses of the kinase domain. It is recommended that nilotinib or dasatinib whichever was shown to be active against the specific mutation, should be chosen for treatment. For patients with no mutations or patients with IM intolerance, it is recommended that either second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor be chosen, based on the patient's disease history.",

Using inducible expression and knockdown systems, we analyzed the role of Gab2 in Bcr-Abl signaling in human CML cells, especially with respect to TKI sensitivity. We show for the first time that Gab2 signaling protects CML cells from various Bcr-Abl inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and GNF-2), whereas Gab2 knockdown or haploinsufficiency leads to increased TKI sensitivity. We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. The identification of Gab2 as a novel modulator of TKI sensitivity in CML suggests that Gab2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease.",

Therefore, we sought to investigate the applicability of the PAXgene system for bone marrow samples in CML.;Simultaneously stabilized blood and bone marrow samples were obtained from 55 imatinib-resistant CML patients to compare RNA yield and purity, expression of two housekeeping genes (total ABL and beta-glucuronidase; GUS) by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, BCR-ABL expression (ratios BCR-ABL/ABL and BCR-ABL/GUS), and BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing.;RNA extraction revealed high-quality RNA derived from both stabilized blood and bone marrow samples. RNA yield was significantly higher in bone marrow (median 9.9 microg RNA/mL bone marrow) than in blood (median 4.3 microg RNA/mL blood) (p=0.0005). The number of housekeeping gene transcripts was comparable in blood and bone marrow (median ABL copies/2 microL cDNA 13,260 vs. 25,590; median GUS copies/2 microL cDNA 35,490 vs. 60,200; n.s.). Further, ratios BCR-ABL/ABL (blood vs. bone marrow, median 47% vs. 57%) and ratios BCR-ABL/GUS (blood vs. bone marrow, median 26% vs. 21%) were not significantly different. Results of mutation analysis corresponded in 51 out of 55 patients (93%), whereas moderate differences were observed in four patients.;We conclude that bone marrow can be effectively stabilized using the PAXgene system and shows concordance with blood in terms of BCR-ABL mRNA quantification and mutation analysis in imatinib-resistant CML patients.",

The translocation (9;22) in CML-N results in the transcription of an e19/a2 type BCR/ABL mRNA that codes for a 230-kD BCR/ABL protein (p230). The indolence of the clinical course of patients with CML-N has been disputed.;The objectives of this study were to quantify and correlate with clinical outcome the p230 mRNA and protein in patients with CML-N, to describe six new patients and the follow-up (with molecular analysis) of five previously reported patients with CML-N, and to review characteristics of all patients with CML-N and p230 BCR/ABL reported to date in the literature.;Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays on specimens from the great majority of patients with CML-N revealed minimal numbers of molecules of p230 BCR/ABL transcripts per total RNA. This also was associated with a lack of detectable p230 BCR/ABL protein in patient specimens, even in one patient who was followed for 16 years after diagnosis. This may explain the milder leukemic phenotype in most patients with CML-N. A review of all 23 patients who had an e19/a2 type BCR/ABL translocation suggested that the low level of p230 BCR/ABL mRNA and the lack of detectable p230 BCR/ABL protein in patients with no additional cytogenetic abnormalities may predict their indolent clinical course.;Patients with p230 positive CML-N have indolent course, probably as a result of low p230 mRNA and protein levels. This supports the need to conduct additional molecular studies, even if cytogenetic studies have revealed t(9;22), because of the prognostic importance of the molecular findings.",

We report on two patients with Ph+ ALL who were successfully treated with polychemotherapy and consecutive autologous HSCT. Both patients are in continuous hematologic remission after an observation period of 12 years and 18 years, respectively, despite measurable MRD and although no maintenance therapy was initiated. BCR/ABL transcript-levels ranged between 0.1 and 3% in patient 1, and 0.01 and 0.1% in patient 2 during the observation time. Collectively, these data suggest that not all Ph+ subclones even those that persist after HSCT in Ph+ ALL, may have the potential to cause a hematologic relapse.

Ninety-three patients had evaluable PCR assays for both the p190bcr-abl and p210bcr-abl type of BCR-ABL gene rearrangements. Twenty-one of 93 patients (23%) were positive for the BCR-ABL rearrangement by the PCR assay. Fourteen of these patients had the p210brc-abl BCR-ABL rearrangement characteristically seen in CML patients, while seven had the p190bcr-abl rearrangement seen in ALL alone. Of 61 patients analyzed, both with conventional cytogenetics and PCR, eight (13%) were positive for the Ph1, while 14 (23%) were positive for the BCR-ABL rearrangement by the PCR assay. Discordance between the PCR assay and cytogenetics occurred in eight cases where the PCR assay was positive and the cytogenetics negative, and two cases where the PCR assay was negative and cytogenetics positive. PCR positivity did not correlate with treatment response, survival, or relapse-free survival, but there was a higher percentage of L2 FAB morphology in the PCR+ cases compared to the PCR-cases (67 vs. 28%, p = 0.003). In addition, the data suggested that patients with a p190bcr-abl rearrangement have a better response to induction therapy, but a worse relapse-free survival compared to patients with a p210bcr-abl breakpoint, but these differences were not statistically significant. These data suggest that PCR and conventional cytogenetics may provide complementary information, since there appear to be a subset of patients who are Ph1-negative yet BCR-ABL positive by PCR.

Using targeted approaches against components of the superoxide-producing NADPH-oxidases, including NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), NOX4 and the common p22(phox) subunit of NOX1-4, myeloid cells were found to display reduced cell growth and spontaneous migration. Consistent with a role of NOXs as regulators of membrane proximal signaling events in nonphagocytic cells, NOX2 and NOX4 were not involved in the excess production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and did not significantly increase oxygen consumption. All NOX family members are controlled in part through levels of the rate-limiting substrate NADPH, which was found to be significantly elevated in TKO-transformed cells. Also, reduced phosphorylation of the actin filament crosslinking protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) in response to suppression of p22(phox) hints at a novel effector of NOX signaling. MARCKS was also found to be required for increased migration. Overall, these data suggest a model whereby NOX links metabolic NADPH production to cellular events that directly contribute to transformation.",

Seven patients were studied at diagnosis and during follow-up after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas two were evaluated only after HSCT. The PCR reaction was carried out in capillary tubes in a final volume of 10 microL, using 2 microL cDNA, the Mensik et al. primers, and two HybProbes. The results for BCR-ABL were normalized with reference to ABL. The PCR program is completed in only 45 min.;The sensitivity attained allowed the detection of rearrangements at dilutions of between 5-10(-4) and 10(-5) K562 cDNA. The within-assay coefficient of variation was 11% for BCR-ABL, and 9% for ABL.

Since there is limited information on the distribution of clinico-biological variables in different age cohorts, we analyzed 5202 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Italian multicenter AIEOP and GIMEMA protocols and stratified them in nine age cohorts. The highest prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was observed in children, although a second peak was recorded from the 4(th) decade onwards. Interestingly, the lowest incidence was found in females between 14-40 years. Immunophenotypic characterization showed a B-lineage in 85.8% of patients: a pro-B stage, associated with MLL/AF4 positivity, was more frequent in patients between 10-50 years. T-lineage leukemia (14.2%) was rare among small children and increased in patients aged 10-40 years. The prevalence of the BCR/ABL1 rearrangement increased progressively with age starting from the cohort of patients 10-14 years old and was present in 52.7% of cases in the 6th decade. Similarly, the MLL/AF4 rearrangement constantly increased up to the 5(th) decade, while the ETV6/RUNX1 rearrangement disappeared from the age of 30 onwards. This study shows that acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults is characterized by a male prevalence, higher percentage of T-lineage cases, an increase of poor prognostic molecular markers with aging compared to cases in children, and conclusively quantified the progressive increase of BCR/ABL(+) cases with age, which are potentially manageable by targeted therapies.

According to our previous observations, in vitro differentiation of several erythroid cell lines is accompanied by the downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities. In this work we investigated whether ERKs have a decisive role in either the erythroid differentiation process or apoptosis of bcr-abl+ K562 cells by means of direct (MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126) and indirect (reduced Bcr-Abl function) inhibition of their activities. We found that both Gleevec and UO126 induced hemoglobin expression. Gleevec treatment reduced the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl, ERK and STAT-5 for up to 24 h, decreased Bcl-XL levels, and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, UO126 treatment resulted in only a transient decrease of ERK activity and did not induce cell death. For studying the effect of reduced Bcr-Abl function on erythroid differentiation at the level of the bcr-abl transcript, we applied the siRNA approach. Stable degradation of bcr-abl mRNA was achieved by using a retroviral vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter. Despite a high (>90%) transduction efficiency we detected only a transient decrease in Bcr-Abl protein and in phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. This transient change in Bcr-Abl signaling was sufficient to induce hemoglobin expression without significant cell death. These results suggest that by transiently reducing Bcr-Abl function it is possible to overcome the differentiation blockade without evoking apoptosis in CML cells and that reduced ERK activity may have a crucial role in this process.",

In particular, while CML progenitor cells and differentiated cells are oncogene addicted, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is dispensable for CML LSC survival and maintenance. Notably, in CML, additional cellular mechanisms promote LSC survival and maintenance, rendering these cells able to survive even in the presence of TKI and to eventually promote relapse.;This review will focus on the mechanisms of LSC insensitivity to TKI and on the strategies to obtain synthetic lethality with combination therapies.;Several pathways have been proposed to promote LSC maintenance and described as ideal targets to induce CML LSC exhaustion in combination with TKI.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm, characterized by the unrestrained expansion of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. CML was the first malignancy in which a unique chromosomal abnormality was identified and a pathophysiologic association was suggested. The hallmark of CML is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9; 22)(q34; q11), creating a derivative 9q+ and a shortened 22q-. The latter, known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, harbors the breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) fusion gene, encoding the constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that is necessary and sufficient for initiating CML. The successful implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of CML remains a flagship for molecularly targeted therapy in cancer. TKIs have changed the clinical course of CML; however, some patients nonetheless demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to such therapy and require an alternative therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the assessment of early response to treatment with TKIs has become an important tool in the clinical monitoring of CML patients. Although mutations in the BCR-ABL have proven to be the most prominent mechanism of resistance to TKIs, other mechanisms-either rendering the leukemic cells still dependent on BCR-ABL activity or supporting oncogenic properties of the leukemic cells independent of BCR-ABL signaling-have been identified. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of CML pathogenesis; recommendations for diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and management guidelines; and highlights the BCR-ABL-dependent and -independent mechanisms that contribute to the development of resistance to TKIs.

The results showed that among 49 newly diagnosed cases considered as CMPD, 28 cases met the criterion of CML morphologically, out of them 23 cases were eventually diagnosed to be CML and with morphological consistent rate 82.1% (23/28), the sensitivity and specificity all were 100% (23/23). The BCR/ABL positive rate of eventually diagnosed cases was 81.3% ± 17.7%. Among 13 cases received allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), 9 cases achieved long-term disease-free survival and 4 cases relapsed, the several monitoring for whom after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and imatinib treatment or allo-HSCT showed BCR/ABL negative. Among 16 cases treated with imatinib, 11 cases remained BCR/ABL negative after 1 year; 5 cases showed BCR/ABL positive during 6, 7 and 10 years after treatment, respectively, but out of them BCR/ABL positive in 1 case turned negative after allo-HSCT. It is concluded that the FISH is sensitive and specific diagnostic technique, the detection of BCR/ABL fusion gene in newly diagnosed and treated cases by using 2 different probes can help to fast and accurately determine the differential diagnosis for CML and Ph(+) ALL, and dynamically monitor the MRD after treatment with imatinib and allo-HSCT.",

These observations indicate that TKI-insensitive LSCs and TKI-sensitive leukemic progenitor cells are biologically different, which leads us to believe that LSCs and more differentiated leukemic cells have different genetic mechanisms. Further study of LSCs to identify the novel gene signatures and mechanisms that control the function and molecular phenotype of LSCs is critical. In this mini-review, we will discuss our current understanding of the biology of LSCs and novel genes that could serve as a molecular signature of LSCs in CML.

Samples from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood or both were analyzed by conventional cytogenetics, Southern blot, fluorescent interphase in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). In all patients, FISH detected 1% to 12% nuclei with a BCR-ABL fusion gene, whereas Q-RT-PCR were negative or weakly positive. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the BCR-ABL genomic rearrangement remains unexpressed in a small percentage of cells whatever the treatment (IFN-alpha or BMT), and this in spite of the negativity of the RT-PCR-based classical molecular remission criterion. These data corroborate those obtained by other investigators and point to the need for follow-up of CML patients in CCR over an extensive period, at the DNA level to evaluate the residual disease and at the RNA level (Q-RT-PCR) to estimate the risk of relapse and guide the therapeutic decision.

The results showed that the mean detectable rate of bcr/abl fusion gene before and after IFN-alpha therapy was 96.4% and 58.6% respectively, in 22 patients who were bcr/abl-positive before IFN-alpha therapy by D-FISH method, was 94.0% and 70.1% respectively, in 2 patients of Ph-negative before treatment. Major, minor and no responses were seen respectively in 4, 4 and 14 cases from 22 patients by D-FISH method. The results also showed a good correlation with the analysis of RT-PCR and conventional cytogenetics. In conclusion, D-FISH method could directly detect the bcr/abl fusion gene of the interphase cells in bone marrow of patients with CML. It can overcome the defect of conventional cytogenetic methods which analyze only the cells in metaphase and the drawback of RT-PCR unable to quantify the bcr/abl fusion gene.

Morphometric analysis confirmed the significant decrease in the number of micromegakaryocytes and yielded planimetric parameters in keeping with normalization. Moreover, a fluorescence in-situ hybridization study in five patients of this cohort revealed that before therapy 70% of all myeloid cells exhibited the bcr/abl gene. Regarding megakaryopoiesis about 65% of the micromegakaryocytes displayed positive signals.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were applied to stratify our samples based on given gene lists reported to predict MLL, BCR-ABL, and T-ALL, as well as MLL and non-MLL gene rearrangement positive pediatric ALL. In addition, seven other B-precursor ALL cases not bearing t(9;22) or t(11q23)/MLL chromosomal aberrations were analyzed. Using top differentially expressed genes, hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses demonstrate that the genetically more heterogeneous B-precursor ALL samples intercalate with BCR-ABL-positive cases, but were clearly distinct from T-ALL and MLL profiles. Similar expression signatures were observed for both heterogeneous B-precursor ALL and for BCR-ABL-positive cases. As an unrelated laboratory, we demonstrate that gene signatures defined for childhood ALL were also capable of stratifying distinct subtypes in our cohort of adult ALL patients.

BCR-ABL-induced acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia was also eradicated by DLI in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched chimeras. Most DLI-treated mice converted to full allogeneic chimerism but succumbed frequently to GvHD or graft failure. When MHC-matched B10.D2 (H-2(d)) mice were the allogeneic donors, CML-like disease was more resistant to DLI.

Using mouse genetics and a BCR-ABL model of CML, we observed cross talk between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the interferon-regulatory factor 8 (Irf8). In normal hematopoiesis, activation of β-catenin results in up-regulation of Irf8, which in turn limits oncogenic β-catenin functions. Self-renewal and myeloproliferation become dependent on β-catenin in Irf8-deficient animals that develop a CML-like disease. Combined Irf8 deletion and constitutive β-catenin activation result in progression of CML into fatal blast crisis, elevated leukemic potential of BCR-ABL-induced LICs, and Imatinib resistance. Interestingly, activated β-catenin enhances a preexisting Irf8-deficient gene signature, identifying β-catenin as an amplifier of progression-specific gene regulation in the shift of CML to blast crisis. Collectively, our data uncover Irf8 as a roadblock for β-catenin-driven leukemia and imply both factors as targets in combinatorial therapy. ",

Using a mouse mast cell line (IC.DP), we previously showed that v-Abl PTK induced resistance to the anti-cancer drugs melphalan and hydroxyurea by the suppression of apoptosis. Here, using this cell line, we demonstrate by alkaline elution that v-Abl PTK did not affect the levels of DNA damage induced by either drug. This confirms that v-Abl PTK acts downstream of the drug-target interaction to prevent the coupling of drug-induced damage to the apoptotic pathway. Although Abl PTK- and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-stimulated signaling events share common signaling pathways, a similar level of drug resistance was not provided by IL-3, implying that Abl PTK does not merely mimic an IL-3 survival signaling pathway. Previously we demonstrated translocation of protein kinase C-beta II stimulated by activation of Abl PTK. Drug sensitivity was restored in cells with active v-Abl PTK by simultaneous addition of calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in the suppression of drug-induced apoptosis by v-Abl PTK. One novel strategy for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia could therefore include the use of a downstream modifier of the Abl PTK-mediated survival signaling pathway to render leukemic cells more sensitive to a second drug, such as a cytotoxic agent.",

Thus, the efficient delivery of target gene-specific siRNAs is one major challenge in the establishment of therapeutic RNAi. Here we show that in vivo application of targeted nonvirally delivered synthetic bcr-abl siRNA in a female patient with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to imatinib (Y253F mutation) and chemotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can silence the expression of bcr-abl gene. We found a remarkable inhibition of the overexpressed bcr-abl oncogene resulting in increased apoptosis of CML cells.

To investigate the role of the coiled-coil domain and Tyr177 in promoting CML, 4 P210 bcr/abl-derived mutants containing different bcr domains fused to abl were constructed. All 4 mutants, Delta(1-63) bcr/abl, (1-63) bcr/abl, Tyr177Phe bcr/abl, and (1-210) bcr/abl exhibited elevated tyrosine kinase activity and conferred factor-independent growth in cell lines. In contrast, differences in the transforming potential of the 4 mutants occurred in our mouse model, in which all mice receiving P210 bcr/abl-expressing bone marrow cells exclusively develop a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) resembling human CML. Of the 4 mutants assayed, only 1-210 bcr/abl, containing both the coiled-coil domain and Tyr177, induced MPD. Unlike full-length P210, this mutant also caused a simultaneous B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The other 3 mutants, (1-63) bcr/abl, Tyr177Phe bcr/abl, and Delta(1-63) bcr/abl, failed to induce an MPD but instead caused T-cell ALL.

CML and normal progenitors were cultured with SKI-606 or imatinib. SKI-606 effectively inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity in CML CD34(+) cells and inhibited Src phosphorylation more potently than imatinib. However, SKI-606 and imatinib resulted in similar suppression of CML primitive and committed progenitor proliferation and growth in CFC and LTC-IC assays. Exposure to either agent alone or in combination resulted in only modest increase in apoptosis. Evaluation of downstream signaling pathways indicated that Akt and STAT5 activity was not changed, but a delayed increase in MAPK activity was seen at high concentrations of SKI-606. SKI-606 inhibited normal progenitor proliferation to a lesser extent than imatinib. SKI-606 effectively inhibits Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activity and inhibits CML progenitor growth with relatively little effect on normal progenitors.

Here, we report the identification of a novel 2-phenyloxypyrimidine compound TGI1002 to specifically disrupt SET-PP2A interaction. By binding to SET, TGI1002 inhibits SET-PP2A interaction and increases PP2A activity. In addition, knocking-down SET expression decreases tumor cell sensitivity to TGI1002. TGI1002 treatments also markedly increase dephosphorylation of BCR-ABL. Moreover, TGI1002 significantly inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival of xenografted mice implanted with BaF3-p210T315I cells.

Seven patients treated in late CP and three patients treated in the accelerated phase were included for comparison. Blood samples were collected before and every third month during imatinib therapy. Mutations were not seen in any blood sample collected before start of therapy. During imatinib treatment, 2 of the 30 early CP patients acquired point mutations and both of them had other signs of imatinib resistance.

Likewise, none of 12 early CP patients with detectable BCR-ABL transcripts but in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission at 12 months displayed any mutation. We conclude that screening early CP patients for BCR-ABL mutations before start of imatinib therapy is not cost-effective.

The protein breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1)-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a deubiquitinase interacting with the DNA repair regulator BRCA1 and is frequently inactivated in many cancers. Here, we report that BAP1 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in a BCR-ABL1-expressing hematopoietic cell line (UT-7/11). A decrease of BAP1 transcripts is also observed in newly diagnosed CML patients. Moreover, BAP1 protein levels are low or undetectable in CD34(+) cells from CML patients at diagnosis as compared with CD34(+) cells from normal donors. In addition, BRCA1 protein level is reduced in BCR-ABL1-expressing UT-7/11 cells. Finally, the enforced expression of BAP1 is associated with BRCA1 protein deubiquitination and restoration. These results demonstrate BAP1 as a major link with the BCR-ABL-induced downregulation of BRCA1 in CML.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There is remarkable recent progress in our understanding of the biology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). First, the BCR/ABL rearrangement was identified as the molecular basis of the disease. Second, animal models support the notion that the BCR/ABL gene product causes a syndrome similar to CML. Third, recent advances in understanding the functions of the normal ABL protein have given clues to the mechanism(s) of ABL-induced leukemias and approaches to blocking this process. Extrapolating these findings to humans seems reasonable. The challenge now is to determine how the BCR/ABL gene product causes chronic phase CML. Also unresolved is whether BCR/ABL also plays a role in the acute phase of the disease. Finally, the relationship between the two common forms of BCR/ABL, the P190 and P210 configurations, and different disease phenotypes, like CML and Philadelphia (Ph1)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), needs to be clarified. There is also substantial progress in treating CML. Bone marrow transplants have emerged as the preferred therapy. These result in long-term leukemia-free survival in more than one-half of appropriately selected subjects. How transplants cure CML is complex and controversial. Some data suggest high-dose treatment is the dominant factor whereas other data implicate antileukemia effects of the immune system. Interferon treatment has also proven effective in CML. Whether it prolongs survival of persons with CML remains to be determined, as does its mechanism of action. Certainly the most important and difficult challenge in CML therapy is determining how to use knowledge about the causes CML to treat the disease. These and other issues in the biology and therapy of CML were the subject of a recent meeting of basic and clinical scientists. The meeting, third in a series begun in 1987, was held on Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 4-7 April, 1992. Four major topics were considered in five sessions: molecular biology, cell biology, Ph1-chromosome positive ALL, and therapy of CML. This report summarizes meeting highlights.",

Elimination of BCR/ABL-dependent intracellular signals triggers apoptosis, but it is unclear whether this activates additional cell survival and/or death pathways. We have shown here that IM induces autophagy in CML blast crisis cell lines, CML primary cells, and p210BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid precursor cells. IM-induced autophagy did not involve c-Abl or Bcl-2 activity but was associated with ER stress and was suppressed by depletion of intracellular Ca2+, suggesting it is mechanistically nonoverlapping with IM-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that suppression of autophagy using either pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference of essential autophagy genes enhanced cell death induced by IM in cell lines and primary CML cells. Critically, the combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), i.e., IM, nilotinib, or dasatinib, with inhibitors of autophagy resulted in near complete elimination of phenotypically and functionally defined CML stem cells. Together, these findings suggest that autophagy inhibitors may enhance the therapeutic effects of TKIs in the treatment of CML.",

Preclinical data indicate that dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl, and that dasatinib is active against 18 of 19 Bcr-Abl mutations known to cause imatinib resistance. Phase I clinical data show that dasatinib is well tolerated and highly effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism of action of dasatinib is not fully understood. In this study, we confirm that dasatinib inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of SFKs, including Src, Hck, and Lyn, in K562 human CML cells. Significantly, downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) signaling is also blocked by dasatinib as shown by decreases in levels of phosphorylated Stat5 and Stat5 DNA-binding activities. In addition, dasatinib down-regulates expression of Stat5 target genes, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and cyclin D1. Consistent with these results, blockade of Stat5 signaling by dasatinib is accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, Stat5 DNA-binding activities are enhanced with increasing cell density, which is associated with resistance to apoptosis by dasatinib. Our findings indicate that inhibition of Stat5 signaling downstream of Bcr-Abl/SFKs contributes to the action of dasatinib, and, conversely, that increasing cell density up-regulates Stat5 activation and confers resistance to dasatinib. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated Stat5 in CML cells represents a mechanistically relevant biomarker for monitoring inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling by dasatinib in CML patients using convenient immunocytochemical assays.",

The results showed that persistent full donor chimerism (DC >/= 95%) was associated with an absence of MRD. All patients with stable MC (90% </= DC < 95%) and bcr/abl negative had a probability of long-term survival with molecular remission, however the result of bcr/abl positivity was not always associated with leukemia relapse, only the patient with decreasing values of donor chimerism as well as bcr/abl positive proved to be in a higher risk of relapse or graft failure. Decrease of donor chimerism in correlation with MRD positive was detected in 5 patients. Three out of five patients had been proved to have a molecular relapse, one out of five patients had developed to cytogenetic relapse and another patient experienced graft failure. It is concluded that the results of STR-PCR in the range of its sensitivity fully correspond with bcr/abl tests in patients.

Relevant articles were identified through searches of PubMed and abstracts from international hematology/oncology congresses. Additional information sources were identified from the bibliographies of these references and from the authors' own libraries and expertise. In vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ) data alone are not sufficient to guide the choice of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the presence of a mutant breakpoint cluster region-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL) clone, because there is a lack of data regarding how well such IC(50) values correlate with clinical response. A small subset of BCR-ABL mutant clones have been associated with impaired responses to second-generation TKIs (tyrosine to histidine mutation at codon 253 [Y253H], glutamic acid to lysine or valine mutation at codon 255 [E255K/V], and phenylalanine to cysteine or valine mutation at codon 359 [F359C/V] for nilotinib; valine to leucine mutation at codon 299 [V299L] and F317L for dasatinib); neither nilotinib nor dasatinib is active against the threonine to isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I). For each second-generation TKI, the detection of 1 of a small subset of mutations at the time of resistance may be helpful in the selection of second-line therapy [corrected]. For the majority of patients, comorbidities and drug safety profiles should be the basis for choosing a second-line agent. Clinical trial data from an evaluation of the response of specific mutant BCR-ABL clones to TKIs is needed to establish the role of mutation testing in the management of CML.",

Since the fusion or mutation of tyrosine kinase is a primary and central event in chronic myeloproliferative diseases, targeting the kinase activity has been thought to be an ideal intervention to treat these diseases. The clinical success of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia has made this idea a reality, and has accelerated the development of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

The development of the Bcr-Abl-targeted imatinib represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of CML, because treatment with imatinib resulted in significantly better patient outcome, response rates, and overall survival compared with previous standards. Despite this advance, not all patients benefit from imatinib because of resistance and intolerance. Resistance to imatinib can develop from a number of mechanisms that can be defined as Bcr-Abl-dependent (e.g., most commonly resulting from point mutations in the Abl kinase domain) and Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms (including the constitutive activation of downstream signaling molecules, e.g., Src family kinases), which could result in the activation of the pathway regardless of Bcr-Abl inhibition. Clearly, new treatment approaches are required for patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib, which can be dose escalated in patients who demonstrate resistance. This does not result in long-term responses. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is limited by the availability of matched donors and the potential for morbidity. Dasatinib, a dual Bcr-Abl/Src kinase inhibitor, has shown efficacy against all imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutations except for T315I. A large trial program showed that dasatinib is effective in patients previously exposed to imatinib and has a manageable safety profile in all phases of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resulting in its approval.

The present work aimed at the development and application of transferrin receptor (TrfR) targeted liposomes co-encapsulating anti-BCR-ABL siRNA and imatinib at different molar ratios. The encapsulation yields and drug loading of each molecule was evaluated. Anti-leukemia activity of the developed formulations co-encapsulating siRNA and imatinib and of the combination of Trf-liposomes carrying siRNA and free imatinib under two different treatment schedules of pre-sensitization was assessed. The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of imatinib significantly decreases the encapsulation yields of siRNA, whereas imatinib encapsulation yields are increased by the presence of siRNA. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrate that the formulations co-encapsulating siRNA and imatinib promote a 3.84-fold reduction on the imatinib IC(50) (from 3.49 to 0.91 µM), whereas a 8.71-fold reduction was observed for the pre-sensitization protocols (from 42.7 to 4.9 nM). It was also observed that the formulations with higher siRNA to imatinib molar ratios promote higher cell toxicity.

A fraction of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases carry the translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) which juxtaposes the ABL proto-oncogene to the BCR gene generating a chimeric gene, BCR/ABL. This aberration is more frequent in adult ALL (20%-40%) than in pediatric ALL (<5%), and predicts poor clinical outcome. AIM OF OUR WORK: Is to study BCR/ABL fusion gene in ALL cases using fluorescent in situ hybridization.;Twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients, 16 adult and 4 paediatric cases, were included in the study, 11 cases (55%) were of precursor B phenotype, 8 cases (40%) belonged to T lineage, while one case was biphenotypic expressing mainly precursor B cell markers tether with CD13, CD33, CD117, Detection of BCR/ABL fusion gene was done using interphase FISH technique and was confirmed molecularly using the RT-PCR technique.;BCR/ABL fusion gene was negative in all the examined cases, yet abnormality involving 9q34, ABL gene, either by addition or deletion was detected in three cases (15%). Two of these cases were associated with BCR gene extra copies (three and four copies, respectively).;This may reflect the frequency of association of ABL gene and BCR gene abnormality in our cases, and that absence of fusion gene BCR/ABL does not exclude their role in the leukomogenic process, yet a larger study is required to confirm and detect the prevalence of these gene disturbances in ALL and their association.",

A phase I/II study was conducted in Japanese patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or relapsed/refractory Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thirty-four patients were treated with nilotinib for up to 36 months. Major cytogenetic response was achieved in 15/16 patients (93.8%) with chronic-phase CML within a median of approximately 3 months. Major molecular response was achieved in 13/16 patients (81.3%). These responses were sustained at the time of the most recent evaluation in 13 patients and 11 patients, respectively. Hematologic and cytogenetic responses were also observed in patients with advanced CML. The BCR-ABL mutation associated with the most resistance to available TKIs, T315I, was observed in three patients. Common adverse events included rash, nasopharyngitis, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, headache and vomiting.

Here, we use lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) targeting BCR-ABL and the downstream signaling molecules SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 to compare the efficacy and specificity of molecularly defined therapeutics with that of conventional cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide) in a conditional BCR-ABL cell culture model. IC(50) values were determined for each drug in TonB cells cultured either with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or BCR-ABL, and molecularly defined therapies were studied using lentivirally expressed shRNAs. We demonstrate that conventional anti-leukemic drugs have small or no differential effects under different cell culture conditions, whereas both imatinib and specific RNAi significantly inhibit proliferation of TonB cells in the presence of BCR-ABL but not IL-3. To study molecularly defined combination therapy, we evaluated either imatinib in TonB cells with target-specific RNAi or we used lentiviral vectors to induce combinatorial RNAi through simultaneous expression of two shRNAs. These combination therapies result in increased efficacy without loss in specificity. Interestingly, combinatorial RNAi can specifically deplete TonB cell cultures in the presence of BCR-ABL, even without targeting the oncogene itself. This model provides a tool to evaluate potential therapeutic targets and to quantify efficacy and specificity preclinically of new combination therapies in BCR-ABL-positive cells.",

However, to combat acquired resistance to imatinib, an alternative approach is to decrease the expression of the addicted gene to efficiently kill resistant malignant hematologic cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the strategy of shutting down the transcription and expression of FIP1-like-1 (FIP1L1)-PDGFRα and Bcr-Abl with SNS-032, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and CDK9 in phase I clinical trials.;The effects of SNS-032 on PDGFRα and Bcr-Abl signaling pathways, apoptosis, and cell cycling were analyzed in TKI-resistant cells of HES and CML. The in vivo antitumor activity of SNS-032 was assessed with xenografted BaF3-T674I FIP1L1-PDGFRα and KBM5-T315I Bcr-Abl cells in nude mouse models.;SNS-032 inhibited the phosphorylation on Ser5 and Ser2 of RNA polymerase II.

Maximum likelihood methods were used to test 3 potential hypotheses of the dynamics of BCR-ABL transcripts on imatinib therapy: (i) monoexponential, in which there is little, if any, decline in BCR-ABL transcripts; (ii) biexponential, in which patients have a rapid initial decrease in BCR-ABL transcripts followed by a more gradual response; and (iii) triexponential, in which patients first exhibit a biphasic decline but then have a third phase when BCR-ABL transcripts increase rapidly.;We found that most patients treated with imatinib exhibit a biphasic decrease in BCR-ABL transcript levels, with a rapid decrease during the first few months of treatment, followed by a more gradual decrease that often continues over many years.;We show that the only hypothesis consistent with current data on progenitor cell turnover and with the long-term, gradual decrease in the BCR-ABL levels seen in most patients is that these patients exhibit a continual, gradual reduction of the LSCs.

Moreover, there is also an indication that the BRCA1 protein is downregulated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. We have investigated a possible functional relationship between BRCA1 and mitotic checkpoint competence in cells with the same genetic background expressing different levels of Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML. Herein, we show that Bcr-Abl strongly downregulates the BRCA1 protein level, which is partially reversed on treatment with imatinib, an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Bcr-Abl leads to decreased expression of genes involved in the mitotic checkpoint activation--Mad2, Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1, resulting in mitosis perturbances, weakened mitotic checkpoint function, and mitotic slippage after nocodazole treatment. Furthermore, high Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed also postmitotic checkpoint dysfunctions and inability to effectively arrest in the 4NG1 phase of the cell cycle, which was associated with limited p21 induction. These observations had significant biological consequences, as we found a high level of improper divisions, chromosomal missegregation, and generation of polyploid cells on mitotic checkpoint prolonged activation. Additionally, Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed resistance to death activated by spindle defects, reversed by imatinib. Our study presents new facts and supports the hypothesis concerning the mutator nature of Bcr-Abl itself. The functional interaction between Bcr-Abl and mitosis dysfunctions, due to compromised mitotic checkpoints, may have important implications for the generation of aneuploidy and CML progression.",

C., Carlesso, N., Xu, G., Druker, B., and Griffin, J. D. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 257-265) describe enhanced phosphorylation of Vav in Bcr-Abl-expressing Mo7e cells yet fail to demonstrate association of the two proteins. Here, we report the identification of a direct complex between Vav and Bcr-Abl in yeast, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav by Bcr-Abl. Mutational analysis revealed that the SH2 domain and the C-terminal SH3 domain as well as a tetraproline motif directly adjacent to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Vav are important for establishing this phosphotyrosine dependent interaction. Activation of Rac-1 by Bcr-Abl was abrogated by co-expression of the Vav C terminus encoding the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains as a dominant negative construct. Bcr-Abl transduced primary bone marrow from Vav knock-out mice showed reduced proliferation in a culture cell transformation assay compared with wild-type bone marrow. These results suggest, that Bcr-Abl utilizes Vav as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate Rac-1 in a process that involves a folding mechanism of the Vav C terminus. Given the importance of Rac-1 activation for Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, this mechanism may be crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia and of importance for other signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of Rac-1.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is initially driven by the bcr-abl fusion oncoprotein. The identification of bcr-abl led to the discovery and rapid translation into the clinic of bcr-abl kinase inhibitors. Although, bcr-abl inhibitors are efficacious, experimental evidence indicates that targeting bcr-abl is not sufficient for elimination of minimal residual disease found within the bone marrow (BM). Experimental evidence indicates that the failure to eliminate the leukemic stem cell contributes to persistent minimal residual disease. Thus curative strategies will likely need to focus on strategies where bcr-abl inhibitors are given in combination with agents that specifically target the leukemic stem cell or the leukemic stem cell niche. One potential target to be exploited is the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Recently using STAT3 conditional knock-out mice it was shown that STAT3 is critical for initiating the disease. Interestingly, in the absence of treatment, STAT3 was not shown to be required for maintenance of the disease, suggesting that STAT3 is required only in the tumor initiating stem cell population (Hoelbl et al., 2010). In the context of the BM microenvironment, STAT3 is activated in a bcr-abl independent manner by the cytokine milieu. Activation of JAK/STAT3 was shown to contribute to cell survival even in the event of complete inhibition of bcr-abl activity within the BM compartment. Taken together, these studies suggest that JAK/STAT3 is an attractive therapeutic target for developing strategies for targeting the JAK-STAT3 pathway in combination with bcr-abl kinase inhibitors and may represent a viable strategy for eliminating or reducing minimal residual disease located in the BM in CML.",

In primary samples from virtually all patients with CML or Ph+ALL, the CRKL adapter protein is tyrosine phosphorylated and physically associated with p210(BCR/ABL). CRKL has one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains and is structurally related to c-CRK-II (CRK) and the v-Crk oncoprotein. We have previously shown that CRKL, but not the related adapter protein c-CRK, is tyrosine phosphorylated in cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, and that CRKL binds to BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH3 domains. Furthermore, the CRKL-SH2 domain has been shown to bind one or more cellular proteins, one of which is p120(CBL). Here we demonstrate that another cellular protein linked to BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH2 domain is p130(CAS). p130(CAS) was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with CRKL in BCR/ABL expressing cell lines and in samples obtained from CML and ALL patients, but not in samples from controls. In both normal and BCR/ABL transformed cells, p130(CAS) was detected in focal adhesion-like structures, as was BCR/ABL. In normal cells, the focal adhesion proteins tensin, p125(FAK), and paxillin constitutively associated with p130(CAS). However, in BCR/ABL transformed cells, the interaction between p130(CAS) and tensin was disrupted, while the associations between p130(CAS), p125(FAK), and paxillin were unaffected. These results suggest that the BCR/ABL oncogene could alter the function of p130(CAS) in at least three ways: tyrosine phosphorylation, inducing constitutive binding of CRKL to a domain in p130(CAS) containing Tyr-X-X-Pro motifs (substrate domain), and disrupting the normal interaction of p130(CAS) with the focal adhesion protein tensin. These alterations in the structure of signaling proteins in focal adhesion like structures could contribute to the known adhesion abnormalities in CML cells.",

CML is a rare malignant neoplasm in pediatric age. It is characterized by a Philadelphia chromosome, which comes from a genetic translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation results in an abnormal fusion called BCR-ABL oncogene which encodes a chimeric BCR-ABL protein. This protein is the underlying cause of CML. Nilotinib is a newly licensed drug for CML in adults. Structurally, it is similar to imatinib (the older tyrosine kinase inhibitor), but it is much more potent in inhibiting BCR-ABL due to its much increased affinity for its binding site. Specific guidelines for CML treatment in children have yet to be determined. In our patient, nilotinib was used as an off-label drug because it is not licensed for children. According to the pharmacokinetic response to drugs, children cannot be considered small adults irrespective of their weight.

In this study, we succeeded in causing a marked leukocytosis resembling CML from restricted foci of LICs in the normal hematopoietic system by direct transplantation of BCR-ABL gene-transduced LICs into the bone marrow (BM) cavity of nonirradiated mice. Herein, we observed that BCR-ABL(+)lineage(-)c-kit(-) immature leukemia cells produced high levels of an inflammatory chemokine, MIP-1α/CCL3, which promoted the development of CML. Conversely, ablation of the CCL3 gene in LICs dramatically inhibited the development of CML and concomitantly reduced recurrence after the cessation of a short-term tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Finally, normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can directly impede the maintenance of LICs in BM in the absence of CCL3 signal. ",

We have directly compared the tyrosine kinase activity, in vitro transformation properties, and in vivo leukemogenic activity of the P190, P210, and P230 forms of BCR/ABL. P230 exhibited lower intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity than P210 and P190. Although all three oncogenes transformed both myeloid (32D cl3) and lymphoid (Ba/F3) interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell lines to become independent of IL-3 for survival and growth, their ability to stimulate proliferation of Ba/F3 lymphoid cells differed and correlated directly with tyrosine kinase activity. In a murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation model, the three forms of BCR/ABL were equally potent in the induction of a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative syndrome in recipient mice when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated donors were used. Analysis of proviral integration showed the CML-like disease to be polyclonal and to involve multiple myeloid and B lymphoid lineages, implicating a primitive multipotential target cell. Secondary transplantation revealed that only certain minor clones gave rise to day 12 spleen colonies and induced disease in secondary recipients, suggesting heterogeneity among the target cell population. In contrast, when marrow from non- 5-FU-treated donors was used, a mixture of CML-like disease, B lymphoid acute leukemia, and macrophage tumors was observed in recipients. P190 BCR/ABL induced lymphoid leukemia with shorter latency than P210 or P230. The lymphoid leukemias and macrophage tumors had provirus integration patterns that were oligo- or monoclonal and limited to the tumor cells, suggesting a lineage-restricted target cell with a requirement for additional events in addition to BCR/ABL transduction for full malignant transformation. These results do not support the hypothesis that P230 BCR/ABL induces a distinct and less aggressive form of CML in humans, and suggest that the rarity of P190 BCR/ABL in human CML may reflect infrequent BCR intron 1 breakpoints during the genesis of the Ph chromosome in stem cells, rather than intrinsic differences in myeloid leukemogenicity between P190 and P210.",

Moreover, in the metaphases of the controls analyzed, no bcr/abl+ chromosome was detected that makes the colocalization of bcr and abl signals in the CML patients highly specific.

Mononuclear cells (MNC), and in some experiments CD34+ cells, were maintained for 7 days in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), stem cell factor and interleukin-3. The number of viable cells recovered after culture was between 7.4 and 70.2 for 10(6) cells plated. These cells exhibited the following phenotype: CD34+, CD117+, CD38-, lineage-, and were able to generate cobblestone areas and secondary colonies in long-term culture (LTC), with a frequency similar to that of cells selected from normal marrow. Study by fluorescence in situ hybridization of LTC cells or secondary colonies showed no evidence of BCR/ABL rearrangement. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies on pooled LTC cells or secondary colonies were also negative. By contrast, LTC cells or secondary colonies obtained from CML CD34+ cells without culture in the presence of 5-FU were always positive for BCR/ABL rearrangement. Finally, 5-FU selected cells were able to engraft NOD/SCID mouse, as human cells were detected in blood and marrow 10 weeks post transplantation, which were BCR/ABL negative by RT-PCR. This method of culture makes it possible to select constantly BCR/ABL-negative cells with capacities of development in LTC assay and of NOD/SCID mouse engraftment.",

Valproic acid (VPA) is an anti-epileptic drug that also acts as a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of this research was to determine the anti-leukemic effects of dasatinib and VPA in combination and to identify their mechanism of action in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Dasatinib was found to exert potent synergistic inhibitory effects on VPA-treated AML cells in association with G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction involving the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, -7 and -9. Dasatinib/VPA-induced cell death thus occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK inhibitors efficiently inhibited dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis. The combined effect of dasatinib and VPA on the differentiation capacity of AML cells was more powerful than the effect of each drug alone, being sufficiently strong to promote AML cell death through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK were found to control dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis as upstream regulators, and co-treatment with dasatinib and VPA to contribute to AML cell death through the regulation of differentiation capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that combined dasatinib and VPA treatment has a potential role in anti-leukemic therapy. ",

In patients with an acute phase of CML and in acute myeloid leukemia patients, strong methylation of H3K9 and all isoforms of HP1 are detected. In chronic forms of CML, no strong correlations among the level of histone methylation, disease progression, and modality of treatment were observed. Histone methylation was found even in \"cured\" patients without Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) resulting from +(9;22)(q34;q11) BCR/ABL translocation, suggesting an incomplete process of developmentally regulated chromatin remodeling in the granulocytes of these patients. Similarly, reprogramming of leukemia HL-60 cells to terminal differentiation by retinoic acid does not eliminate H3K9 methylation and the presence of HP1 isoforms from differentiated granulocytes. Thus, our study shows for the first time that histone H3 methylation may be changed dramatically during normal cell differentiation.

Two-color BCR-ABL probes visualizing one fusion signal (1F FISH) have high false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). The FPR is a result of the random spatial association of probe signals within normal interphase cells so that some cells appear to contain the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The FNR of 1F FISH probes depends on the distance between the BCR and ABL probes hybridized to the BCR-ABL fusion gene (< or =368 kb); the \"gap\" between the signals causing the cell to be interpreted as normal. To overcome these difficulties, a two-color probe was used, employing four yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) sequences that span the breakpoint regions of the BCR and ABL genes and that visualize the two fusion signals BCR-ABL and ABL-BCR in CML cells (2F FISH). The FNR for the 2F FISH probes was assessed on clonal Ph+ granulocyte-macrophage-colony-forming cell (CFU-GM) derived colonies and was reduced to 0.4% (2/450), compared with an FNR of 13.5% (111/823) with 1F FISH.

CR-LAAO was more cytotoxic towards Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines than towards healthy subjects' PBMC. The H2O2 produced during the enzymatic action of CR-LAAO mediated its cytotoxic effect. The CR-LAAO induced apoptosis in Bcr-Abl(+) cells, as detected by caspases 3, 8, and 9 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA damage. CR-LAAO elicited apoptosis in PBMC from CML-CP patients without TKI treatment more strongly than in PBMC from healthy subjects and TKI-treated CML-CP and CML-AP patients.

The predominant phenotype in the Cbl-b(-/-) recipients was a CML-like myeloproliferative disease (MPD) similar to that observed in the wild-type animals, but with a longer latency, diminished circulating leukocyte numbers and reduced spleen weights. Despite the decreased leukemic burden in comparison to their wild-type counterparts, the Cbl-b(-/-) animals displayed enhanced numbers of Gr-1(+)/Mac-1(+) spleen cells and neutrophilia. On the basis of prior evidence of CBL-B-dependent motility toward SDF-1α, we hypothesized that Cbl-b deficiency might impair bone marrow localization during transplantation. Homing experiments showed reduced migration of Cbl-b(-/-) cells to the bone marrow. Intrafemoral transplantation of BCR-ABL-transduced Cbl-b(-/-) cells revealed equivalent latency of disease development to the wild-type transplants, supporting the conclusion that Cbl-b deficiency diminishes homing of leukemic cells to the bone marrow, and perturbs the proliferation of BCR-ABL-expressing malignant clones during CML development.",

A semi-nested reverse transcriptase-PCR approach was used for amplification of the ABL kinase domain, which was then subjected to direct sequencing for the detection of point mutations. Expression of BCR-ABL transcripts was quantified using the real-time Taqman assay, and BCR-ABL gene amplification was detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Twelve different point mutations were detected in 18/40 (45%) patients. Five patients had mutations in the P-loop region and 13 had mutations in other regions of the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Progression-free survival at 2 years was inferior for patients with mutations compared to those without mutations (72% vs. 95%, p < 0.0045).

KD P-loop mutations predominated in mice receiving less intensive therapy, whereas high-dose treatment selected for T315I \"gatekeeper\" mutations resistant to all 3 Food and Drug Administration-approved BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors. The addition of dexamethasone and/or L-asparaginase to reduced-intensity dasatinib therapy improved long-term survival of the majority of mice that received all 3 drugs. Although non-tumor-cell-autonomous mechanisms can prevent full eradication of dasatinib-refractory ALL in this clinically relevant model, the emergence of resistance to BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors can be effectively circumvented by the addition of \"conventional\" chemotherapeutic agents with alternate antileukemic mechanisms of action.",

Although the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of MPDs was suggested over 30 years ago, only recently the HSC-specific effects of MPD molecular mutations have been investigated. The pivotal role of BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) development provided the rationale for targeted therapy, which greatly reduced mortality rates. However, BCR-ABL inhibitor-resistant CML HSCs persist that may be a reservoir for relapse. This has provided the impetus for investigating molecular mechanisms governing the production of recalcitrant HSC. Comparatively little was known about the molecular events driving BCR-ABL-negative MPDs until seminal studies revealed that a large proportion of MPD patients harbor a JAK2-activating point mutation, JAK2V617F. Although JAK2 activation appears to be central to BCR-ABL-negative MPD pathogenesis, its effects may be cell type and context specific. Recent evidence suggests that acquired mutations misdirect differentiation and survival of the MPD-initiating stem cell resulting in the production of aberrant self-renewing progenitors that subvert the microenvironment leading to leukemia stem cell generation and leukemic transformation. Thus, combined therapies targeting aberrant molecular pathways may be required to redirect miscreant MPD stem cells.",

However, although many patients respond well to standard-dose imatinib initially, some patients do not achieve adequate levels of response or discontinue therapy because of resistance. One approach to improving treatment response with first-line imatinib may be to increase the imatinib dose (800 mg/day), although recent trial data indicate that overall increases in response rates may be modest. Newer Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce responses in patients with all phases of imatinib-resistant CML, even those with imatinib-resistant mutations in the BCR-ABL gene. Furthermore, in initial studies, first-line dasatinib or nilotinib treatment has produced response rates that compare favorably with historical controls treated with imatinib, although confirmation is required from head-to-head clinical trials.

As a result, multiple signaling pathways are activated in a kinase-dependent manner, and thus the activation of such pathways may affect the expression of genes that confer the malignant phenotype. In this study, we used differential display to investigate the alterations of gene expression in BV173, a CML cell line derived from lymphoid blast crisis, after exposure to ST1571, which selectively inhibits ABL PTK activity. We show that the expression of a set of 12 genes is correlated with the kinase activity and that the profile of these genes reflects mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Several of the genes show a consistent pattern of altered regulation in all Ph-positive lymphoid cell lines, whereas others appear to be unique to BV173 cells. We conclude that BCR-ABL PTK activity drives the expression of specific target genes that contribute to the malignant transformation of Ph-positive cells.

However, in a proportion of patients neither mechanism operates, and resistance appears to be a priori, existing prior to exposure to the drug. These mechanisms of imatinib resistance are poorly understood and may be heterogeneous.;We have previously described such innate resistance to imatinib in subclones of a myeloid leukemia cell line, KCL22, in which imatinib exposure inhibits the activity of Bcr-Abl and yet fails to induce apoptosis. We describe here whole-genome expression analysis of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells derived from the original KCL22 line, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.;We detected differential expression of 39 genes that correlate with the imatinib-resistant phenotype. The resistant cells overexpress several genes associated with the suppression of apoptosis or with conferral of a transformed phenotype.;Amongst the differentially-expressed genes correlating with imatinib resistance, several suggest the activation of alternative pathway(s) that maintain viability and growth independently of Bcr-Abl kinase activity.

Originally identified as transcriptional regulators of the type I interferon system, IRFs play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Hence, understanding IRF biology has important implications in the host response to cancer development and progression. Many lines of evidence suggest that different IRFs are involved in the pathogenesis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder caused by the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that favors cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and allows cell survival even in the absence of proper adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Different BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently available for CML treatment. These drugs are able to generate eight year CML-specific overall survival rates >90%, only a minority of patients will achieve molecular responses compatible with drug discontinuation. Thus, there is an unmet need for additional therapeutic targets that may lead to the cure of most patients diagnosed with CML. A growing body of evidence has suggested a role for both IRF4 and IRF8 in the pathogenesis of CML. Furthermore, IRF1 is consistently deleted at one or both alleles in patients with leukemia and myelodysplasia.

The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ponatinib and its CYP3A4-mediated metabolite, AP24567, were evaluated in a single-center, randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover study in healthy volunteers. Subjects (N = 22) received two single doses (orally) of ponatinib 15 mg, once given alone and once coadministered with daily (5 days) ketoconazole 400 mg, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ponatinib plus ketoconazole increased ponatinib maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) compared with ponatinib alone. The estimated mean ratios for AUC0-∞, AUC0-t, and C(max) indicated increased exposures to ponatinib of 78%, 70%, and 47%, respectively; exposure to AP24567 decreased by 71%. Exposure to AP24567 was marginal after ponatinib alone (no more than 4% of the exposure to ponatinib). These results suggest that caution should be exercised with the concurrent use of ponatinib and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and that a ponatinib dose decrease to 30 mg daily, from the 45 mg daily starting dose, could be considered.",

The Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) expresses an alternative form of c-Abl, v-Abl, that transforms murine pro-B cells, resulting in acute leukemia and providing an experimental model for human disease. Gleevec (STI571) inhibits the Abl kinase and has shown great utility against CML and ALL in humans, although its usefulness is limited by acquired resistance. Since STI571 is active against A-MuLV-transformed cells in vitro, we performed a retroviral cDNA library screen for genes that confer resistance to apoptosis induced by STI571. We found that forced expression of Cdk6 promotes continued cell division and decreased apoptosis of leukemic cells. We then determined that the transcription factor E2A negatively regulates Cdk6 transcription in leukemic pro-B cells and that the v-Abl kinase stimulates Cdk6 expression via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1-dependent pathway. Finally, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor PD0332991 can act synergistically with STI571 to enhance leukemic cell death, suggesting a potential role for CDK6 inhibitors in the treatment of STI571-resistant CML or ALL.",

These studies suggest that oncogenic mutations subvert normal development and induce reacquisition of stem-like features. However, no study has described how specific mutations influence the ability of differentiating cell subsets to serve as leukemia-initiating cells and if varying such cellular origins confers a functional difference. We have examined the role of the tumor suppressor gene p19(ARF) in a murine model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and found that loss of p19(ARF) changes the spectrum of cells capable of tumor initiation. With intact p19(ARF), only hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be directly transformed by BCR/ABL expression. In a p19(ARF)-null genetic background expression of the BCR/ABL fusion protein renders functionally defined HSCs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), and precursor B-lymphocytes competent to generate leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, we show that leukemias arising from p19(ARF)-null HSC versus pro-B cells differ biologically, including relative response to drug insult. Our observations elucidate a unique mechanism by which heterogeneity arises in tumor populations harboring identical genetic lesions and show that activity of p19(ARF) profoundly influences the nature of tumor-initiating cells during BCR/ABL-mediated leukemogenesis.",

These observations have in recent years been supported by laboratory results indicating the presence of CML-specific T cells in the lymphocyte repertoire of both normal healthy individuals and disease-bearing patients. Both MHC-unrestricted and MHC-restricted immune effector mechanisms are involved. Donor lymphocyte infusion has produced encouraging GvL effects. However, future adoptive immunotherapy may depend on the isolation and generation of leukemia-specific T cells. Although many proteins may potentially act as leukemia antigens in CML for MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, the bcr-abl fusion protein has been most extensively investigated. There is now much evidence to suggest that the bcr-abl junctional peptides are capable of eliciting both CD4 and CD8 responses in normal healthy donors and CML patients. Furthermore, the T-cell lines generated react with autologous or HLA-matched fresh CML cells, suggesting that the bcr-abl fusion protein can be processed in vivo so that the joining segment is bound to HLA molecules in a configuration and concentration similar to those of the immunizing peptide for antigen recognition by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor. These results also indicate that the bcr-abl junctional peptides may be used for immunotherapy of CML. Other strategies available for immunotherapy of CML include immunologically or genetically manipulated donor T-cell infusion, the use of cytokines, adoptive immunotherapy with leukemia-reactive T-cells expanded ex vivo, and immune gene therapy. Novel and rational immunotherapy may therefore play an important adjuvant role in future in the management of patients with CML.",

These were subsequently replaced by interferon alpha (IFN alpha) based therapy. Currently, bone marrow transplant survival has improved, making this also a viable option. Five-year progression-free survival averaged above 70% for chemotherapeutic options. Transplant survival at 56 months was approximately 60%; however, these survivors were generally cured of disease. The recognition of the role for BCR-ABL in CML has led to the development of specific kinase inhibitors such as imatinib. Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated a clear superiority of imatinib over interferon plus cytarabine, making this the new standard of care in first-line treatment of CML. Resistance to imatinib has been observed, in addition to relapse. The data suggest that the probability of response may be estimated as early as six months after initiation of imatinib therapy. Although combinations of imatinib with IFN alpha show small improvements compared to imatinib therapy alone, the biggest improvements were seen when imatinib doses were doubled. Unfortunately, not all patients can tolerate this increase in dose. The most common mechanism for imatinib resistance is the presence of a mutated BCR-ABL kinase. Several of these mutants have been cloned and characterized.;Molecular-targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, are now first-line treatment for CML. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is still the only proven curable treatment for CML in patients with an appropriate donor. Next generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors hold promise for patients with mutated BCR-ABL kinase that confer resistance to imatinib.",

However, the existence of splicing variants and different breakpoints on the DNA level hampers the discrimination of the rearrangements by their fragment size on an agarose gel. Therefore, one of the internal primers of each translocation (ABL-2, TEL-2, AF4-2) was labeled with a characteristic fluorescent dye, and an automatic fluorescence-based DNA fragment analysis was performed.

However, the influence of BCR-ABL expression on cell-mediated cytotoxicity is poorly understood. In the present study, we asked whether BCR-ABL expression interferes with leukemic target sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cell cytolysis. Our approach was based on the use of 2 BCR-ABL transfectants of the pluripotent hematopoietic cell line UT-7 expressing low (UT-7/E8, UT-7/G6) and high (UT-7/9) levels of BCR-ABL. As effector cells, we used CD56(bright), CD16-, CD2- NK cells differentiated in vitro from CD34 cord blood progenitors. We demonstrated that BCR-ABL transfectants UT-7/9 were lysed by NK cells with a higher efficiency than parental and low UT-7/E8.1 and UT-7/G6 transfectants. This enhanced susceptibility to lysis correlated with an increase in expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) by target cells. Treatment of UT-7/9 cells by STI571 (a specific inhibitor of the abl kinase) resulted in a decrease in NK susceptibility to lysis and ICAM-1 down-regulation in target cells. Furthermore, the constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) detected in BCR-ABL transfectant UT-7/9, was significantly attenuated when cells were treated by STI571. Interestingly, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by BAY11-67082 (a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor) resulted in down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression and a subsequent decrease in NK-induced killing of UT-7/9 transfectants. Our results show that oncogenic transformation by BCR-ABL may increase susceptibility of leukemic progenitors to NK cell cytotoxicity by a mechanism involving overexpression of ICAM-1 as a consequence of NF-kappaB activation.",

One possible target for specific GVL activity is the bcr-abl fusion protein characteristic of CML. We have investigated the use of normal peptide-pulsed dendritic cells for the generation of cytotoxic, bcr-abl-specific T cells from normal donors. T cells (CD3+, CD8+, TCR alpha beta+, and NK receptor-negative) generated from a normal donor (HLA A24, B52, B59, Cw1) after stimulation with autologous dendritic cells, primed with a 16 mer peptide spanning the b3a2 breakpoint of bcr-abl, lysed CML cells from the peripheral blood of seven patients with CML with the b3a2 breakpoint. CML cells from four patients with only the b2a2 breakpoint were not lysed. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts derived from peripheral blood of patients with CML were not lysed, suggesting that cytotoxicity was not due to alloreactivity. Blocking experiments with anti-HLA-A,B,C indicated that cytotoxicity was dependent on recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, although cytotoxicity was not MHC-restricted because not all patients shared HLA types with the T-cell donor. Specificity for bcr-abl and absence of alloreactivity was confirmed by the presence of lytic activity against autologous and allogeneic class I HLA-A matched monocytes pulsed with the 16 mer bcr-abl fusion peptide, but not against unpulsed monocytes or monocytes pulsed with other peptides.

In previous studies, we have provided evidence that Bcr/Abl overexpression in leukemic cells increased their susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis by different mechanisms. In the present study, using UT-7/9 cells, a high level Bcr/Abl transfectant of UT-7 cells, we show that the treatment of Bcr/Abl target by imatinib mesylate (IM), a specific Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, hampers the formation of the NK/target immunological synapse. The main effect of IM involves an induction of surface GM1 ganglioside on Bcr/Abl transfectants that prevents the redistribution of MHC-related Ag molecules in lipid rafts upon interaction with NK cells. IM also affects cell surface glycosylation of targets, as assessed by binding of specific lectins resulting in the subsequent modulation of their binding to lectin type NK receptor, particularly NKG2D. In addition, we demonstrate that the tyrosine kinase activity repression results in a decrease of MHC-related Ags-A/B and UL-16-binding protein expression on Bcr/Abl transfectants UT-7/9. We show that NKG2D controls the NK-mediated lysis of UT-7/9 cells, and IM treatment inhibits this activating pathway. Taken together, our results show that the high expression of Bcr/Abl in leukemic cells controls the expression of NKG2D receptor ligands and membrane GM1 via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism and that the modulation of these molecules by IM interferes with NK cell recognition and cytolysis of the transfectants.",

Of these 37 samples, 33 were from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (26 post allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [AlloBMT] and seven during interferon-alpha therapy) and 4 from Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (1 post AlloBMT and 3 post high dose chemotherapy). For the 27 samples studied after AlloBMT (26 CML and 1 Ph1-positive ALL) the time after transplantation ranged from 1 to 107 months (median 47.5 months). In 8 (22%) of the 37 samples there were discrepant results among methods. The discrepancy rates relative to other techniques were: karyotyping 17% (5 of 29), Southern blotting 18% (6 of 33), multiplex RT-PCR 8% (3 of 37), and FISH 8% (3 of 37). Therefore, the relative accuracy of each method for disease monitoring in Ph1-positive leukemia was: 83% (24 of 29) for karyotyping, 82% (27 of 33) for Southern blotting, 92% (34 of 37) for FISH, and 92% (34 of 37) for multiplex RT-PCR. This multiplex RT-PCR assay appears equivalent to FISH in terms of accuracy, simplicity, and turnaround time and both are superior to Southern blot and conventional cytogenetics in the laboratory monitoring of Ph1-positive leukemias.",

A 72-h rigosertib treatment was found to inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis, reduce phosphorylation of the breakpoint cluster region-c (BCR)-ABL and its substrate Crk-L, and increase the activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This combination therapy also exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect on Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cell proliferation and reduced the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and Crk-L while increasing that of cleaved PARP and the H2A.X histone. Rigosertib also potently inhibited the growth of ABL TKI-resistant cells, and cotreatment with ABL TKIs and rigosertib induced higher cytotoxicity.

CML progresses through a series of three defined stages with survival times of 3-5 years if untreated. The chromosomal translocation creating the Ph chromosome creates the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is the initiating factor for CML. BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, which transforms hematopoietic stem cells through dysregulation of proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell adhesion. The transformation process is then accelerated by the accumulation of additional translocations. This fusion protein has been used clinically as a therapeutic target and a sensitive marker for measuring residual disease. Techniques, such as cytogenetic analysis of chromosomes, allow for the visualization of the Ph chromosome and additional translocations and abnormalities. The more sensitive fluorescent in situ hybridization assay can directly visualize the bcr-abl translocation through merged fluorescent tags. Polymerase chain reaction, the most sensitive of the assays, can be used to detect minute amounts of bcr-abl mRNA and this has made it possible to monitor and detect minimal residual disease recurrence and disease progression, thus greatly enhancing patient care.;A variety of monitoring techniques can be employed during CML therapy, providing degrees of quantifying disease burden or absence of disease.",

Although the occurrence of t(9;22) in healthy individuals has been previously demonstrated, the number of studies is limited and the results are inconsistent. The present study screened for the presence of bcr‑abl transcripts in the blood of a group of healthy individuals using a sensitive‑nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) assay. Samples were collected from 189 healthy volunteers (145 adults and 44 children). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by two rounds of PCR, amplifying the two common variants of bcr‑abl transcripts, p190 and p210. While the bcr‑abl p190 transcript was not detected, the p210 transcript was detected in ~10% of samples. Notably, the incidence of p210 translocation was higher in males (12.2%) compared with females (7.7%) and males were 2.4 times more likely to have the translocation. A significant incidence was also observed in adults compared with children, where adults were 6 times more likely to have the translocation. The presence of bcr‑abl transcripts in the blood of a significant proportion of healthy individuals should be considered in long‑term investigations to establish its exact association with the risk of developing leukemia. Furthermore, the current assays should be revised to consider the proportion of normal samples carrying the p210 transcripts when making a differential diagnosis.",

The aim of our study was to determine, in patients with CML, the capacity of imatinib mesylate to modulate one of the most potent regulators of angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In newly diagnosed CML, we observed significantly increased VEGF secretion by CML BM cells and significantly increased VEGF plasma concentrations. We showed that low plasma VEGF concentrations could be one of the characteristics of complete cytogenetic remission. To understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the inhibition of VEGF production by imatinib, we focused our experiments on the human cell line K562, which is Bcr/Abl positive. We demonstrated that imatinib inhibits VEGF gene transcription by targeting the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. Taken together, our results highlight the potential prognostic value of VEGF concentrations in evaluating the evolution of CML patients treated with imatinib.",

After treatment with imatinib in mononuclear cell (MNC) of CML patients and K562 in vitro, expression of DNA-PKcs mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and DNA-PKcs protein level, tyrosine phosphorylation of bcr-abl fusion protein were detected by Western blot. The results showed that the expression of DNA-PKcs protein was significantly lower in CML and K562 than those in normal control (P<0.05). In 26 CML patients received allo-PBSCT and 4 CML patients treated with imatinib, the expression of DNA-PKcs protein was enhanced while the expression of bcr-abl mRNA decreased. After treatment of MNC of CML and K562 with imatinib in vitro, the expression of DNA-PKcs protein was enhanced while tyrosine phosphorylation of bcr-abl fusion protein decreased. It is concluded that the expression of DNA-PKcs protein is down-regulate by bcr-abl fusion gene, and the bcr-abl fusion gene down-regulate the expression of DNA-PKcs protein by post-transcriptional mechanism; the decrease of DNA-PKcs protein expression may be one of mechanisms underlying the acute transformation of CML.",

We show that the T315I substitution arises in primitive Ph1 stem cells without altering their myeloid and erythroid terminal differentiation potential. Leukemic cells expressing a T315I mutated BCR-ABL display a progressive decline in LTC-IC assays as described for non-mutated CML cells at diagnosis.

Blocking BCR-ABL by the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec) is clinically highly efficient. Treatment response is unfortunately compromised by the emergence of IM resistance, which is regularly seen in accelerated and blastic phase of CML (CML-AP/BP) and in Ph+ ALL. BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are then considered the causative mechanism of IM resistance, because 50-60% of the IM resistant patients harbour such mutations. In contrast, IM resistance arises very rarely in patients that are treated with IM in early chronic phase of CML. This implies that BCR-ABL independent factors such as the cellular context of BCR-ABL expression and stage of disease decisively control the evolution of IM resistance. In line with this, novel Abl-kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib (DA) or nilotinib (NI) - although capable of inhibiting most of the BCR/-BL kinase mutants - still often fail to overcome resistance and do mostly not induce durable cytogenetic responses in IM resistant CML-AP/BC and Ph+ ALL patients. On the basis of available evidence it is proposed here that alternative genetic aberrations, which synergize with BCR-ABL to enable leukemic self-renewal are of causal importance for the evolution of clinical kinase inhibitor resistance. Kinase mutations may in turn reflect clonal variants of cells that emerge on the basis of an already existing IM resistant and self-renewing leukemic cell population. This model has clinical implications as it implies that even highly potent Abl-kinase inhibition can not target the genetic basis of IM resistance and will also not resolve the problem of Abl-kinase inhibitor resistance.",

To improve treatment options, dasatinib (BMS-354825) was developed as a novel, oral, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases. To date, dasatinib has shown promising anti-leukemic activity in preclinical models of CML and in phase I/II clinical studies in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease.;The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers of dasatinib were investigated in K562 human CML xenografts grown s.c. in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Tumoral levels of phospho-BCR-ABL/phospho-CrkL were determined by Western blot.;Following a single oral administration of dasatinib at a preclinical efficacious dose of 1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg, tumoral phospho-BCR-ABL/phospho-CrkL were maximally inhibited at approximately 3 hours and recovered to basal levels by 24 hours. The time course and extent of the inhibition correlated with the plasma levels of dasatinib in mice. Pharmacokinetic/biomarker modeling predicted that the plasma concentration of dasatinib required to inhibit 90% of phospho-BCR-ABL in vivo was 10.9 ng/mL in mice and 14.6 ng/mL in humans, which is within the range of concentrations achieved in CML patients who responded to dasatinib treatment in the clinic.;Phospho-BCR-ABL/phospho-CrkL are likely to be useful clinical biomarkers for the assessment of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition by dasatinib.",

This gives the transformed cells a proliferative advantage over normal hematopoietic cells. Silencing the BCR/ABL oncogene by treatment with specific drugs remains an important therapeutic goal. In this work, we used locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotides to silence BCR/ABL and reduce CML cell proliferation, as these oligonucleotides are resistant to nucleases and exhibit an exceptional affinity for cognate RNA. The anti-BCR/ABL oligonucleotides were designed as LNA-DNA gapmers, consisting of end blocks of 3/4 LNA monomers and a central DNA stretch of 13/14 deoxyribonucleotides. The gapmers were complementary to the b2a2 and b3a2 mRNA junctions with which they form hybrid duplexes that have melting temperatures of 79 degrees C and 75 degrees C, respectively, in a 20 mmol/L NaCl-buffered (pH 7.4) solution. Like DNA, the designed LNA-DNA gapmers were capable of activating RNase H and promote cleavage of the target b2a2 and b3a2 BCR/ABL mRNAs. The treatment of CML cells with junction-specific antisense gapmers resulted in a strong and specific reduction of the levels of BCR/ABL transcripts ( approximately 20% of control) and protein p210(BCR/ABL) ( approximately 30% of control). Moreover, the antisense oligonucleotides suppressed cell growth up to 40% of control and induced apoptosis, as indicated by the increase of caspase-3/7 activity in the treated cells. Finally, the b2a2-specific antisense gapmer used in combination with STI571 (imatinib mesylate), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of p210(BCR/ABL), produced an enhanced antiproliferative effect in KYO-1 cells, which compared with K562 cells are refractory to STI571. The data of this study support the application of BCR/ABL antisense LNA-DNA gapmers, used either alone or in combination with STI571, as potential antileukemic agents.",

With a structure-based drug design approach we have discovered a novel inhibitor CHMFL-074, that potently inhibits both the native and a variety of clinically emerged mutants of BCR-ABL kinase. The X-ray crystal structure of CHMFL-074 in complex with ABL1 kinase (PDB ID: 5HU9) revealed a typical type II binding mode (DFG-out) but relatively rare hinge binding. Kinome wide selectivity profiling demonstrated that CHMFL-074 bore a high selectivity (S score(1) = 0.03) and potently inhibited ABL1 kinase (IC50: 24 nM) and PDGFR α/β (IC50: 71 nM and 88 nM). CHMFL-074 displayed strong anti-proliferative efficacy against BCR-ABL-driven CML cell lines such as K562 (GI50: 56 nM), MEG-01 (GI50: 18 nM) and KU812 (GI50: 57 nM). CHMFL-074 arrested cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis in the Ph+ CML cell lines. In addition, it potently inhibited the CML patient primary cell's proliferation but did not affect the normal bone marrow cells. In the CML cell K562 inoculated xenograft mouse model, oral administration of 100 mg/kg/d of CHMFL-074 achieved a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 65% without exhibiting apparent toxicity. As a potential drug candidate for fighting CML, CHMFL-074 is under extensive preclinical safety evaluation now.",

In the study described here, most such cells expressed a primitive phenotype (CD38-, CD45RA-, CD71-, and HLA-DR(lo)) and cultures of these cells containing growth factors produced ultimately larger, but initially more slowly growing clones than do cultures of initially cycling CD34+ leukemic cells. Initially quiescent leukemic cells expressing BCR-ABL proliferated in single-cell cultures in the absence of added growth factors, thereby demonstrating their ability to spontaneously exit G0 and enter a continuously cycling state. Interestingly, on isolation, few of these quiescent BCR-ABL+ cells contained either interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) transcripts, whereas both were present in most cycling BCR-ABL+ CD34+ cells. However, after 4 days of culture in the absence of added growth factors and in association with their entry into the cell cycle (as indicated by up-regulation of Ki-67 and cdc25 transcripts), IL-3 transcripts became detectable. These findings show that entry of leukemic (BCR-ABL-expressing) progenitors into a quiescent (G0) state in vivo is highest among the most primitive leukemic cell populations, associated with a down-regulation of IL-3 and G-CSF gene expression, and spontaneously reversible in association with up-regulation of IL-3 expression. These results highlight the potential physiologic relevance of quiescent CML progenitors, even in treated patients, in whom these cells would be predicted to have a proliferative advantage over their quiescent normal counterparts when cytokine concentrations are low.",

To this effect, the BCR/ABL fusion was assessed at the single cell level in 25 sets of PB and BM samples using dual-color I-FISH in immunophenotyped CD34(+) cells and RT-PCR of individual CFU-GM colonies. In 15 cases found to be 100% Ph(+), the respective BCR/ABL gene was absent in 30% of CD34(+) cells, while the respective transcripts could not be identified in 17% of CFU-GM. The mean percentage of BCR/ABL(-) CD34(+) cells and CFU-GM cells was higher (38% and 29%, respectively) in untreated patients than in treated patients (24% and 7%, respectively). In eight cases with cytogenetic response (CgR), the percentage of Ph(-) metaphases correlated with the level of BCR/ABL(-) colonies in BM and PB and with the proportion of BCR/ABL(-) CD34(+) cells in the BM. Immunophenotyping and FISH was fast, easy, always informative, and quantitative for the BCR/ABL(-) CD34(+) cells. Our results show that (a) at early diagnosis a high frequency of BCR/ABL(-) HSC circulate in the PB and that Ph(-) hematopoiesis is not completely suppressed; (b) although normal clonogenic cells decline rapidly within a few months after diagnosis, appreciable numbers of normal CD34(+) cells survive in chronic phase, especially in patients with CgR.",

However, the data on incidence of PGF in UCB are contradictive. We have compared multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) in neonates from Slovak National Birth Cohort. According to multiplex PCR, all 135 screened samples were negative for the most frequent PGF of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the prevalence of prognostically important TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL (p190), 200 UCB were screened using RT qPCR. The initial screening showed an unexpectedly high incidence of studied PGF. The validation of selected samples in two laboratories confirmed approximately ¼ of UCB positive, resulting in ∼4% incidence of TEL-AML1, ∼6.25% incidence of BCR-ABL1 p190, and ∼0.75% frequency of MLL-AF4. In most cases, the PGF presented at very low level, about 1-5 copies per 105 cells.

The concept was introduced in 1978 to model bone marrow sites suited to host hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and favor their self-renewal, while restraining clonal expansion and commitment to differentiation. Studies of the effects of low oxygen tension on HSC maintenance in vitro led us to hypothesize niches were located within bone marrow areas where oxygen tension is lower than elsewhere. We named these areas hypoxic stem cell niches, although a low oxygen tension is to be considered physiological for the environment where HSCs are maintained. HSCs were later shown to have the option of cycling in low oxygen, which steers this cycling to the maintenance of stem cell potential. Cell subsets capable of withstanding incubation in very low oxygen were also detected within leukemia cell populations, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The oncogenetic Bcr/Abl protein is completely suppressed in these subsets, whereas Bcr/Abl messenger ribonucleic acid is not, indicating that CML cells resistant to low oxygen are independent of Bcr/Abl for persistence in culture but remain genetically leukemic. Accordingly, leukemia stem cells of CML selected in low oxygen are refractory to the Bcr/Abl inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Bcr/Abl protein suppression turned out to be actually determined when glucose shortage complicated the effects of low oxygen, indicating that ischemia-like conditions are the driving force of leukemia stem cell refractoriness to imatinib mesylate. These studies pointed to \"ischemic\" stem cell niches as a novel scenario for the maintenance of minimal residual disease of CML. A possible functional relationship of the \"ischemic\" with the \"hypoxic\" stem cell niche is discussed.",

Following imatinib initiation, a gradual decrease in serum sodium level was noticed. Prolonged aplasia and neutropenic fever prompted discontinuation of therapy for 4 weeks. Following the patient's recovery, complete remission was achieved and monotherapy with imatinib 800 mg daily was restarted; however, hyponatremia recurred a few days later. The clinical findings and laboratory workup were compatible with the diagnosis of SIADH, which was attributed to high-dose imatinib. Fluid restriction and imatinib dosage reduction (to 600 mg/day) restored sodium levels. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this adverse reaction was probably associated with imatinib.;Imatinib emerged as the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor to enter everyday clinical practice for the treatment of Ph(+) leukemias. Due to its molecular specificity, imatinib lacks the broad cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapy. Inhibition of kinases in normal tissues accounts for many of imatinib's adverse reactions. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of imatinib-induced SIADH.;We recommend monitoring for SIADH if a patient receiving high-dose imatinib develops hyponatremia.",

Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Abnormal ABL-related protein with increased tyrosine kinase activity suggested a molecular mechanism of CML. The BCR/ABL fusion gene can be found not only in the chromosome but in interphase nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We employed both fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and FISH to study the lineage involvement of individual stem cells and progenitor cells in patients with CML. Evidence of BCR/ABL fusion was found in pluripotent stem cells (CD34+, Thy1+), myeloid cells, B progenitor cells (CD34+, CD19+) and T/NK progenitor cells (CD34+, CD7+, CD5+) but not mature T cells (CD3+) or natural killer cells (CD3-, CD56+).

Previous findings have suggested a lack of IRF5 transcripts in both acute and chronic leukemias. However, to date, IRF5 expression and function have not been investigated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We report that IRF5 is expressed in CML cells, where it interacts with the BCR-ABL kinase that modulates its expression and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRF5 displayed reduced transcriptional activity that was partially restored by imatinib mesylate (IM). Interestingly, a mutant devoid of a BCR-ABL consensus site (IRF5(Y104F)) still presented significant tyrosine phosphorylation. This finding suggests that the oncoprotein phosphorylates additional tyrosine residues or induces downstream signaling pathways leading to further IRF5 phosphorylation. We also found that ectopic expression of IRF5 decreases the proliferation of CML cell lines by slowing their S-G2 transition, increasing the inhibition of BCR-ABL signaling and enhancing the lethality effect observed after treatment with IM, α-2-interferon and a DNA-damaging agent. Furthermore, IRF5 overexpression successfully reduced the clonogenic ability of CML CD34-positive progenitors before and after exposure to the above-indicated cytotoxic stimuli. Our data identify IRF5 as a downstream target of the BCR-ABL kinase, suggesting that its biological inactivation contributes to leukemic transformation. ",

In the CD10 population, the residual B cell subpopulations in the BCR/ABL patients were obviously reduced compared to those in the BCR/ABL patients. New subpopulations were detected in 22 of 23 patients and were primarily located in the CD34CD10 populations. Subpopulations of clonal evolution were heterogeneous after induction therapy.

The exact phenotype of the hematopoietic stem cell and the hierarchical level of the occurrence of this mutation in leukemic hematopoiesis has not been determined. To study the effects of T315I-mutated breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell, we have used the murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived hematopoiesis model. Native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL were introduced retrovirally in mESC-derived embryonic bodies followed by induction of hematopoiesis. In several experiments, T315I-mutated and nonmutated BCR-ABL-transduced embryonic bodies rapidly generated hematopoietic cells on OP-9 feeders, with evidence of hematopoietic stem cell markers. After injection into NOD/SCID mice, these cells induced myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, whereas transplantation of control (nontransduced) hematopoietic cells failed to produce any hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. Moreover, the expression of native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL conferred to mESC-derived hematopoietic cells a self-renewal capacity demonstrated by the generation of leukemias after secondary transplantations. Secondary leukemias were more aggressive with evidence of extramedullary tumors. The expression of stem cell regulator Musashi-2 was found to be increased in bone marrow of leukemic mice. These data show that T315I-mutated BCR-ABL is functional at the stem cell level, conferring to mESC-derived leukemic cells a long-term hematopoietic repopulation ability. This model could be of interest to test the efficiency of drugs at the stem cell level in leukemias with T315I mutation.",

The oligonucleotide uptake was directly dependent on the extracellular concentration and was constant over the first 18 h of incubation. After that the uptake rate decreased.

The controls used in the experiments were the sense oligonucleotide, equimolar amounts of sense and antisense, and an untreated control. Antisense oligonucleotides completely inhibited cell growth of BV173 cells and did not inhibit growth of HL-60 cells, whereas control oligonucleotides had no such effect on either cell line. An oligonucleotide specific for the other CML breakpoint was also effective in reducing cell growth of BV173. By the use of a DNA double staining technique to discriminate between necrotic and apoptotic cells, we detected a large number of apoptotic cells in antisense treated BV173 cultures after 5 days of treatment as compared to controls.

Accordingly, long-term disappearance of bcr-abl after intensive therapy is considered to be a probable cure of CML. The nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a powerful tool for minimal residual CML detection. The RT-PCR was optimized by (1) increasing the amount of total RNA involved in the reverse transcription reaction to correspond to total RNA extracted from 10(8) cells, (2) using a specific abl primer in this reverse reaction, and (3) reamplifying 10% of the RT-PCR product in nested amplification. This optimized RT-PCR permitted us to detect up to 1 copy of RNA bcr-abl synthesised in vitro, mixed with yeast RNA in an equivalent quantity to 10(8) white blood cells (WBCs). Using this highly sensitive RT-PCR during the follow-up of CML patients, a signal was unexpectedly found in healthy controls. Therefore, a systematic study of the possible expression of bcr-abl RNA in the WBCs of healthy adults and children and in umbilical cord blood was undertaken. It showed the presence of bcr-abl transcript in the blood of 22 of 73 healthy adults and in the blood of 1 of 22 children but not in 22 samples of umbilical cord blood.",

Cyclin D1 RNA expression in the CP of CML was also found to have clinical relevance to time to AP transformation. The median time to AP transformation for the CP patients with cyclin D1 transcripts of 1.50 x 10(4)/microg RNA was significantly shorter than that for those with cyclin D1 transcripts < 1.50 x 10(4)/microg RNA (15 vs. 67 months, p=0.0354) although confirmation to conduct in a larger patient group is required.

Often, relapse occurs in peripheral organs, such as the CNS, which acts as a sanctuary site for leukemia cells to escape anti-cancer treatments. Similar to normal leukocyte migration, leukemia dissemination entails migration of cells from the blood circulation into tissues by extravasation. To extravasate, leukemia cells cross through vascular endothelial walls via a process called transendothelial migration, which requires cytoskeletal remodeling. However, the specific molecular players in leukemia extravasation are not fully known. We examined the role of myosin-IIA a cytoskeletal class II myosin motor protein, in leukemia progression and dissemination into the CNS by use of a mouse model of Bcr-Abl-driven B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Small hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of myosin-IIA did not affect apoptosis or the growth rate of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, in an in vivo leukemia transfer model, myosin-IIA depletion slowed leukemia progression and prolonged survival, in part, by reducing the ability of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to engraft efficiently. Finally, myosin-IIA inhibition, either by small hairpin RNA depletion or chemical inhibition by blebbistatin, drastically reduced CNS infiltration of leukemia cells. The effects on leukemia cell entry into tissues were mostly a result of the requirement for myosin-IIA to enable leukemia cells to complete the transendothelial migration process during extravasation. Overall, our data implicate myosin-IIA as a key mediator of leukemia cell migration, making it a promising target to inhibit leukemia dissemination in vivo and potentially reduce leukemia relapses.

However, even though imatinib successfully controls the leukemia in chronic phase, it seems not to be able to cure the disease, potentially necessitating lifelong treatment with the inhibitor under constant risk of relapse. On a molecular level, the cause of disease persistence is not well understood. Initial studies implied that innate features of primitive progenitor cancer stem cells may be responsible for the phenomenon. Here, we describe an assay using retroviral insertional mutagenesis (RIM) to identify genes contributing to disease persistence in vivo. We transplanted mice with bone marrow cells retrovirally infected with the Bcr-Abl oncogene and subsequently treated the animals with imatinib to select for leukemic cells in which the proviral integration had affected genes modulating the imatinib response. Southern blot analysis demonstrated clonal outgrowth of cells carrying similar integration sites. Candidate genes located near the proviral insertion sites were identified, among them the transcription factor RUNX3. Proviral integration near the RUNX3 promoter induced RUNX3 expression, and Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines with stable or inducible expression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 were protected from imatinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, imatinib treatment selected for RUNX1-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo after infection of primary bone marrow cells with Bcr-Abl and RUNX1. Our results demonstrate the utility of RIM for probing molecular modulators of targeted therapies and suggest a role for members of the RUNX transcription factor family in disease persistence in CML patients.",

Imatinib (IM), the first line treatment for CML, is excessively expensive and induces various side effects in CML patients. Therefore, it is essential to investigate a new strategy for improving CML therapy. Our immunoblot data revealed that RanGTPase activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) protein levels increased by approximately 30-fold in K562 cells compared with those in normal cells. RanGAP1 is one of the important components of RanGTPase system, which regulates the export of nuclear protein. However, whether RanGAP1 level variation influences BCR-ABL nuclear export is still unknown. In this report, using shRNA to downregulate RanGAP1 expression level augmented K562 cell apoptosis by approximately 40% after treatment with 250 nM IM. Immunofluorescence assay also indicated that three-fold of nuclear BCR-ABL was detected. These data suggest that BCR-ABL nuclear entrapment induced by RanGAP1 downregulation can be used to improve IM efficacy. Moreover, our qRT-PCR data indicated a trend of inverse correlation between the RanGAP1 and microRNA (miR)-1301 levels in CML patients. MiR-1301, targeting the RanGAP1 3' untranslated region, decreased by approximately 100-fold in K562 cells compared with that in normal cells. RanGAP1 downregulation by miR-1301 transfection impairs BCR-ABL nuclear export to increase approximately 60% of cell death after treatment of 250 nM IM. This result was almost the same as treatment with 1000 nM IM alone. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that Tyr-99 of nuclear P73 was phosphorylated accompanied with nuclear entrapment of BCR-ABL after transfection with RanGAP1 shRNA or miR-1301 in IM-treated K562 cells. Altogether, we demonstrated that RanGAP1 downregulation can mediate BCR-ABL nuclear entrapment to activate P73-dependent apoptosis pathway which is a novel strategy for improving current IM treatment for CML.

However, a significant proportion of patients treated with TKIs develop resistance because of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. Here we describe the unknown activity of the natural product berbamine that efficiently eradicates LSCs and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl clones. Unexpectedly, we identify CaMKII γ as a specific and critical target of berbamine for its antileukemia activity. Berbamine specifically binds to the ATP-binding pocket of CaMKII γ, inhibits its phosphorylation and triggers apoptosis of leukemia cells. More importantly, CaMKII γ is highly activated in LSCs but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells and coactivates LSC-related β-catenin and Stat3 signaling networks. The identification of CaMKII γ as a specific target of berbamine and as a critical molecular switch regulating multiple LSC-related signaling pathways can explain the unique antileukemia activity of berbamine. These findings also suggest that berbamine may be the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of CaMKII γ, and potentially, can serve as a new type of molecular targeted agent through inhibition of the CaMKII γ activity for treatment of leukemia.",

In particular, PD0332991 exhibited extremely high antileukemic activity against CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL cell lines in the nanomolar range by the induction of G0-G1 arrest and partially cell death through dephosphorylation of pRb and downregulation of the genes that are involved in S-phase transition. As an underlying mechanism for favorable sensitivity to the small molecules targeting CDK4/CDK6, cell-cycle progression of Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia cells was regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional modulation of CDK4 as well as Cyclin D2 gene expression under the control of BCR-ABL probably through the PI3K pathway. Consistently, the gene expression level of Cyclin D2 in Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia cells was significantly higher than that in Ph(-) lymphoid leukemia cells. Of note, three Ph(+) ALL cell lines having the T315I mutation also showed sensitivity to PD0332991. In a xenograft model, PD0332991, but not imatinib, suppressed dissemination of Ph(+) ALL having the T315I mutation and prolonged survival, demonstrating that this reagent would be a new therapeutic modality for relapsed CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL patients after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the reversal effects of down-regulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) on the chemoresistance of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patients' cells and cell lines. After treatment with the specific NHE1 inhibitor cariporide to decrease intracellular pH (pHi), the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels of the K562R cell line and cells from IM-insensitive CML patients decreased. HO-1, as a Bcr/Abl-dependent survival molecule in CML cells, is important for the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with newly diagnosed CML or IM-resistant CML. Silencing PKC-β and Nrf-2 or treatment with inhibitors of p38 pathways obviously blocked NHE1-induced HO-1 expression. Furthermore, treatment with HO-1 or p38 inhibitor plus IM increased the apoptosis of the K562R cell line and IM-insensitive CML patients' cells. Inhibiting HO-1 enhanced the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Hence, the results support the anti-apoptotic role of HO-1 induced by NHE1 in the K562R cell line and IM-insensitive CML patients and provide a mechanism by which inducing HO-1 expression via the PKC-β/p38-MAPK pathway may promote tumor resistance to oxidative stress.

        "Doc_abstract":"Disease progression in myeloid malignancies results from the accumulation of \"mutations\" in genes that control cellular growth and differentiation. Many types of genetic alterations have been identified in myeloid diseases. However, the mechanism(s) by which these cells acquire genetic alterations or \"Genomic instability\", is less well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that the genetic changes in myeloid malignancies lead to increased production of endogenous sources of DNA damage, such as, reactive oxygen species (ROS). The fusion gene BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), FLT3/ITD in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and RAS mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) result in ROS production. Increased ROS can drive a cycle of genomic instability leading to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and altered repair that can lead to acquisition of genomic changes. Evidence is coming to light that defects in a main repair pathway for DSBs, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), lead to up-regulation of alternative or \"back-up\" repair that can create chromosomal deletions and translocations. This article will review evidence for activation of RAS/PI3K/STAT pathways, that lead to increased ROS, DNA damage and defective repair in myeloid diseases, a mechanism for acquisition of additional mutations that can drive disease progression.",

Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multikinase inhibitor with in vitro and clinical activity in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia, irrespective of BCR-ABL KD mutation. Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 \"gatekeeper\" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations. On the basis of its in vitro activity against FLT3 TKI-resistant F691 substitutions, further clinical evaluation of ponatinib in TKI-naïve and select TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML patients is warranted. Alternative strategies will be required for patients with TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD D835 mutations.",

CC, nested-RT-PCR and interphase D-FISH were simultaneously carried out to detect the tumor load of 7 CML patients during treatment with non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-NSCT). 40 specimens from 7 CML patients before and after allo-NSCT were analyzed. The results showed that 29 specimens were Ph (+) with different positive ratio and 3 specimens with lower cells were not analyzed by CC. 36 specimens were bcr/abl mRNA (+) by RT-PCR. 4 specimens from case 1 at 12, 18, 26 and 38 months after allo-NSCT were Ph (-) and bcr/abl mRNA (-), 4 Ph (-) bcr/abl (+) specimens containing 2 from case 1 at 9 and 10 months after allo-NSCT, 1 from case 2 at 15 months after allo-NSCT, 1 from case 3 at 12 months after allo-NSCT showed 5.4%, 0%, 16.5% and 1.5% bcr/abl (+) cells by FISH. 3 specimens with lower cells containing 2 from case 5 at 20 and 60 days after allo-NSCT and 1 from case 7 at 40 days after allo-NSCT were analyzed by FISH and showed 55.0%, 27.5% and 73.5% bcr/abl (+) cells. The Ph (-) bcr/abl (-) specimen from case 1 at 12 months post-allo-NSCT showed 0% bcr/abl (+) cells by FISH.

When specimen with lower cells can not be analyzed by CC in early period after allo-NSCT, or result of CC can not evaluate precisely dynamic change of tumor load and when tumor load in treated patient are lower to Ph (-) by CC while bcr/abl mRNA (+) by RT-PCR, FISH must be used to detect precisely tumor load and monitor dynamic change of it.

A significant anti-angiogenic effect was also observed after HU treatment, contrasting with IFN administration or combination regimens (IFN plus HU).

The success of this approach relies on the identification of molecular pathways that selectively regulate CSC function. Using BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a disease model for CSCs, we show that BCR-ABL downregulates the Blk gene (encoding B-lymphoid kinase) through c-Myc in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in CML mice and that Blk functions as a tumor suppressor in LSCs but does not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hematopoiesis. Blk suppresses LSC function through a pathway involving an upstream regulator, Pax5, and a downstream effector, p27. Inhibition of this Blk pathway accelerates CML development, whereas increased activity of the Blk pathway delays CML development. Blk also suppresses the proliferation of human CML stem cells. Our results show the feasibility of selectively targeting LSCs, an approach that should be applicable to other cancers.",

Not surprisingly, TRAIL is downregulated in a variety of tumor cells, including BCR-ABL-positive leukemia. Although we know much about the molecular basis of TRAIL-mediated cell killing, the mechanism responsible for TRAIL inhibition in tumors remains elusive because (a) TRAIL can be regulated by retinoic acid (RA); (b) the tumor antigen preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) was shown to inhibit transcription of RA receptor target genes through the polycomb protein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2); and (c) we have found that TRAIL is inversely correlated with BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Thus, we decided to investigate the association of PRAME, EZH2 and TRAIL in BCR-ABL-positive leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that PRAME, but not EZH2, is upregulated in BCR-ABL cells and is associated with the progression of disease in CML patients. There is a positive correlation between PRAME and BCR-ABL and an inverse correlation between PRAME and TRAIL in these patients. Importantly, knocking down PRAME or EZH2 by RNA interference in a BCR-ABL-positive cell line restores TRAIL expression. Moreover, there is an enrichment of EZH2 binding on the promoter region of TRAIL in a CML cell line. This binding is lost after PRAME knockdown. Finally, knocking down PRAME or EZH2, and consequently induction of TRAIL expression, enhances Imatinib sensibility. Taken together, our data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism responsible for lowering TRAIL expression and provide the basis of alternative targets for combined therapeutic strategies for CML.",

Nevertheless, resistance or intolerance to imatinib and other BCR/ABL inhibitors may occur during therapy. Therefore, CML research is focusing on novel targets and targeted drugs. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in mitosis. In this study, we examined the expression of Plk1 in CML cells and its potential role as a therapeutic target. Plk1 was found to be expressed in phosphorylated form in the CML cell line K562 as well as in primary CML cells in all patients tested. Inhibition of BCR/ABL by imatinib or nilotinib (AMN107) led to decreased expression of the Plk1 protein in CML cells, suggesting that BCR/ABL promotes Plk1 generation. Silencing of Plk1 in CML cells by a small interfering RNA approach was followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Plk1-targeting drug BI 2536 was found to inhibit proliferation of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, including leukemic cells, carrying the T315 mutation of BCR/ABL with reasonable IC(50) values (1-50 nmol/L). The growth-inhibitory effects of BI 2536 on CML cells were found to be associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, BI 2536 was found to synergize with imatinib and nilotinib in producing growth inhibition in CML cells.

It therefore represents a challenging disease for T-cell immunotherapeutics. The CD19/CD3 bi-specific antibody construct blinatumomab (AMG103 or MT103) has been tested clinically in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia but has not been assessed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We investigated whether blinatumomab could overcome T-cell dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in vitro. Blinatumomab was tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 28 patients (treatment naïve and previously treated). T-cell activation and function, as well as cytotoxicity against leukemic tumor cells were measured. Blinatumomab induced T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion and granzyme B release in a manner similar to that occurring with stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads. However, only blinatumomab was able to induce tumor cell death and this was found to require blinatumomab-mediated conjugate formation between T cells and tumor cells. Cytotoxicity of tumor cells was observed at very low T-cell:tumor cell ratios. A three-dimensional model based on confocal microscopy suggested that up to 11 tumor cells could cluster round each T cell. Importantly, blinatumomab induced cytotoxicity against tumor cells in samples from both treatment-naïve and treated patients, and in the presence of co-culture pro-survival signals. The potent cytotoxic action of blinatumomab on tumor cells appears to involve conjugation of T cells with tumor cells at both the activation and effector stages. The efficacy of blinatumomab in vitro suggests that the bi-specific antibody approach may be a powerful immunotherapeutic strategy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is initiated and driven by the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Despite major advances in the treatment of this highly aggressive disease with potent inhibitors of the BCR-ABL kinase such as dasatinib, patients in remission frequently relapse due to persistent minimal residual disease possibly supported, at least in part, by salutary cytokine-driven signaling within the hematopoietic microenvironment. Using a mouse model of Ph+ ALL that accurately mimics the genetics, clinical behavior, and therapeutic response of the human disease, we show that a combination of 2 agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (dasatinib and ruxolitinib, which inhibit BCR-ABL and Janus kinases, respectively), significantly extends survival by targeting parallel signaling pathways. Although the BCR-ABL kinase cancels the cytokine requirement of immature leukemic B cells, dasatinib therapy restores cytokine dependency and sensitizes leukemic cells to ruxolitinib. As predicted, ruxolitinib alone had no significant antileukemic effect in this model, but it prevented relapse when administered with dasatinib. The combination of dasatinib, ruxolitinib, and the corticosteroid dexamethasone yielded more durable remissions, in some cases after completion of therapy, avoiding the potential toxicity of other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

We recently identified several features of CML CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells expected to confer resistance to BCR-ABL-targeted therapeutics. From a study of 25 initially chronic-phase patients, we now demonstrate that some, but not all, of these parameters correlate with subsequent clinical response to IM therapy. CD34(+) cells from the 14 IM nonresponders demonstrated greater resistance to IM than the 11 IM responders in colony-forming cell assays in vitro (P < .001) and direct sequencing of cloned transcripts from CD34(+) cells further revealed a higher incidence of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations in the IM nonresponders (10%-40% vs 0%-20% in IM responders, P < .003). In contrast, CD34(+) cells from IM nonresponders and IM responders were not distinguished by differences in BCR-ABL or transporter gene expression. Interestingly, one BCR-ABL mutation (V304D), predicted to destabilize the interaction between p210(BCR-ABL) and IM, was detectable in 14 of 20 patients. T315I mutant CD34(+) cells found before IM treatment in 2 of 20 patients examined were preferentially amplified after IM treatment. Thus, 2 properties of pretreatment CML stem/progenitor cells correlate with subsequent response to IM therapy. Prospective assessment of these properties may allow improved patient management.",

In the present study, we identified a unique subpopulation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells coexpressing markers of endothelial cells (including VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, and Flk-1) and committed B-lineage progenitors. After long-term coculture with bone marrow stromal cells, tumor cells formed hematopoietic colonies and cords, expressed early stem- cell markers, and showed endothelial sprouting. Gene expression profiles of LSCs were altered in the presence of stromal cell contact. Stromal cell contact promoted leukemic cell VE-cadherin expression, stabilized beta-catenin, and up-regulated Bcr-abl fusion gene expression. Our study indicates that these specific tumor cells are uniquely positioned to respond to microenvironment-derived self-renewing and proliferative cues. Ph(+)/VE-cadherin(+) tumor subpopulation circumvents the requirement of exogenous Wnt signaling for self-renewal through stromal cell support of leukemic cell VE-cadherin expression and up-regulated Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity. These data suggest that strategies targeting signals in the marrow microenvironment that amplify the Bcr-abl/VE-cadherin/beta-catenin axis may have utility in sensitizing drug-resistant leukemic stem cells.",

The resulting gene product, BCR-ABL, encodes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase (TK) that is a factor in the pathology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Use of targeted therapy that inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity may lead to hematologic and cytogenetic responses in affected individuals. The oral TK inhibitor dasatinib was approved in 2006 for use in patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are unable to tolerate or have not responded to other treatments.;This paper reviews the available data on dasatinib, including its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, findings of in vitro and in vivo studies, adverse effects, and potential place in therapy.;Pertinent information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2007), EMBASE (1980-first quarter 2007), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2007) using the terms dasatinib, BMS-354825, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Sprycel, Philadelphia chromosome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All clinical studies and case reports published at the time of the search were included in this review.;Observed mutations in the amino acid sequence of BCR-ABL cause the failure of treatment with existing TK inhibitors. Dasatinib has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against BCR-ABL, including mutations that are resistant to other available TK inhibitors. Preliminary results are available from several noncomparative studies of dasatinib in patients who were unable to tolerate or were resistant to previous therapies. The 5 phases of START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) represent the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of dasatinib in the treatment of patients in all stages of CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL who had undergone previous treatment for leukemia. Dasatanib had the greatest benefit in patients in the chronic phase of CML, with complete hematologic responses in 90% of patients, 52% of whom achieved a major hematologic response. Compared with those in the chronic phase, patients in the accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML, or with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had lower responses. In the START-R trial, which compared the response to dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (800 mg/d), both regimens had comparable ability to induce a complete hematologic response (95% and 93%, respectively), although more patients achieved a major cytogenetic response with dasatinib (32% vs 7%). Adverse effects include significant myelosuppression. Dasatinib may have the potential for use in the management of nonleukemic malignancies.;Dasatinib has a wider spectrum of activity against a broader range of BCR-ABL forms than existing TK inhibitors. It has shown clinical benefit and tolerability in patients in all phases of CML, as well as in those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib illustrates the potential for targeted drug development based on an understanding of the genetic alterations leading to CML and the development of resistance to treatment.",

Targeting these mRNA by antisense oligonucleotides (AS) might offer the opportunity to decrease leukemic growth. We have tested the ability of AS to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of CD34 positive (CD34+) blood cells from 16 patients with newly diagnosed CML. CD34+ cells were isolated by an immunomagnetic technique and incubated for 16 to 18 hours with an 18 mer AS (0.25 mM). Sense oligonucleotides served as controls. The effects of AS were evaluated by clonogenic test (production of CFU-GM). Moreover, colonies were picked out and studied by RT-PCR to analyse the presence of BCR-ABL transcript. For nine patients with B3A2 transcript, the median inhibition of CFU-GM formation at day 14 was 64.0 +/- 11.2% (68.0 +/- 11.4% at day 21) and for the seven patients with a B2A2 transcript: 59.0 +/- 11.4% (72.5 +/- 12.0% at day 21).

The inducibly expressed DN Ras (N17), STAT5 (694F), and DN phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Delta p85) inhibited the growth by 90, 55, and 40%, respectively. During the growth inhibition, the expression of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 was suppressed by N17, 694F, or Delta p85; that of cyclin E by N17; and that of cyclin A by Delta p85. In addition, N17 induced apoptosis in a small proportion of K562, whereas 694F and Delta p85 were hardly effective. In contrast, coexpression of two DN mutants in any combinations induced severe apoptosis. During these cultures, the expression of Bcl-2 was suppressed by N17, 694F, or Delta p85, and that of Bcl-XL by N17. Furthermore, although K562 was resistant to interferon-alpha- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, disruption of one pathway by N17, 694F, or Delta p85 sensitized K562 to these reagents. These results suggested that cooperation among these molecules is required for full leukemogenic activities of BCR/ABL.",

In this study, 139 Thai CML patients were followed for a median period of 3 years (range 18-43 months). Clinical presentations of both BCR-ABL gene variant groups (73% e14a2+ and 27% e13a2+) were similar, although e14a2+ patients tended to be older (42 vs. 37 years) and had higher white blood cell counts than e13a2+ patients. The majority of patients in both groups presented with Sokal stage 2-3 (score >0.8) and were categorized as Hasford's intermediate- to high-risk groups (score >780). All patients received oral chemotherapy and 13% underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. None received oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the conventional chemotherapy group, the overall survival (OS) rate was slightly better in e14a2+ than in e13a2+ patients (p = n.s.). The median survival in e14a2+ and e13a2+ patients who did not receive stem cell transplantation was 49 and 33 months, respectively (p = n.s.). The type of blastic crisis in e14a2+ and e13a2+ patients was similar, being predominantly myeloid. In conclusion, CML patients in Thailand, despite being much younger, had a comparable OS with those in the Western countries, with no different OS between e14a2+ and e13a2+ patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Imatinib mesylate has proven to be the most effective treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, imatinib resistance has raised concern and prompted interest in additional strategies to achieve disease eradication. Resistance to imatinib is mainly associated with three mechanisms: acquired mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL protein, genetic amplification, and transcript overexpression of BCR-ABL rearrangement. Therefore an accurate assessment of resistance mechanism is particularly important to improve strategies to overcome resistance. In order to determine overexpression of BCR-ABL, we propose a method that correlates quantitative real time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization data from the same peripheral blood sample. The ratio between both methodologies permits to calculate the expression index (EI) for each patient. EI estimates the rate of BCR-ABL transcription per rearrangement. The median EI value, including all cases (n = 123), was 0.288; those cases (n = 13) included in percentile 90 showed an increment of EI above 1 Log (>2.88) with respect to the median value and were considered as cases with overexpression. We also evaluated the EIs using receiver operating characteristics curve; choosing an EI cutoff of 1.836 we obtained a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 61%. Using this EI cutoff value, more patients (n = 17) were included in the overexpression group. Patients within this group were resistant to imatinib and also showed a worse overall survival if compared with the remaining.",

Seventeen were transplanted in relapse, and 19 were transplanted in remission. Twenty-three patients had at least one positive bcr-abl polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay after BMT either before a relapse or without subsequent relapse. Ten of these 23 relapsed after a positive assay at a median time from first positive PCR assay of 94 days (range, 28 to 416 days). By comparison, only 2 relapses occurred in the 13 patients with no prior positive PCR assays; both patients had missed at least one scheduled follow-up assay and were not tested 2 months and 26 months before their relapse. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) of relapse associated with a positive PCR assay compared with a negative assay was 5.7 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 26.0, P = .025). In addition, the data suggest that the type of bcr-abl chimeric mRNA detected posttransplant was associated with the risk of relapse: 7 of 10 patients expressing the p190 bcr-abl relapsed, compared with 1 of 8 who expressed only the p210 bcr-abl mRNA (P = .02, log-rank test). The RR of p190 bcr-abl positivity compared to PCR-negative patients was 11.2 (confidence interval 2.3-54.8, P = 0.003), whereas a positive test for p210 bcr-abl was apparently not associated with an increased relative risk. In separate multivariable models, PCR positivity remained a statistically significant risk factor for relapse after separately adjusting for donor (unrelated and partially matched v matched, autologous, and syngeneic), remission status at the time of transplant, the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and type of conditioning regimen (total body irradiation dose of < or = 1,200 cGy v > 1,200 cGy). The PCR assay appears to be a useful test for predicting patients at high risk of relapse after BMT and may identify patients who might benefit from therapeutic interventions. The finding that the expression of p190 bcr-abl may portend an especially high risk of relapse suggests a different clinical and biologic behavior between p190 and p210 bcr-abl.",

Resistance to imatinib can arise by multiple mechanisms including amplification or mutation of Bcr-Abl, and continuity of imatinib therapy is probably a poor option for either of these patient groups. Recently, however, a structurally distinct new class of drugs, the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines, has been described, and these compounds are predicted to make different molecular contacts in the Abl kinase domain. These drugs potently target both the Bcr-Abl and Src-family kinase activities, both of which are thought to be relevant to survival of the leukemic cell. We asked whether these drugs could selectively induce cell death in murine cell line models of CML cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib by different mechanisms. We show that whereas the pyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidines are indeed highly potent in suppressing proliferation of Bcr-Abl-overexpressing imatinib-resistant cells, they are almost completely ineffective against cells expressing the T315I mutant. This implies that despite structural differences from imatinib, these drugs are unlikely to be useful in patients expressing this mutant Bcr-Abl protein, but may be effective in cases where selection of cells overexpressing the oncoprotein leads to refractoriness to imatinib.",

Although the transition to the acute terminal phase or blastic crisis is often associated with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, the molecular events which correlate the initial cytogenetic lesion with the terminal phase are poorly understood. Defective cellular DNA repair capacity is often associated with chromosomal instability, increased mutation frequency, and biologic alterations.;We, therefore, tested whether the protein product of the bcr/abl translocation (p210) could alter DNA repair after gamma-irradiation of murine cell lines expressing the bcr/abl cDNA.;The 32D cl 3 parent, 32D cl 3 pYN (containing the control vector plasmid) and each of two sources of 32D cl 3 cells expressing p210 bcr/abl cDNA (32D-PC1 cell line and 32D-LG7 subclone) showed a D0 of 1.62, 1.57, 1.16, and 1.27 Gy, respectively. Thus, expression of the p210 bcr/abl product induced a significant (p < 0.05) increase in radiosensitivity at the clinically relevant radiation therapy dose-rate (1.16 Gy/min). The increased radiosensitivity of p210 bcr/abl expressing cells persisted if cells were held before plating in a density-inhibited state for 8 hr after gamma-irradiation, indicating little effect on the repair of potentially lethal gamma-irradiation damage. The IL-3 dependent parent 32D cl 3 cells demonstrated programmed cell death in the absence of growth factor or following gamma-irradiation to 200 cGy. Expression of bcr/abl cDNA in the 32D-PC1 and 32D-LG7 sub clones abrogated IL-3 requirement of these cell lines and inhibited gamma-irradiation induced programmed cell death.;These data suggest a role for bcr/abl p210 in amplifying gamma-irradiation DNA damage or broadly inhibiting DNA repair, conditions that may stimulate further cytogenetic alterations in hematopoietic cells.",

In resistant cell lines and in primary MNCs derived from imatinib-rsistant patients, valproate restored sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of imatinib. Coexposure of cells to valproate and imatinib was associated with repression of several genes involved in Bcr-Abl transformation. In particular, the combination valproate-imatinib downregulated the expression of Bcr-Abl and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is particularly overexpressed in imatinib-resistant clones.;Data from this study suggested that administration of the clinically available HDAC inhibitor valproate may be a powerful strategy to enhance cytotoxic effects of imatinib in those patient resistant to imatinib or in which complete cytogenetic remission has been not reached.",

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible stress protein that catalyzes the degradation of heme and has recently been implicated in the regulation of growth and survival of various neoplastic cells. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and role of HO-1 in CML cells. As assessed by Northern and Western blot analysis as well as immunostaining, primary CML cells were found to express HO-1 mRNA and the HO-1 protein in a constitutive manner. Exposure of these cells to the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 resulted in decreased expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein. In addition, BCR/ABL was found to up-regulate HO-1 promoter activity, mRNA levels, and protein levels in Ba/F3 cells. To investigate the role of HO-1 for survival of primary CML cells, the HO-1 inducer hemin was used. Hemin-induced expression of HO-1 was found to protect CML cells from STI571-induced cell death. In addition, inhibition of HO-1 by zinc-(II)-deuteroporphyrin-IX-2,4-bisethyleneglycol resulted in a substantial decrease of cell viability. Furthermore, overexpression of HO-1 in the CML-derived cell line K562 was found to counteract STI571-induced apoptosis. Together, our data identify HO-1 as a novel BCR/ABL-driven survival molecule and potential target in leukemic cells in patients with CML. The pathogenetic and clinical implications of this observation remain to be elucidated.",

This study was undertaken to investigate the influence of Bcr-Abl and of the small molecule Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced neutrophilic differentiation. We show that differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells into mature granulocytes is accompanied by the increased expression of the antigens macrophage adhesion molecule-1 (Mac-1) and Gr-1, of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR), of myeloid transcription factors (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha [C/EBPalpha], C/EBPepsilon, and PU.1), and of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). In 32Dcl3 cells transfected with the bcr-abl gene (32D(Bcr-Abl)), G-CSF did not trigger either granulocytic differentiation or the up-regulation of C/EBPalpha, C/EBPepsilon, and the G-CSFR. This could be correlated to a defect in c-Myc down-regulation. In contrast, the up-regulation of PU.1 and p27(Kip1) by G-CSF was not affected by Bcr-Abl. Importantly, incubation of 32D(Bcr-Ablwt) cells with the kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate prior to G-CSF stimulation completely neutralized the effects of Bcr-Abl on granulocytic differentiation and on C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon expression. Taken together, the results suggest that the Bcr-Abl kinase induces a reversible block of the granulocytic differentiation program in myeloid cells by disturbing regulation of hematopoietic transcription factors such as C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon.",

Although the accumulating evidence supports a role of Abi1 in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and growth factor/receptor signaling, it is not clear how it contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis. We show here that Abi1 gene silencing by short hairpin RNA attenuated the Bcr-Abl-induced abnormal actin remodeling, membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase clustering and inhibited cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Although the knock down of Abi1 expression did not affect growth factor-independent growth of Bcr-Abl-transformed Ba/F3 cells in vitro, it impeded competitive expansion of these cells in non obese diabetic (NOD)/ severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice. Remarkably, the knock down of Abi1 expression in Bcr-Abl-transformed Ba/F3 cells impaired the leukemogenic potential of these cells in NOD/SCID mice. Abi1 contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis in part through Src family kinases, as the knock down of Abi1 expression attenuates Bcr-Abl-stimulated activation of Lyn.

Exploiting the selective affinity of Achatinin-H toward N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid-alpha2-6-GalNAc, we have demonstrated the presence of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins (Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs) on lymphoblasts of 70 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and on leukemic cell lines by fluorimetric HPLC and flow cytometric analysis. This study aims to assess the structural aspect of the glycotope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) and to evaluate whether these disease-specific molecules can be used to monitor the clinical outcome of ALL. The Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) were affinity-purified, and three distinct leukemia-specific molecular determinants (135, 120, and 90 kDa) were demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and isoelectric focusing. The carbohydrate epitope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) was confirmed by using synthetic sialic acid analogs. The enhanced presence of anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GP(ALL) antibody in ALL patients prompted us to develop an antigen-ELISA using purified Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) as coating antigens. Purified antigen was able to detect leukemia-specific antibodies at presentation of disease, which gradually decreased with treatment. Longitudinal monitoring of 18 patients revealed that in the early phase of the treatment patients with lower anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs showed a better prognosis. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed in other hematological disorders (n = 50) like chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as normal healthy individuals (n = 21). This study demonstrated the potential of purified Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) as an alternate tool for detection of anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GP antibodies to be helpful for diagnosis and monitoring of childhood ALL patients.",

However, one major drawback of anti-kinase therapies is the emergence of drug resistance mutations rendering the target to have reduced or lost affinity for the drug. Understanding the mechanisms employed by resistant variants not only helps in developing the next generation inhibitors but also gives impetus to clinical management using personalized medicine. We reported a retroviral vector based screening strategy to identify the spectrum of resistance conferring mutations in BCR/ABL, which has helped in developing the next generation BCR/ABL inhibitors.

Alternative therapeutic strategies to override imatinib-resistant CML are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the effect of AKI603, a novel small molecule inhibitor of Aurora kinase A (AurA) to overcome resistance mediated by BCR-ABL-T315I mutation. Our results showed that AKI603 exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity in leukemic cells. AKI603 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacities in imatinib-resistant CML cells by inducing cell cycle arrest with polyploidy accumulation. Surprisingly, inhibition of AurA by AKI603 induced leukemia cell senescence in both BCR-ABL wild type and T315I mutation cells. Furthermore, the induction of senescence was associated with enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect of AKI603 was proved in the BALB/c nude mice KBM5-T315I xenograft model. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the small molecule AurA inhibitor AKI603 may be used to overcome drug resistance induced by BCR-ABL-T315I mutation in CML.",

The actual treatment of CML patients in chronic phase is the specific abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate that induces 90% of cytogenetic responses in early-phase patients. However, resistance in long-term treated patients occurs and the allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment in resistant patients. Despite recent reports outlining the role of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells as potent antileukemic effectors, the mechanisms controlling the leukemic target recognition and lysis by activated NK cells have not been well identified. The authors' experimental data obtained on appropriate cellular models identify diverse mechanisms that could explain the increased NK-cell susceptibility of Bcr/Abl targets to NK-mediated lysis. They further delineate unexpected effects of the inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity on the cross-talk between NK and CML leukemic cells. The consequences of such discoveries are discussed in the context of combined treatments with antikinases as well as adoptive cellular therapy approaches in myeloid leukemia patients.",

Nineteen patients were evaluated every 2 to 4 weeks, and their levels of JunB expression before therapy were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy individuals. After imatinib therapy, an increase in JunB expression was found in 5 patients, all of whom achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) and molecular response (MR), with a decrease in BCR-ABL expression. JunB expression decreased to a very low level in 2 patients, both of whom showed progression to blast crisis.

We used this system to characterize the lineage and degree of maturation of the cells carrying the minor m-BCR/ABL fusion, in a follow-up of an 8-year-old boy with Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The boy was treated using a high-risk protocol and was closely monitored with FISH analysis for cells carrying the m-BCR/ABL fusion. Consecutive analysis along 2.5 years from remission showed 0.2-4.5% m-BCR/ALB(+) cells in the peripheral blood (PB), which is within the accepted background range for this method. The combined analysis found that all the m-BCR/ABL(+) cells were mature lymphocytes. Because mature lymphocytes have a long life span in the circulation, this finding supports the fact that the patient is in remission. Moreover, since mature differentiated cells have a low proliferative capacity, there is a low risk for relapse.",

Combined with chemotherapy, imatinib exerts remarkable efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed disease with a complete remission (CR) rate of 95% and a survival rate of 55% at 3 years. Profound eradication of leukemia cells not only provides patients with a better chance for receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during first CR but also contributes to durable CR even without transplantation. Despite such improvement, however, relapse does occur, mainly owing to acquisition of resistance. Growing comprehension of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to imatinib has led to the development of novel BCR-ABL inhibitors that yield higher affinity for BCR-ABL and/or potent inhibitory activity against other target molecules such as SRC family kinases. The second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors, namely dasatinib and nilotinib, are already showing clinical activity in patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL, and other novel agents are undergoing preclinical and early clinical evaluation.

The treatment of accelerated and blastic phases relies on imatinib +/- conventional chemotherapy, ideally followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as newly developed TKIs are currently evaluated within this frame.

In primary leukemic neutrophils from patients with CML, the major tyrosine phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene. In cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, CRKL was tyrosine phosphorylated, while CRK was not. We looked for changes in CRK- and CRKL-binding proteins in Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell lines which were transformed by BCR/ABL. Anti-CRK II or anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates were probed by far Western blotting with CRK II- or CRKL-GST fusion proteins to display CRK- and CRKL-coprecipitating proteins. There was a striking qualitative difference in the proteins coprecipitating with CRKL and CRK II. In untransformed cells, three major proteins coprecipitated with CRKL, identified as C3G, SOS and c-ABL. Each of these proteins was found to interact with the CRKL-SH3 domains, but not the SH2 domain. After BCR/ABL transformation, the CRKL SH3-domain binding proteins did not change, with the exception that BCR/ABL now coprecipitated with CRKL. Compared to CRKL, very few proteins coprecipitated with CRK II in untransformed, quiescent cells. After BCR/ABL transformation, both the CRKL- and CRK-SH2 domains bound to a new complex of proteins of approximate molecular weight 105-120 kDa. The major protein in this complex was identified as p120CBL. Thus, in these hematopoietic cell lines, CRKL is involved to a greater extent than CRK II in normal signaling pathways that involve c-ABL, C3G and SOS. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CRKL but not CRK II, appears to form complexes which potentially link BCR/ABL, c-ABL, C3G, and SOS to the protooncoprotein, p120CBL.",

We developed animal models of obesity and leukemia to test whether obesity could directly accelerate acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using BCR/ABL transgenic and AKR/J mice weaned onto a high-fat diet. Mice were observed until development of progressive ALL. Although obese and control BCR/ABL mice had similar median survival, older obese mice had accelerated ALL onset, implying a time-dependent effect of obesity on ALL. Obese AKR mice developed ALL significantly earlier than controls. The effect of obesity was not explained by WBC count, thymus/spleen weight, or ALL phenotype. However, obese AKR mice had higher leptin, insulin, and interleukin-6 levels than controls, and these obesity-related hormones all have potential roles in leukemia pathogenesis. In conclusion, obesity directly accelerates presentation of ALL, likely by increasing the risk of an early event in leukemogenesis. This is the first study to show that obesity can directly accelerate the progression of ALL. Thus, the observed associations between obesity and leukemia incidence are likely to be directly related to biological effects of obesity.",

In this study, microarray analysis revealed that c-Jun, a monopoiesis-promoting transcription factor, was downregulated in CML neutrophils. BCR-ABL directly inhibited c-Jun expression, as c-Jun downregulation in primary CML neutrophils and in the CML blast cell lines, KCL22 and K562, was reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. We established a myeloid differentiation model in KCL22 cells using zinc-inducible CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha (KCL22/alpha). Myeloid differentiation was observed in C/EBP-induced KCL22/alpha cells. Imatinib-induced c-Jun upregulation promoted the monocytic differentiation of KCL22/alpha cells. c-Jun knockdown in KCL22/alpha cells by a short interfering RNA redirected their differentiation from the monocytic to the neutrophilic lineage, even after imatinib treatment. A blockade of PI3K-Akt signaling with an Akt inhibitor upregulated c-Jun and induced the monocytic differentiation of KCL22, K562, and C/EBP-induced KCL22/alpha cells. Thus, BCR-ABL downregulates c-Jun expression by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway during CML-CP, thereby allowing C/EBPs to promote neutrophil differentiation.",

Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain lead to the constitutive activation of the FLT3 kinase inducing the activation of multiple genes, which may result in the expression of leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs). We analyzed the regulation of LAA in FLT3-wild-type (WT)- and FLT3-ITD(+) myeloid cells to identify potential targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy for AML patients. Antigens, such as PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin, WT-1 and PRAME, were upregulated by constitutively active FLT3-ITD as well as FLT3-WT activated by FLT3 ligand (FL). Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) clones against PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin and an AML-directed CTL clone recognized AML cell lines and primary AML blasts expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as FLT3-WT(+) myeloid dendritic cells in the presence of FL. Downregulation of FLT3 led to the abolishment of CTL recognition. Comparing our findings concerning LAA upregulation by the FLT3 kinase with those already made for the Bcr-Abl kinase, we found analogies in the LAA expression pattern.

The NLS function of BCR-ABL is re-activated by a kinase inhibitor, imatinib, and in a kinase-defective BCR-ABL mutant. The mechanism of this kinase-dependent inhibition of the NLS function is not understood.;By examining the subcellular localization of mutant BCR-ABL proteins under conditions of imatinib and/or leptomycin B treatment to inhibit nuclear export, we have found that mutations of three specific tyrosines (Y232, Y253, Y257, according to ABL-1a numbering) in the kinase domain can inhibit the NLS function of kinase-proficient and kinase-defective BCR-ABL. Interestingly, binding of imatinib to the kinase-defective tyrosine-mutant restored the NLS function, suggesting that the kinase domain conformation induced by imatinib-binding is critical to the re-activation of the NLS function. The C-terminal region of ABL contains an F-actin binding domain (FABD). We examined the subcellular localization of several FABD-mutants and found that this domain is also required for the activated kinase to inhibit the NLS function; however, the binding to F-actin per se is not important. Furthermore, we found that some of the C-terminal deletions reduced the kinase sensitivity to imatinib.;Results from this study suggest that an autophosphorylation-dependent kinase conformation together with the C-terminal region including the FABD imposes a blockade of the BCR-ABL NLS function. Conversely, conformation of the C-terminal region including the FABD can influence the binding affinity of imatinib for the kinase domain. Elucidating the structural interactions among the kinase domain, the NLS region and the FABD may therefore provide insights on the design of next generation BCR-ABL inhibitors for the treatment of CML.",

Engraftment of mice with bone marrow cells infected with a bcr-abl retrovirus has been shown to elicit multiple hematopoietic disorders, including a clonal but nontransplantable hyperproliferation of erythroid and/or mast cells. Culture of spleen and bone marrow cells from such mice usually yielded mast cell lines, even when erythroid disease dominated the primary animal. The mast cells, which carried the same proviral insert as the primary disease, generally grew slowly and were neither transplantable nor clonogenic in agar until they had been cultured for several months. Unexpectedly, several bcr-abl-induced lines switched in vitro from mast cell to megakaryocytic and/or erythroid character, and one became myeloid. The dramatic phenotypic shifts seem likely to involve changes occurring within progenitor cells maintaining the clone, rather than mutation of mature mast cells. The variant lines exhibited substantial spontaneous differentiation, despite being readily transplantable and therefore fully transformed. The production of hematopoietic growth factors by the mast cell lines and their phenotypic variants may implicate an autocrine loop in their evolution. These novel bcr-abl cell lines should aid in the study of genetic events in the progression from chronic to acute leukemia and facilitate analysis of hematopoietic lineage commitment.",

Imanitib was the first BCR-ABL targeted agent approved for the treatment of CML patients and confers significant response in most patients; however, a substantial number of patients are initially refractory to the drug or may develop resistance during the course of treatment. Point mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR-ABL that impact drug binding have been identified as one of the major mechanisms of resistance. We present here an overview of the current practice in monitoring for such mutations, including the methods used, criteria for investigating and guidelines for reporting the mutations.

The ABL probe hybridized to both chromosomes 9 at band q34, while two other probes which map centromeric and telomeric of BCR on 22q11 hybridized solely with chromosome 22. For the first time, a BCR-ABL rearrangement is shown to take place on 9q34 instead of in the usual location on 22q11. A rearrangement in the latter site is found in all Ph-positive CML and in almost all investigated CML with variant Ph or Ph-negative, BCR-positive cases. The few aberrant chromosomal localizations of BCR-ABL recombinant genes found previously were apparently the result of complex and successive changes. Furthermore in patient 2, both chromosomes 9 showed positive FISH signals with both ABL and BCR probes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated that mitotic recombination had occurred on the long arm of chromosome 9 and that the rearranged chromosome 9 was of paternal origin. The leukemic cells of this patient showed a duplication of the BCR-ABL gene, analogous to duplication of the Ph chromosome in classic CML. In addition they had lost the maternal alleles of the 9q34 chromosomal region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Direct sequencing of the BCR-ABL kinase domain is relatively rapid and allows detection of emerging mutations at a sensitivity of approx 20%. Mutations have been detected over a range of 242 amino acids, which spans the entire kinase domain. For optimal sensitivity, the kinase domain of the abnormal gene should be isolated by reverse-transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers that hybridize to the BCR and ABL genes. The quality of the RNA is assessed by real-time quantitative PCR prior to analysis, and BCR-ABL levels are determined. Only RNA of adequate quality is used to ensure accurate and reproducible mutation analysis. Depending on the level of BCR-ABL transcripts, a one- or two-step PCR is required to amplify the kinase domain.

We sought to determine levels of residual disease in patients with MCR using various molecular methods and to establish a relation between residual BCR-ABL transcript levels and rate of relapse in complete cytogenetic remission (CCR). Response was measured by conventional cytogenetic analysis, hypermetaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (HM-FISH, IP-FISH) of bone marrow (BM) cells, qualitative nested and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BCR-ABL transcripts. We investigated 323 peripheral blood (PB) and BM samples from 48 CML patients who achieved a complete (Ph+ 0%; n=41) or partial (Ph+ 1-34%; n=7) cytogenetic remission after 3-20 months of imatinib therapy. Prior to imatinib, 35 patients were in chronic phase (CP), eight in accelerated phase (AP), four in myeloid and one in lymphoid blast crisis. HM-FISH results correlated with ratios BCR-ABL/ABL in PB and BM. In patients with CCR, residual disease was detectable by HM-FISH (31%), IP-FISH (18%), and RT-PCR (100%). During follow-up, BCR-ABL became undetectable in two patients (one CP, one AP) by both nested and quantitative RT-PCR. CCR is ongoing in 30 evaluable patients, 11 patients have relapsed. At the time of best response, median ratios BCR-ABL/ABL were 2.1% (range 0.82-7.8) in patients with subsequent relapse and 0.075% (range 0-3.9) in patients with ongoing remission (P=0.0011). All 16 CP patients, who achieved ratios BCR-ABL/ABL <0.1% as best molecular response are in continuous remission, while 6/13 patients (46%) with ratios >/=0.1% have relapsed (P=0.0036). We conclude that: (i) in patients with CCR to imatinib, HM-FISH and RT-PCR usually reveal residual BCR-ABL+ cells; (ii) RT-PCR results derived from PB and BM are comparable in CP CML; and (iii) low levels of residual disease with ratios BCR-ABL/ABL &<0.1% are associated with continuous remission.",

Therefore, we initiated a pilot study to monitor circulating BCR-ABL+ cells and to collect, purge, and autograft peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in these patients. After GMALL 05/93 high-risk phase II of induction chemotherapy (high-dose AraC 3 g/m2 x 8 does and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 x 3 doses), patients received 5-10 micrograms/kg subcutaneous recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) daily. Mobilized CD34+ cells peaked between 20 and 26 days after starting chemotherapy at 4.8-75.6 (median 10.8) x 10(4)/mL peripheral blood (PB) (n = 5). Patients treated with additional chemotherapy cycles failed to mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ cells. PB stem cells (PBSC) were purged using a cocktail of CD10, CD19, and AB4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) coupled to immunomagnetic beads (IMB). The median recoveries of total nucleated cells (TNC) and CD34+ cells after mAb/IMB purging were 84 and 81%. The peak numbers of CD34+ cells collected in a single leukapheresis were median 8.6 x 10(6)/kg pre- and 5.2 x 10(6)/kg postpurge (n = 4). The absolute prepurge CD19+ cells were as low as median 2.7 (range 1.4-19) x 10(6) per leukapheresis. Residual BCR-ABL+ cells in unpurged leukapheresis products were assessed by limiting-log10-dilution nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as one in 10(5) to one in 10(6) normal cells and were consistently undetectable in all purged PBSC autografts. We conclude that sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells for PBSCT can be collected after phase II but not at later stages of the GMALL 05/93 high risk protocol; PBSC grafts are 3 log less contaminated with residual BCR-ABL+ cells compared to an historical series of 13 autologous BM grafts; and purging of PBSC with mAb/IMB is feasible with minor loss of CD34+ cells and abolished BCR-ABL signals in the grafts.",

Clinical trial data may not reflect the full AE profile of BCR-ABL inhibitors because of stringent study entry criteria, relatively small sample size, and limited duration of follow-up. To determine the utility of the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS) surveillance database for identifying AEs possibly associated with the BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in the postmarketing patient population, we conducted Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker disproportionality analyses of FAERS reports on AEs in relevant system organ classes. Signals consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents as well as signals for less well-described AEs were detected. Bone marrow necrosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, and peritoneal fluid retention events were uniquely associated with imatinib. AEs that most commonly reached the threshold for dasatinib consisted of terms relating to hemorrhage and fluid retention, including pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Most terms that reached the threshold solely with nilotinib were related to peripheral and cardiac vascular events. Although this type of analysis cannot determine AE incidence or establish causality, these findings elucidate the AEs reported in patients treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors across multiple clinical trials and in the community setting for all approved and nonapproved indications, suggesting drug-AE associations warrant further investigation.

These arise by multiple mechanisms such as mutation, translocation, amplification, and others. Sometimes more than one abnormality is present within a single oncogene. In other instances, a leukemia cell may contain abnormalities of several different oncogenes. Some oncogene abnormalities are relatively specific for certain leukemias and occur in almost all cases; examples include ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia or MYC in Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma. Other abnormalities are also relatively specific but occur in only some cases such as NRAS in acute myelogenous leukemia or BCL2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In other leukemias, such as most cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, oncogene abnormalities are uncommon. The precise role of oncogenes in the pathogenesis of human leukemia is unknown. Retrovirus transduced versions of some of the oncogenes modified in human leukemias cause leukemia in animals. Other oncogenes, modified or unmodified, transform animal and human hematopoietic cells in vitro. Some oncogene products are hematopoietic growth factors or growth factor receptors while others regulate cell proliferation or differentiation by diverse mechanisms. Disruption of the balance between these processes seems the most likely mechanism of oncogene related leukemogenesis. If the role of oncogenes in human leukemias can be defined, innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies may be forthcoming.",

We have developed an experimental system in which murine hematopoietic stem cell populations are infected with either v-abl or BCR/ABL retroviruses and are used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Irrespective of the form of activated abl, greater than 90% of the animals reconstituted with such cells develop tumors.

The myeloproliferative syndrome is characterized by large numbers of clonally derived, infected myeloid cells. This model will allow study of the mechanism by which activated abl genes affect hematopoietic precursors in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that introduction of an activated abl gene into the appropriate target cell, not the structure of the gene, is the major determinant in myeloid cell specificity.",

However, leukemic stem cells are insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and contribute to the persistence of disease by representing a reservoir of selfrenewing cells that replenish the disease after drug discontinuation. This finding has refocused the interest of scientists toward drug combinations, ie, treating with TKIs and simultaneously targeting alternative survival mechanisms. One candidate target mechanism is autophagy, a cellular recycling process that acts as a cytoprotective shield in CML cells in response to TKI-induced stress and in other cancer cells surviving in an inhospitable microenvironment. On that basis, inhibition of autophagy has now become an exciting option for combination treatment in cancer, and clinical trials have been initiated in solid and hemopoietic tumors such as CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. This review describes the biology of CML and elucidates how the molecular driver BCR-ABL led to the development of TKIs. We then discuss the molecular regulation of autophagy and the potential for autophagy inhibition as the next step in our attempt to tackle the problem of CML persistence to offer a curative option.",

To investigate the mechanisms behind this oncogenic stress response we used Bcr-Abl over-expressing cells cultivated in presence of imatinib. Imatinib deprivation led to rapid induction of Bcr-Abl activity and over-stimulation of PI3K/Akt-, Ras/MAPK-, and JAK/STAT pathways. This resulted in a delayed necrosis-like cell death starting not before 48 hours after imatinib withdrawal. Cell death was preceded by enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and amino acid metabolism leading to elevated ATP and protein levels. This enhanced metabolism could be linked to induction of cell death as inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis was sufficient to sustain cell viability. Therefore, these data provide first evidence that metabolic changes induced by Bcr-Abl hyper-activation are important mediators of oncogenic stress-induced cell death.During the first 30 hours after imatinib deprivation, Bcr-Abl hyper-activation did not affect proliferation but resulted in cellular swelling, vacuolization, and induction of eIF2α phosphorylation, CHOP expression, as well as alternative splicing of XPB, indicating endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Cell death was dependent on p38 and RIP1 signaling, whereas classical death effectors of ER stress, namely CHOP-BIM were antagonized by concomitant up-regulation of Bcl-xL.Screening of 1,120 compounds for their potential effects on oncogenic stress-induced cell death uncovered that corticosteroids antagonize cell death upon Bcr-Abl hyper-activation by normalizing cellular metabolism. This protective effect is further demonstrated by the finding that corticosteroids rendered lymphocytes permissive to the transforming activity of Bcr-Abl. As corticosteroids are used together with imatinib for treatment of Bcr-Abl positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia these data could have important implications for the design of combination therapy protocols.In conclusion, excessive induction of Warburg type metabolic alterations can cause cell death. Our data indicate that these metabolic changes are major mediators of oncogenic stress induced by Bcr-Abl.",

Consistent with this activity, Icsbp represses a set of genes encoding proteins that promote cell proliferation/survival. One such gene encodes Gas2, a calpain inhibitor. We previously found that increased Gas2-expression in Bcr-abl+ cells stabilized βcatenin; a Calpain substrate. This was of interest, because βcatenin contributes to disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Calpain has additional substrates implicated in leukemogenesis, including Stat5. In the current study, we hypothesized that Stat5 activity in CML is regulated by Gas2/Calpain. We found that Bcr-abl-induced, Shp2-dependent dephosphorylation of Icsbp impaired repression of GAS2 by this transcription factor. The consequent decrease in Calpain activity stabilized Stat5 protein; increasing the absolute abundance of both phospho and total Stat5. This enhanced repression of the IRF8 promoter by Stat5 in a manner dependent on Icsbp, Gas2 and Calpain, but not Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation. During normal myelopoiesis, increased expression and phosphorylation of Icsbp inhibits Calpain. In contrast, constitutive activation of Shp2 in Bcr-abl+ cells impairs regulation of Gas2/Calpain by Icsbp, aberrantly stabilizing Stat5 and enhancing IRF8 repression. This novel feedback mechanism enhances leukemogenesis by increasing Stat5 and decreasing Icsbp. Bcr-abl targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provide long term disease control, but CML is not cured by these agents. Our studies suggest targeting Calpain might be a rational therapeutic approach to decrease persistent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) during TKI-treatment.",

We design a new class of peptide inhibitors that target the substrate-binding site of BCR-ABL by grafting sequences derived from abltide, the optimal substrate of Abl kinase, onto a cell-penetrating cyclotide MCoTI-II. Three grafted cyclotides show significant Abl kinase inhibition in vitro in the low micromolar range using a novel kinase inhibition assay. Our work also demonstrates that a reengineered MCoTI-II with abltide sequences grafted in both loop 1 and 6 inhibits the activity of [T315I]Abl in vitro, a mutant Abl kinase harboring the \"gatekeeper\" mutation which is notorious for being multidrug resistant. Results from serum stability and cell internalization studies confirm that the MCoTI-II scaffold provides enzymatic stability and cell-penetrating properties to the lead molecules.

However, it is now well documented that even genetically wild-type tumor suppressors can be involved in tumorigenesis, when functionally inactivated. In particular, tumor suppressors' functions can be impaired by subtle variations of protein levels, changes in cellular compartmentalization and post-transcriptional/post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Notably, tumor suppressors inactivation offers challenging therapeutic opportunities. The reactivation of an inactive and genetically wild-type tumor suppressor could indeed promote selective apoptosis of cancer cells without affecting normal cells.;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) could be considered as the paradigm for non-genomic loss of function of tumor suppressors due to the ability of BCR-ABL to directly promote functionally inactivation of several tumor suppressors.;In this review we will describe new insights on the role of FoxO, PP2A, p27, BLK, PTEN and other tumor suppressors in CML pathogenesis.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been shown to be typical of many neoplasms. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cells carrying the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and an oncogenic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase fusion gene. While the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib has revolutionized treatment of CML, it has become increasingly clear in recent years that TKI treatment alone will not be curative in many cases. Thus, further dissection of the regulatory networks that drive BCR-ABL-induced malignant transformation may help to identify other novel therapeutic approaches that complement TKI treatment. In this study we demonstrate that the expression of miR-424 is markedly low in CML cell lines and patient samples at time of diagnosis. With the aid of bioinformatics analysis we revealed a conserved target site for miR-424 in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the ABL gene. Via luciferase assays, we showed that miR-424 directly targets BCR-ABL. Overexpression of miR-424 was shown to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of K562 cells as well as sensitize these cells to imatinib treatment. These findings strongly suggest that miR-424 acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating BCR-ABL expression. Up-regulation of miR-424 in CML cells may therefore have a therapeutic effect against this disease. ",

Multiple clones were established in vitro from two of these mice (nos. 730 and 753).

PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase I study of dasatinib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or imatinib-refractory, Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia was performed. Dose levels of 50, 65, 85, and 110 mg/m²/dose, administered orally twice daily for 28 days, with courses repeated without interruption, were studied. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with the initial dose.;A total of 39 patients (solid tumors, n = 28; chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], n = 9; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 2) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 50, 65, and 85 mg/m² dose levels. At 110 mg/m², two of six patients experienced DLT including grade 2 diarrhea and headache. In children with leukemia, grade 4 hypokalemia (50 mg/m²), grade 3 diarrhea (85 mg/m²), and grade 2 creatinine elevation (50 mg/m²) were observed. DLT in later courses included pleural effusions, hemangiomatosis, and GI hemorrhage.

Here we show that CD44 expression is increased on mouse stem-progenitor cells expressing BCR-ABL and that CD44 contributes functional E-selectin ligands. In a mouse retroviral transplantation model of CML, BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors from CD44-mutant donors are defective in homing to recipient marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and impaired induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease. By contrast, CD44-deficient stem cells transduced with empty retrovirus engraft as efficiently as do wild-type HSCs. CD44 is dispensable for induction of acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia by BCR-ABL, indicating that CD44 is specifically required on leukemic cells that initiate CML. The requirement for donor CD44 is bypassed by direct intrafemoral injection of BCR-ABL1-transduced CD44-deficient stem cells or by coexpression of human CD44. Antibody to CD44 attenuates induction of CML-like leukemia in recipients. These results show that BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic stem cells depend to a greater extent on CD44 for homing and engraftment than do normal HSCs, and argue that CD44 blockade may be beneficial in autologous transplantation in CML.",

The lack of specificity of the anticancer drug imatinib enables it to be used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, where its target is the Bcr-Abl kinase, as well as a proportion of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), where its target is the C-Kit kinase. However, imatinib also has cardiotoxic effects traceable to its impact on the C-Abl kinase. Motivated by this finding, we made a modification to imatinib that hampers Bcr-Abl inhibition; refocuses the impact on the C-Kit kinase; and promotes inhibition of an additional target, JNK, a change that is required to reinforce prevention of cardiotoxicity. We established the molecular blueprint for target discrimination in vitro using spectrophotometric and colorimetric assays and through a phage-displayed kinase screening library. We demonstrated controlled inhibitory impact on C-Kit kinase in human cell lines and established the therapeutic impact of the engineered compound in a novel GIST mouse model, revealing a marked reduction of cardiotoxicity. These findings identify the reengineered imatinib as an agent to treat GISTs with curbed side effects and reveal a bottom-up approach to control drug specificity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy that arises from the transformation of stem hematopoietic cells by the fusion oncogene BCR/ABL and subsequent clonal expansion of BCR/ABL-positive progenitor leukemic cells. The BCR/ABL protein displays a constitutively increased tyrosine kinase activity that alters many regulatory pathways, leading to uncontrolled growth, impaired differentiation and increased resistance to apoptosis featured by leukemic cells. Current CML therapy is based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), primarily imatinib, which induce apoptosis in leukemic cells. However, some patients show primary resistance to TKIs while others develop it in the course of therapy. In both cases, resistance may be underlined by perturbations in apoptotic signaling in leukemic cells. As mitochondria may play an important role in such signaling, alteration in mitochondrial metabolism may change resistance to pro-apoptotic action of TKIs in BCR/ABL-positive cells. Because BCR/ABL may induce reactive oxygen species and unfaithful DNA repair, it may affect the stability of mitochondrial DNA, influencing mitochondrial apoptotic signaling and in this way change the sensitivity of CML cells to TKIs. Moreover, cancer cells, including BCR/ABL-positive cells, show an increased level of glucose metabolism, resulting from the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis to supply ATP for extensive proliferation. Enhanced level of glycolysis may be associated with TKI resistance and requires change in the expression of several genes regulated mostly by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, HIF-1α. Such regulation may be associated with the impaired mitochondrial respiratory system in CML cells. In summary, mitochondria and mitochondria-associated molecules and pathways may be attractive targets to overcome TKI resistance in CML.",

We evaluated 3 new agents against 2 new K562 variants, IM-R1 and IM-R2 cells, which were developed having 7- and 27-fold greater IM resistance, respectively, than the parental K562 cells. Both variants possessed BCR-ABL gene amplification along with elevated levels of its transcript and protein. Greater BCR-ABL gene amplification was observed in IM-R2 cells than in IM-R1 cells, which was consistent with the higher mRNA and protein levels of Bcr-Abl, and ultimately correlated with the greater IM resistance in IM-R2 cells. No mutation in the Abl kinase domain was detected in either variant. Despite the absence of Lyn overexpression, the Src kinase inhibitor CGP76030 showed positive cooperability with IM in inhibiting cell growth of not only K562 cells but also these 2 variants. This might be because of the augmented inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation. The new Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib was 10-fold more potent than IM in inhibiting the growth of K562 cells. Nilotinib inhibited the growth of IM-R1 and IM-R2 cells as potently as K562 cells. The combination of nilotinib with CGP76030 showed little additivity, because the potency of nilotinib masked the efficacy of CGP76030. The new dual Abl/Lyn inhibitor INNO-406 (formerly NS-187) was slightly more potent than nilotinib in inhibiting the growth of all 3 cell lines. Because BCR-ABL gene amplification occurs in blast crisis, these inhibitors might overcome IM resistance in such patients' leukemia.",

This backdrop of mutant cells may be present in the majority of healthy individuals and is apparently weakly selected against. This may provide empirical support for the concept of global neutrality, or near-neutrality (very weak selection), of many somatic mutations. Many healthy individuals, as well as patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, manifest the BCR-ABL fusion gene in blood cells. The presumed neutrality of the BCR-ABL rearrangement-carrying pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells and the relative uniformity of the incidence rate of CML worldwide were used to estimate the extent of the background of BCR-ABL-positive stem cells and the numerical size of the human pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell pool. Three different approaches (molecular-epidemiological, statistical, and population genetical) were employed. Each resulted in very similar estimates of the size of the stem cells carrying the BCR-ABL allele fusions (1.4 x 10(4) cells) and the size of the total human stem cell pool (1.6 x 10(9) cells per individual). The implication of these estimates in the context of the hierarchical nature of the stem cell pool is also considered. The presumptive smaller-sized population of CD34(-) stem cells could not be characterized by any of the approaches used as a \"founding\" population, representing an ultimate source of all hematopoietic progenitors, or as a subset of stem cells comprising a deeper \"kinetic\" segment of the total (10(9)-sized) stem cell compartment.",

This chromosomal translocation results in the fusion between the 5' part of the BCR gene, normally located on chromosome 22, and the 3' part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 giving origin to a BCR-ABL fusion gene which is transcribed and then translated into a hybrid protein. In general, three breakpoint cluster regions in the BCR gene have been described: major (M-BCR), minor (m-BCR) and micro (μ-BCR). Three main variants of the BCR-ABL gene have been described depending on the length of the sequence of the BCR gene included that encode for the P190, P210, P230 proteins. Most patients (95 %) were found to have P210 protein that resulted from rearrangement in the M-BCR region in the BCR gene and thus gives rise to b2a2 or b3a2 variants. The incidence of one or other rearrangement in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients varies in different reported series. These two variants are associated with distinct clinical types of human leukemias. In this study, we report the frequencies of M-BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in 44 CML patients and we review the data on the correlations between the type of M-BCR/ABL variant and the corresponding sex, age and biological features. Forty-four untreated chronic phase CML patients were studied. The type of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). More than half of them showed b3a2 fusion transcript (64 %), while (36 %) showed b2a2 transcript. No patients coexpressed b3a2/b2a2. Correlation between biological data demonstrated that: (a) M-BCR rearrangements were not associated with the sex of the patients. (b) Patients with b3a2 rearrangements were older than patients with b2a2 transcripts. (c) M-BCR rearrangements were influenced neither by the white blood count (WBC) nor with hemoglobin levels. However, platelet level is more elevated in patients with b3a2 transcript (681.2/L vs. 207/L; P = 0.001). In conclusion, we observed significant correlations between age, platelet level and M-BCR-ABL transcript, these observations deserve further investigations.",

Transformation from chronic to blastic phase is the lethal step in CML. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the basic reason for blastic transformation. It has been shown that Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to the self-renewal capacity and proliferation of LSCs in CML. However, the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in blastic transformation of CML is still obscure. Here, we explored the relationship between BCR-ABL and β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo. We found that BCR-ABL stimulated β-catenin via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in blastic phase CML cells. Inhibition of the kinase activity of BCR-ABL, PI3K, or AKT decreased the level of β-catenin in both K562 cells and a CML mouse model and suppressed the transcription of downstream target genes (c-myc and cyclin D1). In addition, inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT pathway delayed the disease progression in the CML mouse model. To further explore the role of β-catenin in the self-renewal and survival of CML LSCs, we established a secondary transplantation CML mouse model. Our data revealed that inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT pathway reduced the tumor-initiating ability of K562 cells, decreased leukemia cell infiltration into peripheral blood and bone marrow, and prolonged the survival of mice. In conclusion, our data indicate a close relationship between β-catenin and BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT in blastic phase CML. β-Catenin inhibition may be of therapeutic value by targeting LSCs in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which may delay blastic transformation of CML.",

Identifying drugs which can efficiently block the pathways of both these disorders can be an ideal and novel strategy to treat FA. The curcumin, a natural compound obtained from turmeric is an interesting therapeutic molecule as it has been reported in the literature to combat both FA as well as leukemia. However, its complete mechanism is not elucidated. Herein, a systems biology approach for elucidating the therapeutic potential of curcumin against FA and leukemia is investigated by analyzing the computational molecular interactions of curcumin ligand with FANC G of FA and seven other key disease targets of leukemia. The proteins namely DOT1L, farnesyl transferase (FDPS), histone decetylase (EP3000), Polo-like kinase (PLK-2), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), tyrosine kinase (ABL1), and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) were chosen as disease targets for leukemia and modeled structure of FANC G protein as the disease target for FA. The docking investigations showed that curcumin had a very high binding affinity of -8.1 kcal/mol with FANC G protein. The key disease targets of leukemia namely tyrosine kinase (ABL1), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), and polo-like kinase (PLK-2) showed that they had the comparable binding affinities of -9.7 k cal/mol, -8.7 k cal/mol, and -8.6 k cal/mol, respectively with curcumin.

BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations are associated with acquired imatinib resistance, but their role in primary resistance is uncertain. Using highly sensitive ligation-PCR and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), we identified baseline TKD mutations in 21% and 42% of imatinib-naïve patients with newly diagnosed (n=26) or recurrent (n=65) Ph+ ALL, respectively (P=ns). Within 4 weeks of starting the imatinib treatment, absolute levels of mutant bcr-abl transcripts increased significantly in patients with advanced, but not with de novo, Ph+ ALL. The net expansion of pre-existing mutant clones during imatinib treatment resulted in the rapid appearance of initially undetectable TKD mutations, which after 4 weeks were detectable in 70% of patients with advanced disease. There was a high degree of concordance between the type of mutations detected at relapse and during initial imatinib treatment. The profoundly different outgrowth dynamics of leukemic clones with bcr-abl mutations in imatinib-treated patients who differ in their disease history, provides clinical-translational evidence for a contributory role of non-mutational resistance mechanisms, possibly induced by prior chemotherapy. Moreover, the prevalence of pre-existing, clinically relevant TKD may have been underestimated in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naïve patients with Ph+ ALL.",

First, we confirmed the correlation of dPCR to conventional RQ-PCR using 30 patient samples with various minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. When the sensitivity limits were determined using cell line and patient sample dilutions, rRQ-PCR and dPCR with pre-amplification showed 2-3 log improvement compared to conventional RQ-PCR, and 24 of 32 PCR negative samples as assayed by conventional RQ-PCR showed detectable BCR-ABL in rRQ-PCR and/or dPCR.

Histamine is an essential mediator and marker of basophils and is highly up-regulated in CML. We examined the biochemical basis of histamine synthesis in CML cells. The CML-specific oncoprotein BCR/ABL was found to promote expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and synthesis of histamine in Ba/F3 cells. Moreover, the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib (STI571) and nilotinib (AMN107) decreased histamine levels and HDC mRNA expression in BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cells, in the CML-derived basophil cell line KU812, and in primary CML cells. Synthesis of histamine was found to be restricted to the basophil compartment of the CML clone and to depend on signaling through the PI3-kinase pathway. CML cells also expressed histamine receptors (HRs), including HR-1, HR-2, HR-4, and histamine-binding CYP450 isoenzymes which also serve as targets of HR antagonists. The HR-1 antagonists loratadine and terfenadine, which bind to CYP450, were found to counteract proliferation of CML cells, whereas no growth inhibition was observed with the HR-1 antagonist fexofenadine which is not targeted or metabolized by CYP450. Moreover, DPPE, an inhibitor of histamine-binding CYP450 isoenzymes, produced growth inhibition in CML cells. Together, these data show that BCR/ABL promotes histamine production in CML cells and that certain HR-targeting drugs exert antileukemic effects on CML cells.",

In the context of ABL, these domains have an autoinhibitory effect on kinase activity, and mutations in this region can activate the enzyme. To determine the frequency and relevance to resistance of regulatory domain mutations in CML patients on imatinib, we screened for such mutations in a cohort of consecutive CML patients with various levels of response. Regulatory domain mutations were detected in 7 of 98 patients, whereas kinase domain mutations were detected in 29. One mutation (T212R) conferred in vitro tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance and was associated with relapse, whereas most other mutations did not affect drug sensitivity. Mechanistic studies showed that T212R increased the activity of ABL and BCR-ABL and that T212R-induced resistance may be partially the result of stabilization of an active kinase conformation.

Hence, sustained remission requires a long phase of therapy. Data indicate that a combination of different available targeted drugs might prevent treatment failure due to drug resistance, especially at advanced stages of the disease. However, for long-term multiple-drug treatments, complications can arise from side effects. We investigate whether and how the number of drugs could be reduced during long-term therapy. Using computational models, we show that one or more drugs can be removed once the number of tumor cells is reduced significantly, without compromising the chances of sustained tumor suppression. Which drug to remove first depends on the number of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene that confer resistance to the drugs, as well as on how effectively the drugs inhibit Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase activity and inhibit tumor growth. We further show that the number of CML cells at which the number of drugs can be reduced does not correlate with the two phases of decline of the BCR-ABL transcript numbers. Neither does it depend much on kinetic parameters of CML growth, except for the mutation rates at which resistance is generated. This is a significant finding because even without any information on most parameters, and using only the data on the number of cancer cells and the rate at which resistant mutants are generated, it is possible to predict at which stage of treatment the number of drugs can be reduced.",

We mobilized and collected autologous CD34(+) stem cells from 20 CML-CP patients in CCyR, 19 of whom were taking imatinib, and measured BCR-ABL expression in the apheresis products, blood and bone marrow using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR).

It is shown here that transformation of the hematopoietic cell lines Ba/F3, 32Dcl3, and MO7e with BCR/ABL results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with quiescent, untransformed cells. The increase in ROS was directly due to BCR/ABL because it was blocked by the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. Oxidative stress through ROS is believed to have many biochemical effects, including the potential ability to inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). To understand the significance of increased production of ROS, a model system was established in which hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was added to untransformed cells to mimic the increase in ROS induced constitutively by BCR/ABL. H(2)O(2) substantially reduced total cellular PTPase activity to a degree approximately equivalent to that of pervanadate, a well known PTPase inhibitor. Further, stimulation of untransformed cells with H(2)O(2) or pervanadate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of each of the most prominent known substrates of BCR/ABL, including c-ABL, c-CBL, SHC, and SHP-2. Treatment of the BCR/ABL-expressing cell line MO7/p210 with the reducing agents pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or N-acetylcysteine reduced the accumulation of ROS and also decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Further, treatment of MO7e cells with H(2)O(2) or pervanadate increased the tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL.

Both HL60 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl and naturally Ph1-positive K562 leukemia cells are resistant to most cytotoxic drugs, but were found to be sensitive to GA. Furthermore, GA sensitized Bcr-Abl-expressing cells to doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX). In contrast, in parental HL60 cells, 90 nM GA inhibited PARP cleavage, nuclear fragmentation, and cell death caused by 500 ng/ml DOX. Like GA, STI 571 (an inhibitor of the Abl kinase) sensitized Bcr-Abl-expressing cells to DOX. Unlike GA, STI 571 did not antagonize the cytotoxic effects of DOX in parental HL60 cells. These results indicate that sensitization of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells, but not desensitization of HL60 cells, depends on inhibition of Bcr-Abl.

However, these agents may also affect anti-tumor immunity. Here, we analyzed the effects of the 3 BCR/ABL-inhibitors on natural killer (NK) cell reactivity. Exposure of CML cells (K562, Meg-01) to pharmacological concentrations of Imatinib, Nilotinib and Dasatinib diminished expression of ligands for the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D to a similar extent. This resulted in comparably reduced NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production. When direct effects on NK cell responses to K562 and primary CML cells as well as activating cytokines were studied, Dasatinib was found to abrogate NK cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Nilotinib did not alter cytotoxicity but, at high levels, impaired NK cytokine production, while Imatinib had no direct influence on NK cell reactivity. Of note, Nilotinib, but not the other BCR/ABL-inhibitors increased cell death within the preferentially cytokine-secreting CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cell subset, which may, at least in part, serve to explain the effect of Nilotinib on NK cytokine production. Analysis of NK cell signaling revealed that Dasatinib inhibited proximal signaling events leading to decreased phosphorylation of PI3K and ERK that are crucial for NK cell reactivity. Imatinib and Nilotinib, in contrast, showed no relevant effect on NK cell PI3K or ERK activity. In light of the potential role of NK cells in the immunesurveillance of residual leukemia and for future combinatory immunotherapeutic approaches, our data indicate that choice and dosing of the most suitable BCR/ABL-inhibitor for a given patient require careful consideration.",

Although it is still controversial whether the 'insensitivity' of CML stem cells to treatment with TKIs is due to BCR-ABL-dependent or independent mechanisms, recent evidence indicates that treatment with IM suppresses BCR-ABL-dependent signaling in CML stem cells with no adverse effects on their survival. Treatment of CML cells with IM/TKIs induces autophagy, a genetically regulated process of adaptation to metabolic stress which may allow tumor cells to become metabolically inert, enabling their survival under conditions that may mimic growth factor/nutrient deprivation. Based on this hypothesis, TKI-induced autophagy may 'antagonize' TKI-induced cell death and inhibition of autophagy may eliminate this survival mechanism by restoring 'sensitivity' of CML stem cells to treatment with IM/TKIs. Consistent with this, recent evidence indicates that phenotypically and functionally defined CML-enriched stem cells that are insensitive to treatment with TKIs are efficiently eliminated by the combination of TKI and chloroquine, an inhibitor of late stage autophagy. Thus, inhibition of autophagy may 'sensitize' CML stem cells to treatment with TKIs, thus preserving the high specificity of TKI-based therapies.",

Differentiation therapy is considered to be a new strategy for treating this type of leukemia. Aclacinomycin A (ACM) is an antitumor antibiotic. Previous studies have shown that ACM induced erythroid differentiation of CML cells. In this study, we investigate the effect of ACM on the sensitivity of human CML cell line K562 to Bcr-Abl specific inhibitor imatinib (STI571, Gleevec). We first determined the optimal concentration of ACM for erythroid differentiation but not growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 cells. Then, pretreatment with this optimal concentration of ACM followed by a minimally toxic concentration of imatinib strongly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis compared to that with simultaneous co-treatment, indicating that ACM-induced erythroid differentiation sensitizes K562 cells to imatinib. Sequential treatment with ACM and imatinib induced Bcr-Abl down-regulation, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and caspase-3 activation, as well as decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL expressions, but did not affect Fas ligand/Fas death receptor and procaspase-8 expressions. ACM/imatinib sequential treatment-induced apoptosis was suppressed by a caspase-9 inhibitor and a caspase-3 inhibitor, indicating that the caspase cascade is involved in this apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ACM induced erythroid differentiation through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The inhibition of erythroid differentiation by p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190, p38MAPK dominant negative mutant or p38MAPK shRNA knockdown, reduced the ACM/imatinib sequential treatment-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results suggest that differentiated K562 cells induced by ACM-mediated p38MAPK pathway become more sensitive to imatinib and result in down-regulations of Bcr-Abl and anti-apoptotic proteins, growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results provided a potential management by which ACM might have a crucial impact on increasing sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib in the differentiation therapeutic approaches.",

Here, we report on the extremely rare case of adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute bilineage leukemia, which is characterized by T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Chromosome analysis showed 46,XY,del(7)(p11.2),t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) in all metaphases and a minor BCR/ABL chimeric gene was detected in these leukemic cells by PT-PCR. When the CD5+ and CD5- cells were sorted, a fusion gene of BCR/ABL and the same clonally rearranged band of a T-cell receptor (TCR) gene were detected in both populations. Nucleotide sequencing of the TCR-gamma gene revealed the clonal rearrangement of the V8-JGT2 complex in both populations. Overexpression of PU.1, which plays a fundamental role in myelomonocyte development, was found in the sorted CD34+CD7+ and CD5-, but not CD5+ cells. These results suggest that leukemic progenitor cells in the T-lineage with the del(7) and t(9;22) have the potential to differentiate into myeloid lineage, and that enforced PU.1 expression may contribute in part of this phenomenon.",

Its detection is routinely accomplished by Southern blot analysis and karyotyping. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are emerging molecular techniques that offer viable alternatives. We analyzed 40 samples of peripheral blood and bone marrow (CML, 16; acute myelogenous leukemia, 6; acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 1; chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, 2; myelodysplasias, 4; myeloproliferative disorders, unclassified, 3; nonleukemic hematologic malignancies, 3; hypercellular bone marrow, 1; normal control samples, 2; and K562 cell line samples, 2) for the presence of bcr-abl fusion gene and its messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript by FISH and RT-PCR, respectively. We compared the results with results of Southern blot analysis and karyotyping when available. Cost analysis was performed. Thirty-three samples were evaluable by FISH; 14 of 14 evaluable CML samples and one ALL sample were positive for bcr-abl by FISH (100%). The other 15 evaluable samples were negative; 16 of 16 (100%) and 13 of 16 (81%) of CML cases were positive for bcr-abl mRNA by RT-PCR (chemiluminescent blot method) and RT-PCR (colorimetric method), respectively. The ALL sample was positive by both RT-PCR methods. All other samples were negative by RT-PCR (chemiluminescent blot method), and all but 1 case of myeloproliferative disorder tested negative by RT-PCR (colorimetric method). We conclude the utility of FISH and RT-PCR is associated with certain limitations, such as insufficient RNA for RT-PCR and the occasional absence of internal positive FISH control signals. However, each procedure offers (with a high concordance rate) a specific and cost-effective alternative to Southern blot analysis and karyotyping and improved turnaround time for the detection of bcr-abl fusion gene or its mRNA transcript.",

Patients (n = 846) received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, or imatinib 400 mg once daily. At 3 months, more patients had EMR failure (ie, BCR-ABL(IS) >10%) on imatinib (33%) than on nilotinib (9%-11%); similarly at 6 months, 16% of patients in the imatinib arm vs 3% and 7% in the nilotinib arms had EMR failure. In all arms, EMR failure was associated with lower rates of molecular response, an increased risk of progression, and lower overall survival compared with EMR achievement. We also analyzed patient and treatment characteristics associated with EMR and found distinct patterns in the nilotinib arms vs the imatinib arm. High Sokal risk score was associated with a high rate of EMR failure on imatinib, but not on nilotinib. In contrast, reduced dose intensity and dose interruptions were strongly associated with EMR failure in nilotinib-treated, but not imatinib-treated, patients.

Ligand-independent activation occurs as a consequence of point mutations or insertions/deletions within functionally relevant regulatory domains (JAK2) or the creation of TK fusion proteins by balanced reciprocal translocations, insertions or episomal amplification (ABL1 and JAK2). Specific abnormalities are correlated with clinical phenotype, although some are broad and encompass several World Health Organization-defined entities. TKs are excellent drug targets as exemplified by the activity of imatinib in BCR-ABL1-positive disease, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia. Resistance to imatinib is seen in a minority of cases and is often associated with the appearance of secondary point mutations within the TK domain of BCR-ABL1. These mutations are highly variable in their sensitivity to increased doses of imatinib or alternative TK inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib. Selective and non-selective inhibitors of JAK2 are currently being developed, and encouraging data from pre-clinical experiments and initial phase-I studies regarding efficacy and potential toxicity of these compounds have already been reported.",

Spleen cells from leukemic mice showed a higher percentage of slow-cycling G(0) cells in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population compared with the CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(-) populations. After ex vivo imatinib treatment, more residual cells were observed in the CD34(+)CD38(-) population than in the other populations. Although slow-cycling G(0) cells were insensitive to imatinib in spite of BCR-ABL and CrkL dephosphorylation, combination treatment with everolimus induced substantial cell death, including that of the CD34(+)CD38(-) population, with p70-S6 K dephosphorylation and decrease of MCL-1 expression. The leukemic non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mouse system with the in vivo combination treatment with imatinib and everolimus showed a decrease of tumor burden including CD34(+) cells.

In general, 3 breakpoint cluster regions in the BCR gene have been described: major (M-bcr), minor (m-bcr), and micro (mu-bcr). This study was designed to determine the frequency of BCR-ABL transcripts using one-step multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) samples at diagnosis from 548 patients were obtained with a referring diagnosis of Ph-positive (Ph+) CML, and multistep RT-PCR and newly developed one-step multiplex RT-PCR were applied on each sample. Compared with the previous multistep RT-PCR, one-step multiplex RT-PCR with the primers is the more rapid and accurate method to identify the BCR-ABL breakpoints. Most patients (538/548, 98.18%) were found to have b3a2 or b2a2, and total frequency of occurrence of c3a2, e1a2, b2a3, b1a1, and e1a3 or coexpression of b2a2 and b3a2 was less than 2.00%. No differences were observed between women and men. As the multiplex RT-PCR technique distinguishes BCR-ABL transcripts in all samples with high sensitivity and specificity, it easily could be applied at early stages of diagnosis. The incidence of one or the other rearrangement in CML patients varies in different reported series, and the frequency in each type of BCR-ABL transcript in Korean CML patients seems to be different from those of Western countries.",

Another patient lost the original mutation but acquired a more resistant new mutation and became resistant to the second TKI.;Cytogenetic clonal evolution is an independent poor prognostic factor in CML, which could explain the onset of mechanisms for second TKIs resistance to ABL kinase domain mutations.

In both cases, the overwhelmingly preferred conformation for this region is a bend-helix motif.

Chronic-phase CML patients are treated with impressive efficacy with TK inhibitors (TKi) such as imatinib mesylate (IM). However, rather than definitively curing CML, TKi induces a state of minimal residual disease, due to the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSC) which are insensitive to this class of drugs. LSC persistence may be due to different reasons, including the suppression of BCR/Abl oncoprotein. It has been shown that this suppression follows incubation in low oxygen under appropriate culture conditions and incubation times.Here we describe the culture repopulation ability (CRA) assay, a non-clonogenic assay capable - together with incubation in low oxygen - to reveal in vitro stem cells endowed with marrow repopulation ability (MRA) in vivo. The CRA assay can be used, before moving to animal tests, as a simple and reliable method for the prescreening of drugs potentially active on CML and other leukemias with respect to their activity on the more immature leukemia cell subsets.

Therefore, we assessed the variability of quantitative results obtained from 4 different laboratories in Japan, including 3 companies and Tohoku University Hospital, using identical peripheral blood or bone marrow samples of patients in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 11) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 2). RQ-PCR was designed to quantify the copy numbers of disease-specific fusion chimeras; BCR-ABL (CML) and AML1-ETO (AML). In 5 out of 13 samples, the quantitative results from 4 laboratories varied more than 10 times (up to 712 times). Thus, we next sought to determine factors affecting the variability of RQ-PCR results across laboratories, by sending back RNA and cDNA samples from each company to Tohoku University, and they were further proceed to yield quantitative data. The main difference between companies and Tohoku University was probably due to the difference of blood separation method (Blood lysis or Ficoll-Hypaque). On the other hand, the variability among 4 laboratories was the most noticeable in the PCR step, mainly attributable to the difference of primer/probe sequence among laboratories.

In particular, mouse models of CML have greatly facilitated the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of this disease and have led to the identification of new drug targets that in some cases offer the possibility of functional cure. There are currently three established CML mouse models: the BCR-ABL transgenic model, the BCR-ABL retroviral transduction/transplantation model, and the xenotransplant immunodeficient model. Each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the question of interest, some models may be more appropriate than others. In this chapter, we describe a newly developed xenotransplant mouse model to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination. The model facilitates the evaluation of the frequency of leukemic stem cells with long-term leukemia-initiating activity, a critical subcellular population that causes disease relapse and progression, through the utilization of primary CD34(+) CML stem/progenitor cells obtained from CML patients at diagnosis and prior to drug treatment. We have also investigated the effectiveness of new combination treatment strategies designed to prevent the development of leukemia in vivo using BCR-ABL (+) blast crisis cells as a model system. These types of in vivo studies are important for the prediction of individual patient responses to drug therapy, and have the potential to facilitate the design of personalized combination therapy strategies.

Samples from bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood or both were analyzed by conventional cytogenetics, Southern blot, interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). In all patients, FISH detected 1% to 12% nuclei with a BCR-ABL fusion gene, whereas Q-RT-PCR experiments were negative or weakly positive. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the BCR-ABL genomic rearrangement persists unexpressed in nonproliferating cells whatever the treatment (IFN-alpha or BMT). These data point to the need for follow-up of CML patients in CCR over an extensive period at the DNA level (FISH) to evaluate the residual disease and at the RNA level (Q-RT-PCR) to estimate the risk of relapse.

Although initially considered to have minimal effects of normal hematopoiesis, recent studies show that imatinib also inhibits the growth of some nonmalignant hematopoietic cells, including monocyte/macrophages. This inhibition could not be attributed to the known activity profile of imatinib. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that imatinib targets the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor c-fms. Phosphorylation of c-fms was inhibited by therapeutic concentrations of imatinib, and this was not due to down-regulation in c-fms expression. Imatinib was also found to inhibit M-CSF-induced proliferation of a cytokine-dependent cell line, further supporting the hypothesis that imatinib affects the growth and development of monocyte and/or macrophages through inhibition of c-fms signaling. Importantly, these results identify an additional biologic target to those already defined for imatinib. Imatinib should now be assessed for activity in diseases where c-fms activation is implicated, including breast and ovarian cancer and inflammatory conditions.",

However, imatinib failure is observed in around 25%-30% of patients.

Early evidence of imatinib resistance, when the biology of the emerging leukemia might still be relatively favorable, is the best time to switch to second-line therapy. Close cytogenetic and molecular monitoring will facilitate early intervention in appropriate cases. However, caution should be used when interpreting minimal residual disease data, and the danger of inappropriate changes in therapy based on assay fluctuations should be recognized. A significant increase in the level of BCR-ABL to a level > 0.1% on the international scale (major molecular response) should prompt a repeat BCR-ABL assay, a mutation screen, and possibly marrow cytogenetics. What constitutes a significant increase depends on the laboratory-specific measurement reliability. The possibilities of poor compliance or drug interactions should be considered. If the repeat BCR-ABL assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, or cytogenetics confirms loss of complete cytogenetic response or if a mutation is identified, a dose increase or a switch in therapy to a second-line kinase inhibitor might be indicated.

At the same time, age is the single most important prognostic factor in the development of most human cancers, including chronic myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemias initiated by Bcr-Abl oncogenic translocations. Prevailing paradigms attribute the association between aging and cancers to the accumulation of oncogenic mutations over time, because the accrual of oncogenic events is thought to be the rate-limiting step in initiation and progression of cancers. Conversely, aging-associated functional decline caused by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms is likely to reduce the fitness of stem and progenitor cell populations. This reduction in fitness should be conducive for increased selection of oncogenic mutations that can at least partially alleviate fitness defects, thereby promoting the initiation of cancers. We tested this hypothesis using mouse hematopoietic models. Our studies indicate that the dramatic decline in the fitness of aged B-lymphopoiesis coincides with altered receptor-associated kinase signaling. We further show that Bcr-Abl provides a much greater competitive advantage to old B-lymphoid progenitors compared with young progenitors, coinciding with restored kinase signaling pathways, and that this enhanced competitive advantage translates into increased promotion of Bcr-Abl-driven leukemias. Moreover, impairing IL-7-mediated signaling is sufficient to promote selection for Bcr-Abl-expressing B progenitors. These studies support an unappreciated causative link between aging and cancer: increased selection of oncogenic mutations as a result of age-dependent alterations of the fitness landscape.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mathematical models of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell population dynamics are being developed to improve CML understanding and treatment. We review such models in light of relevant findings from radiobiology, emphasizing 3 points. First, the CML models almost all assert that the latency time, from CML initiation to diagnosis, is at most ∼10 years. Meanwhile, current radiobiologic estimates, based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data, indicate a substantially higher maximum, suggesting longer-term relapses and extra resistance mutations. Second, different CML models assume different numbers, between 400 and 10(6), of normal HSCs. Radiobiologic estimates favor values>10(6) for the number of normal cells (often assumed to be the HSCs) that are at risk for a CML-initiating BCR-ABL translocation. Moreover, there is some evidence for an HSC dead-band hypothesis, consistent with HSC numbers being very different across different healthy adults. Third, radiobiologists have found that sporadic (background, age-driven) chromosome translocation incidence increases with age during adulthood. BCR-ABL translocation incidence increasing with age would provide a hitherto underanalyzed contribution to observed background adult-onset CML incidence acceleration with age, and would cast some doubt on stage-number inferences from multistage carcinogenesis models in general.",

Despite impressive advances in oncogene-directed therapeutics, genetic instability in cancer cells often manifest acquired resistance. This is particularly noted in the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapies and not more evident than for chronic myeloid leukemia. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms affecting cancer cell sensitivity and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.;In this study, we used continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib (0.6-1 μM) to select imatinib-resistant K562 cells.;Expression of BCR-ABL increased both at RNA and protein levels in imatinib-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, expression levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) were increased significantly in resistant cells, channeling sphingoid bases to the SphK1 pathway and activating sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation pathways that include the adaptor protein Crk. The partial inhibition of SphK1 activity by N,N-dimethylsphingosine or expression by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to imatinib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells and returned BCR-ABL to baseline levels. To determine the resistance mechanism-induced SphK1 upregulation, we used pharmacological inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and observed robust downmodulation of SphK1 expression and activity when AKT2, but not AKT1 or AKT3, was suppressed.;These results demonstrate that SphK1 is upregulated in imatinib-resistant K562 cells by a pathway contingent on a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT2/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. We propose that SphK1 plays an important role in development of acquired resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines.",

In the context of a gene therapy protocol for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) we examined whether the Bcr-Abl fusion protein would have either of these effects. Thus, the mechanism of cell killing by transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and subsequent ganciclovir (GCV) treatment was examined in pre-B (TonB210.1) cells and myeloid cells (32D) and in their BCR-ABL-expressing counterparts. HSV-tk-transduced cell lines, either in the presence or in the absence of BCR-ABL expression, became susceptible to GCV at concentrations which were nontoxic to the nontransduced cells. This susceptibility was represented by apoptotic cell death in all cases. Apoptosis was observed after 24 h of treatment with GCV in the tk-transduced parental cells and in the BCR-ABL-expressing TonB210.1 cells but only after a delay of more than 24 h in the 32Dp210 cells compared to 32D. Cell death in the BCR-ABL-expressing clones was preceded by S- and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest. Activation of FAS/APO-1 and caspase-8 was observed in all the tk-transduced cell lines after GCV treatment. However, the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK only partially abrogated tk/GCV-induced apoptosis. A possible role for inhibition of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) expression in the apoptosis induced by GCV was observed in the tk-transduced TonB210.1 cells but not in the 32D or 32Dp210 cells. The data demonstrate that expression of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein does not block the apoptosis induced by the HSV-tk/GCV system, suggesting that this suicide gene therapy strategy could be considered for the treatment of CML in blast crisis.",

Because the truncated isoform of protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type O (PTPROt) is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, we tested the possibility that it could potentially dephosphorylate and inactivate the fusion protein bcr/abl. Ectopic expression of PTPROt in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 indeed resulted in hypophosphorylation of bcr/abl and reduced phosphorylation of its downstream targets CrkL and Stat5, confirming that PTPROt could inactivate the function of bcr/abl. Furthermore, the expression of catalytically active PTPROt in K562 cells caused reduced proliferation, delayed transition from G0/G1 to S phase, loss of anchorage independent growth, inhibition of ex vivo tumor growth, and increased their susceptibility to apoptosis, affirming that this tyrosine phosphatase can revert the transformation potential of bcr/abl. Additionally, the catalytically inactive PTPROt acted as a trapping mutant that was also able to inhibit anchorage independence and facilitate apoptosis of K562 cells. The inhibitory action of PTPROt on bcr/abl was also confirmed in a murine myeloid cell line overexpressing bcr/abl. PTPROt expression was suppressed in K562 cells and was relieved upon treatment of the cells with 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, with concomitant hypomethylation of the PTPRO CpG island. These data demonstrate that suppression of PTPROt by promoter methylation could contribute to the augmented phosphorylation and constitutive activity of its substrate bcr/abl and provide a potentially significant molecular therapeutic target for bcr/abl-positive leukemia.",

Photolithography and fluorosilicic acid etching were used to fabricate microfluidic channels (referred to as FISHing lines) that allowed analysis of 10 samples on a glass microscope slide 0.2 µl of sample volume was used to fill a micro-channel, which resembled a 250-fold reduction compared to conventional FISH. FISH signals were comparable to conventional FISH, with 50-fold less probe consumption and 10-fold less time. Cells were immobilized in single file in channels just exceeding the diameter of the cells, and were used for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis. To test the micro-channels for application in FISH, MRD was simulated by mixing K562 cells (an established chronic myeloid leukemia cell line) carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene across 1:1 to 1:1,000 Jurkat cells (an established acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line). The limit of detection was seen to be 1:100 cells and 1:1,000 cells for FISHing lines and conventional FISH, respectively; however, the conventional method seemed to over-score the presence of K562 cells. This may in part be attributed to FISHing lines practically eliminating the chance of duplicate screening of cells and hastened the time of screening, enhancing scoring of all cells within the channels. This was compared to 1 in 500 cells on the slide being analyzed with the conventional FISH.",

Danusertib (formerly PHA-739358) is a potent pan-aurora and ABL kinase inhibitor with activity against known BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I. Here, the individual contribution of both signaling pathways to the therapeutic effect of Danusertib as well as mechanisms underlying the development of resistance and, as a consequence, strategies to overcome resistance to Danusertib were investigated. Starting at low concentrations, a dose-dependent inhibition of BCR-ABL activity was observed, whereas inhibition of aurora kinase activity required higher concentrations, pointing to a therapeutic window between the two effects. Interestingly, the emergence of resistant clones during Danusertib exposure in vitro occurred considerably less frequently than with comparable concentrations of IM. In addition, Danusertib-resistant clones had no mutations in BCR-ABL or aurora kinase domains and remained IM-sensitive. Overexpression of Abcg2 efflux transporter was identified and functionally validated as the predominant mechanism of acquired Danusertib resistance in vitro.

However, more than 95% of these patients retain detectable levels of BCR-ABL mRNA and patients discontinuing imatinib therapy almost invariably relapse, demonstrating that an imatinib insensitive population of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) persists in nearly all patients. These findings underscore the need for treatments specifically targeting the leukemia-initiating population of CML cells. While mounting evidence suggests that the LIC in the chronic phase of CML is the BCR-ABL positive hematopoietic stem cell, several recent publications suggest that during CML blast crisis, a granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) population also acquires LIC properties through activation of the beta-catenin pathway.

Epidemiology, staging biology, and monitoring techniques are reviewed.;CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that affects all lineages of hematopoiesis. Final confirmation of CML comes with detection of the Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) or BCR-ABL transcripts. The disease presents in one of three phases: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis. Progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase usually involves the accumulation of additional cytogenetic aberrations and the arising of resistance to therapy. Although at one point mortality associated with CML was high, new kinase inhibitor therapies have markedly extended the life-span of these patients. These inhibitors were derived through the initial observation of the association of the Ph with CML and the eventual identification of the BCR-ABL oncogene which arises from this translocation. Analysis of the mechanism by which BCR-ABL transforms cells identified this protein as a tyrosine kinase and led to the targeting of this activity. The majority of patients present in chronic phase, which is where these kinase inhibitors have their greatest efficacy. Monitoring of disease progression is of critical importance as the prognosis drops significantly for patients with advanced disease. Blood counts, cytogenetics, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are currently used to assess disease. Blood counts are inexpensive but lack sensitivity. Cytogenetic karyotyping while requiring specialized training provides evidence of clonal evolution. Quantitative PCR is capable of tremendous sensitivity making it well suited for assessing response to therapy and the early detection of therapy failures.;Our understanding of BCR-ABL has allowed the development of therapies, which may keep patients with CML in chronic phase indefinitely. This has created a situation in which patient monitoring is essential for detecting changes in the status of CML.

BCR-ABL expression was accompanied by the activation of the SCF receptor: c-KIT. Nilotinib inhibited this activation that was restored by SCF binding. Parallel variations were observed for mammaliam target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and mTOR complex 1 substrate S6K. The inhibition of mTORC1 restored the response of BCR-ABL cell lines to nilotinib in the presence of SCF. PI3K inhibition restored nilotinib-induced apoptosis. On hematopoietic progenitors from CML patient's bone marrows, mTORC1 inhibition also restored nilotinib sensitivity in the presence of SCF, confirming its involvement in SCF-activated survival pathway. However, this pathway seems not to be involved in the nilotinib-induced resistance of the CML stem cell population.

To examine its oncogenicity in vivo and to create an animal model for BCR/ABL-positive leukemias, we generated transgenic mice expressing p210bcr/abl driven by the promoter of the mouse tec gene, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase preferentially expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors. While the founder mice showed excessive proliferation of lymphoblasts shortly after birth and were diagnosed as ALL, the transgenic progeny reproducibly exhibited marked granulocyte hyperplasia with thrombocytosis after a long latent period, which closely resembles the clinical course of human CML. In addition, to investigate whether loss of p53 would play a role in the transition from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we crossmated p210bcr/abl transgenic (BCR/ABLtg/-) mice with p53 heterozygous (p53+/-) mice and generated p210bcr/abl transgenic, p53 heterozygous (BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/-) mice, in which a somatic alteration in the residual p53 allele directly abrogates p53 function. The BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/- mice exhibited rapid proliferation of blast cells and died in a short period compared with their wild-type (BCR/ABL-/- p53+/+), p53 heterozygous (BCR/ABL-/- p53+/-), and p210bcr/abl transgenic (BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/+) littermates. Interestingly, the normal p53 allele was frequently and preferentially lost in the tumor tissues, providing in vivo evidence that acquired loss of p53 contributes to the blastic transformation of p210bcr/abl-expressing hematopoietic cells.

Therefore, the efficacy of treatment in Ph+ ALL is still to be determined. In this study, we focused our attention on the potential benefit of rapamycin (RAPA), an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, in combination with IM on a Ph+ ALL cell line SUP-B15 and a primary Ph+ ALL sample in vitro. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that RAPA (50 nm) plus IM exerted good synergistic effect on Ph+ ALL cells. Notably, we found that IM treatment induced the abnormal activation of the components of mTOR signaling pathway and p-BCR-ABL, whereas RAPA potently eliminated this deleterious side effect induced by IM and might overcome the resistance to IM. The synergistic effect was also associated with the increase in autophagy, which seemed to have an opposite role with apoptosis in Ph+ ALL cells, and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Altogether, our results suggested that IM in combination with RAPA was more effective for Ph+ ALL cells than IM alone. ",

STAT5 is a BCR-ABL substrate and persistently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in CML cells. Activated STAT5 (pSTAT5) drives proliferation and survival of leukemic cells and contributes to initial transformation and maintenance of the disease. In cytokine-induced STAT5 signaling, phosphorylation of STAT5A on Y694 leads to nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor, followed by DNA-binding and gene induction. However, Src-family kinases (SFK) mediate cytoplasmic retention of pSTAT5A leading to attenuated target gene expression and colony formation in CML cells.;In this study we show that autophosphorylation of Y416 in the highly conserved activation loop of SFK generates a potent recruitment site for the SH2 domain of STAT5A. Binding of the SH2 domain to the activation loop is required for STAT5A(Y694) phosphorylation by SFK, but at the same time promotes the persistent cytoplasmic localization of the transcription factor as found in BCR-ABL(+) leukemia. As a consequence of the complex formation between tyrosine-phosphorylated SFK and the SH2 domain of STAT5A, the dimerization of STAT5A is impaired. We further demonstrate that constitutively active STAT5A(S710F) escapes from SFK-mediated cytoplasmic retention by enhancing STAT5A dimer stability.;Our results reveal important structural aspects of cytoplasmic pSTAT5A found in myeloid leukemias and will contribute to the understanding of STAT5A mediated cytoplasmic signaling.",

Bcr/Abl-encoded proteins exhibit elevated kinase activity compared to c-Abl, but the mechanisms of transformation are largely unknown. Some of the biological effects of Bcr/Abl overlap with those of hematopoietic cytokines, particularly interleukin 3 (IL-3). Such effects include mitogenesis, enhanced survival, and enhanced basophilic differentiation. Therefore, it has been suggested that p210Bcr/Abl and the IL-3 receptor may activate some common signal transduction pathways. An important pathway for IL-3 signaling involves activation of the Janus family kinases (JAKs) and subsequent tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription). This pathway directly links growth factor receptors to gene transcription. We analyzed JAK activation, STAT protein phosphorylation, and the formation of specific DNA-binding complexes containing STAT proteins, in a series of leukemia cell lines transformed by Bcr/Abl or other oncogenes. We also examined these events in cell lines transformed by a temperature sensitive (ts) mutant of Bcr/Abl, where the kinase activity of Abl could be regulated. STAT1 and STAT5 were found to be constitutively phosphorylated in 32D, Ba/F3, and TF-1 cells transformed by Bcr/Abl, but not in the untransformed parental cell lines in the absence of IL-3. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5 was also observed in the human leukemia cell lines K562 and BV173, which express the Bcr/Abl oncogene, but not in several Bcr/Abl-negative leukemia cell lines. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5 was directly due to the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr/Abl since it could be activated or deactivated by temperature shifting of cells expressing the Bcr/Abl ts mutant. DNA-STAT complexes were detected in all Bcr/Abl-transformed cell lines and they were supershifted by antibodies against STAT1 and STAT5. DNA-STAT complexes in 32Dp210Bcr/Abl cells were similar, but not identical, to those formed after IL-3 stimulation. It is interesting to note that JAK kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2) were not consistently activated in Bcr/Abl-positive cells. These data suggest that STATs can be activated directly by Bcr/Abl, possibly bypassing JAK family kinase activation. Overall, our results suggest a novel mechanism that could contribute to some of the major biological effects of Bcr/Abl transformation.",

In AML, 92 patients (69%) had hypermethylation detected by Southern blot at diagnosis. This hypermethylation could be confirmed by PCR in 18 of 36 tested cases (50%). Hypermethylation was not significantly associated to any clinical or hematological characteristic of the disease. In ALL, 44 patients (94%) had hypermethylation detected by Southern blot at diagnosis. This hypermethylation could be confirmed by PCR in 33 of the 43 tested cases (77%). Sensitivity of PCR assessed by dilution was 1 to 0.1%. Hypermethylation was not either significantly related to any clinical or hematologic characteristics of the disease. Seven ALL cases which were positive by PCR at diagnosis and achieved cytological CR could be tested during CR. Five cases were negative and did not relapse after 3 to 27 months in CR. One case was positive at the beginning of CR and became negative after autologous transplant. However, he relapsed after 9 months in CR, 3 months after the last negative test.

Nilotinib and dasatinib, both approved in 2010 for first-line CML-CP treatment, are more potent than imatinib and less susceptible to imatinib resistance mechanisms. Comparative clinical trials of each agent with imatinib have shown that they are associated with significantly deeper and more rapid responses than standard-dose imatinib, without compromising safety.;Given that evidence suggests achievement of an early response is predictive of improved long-term outcomes, earlier use of these compounds may lead to more rapid, deeper responses corresponding with improvements in patient outcome.

Accordingly, the natural history of the diseases has changed, and patients in complete molecular response now have the same life expectancy of their healthy coetaneous. Notwithstanding these results, ∼ 20 - 30% of patients do not respond optimally to TKIs therapy, and most of these patients are potential candidates to progress toward the accelerated or blastic phase of the disease. Unfortunately, patients who become resistant to both first- and second-generation TKIs develop BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, against which TKIs have extremely low cross-activity. In particular, none of the TKIs, with the exception of ponatinib, has significant activity against T315 mutation, which is estimated to be present in ∼ 15 - 20% of patients carrying BCR-ABL mutations. The use of omacetaxine mepesuccinate/homoharringtonine for the treatment of TKI-resistant CML patients regained interest due to its mechanism of action independent of binding to the ATP-binding pocket.

In the absence of Alox15, BCR-ABL was unable to induce CML in mice. Furthermore, Alox15 deletion impaired LSC function by affecting cell division and apoptosis, leading to an eventual depletion of LSCs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of 15-LO function impaired LSC function and attenuated CML in mice. The defective CML phenotype in Alox15-deficient animals was rescued by depleting the gene encoding P-selectin, which is upregulated in Alox15-deficient animals. Both deletion and overexpression of P-selectin affected the survival of LSCs. In human CML cell lines and CD34+ cells, knockdown of Alox15 or inhibition of 15-LO dramatically reduced survival. Loss of Alox15 altered expression of PTEN, PI3K/AKT, and the transcription factor ICSBP, which are known mediators of cancer pathogenesis.

Here we established and characterized novel CML cell lines, an imatinib-sensitive cell line, MYL, and an imatinib-resistant subline, MYL-R. Treatment with imatinib inhibited phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and CrkL in both MYL and MYL-R, even though imatinib-induced apoptosis was preferentially observed in MYL than MYL-R, indicating that the resistance is based on a BCR-ABL-independent mechanism. MYL-R showed elevated expressions of Lyn mRNA, Lyn protein, phosphorylated Lyn, and phosphorylated STAT5. Silencing of Lyn by short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in MYL-R, but not in MYL, induced significant growth-inhibition, increased caspase-3 activity, and induced partial recovery from imatinib-resistance. Expression of Bcl-2, previously reported to be associated with Lyn-mediated resistance, was not elevated in MYL-R. Expression of Bim, which plays an important role in imatinib-induced cell-killing, was not suppressed in MYL-R. These results imply that diverse mechanisms of resistance exist among cell types. Treatment of MYL-R cells with various reagents known to have anti-leukemic activity revealed that zoledronic acid and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (SCH 66336) showed strong synergism with imatinib; interferon alpha, PP2, CGP76030, and FK228 (depsipeptide) showed synergism; whereas soluble TRAIL and As2O3 showed additivity or antagonism, and 17-AAG and radicicol showed antagonism. Treatment with either PP2 or zoledronic acid induced greater growth-reduction in MYL-R than MYL. Taken together, Lyn may play an important role in imatinib-resistance in MYL-R.

Although Imatinib, the first molecularly targeted drug developed for CML has achieved a remarkable success, the emergence of resistance to this agent mitigates the prospect of a cure for this leukemia. Though a variety of resistance mechanisms can arise, in the majority of patients resistance coincides with reactivation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein. This can result from gene amplification and, more importantly, point mutations that disrupt the bind of imatinib to BCR-ABL itself. In this review, we aim to define and illuminate mechanisms of resistance and describe how drug resistance is shedding new light on kinase domain regulation.;In light of recent studies and publications, it is now clear that Imatinib exerts its inhibitory action by stabilizing the inactive non ATP-binding conformation of BCR-ABL and that mutations even outside the kinase domain can lead to enhanced autophosphorylation of the kinase, thereby stabilizing the active conformation that resists imatinib binding. So far, 25 different substitutions of 21 amino acid residues of BCR-ABL have been detected in CML patients. In addition, it has been recently illustrated that mutations preexist the onset of treatment and that some confer a more aggressive disease phenotype. Finally it has been shown that molecular remission is almost never reached through Imatinib therapy.;The most common mechanism of relapse for CML patients treated with Imatinib is the appearance of point mutations in the BCR-ABL oncogene that confer resistance to this drug.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemias and 5% to 20% of acute lymphoid leukemias are characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, a reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), generating BCR-ABL and ABL-BCR fusion genes. Cytogenetic studies have recently shown a preferential involvement of the paternally derived chromosome 9 and the maternally derived chromosome 22 in this translocation, indicating that imprinting might be involved in the formation or selection of the translocation. In this study, we have identified a BamHI polymorphism in the coding region of BCR exon 1, allowing us to investigate whether both BCR alleles are transcribed. By using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, we show that both BCR alleles are expressed in the peripheral blood cells of normal individuals.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The phenylaminopyrimidine-derivate Imatinib mesylate has been developed for targeted inhibition of the Abelson kinase (c-ABL), which is constitutively activated when translocated to the genetic locus of the breakpoint cluster region (leading to the BCR/ABL fusion gene), thereby forming the causative pathogenetic event for the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Of note, due to its physico-chemical properties, kinase specificity of Imatinib is limited. Despite of its well documented clinical efficacy mediated by inhibition of constitutively activated tyrosine kinases such as BCR/ABL in CML, PDGF-RA in HES and mutated c-kit in GIST patients, other tyrosine kinases such as Flt-3, Lck and mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK) are affected as well. Accordingly, it has recently been shown that therapeutic doses of Imatinib also target a variety of immune cells, e.g. by modulating the differentiation of dendritic cells (DC) as well as by impeding proper T-cell and macrophage function. In contrast, combining Imatinib with Interleukin 2 (IL-2) potently activates NK-cells and led to the description of a new subclass of DC, so-called IK-DC. The latter mediate Imatinib/IL-2-induced regression of tumors in pre-clinical animal models via production of high amounts of IFN-gamma and the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Thus, Imatinib exerts potent immuno-modulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, which will be discussed together with their clinical relevance in detail throughout this review.",
