While the role of BRAF(V600E) in tumorigenesis is well established, its involvement in metastasis that is clinically observed in melanoma patients remains a topic of debate. Here, we show that BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells have extensive invasion activity as assayed by the generation of F-actin and cortactin foci that mediate membrane protrusion, and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) blocks melanoma cell invasion. In a BRAF(V600E)-driven murine melanoma model or in patients' tumor biopsies, cortactin foci decrease upon inhibitor treatment. In addition, genome-wide expression analysis shows that a number of invadopodia-related genes are downregulated after BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) induces phosphorylation of cortactin and the exocyst subunit Exo70 through ERK, which regulates actin dynamics and matrix metalloprotease secretion, respectively. Our results provide support for the role of BRAF(V600E) in metastasis and suggest that inhibiting invasion is a potential therapeutic strategy against melanoma. ",

Demonstration of patients' T cell responses to BRAF(V600E) would suggest the feasibility of active specific immunotherapy targeting the mutation in these patients. In the present study, BRAF(V600E) peptides with putative binding sites for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 were used to stimulate T lymphocytes of HLA-A2-positive melanoma patients. Four of five patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive lesions showed lymphoproliferative responses to BRAF(V600E) peptide stimulation.

Here, we investigated the role of BRAF(V600E) signaling in altering gene methylation in the genome of melanoma cells using a methylated CpG island amplification/CpG island microarray system and searched for genes coupled to the BRAF(V600E) signaling through methylation aberrations. The results indicated that a wide range of genes with broad functions were linked to BRAF(V600E) signaling through their hyper- or hypomethylation. Expression of 59 genes hypermethylated upon BRAF knockdown was selectively tested and found to be largely correspondingly underexpressed, suggesting that these genes were naturally hypomethylated, and overexpressed with BRAF(V600E) in melanoma. This BRAF(V600E)-promoted hypomethylation was confirmed on genes selectively examined in primary melanoma tumors. Some of these genes were functionally tested and demonstrated to play a role in melanoma cell proliferation and invasion. As a mechanism of aberrant gene methylation driven by BRAF(V600E), expression of the DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone methyltransferase EZH2 was profoundly affected by BRAF(V600E). We have thus uncovered a previously unrecognized prominent epigenetic mechanism in the tumorigenesis of melanoma driven by BRAF(V600E). Many of the functionally important genes controlled by the BRAF(V600E) signaling through aberrant methylation may prove to be novel therapeutic targets for melanoma.",

Sustained PI3'-lipid production commonly occurs via silencing of the PI3'-lipid phosphatase PTEN or, less commonly, through mutational activation of PIK3CA, encoding the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3'-kinase-α (PI3Kα). To define the PI3K catalytic isoform dependency of BRAF-mutated melanoma, we used pharmacologic, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors in conjunction with melanoma-derived cell lines and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. Although BRAF(V600E)/PIK3CA(H1047R) melanomas were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of selective PI3Kα blockade, inhibition of BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(Null) melanoma proliferation required combined blockade of PI3Kα, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ, and was insensitive to PI3Kβ blockade. In GEM models, isoform-selective PI3K inhibition elicited cytostatic effects, but significantly potentiated melanoma regression in response to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted inhibition. Interestingly, PI3K inhibition forestalled the onset of MEK inhibitor resistance in two independent GEM models of BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma. These results suggest that combination therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be a useful strategy to extend the duration of clinical response of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies.;Although BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies elicit melanoma regression, the onset of drug resistance limits the durability of response. Here, we show that combined treatment with PI3K inhibitors significantly forestalled the onset of MEK1/2 inhibitor-resistant disease in BRAF-mutated GEM melanoma models. These results provide a conceptual framework for the combined deployment of BRAF(V600E) plus PI3K pathway-targeted inhibitors in the treatment of a subset of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma.",

Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by oncogene targeting therapy increases overall survival of patients with melanoma, but is unable to produce many durable responses. Adaptive drug resistance remains the main limitation to BRAF(V600E) inhibitor clinical efficacy and immune-based strategies could be useful to overcome disease relapse. Tumor microenvironment greatly differs between visceral metastasis and primary cutaneous melanoma, and the mechanisms involved in the antimetastatic efficacy of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors remain to be determined. To address this question, we developed a metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutant melanoma cell line and demonstrated that the antimetastatic properties of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (a research analogue of vemurafenib) require host natural killer (NK) cells and perforin. Indeed, PLX4720 not only directly limited BRAF(V600E)-induced tumor cell proliferation, but also affected NK cell functions. We showed that PLX4720 increases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, CD69 expression, and proliferation of mouse NK cells in vitro. NK cell frequencies were significantly enhanced by PLX4720 specifically in the lungs of mice with BRAF(V600E) lung metastases. Furthermore, PLX4720 also increased human NK cell pERK1/2, CD69 expression, and IFNγ release in the context of anti-NKp30 and IL2 stimulation. Overall, this study supports the idea that additional NK cell-based immunotherapy (by checkpoint blockade or agonists or cytokines) may combine well with BRAF(V600E) inhibitor therapy to promote more durable responses in melanoma.",

A number of methods are currently available to determine mutation status. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (VE1) against mutant BRAF(V600E) was generated. Its use permits assessment of the mutant protein expression throughout a tumor sample and may allow faster and cheaper determination of the mutation status in selected cases. However, for BRAF(V600E) protein expression analysis to be of clinical value, high sensitivity and specificity of the antibody is a prerequisite. In this study we analyzed 44 metastatic melanoma samples with a known BRAF(V600E) mutation status with immunohistochemical expression of the BRAF(V600E) protein. None of the 22 tumors that lacked the BRAF(V600E) mutation labeled with the antibody VE1. This set of VE1-immunonegative tumors included 4 metastatic lesions with the BRAF(V600E) mutation. All 22 tumor samples that were known to carry the BRAF mutation were immunoreactive with VE1. Sixteen of them stained strongly and homogenously throughout the tumor sample. However, 6 tumor samples contained both BRAF(V600E)-immunopositive and BRAF(V600E)-immunonegative cell populations. When the BRAF status was compared with immunoreactivity for melanocyte differentiation antigens, no significant difference in the expression of melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor, gp100, or tyrosinase was found between mutant and wild-type tumors. In addition to metastatic lesions, we also examined 20 primary melanomas for the expression of BRAF(V600E). Seven of 10 superficial spreading melanomas were immunoreactive with the antibody VE1. Five tumors were strongly and homogenously immunoreactive. In 2 primary tumors the staining was focal, involving only a subpopulation of the tumor. None of the nonsuperficial spreading melanomas was immunoreactive. In 7 primary tumors the mutation status could be analyzed: only tumors carrying the BRAF(V600E) mutation were immunoreactive with VE1. The high specificity and sensitivity of VE1 for the detection of mutant BRAF(V600E) suggests a valuable reagent for clinical purposes.

However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10% of all colon cancers), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.",

Moreover, despite recent advances in targeted therapies for patients with BRAF(V600E) mutant melanomas, acquired resistance remains a limiting factor and hence emphasises the acute need for comprehensive pre-clinical studies to increase the biological understanding of such tumours in order to develop novel effective and longlasting therapeutic strategies. Autophagy and ER stress both have a role in melanoma development/progression and chemoresistance although their real impact is still unclear. Here, we show that BRAF(V600E) induces a chronic ER stress status directly increasing basal cell autophagy. BRAF(V600E)-mediated p38 activation stimulates both the IRE1/ASK1/JNK and TRB3 pathways. Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation by active JNK releases Beclin1 whereas TRB3 inhibits the Akt/mTor axes, together resulting in an increase in basal autophagy. Furthermore, we demonstrate chemical chaperones relieve the BRAF(V600E)-mediated chronic ER stress status, consequently reducing basal autophagic activity and increasing the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest enhanced basal autophagy, typically observed in BRAF(V600E) melanomas, is a consequence of a chronic ER stress status, which ultimately results in the chemoresistance of such tumours. Targeted therapies that attenuate ER stress may therefore represent a novel and more effective therapeutic strategy for BRAF mutant melanoma. ",

Therefore, in current neuropathological practice BRAF testing is of clinical importance in tissue samples of melanoma brain metastases in order to identify cases amenable to therapy with BRAF inhibitors. BRAF mutation testing may also add additional information for differential diagnosis of primary brain tumors in selected situations, e.g., for differentiation of anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (BRAF V600E mutation in 65%) from glioblastoma (BRAF V600E mutation in < 5%). The BRAF mutation status can be tested with DNA-based methods and immunohistochemistry using a V600E mutation-specific antibody. In summary, at this point BRAF V600E testing is clinically indicated in relatively few cases of the daily clinical neuropathology practice, but has important predictive implications for patients with melanoma brain metastases.

As cell fusion has been implicated to facilitate the alteration of a cell's phenotype, we hypothesized that cells in the peritumoral stroma having a stromal phenotype that initiate recurrent tumors might originate from the fusion of tumor and stromal cells. Here, we show that in patients with BRAF(V600E) melanoma, melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART1)-negative peritumoral stromal cells express BRAF(V600E) protein. To confirm the presence of the oncogene at the genetic level, peritumoral stromal cells were microdissected and screened for the presence of BRAF(V600E) with a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, cells carrying the BRAF(V600E) mutation were not only found among cells surrounding the primary tumor but were also present in the stroma of melanoma metastases as well as in a histologically tumor-free re-excision sample from a patient who subsequently developed a local recurrence. We did not detect any BRAF(V600E) mutation or protein in the peritumoral stroma of BRAF(WT) melanoma. Therefore, our results suggest that peritumoral stromal cells contain melanoma-derived oncogenic information, potentially as a result of cell fusion. These hybrid cells display the phenotype of stromal cells and are therefore undetectable using routine histological assessments. Our results highlight the importance of genetic analyses and the application of mutation-specific antibodies in the identification of potentially recurrent-tumor-initiating cells, which may help better predict patient survival and disease outcome.

Studies suggested that tumors with this mutation are especially sensitive to BRAF inhibitors-hence the need to reliably determine the BRAF status of tumor specimens. The present technologies used to screen for this mutation fail to address the problems associated with infiltrating stromal and immune cells bearing wild-type BRAF alleles and thus may fail to detect the presence of mutant BRAF(V600E) tumors. We have developed a rapid, inexpensive method of BRAF analysis that reduces the contamination of wild-type BRAF sequences from tumor biopsies. The protocol involves a series of PCR amplifications and restriction digestions that take advantage of unique features of both wild-type and mutant BRAF RNA at codon 600. Using this protocol, mutant BRAF can be detected in RNA from mixed populations with as few as 0.1 % BRAF(V600E) mutant containing cells.",

RAF kinases play a key role in the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway which mediates cellular response to growth signals. An inhibitor of the RAS-RAF-MAPK cascade, sorafenib, has shown promising therapeutic results in treatment of several types of metastatic tumours. It can be hypothesized that metastatic melanomas with activating BRAF mutation may respond to RAF kinase-blocking therapy. The objective of the study was to analyze if the activating BRAF V600E mutation is present in metastatic melanomas.;Fine-needle aspirates from 44 metastatic melanomas were studied. The V600E mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was selected for genotyping. A Taq-Man MGB biallelic discrimination system was used. Immunocytochemical assessment of the Ki-67 antigen was used to analyze the growth fraction of cells.;Nearly 39% of metastatic melanomas had BRAF V600E mutation. Tumours with BRAF V600E mutation had a tendency to have a more aggressive clinical course. The growth fraction showed correlation with tumour progression. This study indicates that the V600E mutation is present in metastatic melanomas and occurs more often in sites without chronic sun exposure. Mutated tumours may have a more aggressive clinical course since such melanomas metastasize at an earlier stage. Determination of the BRAF mutation and the growth fraction of melanomas may add a prognostic value.;A fraction of melanoma cases possess an activating BRAF mutation and may benefit from RAF-kinase inhibitor treatment. Future studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

Activating mutations in the MAPK pathway, which includes the enzymes RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, result in constitutive signalling, leading to oncogenic cell proliferation and escape from apoptosis; therefore this pathway is a focus of crucial interest for the development of cancer drugs. In melanoma, the most commonly mutated gene is BRAF, with mutations usually occurring in about 50% of all tumours. The BRAF Val600Glu (V600E) mutation constitutes more than 90% of mutations in melanoma. V600E BRAF mutation shows a great dependency on MEK activity, and offers a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype. The use of vemurafenib and dabrafenib, agents that block MAPK signaling in patients with melanoma and the BRAF V600E mutation, has been associated with prolonged survival and progression-free survival. The frequency of V600E BRAF mutation in lung adenocarcinoma is 1.5% to 2.8%. Treatment of V600E BRAF-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with dabrafenib is under evaluation in a phase 2 trial, and could represent another milestone in individualized therapy for lung cancer patients. The next step will be a combination therapy of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib. ",

However, the mechanism(s) by which activated BRAF promotes melanoma cell cycle progression and/or survival remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that expression of BIM, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, is inhibited by BRAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling in mouse and human melanocytes and in human melanoma cells. Trophic factor deprivation of melanocytes leads to elevated BIM expression. However, re-addition of trophic factors or activation of a conditional form of BRAF(V600E) leads to rapid inhibition of BIM expression. In both cases, inhibition of BIM expression was dependent on the activity of MEK1/2 and the proteasome. Consistent with these observations, pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V600E) or MEK1/2 in human melanoma cells (using PLX4720 and CI-1040 respectively) led to a striking elevation of BIM expression. Re-activation of BRAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling led to phosphorylation of BIM-EL on serine 69 and its subsequent degradation. Interestingly, endogenous expression of BIM in melanoma cells was insufficient to induce apoptosis unless combined with serum deprivation. Under these circumstances, inhibition of BIM expression by RNA interference provided partial protection from apoptosis. These data suggest that regulation of BIM expression by BRAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling is one mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF(V600E) can influence the aberrant physiology of melanoma cells.",

This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous.

MEK inhibitor U0126 or RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF(V600E) decreased production of the immunosuppressive soluble factors interleukin (IL)-10, VEGF, or IL-6 from melanoma cells to levels comparable to those after signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 inactivation. The suppressive activity of the culture supernatants from the melanoma cells on the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha by dendritic cells upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation was markedly reduced after transduction with BRAF(V600E) RNAi, comparable to the effects observed with STAT3 RNAi transduction. No additive or synergistic effects were observed by the simultaneous transduction of RNAi for both BRAF(V600E) and STAT3. Furthermore, specific DNA binding and transcriptional activity of STAT3 were not affected by down-regulation of the MAPK signaling with the BRAF RNAi. These results indicate that the MAPK signal, along with the STAT3 signal, is essential for immune evasion by human melanomas that have constitutively active MAPK signaling and is a potential molecular target for overcoming melanoma cell evasion of the immune system.",

Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease.

Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients.

While treatment with selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors (like vemurafenib or dabrafenib) leads to high response rates but short response duration, CTLA-4 blocking therapies induce sustained responses, but only in a limited number of patients. The combination of these diametric treatment approaches may further improve survival, but pre-clinical data concerning this approach is limited. We investigated, using Tyr::CreER(T2)PTEN(F-/-)BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma mice, whether BRAF(V600E) inhibition can synergize with anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment, focusing on the interaction between the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 and the immune system. While PLX4720 treatment strongly decreased tumor growth, it did not induce cell death in BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(-/-) melanomas. More strikingly, PLX4720 treatment led to a decreased frequency of tumor-resident T cells, NK-cells, MDSCs and macrophages, which could not be restored by the addition of anti-CTLA-4 mAb. As this effect was not observed upon treatment of BRAF wild-type B16F10 tumors, we conclude that the decreased frequency of immune cells correlates to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in tumor cells and is not due to an off-target effect of PLX4720 on immune cells. Furthermore, anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment of inducible melanoma mice treated with PLX4720 did not result in enhanced tumor control, while anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment did improve the effect of tumor-vaccination in B16F10-inoculated mice.

Adding an MEK inhibitor increases this response rate to 70%. Limited data are available on the outcomes of unresectable stage III patients, and it remains unclear whether BRAF-targeted therapy can be utilized as a neoadjuvant strategy. Data on patients with advanced locoregional BRAF V600E mutant melanoma treated with BRAF-targeted therapy at Moffitt Cancer Center were analyzed to determine response rates, subsequent resection rates after tumor downsizing, pathologic responses, and patient survival. Fifteen patients with locoregional disease treated with BRAF-targeted therapy, either BRAFi alone (vemurafenib; 11 patients) or a combination of BRAFi and an MEK inhibitor (dabrafenib plus trametinib or placebo; four patients), were identified. The median age was 50 years; the median follow-up was 25.4 months. The median BRAF-targeted therapy treatment duration was 6.0 months (range 1.2-29.4 months). Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors-based evaluation demonstrated objective response in 11 patients (73.3%). Six patients underwent resection of the remaining disease after therapy. Pathological analysis showed complete pathologic response (n=2), partial pathologic response (n=2), or no pathologic response (n=2). Four of six patients undergoing surgery have been alive for more than 2 years, including three patients currently free from active disease. No complications attributable to BRAF-targeted therapy were observed in the perioperative period. Dose reduction or discontinuation because of toxicities occurred in 10/15 patients. Neoadjuvant BRAF-targeted therapy may be effective in advanced locoregional BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients in increasing resectability, yielding pathological responses, and achieving prolonged survival.

Recently, our lab showed that simultaneous activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and targeted inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by PLX4720 synergistically induces apoptosis across a spectrum of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines. As a follow-up to that study, treatment of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma lines with WNT3A and the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 also induces apoptosis. The susceptibility of BRAF-mutant lines and NRAS-mutant lines to apoptosis correlates with negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by ERK/MAPK signaling and dynamic decreases in abundance of the downstream scaffolding protein, AXIN1. Apoptosis-resistant NRAS-mutant lines can sensitize to AZD6244 by pretreatment with AXIN1 siRNA, similar to what we previously reported in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicate that NRAS-mutant melanoma share with BRAF-mutant melanoma the potential to regulate apoptosis upon MEK inhibition through WNT3A and dynamic regulation of cellular AXIN1. Understanding the cellular context that makes melanoma cells susceptible to this combination treatment will contribute to the study and development of novel therapeutic combinations that may lead to more durable responses.",

There is a need for in vivo systems that allow for mechanistic drug resistance studies and (combinatorial) treatment optimization. Therefore, we established a large collection of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), derived from BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61), or BRAF(WT)/NRAS(WT) melanoma metastases prior to treatment with BRAF inhibitor and after resistance had occurred. Taking advantage of PDXs as a limitless source, we screened tumor lysates for resistance mechanisms. We identified a BRAF(V600E) protein harboring a kinase domain duplication (BRAF(V600E/DK)) in ∼10% of the cases, both in PDXs and in an independent patient cohort. While BRAF(V600E/DK) depletion restored sensitivity to BRAF inhibition, a pan-RAF dimerization inhibitor effectively eliminated BRAF(V600E/DK)-expressing cells. These results illustrate the utility of this PDX platform and warrant clinical validation of BRAF dimerization inhibitors for this group of melanoma patients. ",

Immediate progression to melanoma is prevented by upregulation of miR-99/100, which downregulates mTOR and IGF1R signaling. mTORC1 activation through Stk11 (Lkb1) loss abrogates growth arrest of Braf(V600E) melanocytic nevi, but is insufficient for complete progression to melanoma.

Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon BRAF inhibition might contribute to the relative unresponsiveness of colorectal cancer to the first-generation BRAF inhibitors. Here, we report characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigation. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits BRAF(V600E)-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harboring BRAF(V600E) and EGFR mutation/amplification. In BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. In vivo, BGB-283 treatment leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both cell line-derived and primary human colorectal tumor xenografts bearing BRAF(V600E) mutation.

        "Doc_abstract":"During cancer development, it is well established that many genes, including tumor suppressor genes, are hypermethylated and transcriptionally repressed, a phenomenon referred to as epigenetic silencing. In general, the factors involved in, and the mechanistic basis of, epigenetic silencing during cancer development are not well understood. We have recently described an epigenetic silencing pathway, directed by the oncogenic B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) variant BRAF(V600E), that mediates widespread epigenetic silencing in colorectal cancer (CRC). Notably, the BRAF(V600E) mutation is also present in 50-70% of melanomas. Here, we show that the same pathway we identified in CRC also directs epigenetic silencing of a similar set of genes in BRAF-positive melanoma. In both CRC and melanoma, BRAF(V600E) promotes epigenetic silencing through up-regulation of v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog G (MAFG), a transcriptional repressor with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. The elevated concentration of MAFG drives DNA binding on the promoter. Promoter-bound MAFG recruits a set of corepressors that includes its heterodimeric partner BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 1 (BACH1), the chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8), and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, resulting in hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. Our results reveal a common BRAF(V600E)-directed transcriptional regulatory pathway that mediates epigenetic silencing in unrelated solid tumors and provide strong support for an instructive model of oncoprotein-directed epigenetic silencing.

The most common somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event. To investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used a BRAF(V600E) mouse model. In mice expressing BRAF(V600E) in their melanocytes, a single dose of UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. Here we show that sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB sun protection factor (SPF) 50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection. The UVR-exposed tumours showed increased numbers of single nucleotide variants and we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor in approximately 40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in human non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not thought to have a major role in melanoma. However, we show that, in mice, mutant Trp53 accelerated BRAF(V600E)-driven melanomagenesis, and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence of UVR-induced DNA damage in human melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans. Furthermore, we identify TP53/Trp53 as a UVR-target gene that cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to induce melanoma, providing molecular insight into how UVR accelerates melanomagenesis. Our study validates public health campaigns that promote sunscreen protection for individuals at risk of melanoma. ",

HMGCL expression is upregulated in BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma and hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression of HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation and tumor growth potential of human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL through an octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading to increased intracellular levels of HMGCL product, acetoacetate, which selectively enhances binding of BRAF V600E but not BRAF wild-type to MEK1 in V600E-positive cancer cells to promote activation of MEK-ERK signaling. These findings reveal a mutation-specific mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF V600E \"rewires\" metabolic and cell signaling networks and signals through the Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis to selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.

        "Doc_abstract":"Resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibitors is associated with reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling at different levels in melanoma. To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   ) and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun. Using a dominant negative approach, in vitro cell proliferation assays, western blots, and flow cytometry showed that MAPK signaling via BRAF(V600E) promotes melanoma cell proliferation at G1 through AP-1-mediated negative regulation of the INK4 family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (CDKN2C), and the CIP/KIP family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). These effects were antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of CDKN2C and CDKN1A targets CDK2 and CDK4 in vitro. In contrast to BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   )-expressing melanocytes, melanoma cells have an inherent resistance to suppression of AP-1 activity by BRAF(V600E)- or MEK-inhibitors. Here, CDK2/4 inhibition statistically significantly augmented the effects of BRAF(V600E)- or MEK-inhibitors on melanoma cell viability in vitro and growth in athymic nude Foxn1   (   nu   ) mice (P = .03 when mean tumor volume at day 13 was compared for BRAF(V600E) inhibitor vs BRAF(V600E) inhibitor plus CDK2/4 inhibition; P = .02 when mean tumor volume was compared for MEK inhibitor vs MEK inhibitor plus CDK2/4 inhibition; P values were calculated by a two-sided Welch t test; n = 4-8 mice per group).",

All cancers, such as melanoma, are molecularly heterogeneous, with drug-resistant subclones present before the treatment or emerging as a result of targeted therapies. Here, we show intralesional molecular heterogeneity in a progressing V600E BRAF-mutant melanoma metastasis from a patient treated for 7 months with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. In the single metastasis, two distinct subclones were observed, both V600E BRAF-mutant and only one with an additional G13R NRAS mutation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Although targeting the V600E activating mutation in the BRAF gene, the most common genetic abnormality in melanoma, has shown clinical efficacy in melanoma patients, response is, invariably, short lived. To better understand mechanisms underlying this acquisition of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy in previously responsive melanomas, we induced vemurafenib resistance in two V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cell lines, A375 and DM443, by serial in vitro vemurafenib exposure. The resulting approximately 10-fold more vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, A375rVem and D443rVem, had higher growth rates and showed differential collateral resistance to cisplatin, melphalan, and temozolomide. The acquisition of vemurafenib resistance was associated with significantly increased NRAS levels in A375rVem and D443rVem, increased activation of the prosurvival protein, AKT, and the MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and P38, which correlated with decreased levels of the MAPK inhibitor protein, GSTP1. Despite the increased NRAS, whole exome sequencing showed no NRAS gene mutations. Inhibition of all three MAPKs and siRNA-mediated NRAS suppression both reversed vemurafenib resistance significantly in A375rVem and DM443rVem. Together, the results indicate a mechanism of acquired vemurafenib resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cells that involves increased activation of all three human MAPKs and the PI3K pathway, as well as increased NRAS expression, which, contrary to previous reports, was not associated with mutations in the NRAS gene. The data highlight the complexity of the acquired vemurafenib resistance phenotype and the challenge of optimizing BRAF-targeted therapy in this disease. They also suggest that targeting the MAPKs and/or NRAS may provide a strategy to mitigate such resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma. ",

Over 95% of BRAF mutations are of the V600E type and specific small molecular inhibitors are currently under pre-clinical or clinical investigation. BRAF mutation status is determined by DNA-based methods, most commonly by sequencing. Here we describe the development of a monoclonal BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody that can differentiate BRAF V600E and wild type protein in routinely processed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. A total of 47 intracerebral melanoma metastases and 21 primary papillary thyroid carcinomas were evaluated by direct sequencing of BRAF and by immunohistochemistry using the BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody clone VE1. Correlation of VE1 immunohistochemistry and BRAF sequencing revealed a perfect match for both papillary thyroid carcinomas and melanoma metastases. The staining intensity in BRAF V600E mutated tumor samples ranged from weak to strong. The generally homogenous VE1 staining patterns argue against a clonal heterogeneity of the tumors investigated. Caution is essential when only poorly preserved tissue is available for VE1 immunohistochemical analysis or when tissues with only little total BRAF protein are analyzed. Immunohistochemistry using antibody VE1 may substantially facilitate molecular analysis of BRAF V600E status for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes.",

Numerous studies have focused on the role of p16(INK4a) in melanoma, but the involvement of ARF, a well-known p53 activator, is still controversial. Using a transgenic BRAF(V600E) mouse model previously generated in our laboratory, we report that loss of ARF is able to enhance spontaneous melanoma formation and cause profound sensitivity to neonatal UVB exposure. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) and ARF deletion synergize to inhibit nucleotide excision repair by epigenetically repressing XPC and inhibiting the E2F4/DP1 complex.

However, the mechanism(s) involved remains less understood. Here, we report that combinations of HDAC and BRAF inhibitors kill BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells by induction of necrosis. Cotreatment with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or panobinostat (LBH589) and the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, but caspases appeared dispensable for killing, in that inhibition of caspases did not invariably block induction of cell death. The majority of dying cells acquired propidium iodide positivity instantly when they became positive for Annexin V, suggesting induction of necrosis. This was supported by caspase-independent release of high-mobility group protein B1, and further consolidated by rupture of the plasma membrane and loss of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, as manifested by transmission electron microscopic analysis. Of note, neither the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 nor the small interference RNA (siRNA) knockdown of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) inhibited cell death, suggesting that RIPK1 and RIPK3 do not contribute to induction of necrosis by combinations of HDAC and BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. Significantly, SAHA and the clinically available BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib cooperatively inhibited BRAF(V600E) melanoma xenograft growth in a mouse model even when caspase-3 was inhibited.

Although BRAF(V600E) is a driver oncoprotein and pharmacologic target in solid tumors such as melanoma, lung, and thyroid cancer, it remains unknown whether BRAF(V600E) is an appropriate therapeutic target in hematopoietic neoplasms. To address this critical question, we generated a mouse model expressing inducible BRAF(V600E) in the hematopoietic system, and evaluated the efficacy of pathway-targeted therapeutics against primary hematopoietic cells. In this model, BRAF(V600E) expression conferred cytokine-independent growth to monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors leading to aberrant in vivo and in vitro monocyte/macrophage expansion. Furthermore, transplantation of BRAF(V600E)-expressing bone marrow cells promoted an in vivo pathology most notable for monocytosis in hematopoietic tissues and visceral organs. In vitro analysis revealed that MAP-ERK kinase inhibition, but not RAF inhibition, effectively suppressed cytokine-independent clonal growth of monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors. However, combined RAF and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition effectively inhibited cytokine-independent colony formation, suggesting autocrine PI3K pathway activation.

Here, we report that melanocytes expressing a conditionally oncogenic form of BRAF(V600E) exhibit enhanced beta-Trcp expression, increased IKK activity and a concomitant increase in the rate of IkappaBalpha degradation. Conversely, inhibition of BRAF signaling using either a broad-spectrum Raf inhibitor (BAY 43-9006) or by selective knock-down of BRAF(V600E) expression by RNA interference in human melanoma cells leads to decreased IKK activity and beta-Trcp expression, stabilization of IkappaB, inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and sensitization of these cells to apoptosis. Taken together, these data support a model in which mutational activation of BRAF in human melanomas contributes to constitutive induction of NF-kappaB activity and to increased survival of melanoma cells.",

The dysregulation of BRAF signaling has been shown to affect many molecules that promote the continual progression of melanoma. Oncogenic BRAF expression plays a vital role in promoting cell invasion and metastasis in melanoma. It is also associated with poor prognosis in metastatic melanoma. About 40% to 60% of cutaneous melanomas have BRAF mutations, and 90% of the mutations involve a specific substitution at codon 600 (BRAF V600E). In this study, we compared BRAF (V600E) mutation detection by molecular analysis with BRAF expression by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using 2 different antibodies. A total of 25 metastatic malignant melanomas were included in this study. 10 of the 25 (40%) cases were positive by molecular analysis using the COBAS 4800 BRAF V600 Real-time PCR assay, and 18 of the 25 (72%) cases were positive by IHC analysis with 2 different antibodies. All positive cases by molecular analysis were positive by both IHC stains (100%). No false negatives were obtained with either IHC stain. Eight of the 25 (32%) were false-positive by both IHC stains.

Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1 %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1 %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5 %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1 %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1 %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3 years) than wildtype cases (58.2 years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1 %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status.

For colorectal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma and gliomas BRAF V600E immunostaining is sufficient for screening purposes. We also recommend routine immunohistochemical staining followed by sequencing validation in rare CNS metastases or metastases of unknown primary.

In human melanocytes, persistent BRAF(V600E) expression triggers oncogene-induced senescence, which implies that bypass of oncogene-induced senescence is necessary for malignant transformation of melanocytes. We show that a subpopulation of primary human melanocytes with persistent expression of BRAF(V600E) do not enter oncogene-induced senescence, but instead survive despite heightened MAPK activity. Disruption of the p53 pathway using short-hairpin RNA initiated rapid growth of these V600E(+) melanocytes in vitro. The resultant V600E(+)/p53(sh) melanocytes grew anchorage-independently in soft agar, formed pigmented lesions reminiscent of in situ melanoma in artificial skin reconstructs, and were weakly tumorigenic in vivo. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis demonstrated that the transformed melanocytes acquired a substantial deletion in chromosome 13, which encodes the Rb1 tumor suppressor gene. Gene expression profiling study of nevi and melanomas showed that p53 target genes were differentially expressed in melanomas compared with nevi, suggesting a dysfunctional p53 pathway in melanoma in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrate that a subpopulation of melanocytes possesses the ability to survive BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence, and suggest that p53 inactivation may promote malignant transformation of these cells.",

In large cohorts of nevi and melanoma samples, PDK1 expression was significantly higher in primary melanoma, compared with nevi, and was further increased in metastatic melanoma. PDK1 expression suffices for its activity, owing to auto-activation, or elevated phosphorylation by phosphoinositide 3'-OH-kinase (PI3K). Selective inactivation of Pdk1 in the melanocytes of Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) or Braf(V600E)::Cdkn2a(-/-)::Pten(-/-) mice delayed the development of pigmented lesions and melanoma induced by systemic or local administration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

Pdk1(-/-) melanomas exhibit a marked decrease in the activity of AKT, P70S6K and PKC. Notably, PDKi was as effective in inhibiting AGC kinases and colony forming efficiency of melanoma with Pten wild-type (WT) genotypes.

Both drugs target the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutant BRAF that constitutively activates the pathway, and trametinib selectively inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 proteins activated by RAF kinases. The phase III study of dabrafenib in BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma reported rapid tumor regression in most patients and a 59% objective RECIST response rate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were improved compared with dacarbazine. Toxicities were well tolerated and different from those reported for vemurafenib, the first FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor. Efficacy has been demonstrated in other BRAF-mutant genotypes. The phase III study of trametinib in BRAF inhibitor-naïve patients with BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) also showed benefit with a prolonged median PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy. Trametinib is ineffective in patients who have progressed on BRAF inhibitors. A phase II trial of combined dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated higher response rates and longer median PFS than dabrafenib monotherapy, with less cutaneous toxicity. Here, we review the clinical development of both drugs as monotherapies and in combination, and discuss their role in the management of BRAF-mutant melanoma.",

In contrast, colon cancers that harbour the same BRAF(V600E) mutation are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors, due to feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we show that 6 out of 16 melanoma tumours analysed acquired EGFR expression after the development of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using a chromatin-regulator-focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, we find that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) in melanoma causes activation of TGF-β signalling, thus leading to upregulation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), which confer resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Expression of EGFR in melanoma or treatment with TGF-β results in a slow-growth phenotype with cells displaying hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence. However, EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. In a heterogeneous population of melanoma cells having varying levels of SOX10 suppression, cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are rapidly enriched in the presence of drug, but this is reversed when the drug treatment is discontinued. We find evidence for SOX10 loss and/or activation of TGF-β signalling in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples. Our findings provide a rationale for why some BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma patients may regain sensitivity to these drugs after a 'drug holiday' and identify patients with EGFR-positive melanoma as a group that may benefit from re-treatment after a drug holiday.

Given this correlation, the molecular mechanism for BRAF regulation as well as oncogenic activation has attracted considerable interest, and activated forms of BRAF, such as BRAF(V600E), have become attractive targets for small molecule inhibition. Here we report on the identification and subsequent optimization of a potent BRAF inhibitor, CS292, based on an organometallic kinase inhibitor scaffold. A cocrystal structure of CS292 in complex with the BRAF kinase domain reveals that CS292 binds to the ATP binding pocket of the kinase and is an ATP competitive inhibitor. The structure of the kinase-inhibitor complex also demonstrates that CS292 binds to BRAF in an active conformation and suggests a mechanism for regulation of BRAF by phosphorylation and BRAF(V600E) oncogene-induced activation. The structure of CS292 bound to the active form of the BRAF kinase also provides a novel scaffold for the design of BRAF(V600E) oncogene selective BRAF inhibitors for therapeutic application.",

The sensitivity of this method was determined to be as low as 0.5% for the BRAF V600E allele in a wild-type background. This method was successfully validated in 72 thyroid tumors. It detected V600E mutation in 22 out of 33 (67%) of the conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 8 out of 12 (75%) of the tall-cell variant of PTC, whereas none of the 10 follicular variant of PTC showed BRAF V600E mutation.

LKB1 is a multi-task Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates AMPK controlling cell growth and apoptosis under metabolic stress conditions. Additionally, LKB1(Ser428) becomes phosphorylated in a RAS-Erk1/2-p90(RSK) pathway dependent manner. However, the connection between the RAS pathway and LKB1 is mostly unknown.;Using the UV induced HGF transgenic mouse melanoma model to investigate the interplay among HGF signaling, RAS pathway and PI3K pathway in melanoma, we identified LKB1 as a protein directly modified by HGF induced signaling. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture revealed that LKB1(Ser428) (Ser431 in the mouse) is constitutively phosphorylated in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cell lines and spontaneous mouse tumors with high RAS pathway activity. Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells showed a very limited response to metabolic stress mediated by the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Here we show for the first time that RAS pathway activation including BRAF(V600E) mutation promotes the uncoupling of AMPK from LKB1 by a mechanism that appears to be independent of LKB1(Ser428) phosphorylation. Notably, the inhibition of the RAS pathway in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells recovered the complex formation and rescued the LKB1-AMPKalpha metabolic stress-induced response, increasing apoptosis in cooperation with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bim, and the down-regulation of Mcl-1.;These data demonstrate that growth factor treatment and in particular oncogenic BRAF(V600E) induces the uncoupling of LKB1-AMPKalpha complexes providing at the same time a possible mechanism in cell proliferation that engages cell growth and cell division in response to mitogenic stimuli and resistance to low energy conditions in tumor cells. Importantly, this mechanism reveals a new level for therapeutical intervention particularly relevant in tumors harboring a deregulated RAS-Erk1/2 pathway.",

Changes in naevi, including new naevi, hyperpigmentation and fading of existing naevi, have also been reported. In addition, some patients receiving these therapies have developed second primary melanomas. As a consequence, the importance of sequential digital dermoscopy in all patients treated with a BRAFi to detect new primary melanomas has been emphasized. A 61-year-old man with BRAF mutant stage IV metastatic melanoma was commenced on the phase 1 trial of LGX818 at 300 mg daily in 2013. After 2 months of therapy, the patient was noted to have developed eruptive naevi, fading of existing naevi and darkening of other naevi. Excision of a new pigmented lesion from the back indicated a compound naevus. Immunohistochemistry showed that the naevus cells lacked a BRAF V600E mutation. This is the first reported case of eruptive naevi in a patient treated with LGX818. The absence of the BRAF V600E mutation within a changing naevus supports the theory that BRAFi stimulates the proliferation of wild-type BRAF cells.

Med. Chem. 52, 2255-2264 (2009). There are currently no therapies known to alter the clinical course of disseminated melanoma. Mutational profiling studies have shown that the majority of melanomas harbor activating mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF at the V600E position. Preclinical work has validated mutated BRAF as a therapeutic target in melanoma, and a number of BRAF-selective small-molecule inhibitors are now undergoing clinical evaluation. The only BRAF inhibitor to be investigated extensively in clinical trials of melanoma at this time is sorafenib--a compound with very limited single-agent activity. As sorafenib has poor cellular activity against the BRAF V600E mutation, the conclusion that many researchers have arrived at is that sorafenib did not provide a test of the therapeutic value of BRAF inhibition. Thus, more highly selective BRAF inhibitors have been sought. The current paper describes the identification of a new class of BRAF inhibitors that contain pyridoimidazolone as the ATP hinge-binding domain and a rigid imidazolone group. Building upon this novel scaffold, the authors derived a series of compounds with low nanomolar potency against mutated BRAF in isolated kinase assays, and low micromolar potency in cellular assays. These new chemical leads represent a significant step forward in the search for new, potent BRAF-selective small-molecule inhibitors.",

In biliary tract cancer, reported BRAF mutation rates are highly controversial, ranging from 0 to 33% in adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder and 0 to 22% in cholangiocarcinoma. We here analyzed tissue microarrays of a large cohort of biliary tract cancer (n=377) including 159 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 149 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 69 adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder for BRAF V600E mutation using a highly sensitive immunohistochemical screening approach implementing the BRAF V600E protein-specific antibody VE1. All VE1-positive cases as well as 42 VE1-negative cases were additionally analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In total, only 5 VE1-positive cases were detected (5/377; 1%). BRAF V600E mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases. All 5 mutated cases were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (5/159; 3%). None of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder were VE1 positive. Apart from the subtype restriction of BRAF V600E mutation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a female predominance (4 female, 1 male), no significant correlation with clinicopathological data and patient outcome was detected. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BRAF V600E mutation is a rare event in biliary tract cancer, accounting for only 1% of all subtypes, and is restricted to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a feasible approach to routinely screen for BRAF V600E mutation in biliary tract cancer patients, thereby facilitating the detection of rare patients who may benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies.",

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway. Also under investigation is the use of vemurafenib in other solid tumours with BRAF mutations, such as papillary thyroid cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS. BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8% of human tumors, most frequently in melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare. Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified, a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 (V600E) is found in over 80% of cases. These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation. The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation. However, BRAF mutations are common in nevi and colon polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development. Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer, preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival. Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. The first generation of RAF inhibitors, including sorafenib, were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as melanoma. Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results. To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents, clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed.",

To better understand the mechanisms of resistance, we used chronic selection to establish BRAF(V600E) melanoma clones with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. These clones retained the V600E mutation and no second-site mutations were identified in the BRAF coding sequence. Further characterization showed that vemurafenib was not able to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, suggesting pathway reactivation. Importantly, resistance also correlated with increased levels of RAS-GTP, and sequencing of RAS genes revealed a rare activating mutation in KRAS, resulting in a K117N change in the KRAS protein. Elevated levels of CRAF and phosphorylated AKT were also observed. In addition, combination treatment with vemurafenib and either a MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor or an AKT inhibitor synergistically inhibited proliferation of resistant cells. These findings suggest that resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibition could occur through several mechanisms, including elevated RAS-GTP levels and increased levels of AKT phosphorylation.

However, we identified anecdotal discordance between VE1 IHC and sequencing results and therefore analyzed VE1 staining by two different IHC methods (Leica Bond and Ventana BenchMark) in whole tissue sections from 480 colorectal carcinomas (323 BRAF wild-type, 142 BRAF V600E mutation, and 15 BRAF non-V600E mutation). We also compared the results with melanomas and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). With the Bond method, among 142 BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal carcinomas, 77 (54%) had diffuse VE1 staining and 48 (33%) had heterogeneous staining, but 17 (12%) were negative. Among 323 BRAF wild-type colorectal carcinomas, 196 (61%) were negative, but 127 (39%) had staining, including 7 with diffuse staining. When positivity was defined as staining in ≥ 20% of tumor cells, VE1 IHC had sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 93% for BRAF V600E mutation. With the Ventana method, among 57 BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal carcinomas, 36 (63%) had diffuse VE1 staining, whereas 6 (11%) had no or weak (<20% of tumor cells) staining. Among 33 BRAF wild-type colorectal carcinomas, 16 (48%) had no or weak staining, whereas 15 (45%) had heterogeneous staining. In contrast with colorectal carcinoma, Bond and Ventana VE1 IHC in melanoma and PTC were highly concordant with sequencing results. We conclude that VE1 IHC produces suboptimal results in colorectal carcinoma and should not be used to guide patient management.",

Objective response rate of almost 50% has been witnessed in BRAFi clinical trials. Frequent side effects range from squamoproliferative lesions, including hyperplasia, keratoacanthomas, and squamous cell carcinomas to second primary melanomas. We describe a 50-year-old Hispanic woman with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic melanoma who was treated with surgery, radiation therapy, interleukin-2, and was enrolled on a BRAFi (dabrafenib) trial. Two months after initiation, she developed multiple erythematous, indurated, tender subcutaneous nodules bilaterally on the anterior thighs, posterior arms, and left dorsal forearm without overlying epidermal change. Punch biopsy revealed panniculitis with necrotizing granulomata. Infectious and other causes for panniculitis were excluded. We believe the histology likely represents a reaction to BRAFi therapy based on the temporal relationship of its onset to initiation of BRAFi therapy and previously reported cases of neutrophilic panniculitis associated with BRAFi therapy. Panniculitis has been emerging as an important unusual side effect of BRAFi therapy. Our case illustrates a unique presentation of BRAFi-associated panniculitis demonstrating necrotizing granulomata.

Initially described in melanoma, colon and papillary thyroid carcinoma, these alterations have also been observed in primary nervous system tumors albeit at a low frequency. We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF (V600E) mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (p = 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33%). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF (V600E) mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities. Future clinical trials should address whether BRAF (V600E) mutant brain tumor patients will benefit from BRAF (V600E)-directed targeted therapies.",

However, adverse effects and the onset of resistance are frequently observed, limiting the efficacy of this treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX) engrafted in immunocompromised mice have been proposed as valuable preclinical models that can predict clinical response to treatments. Here, we established a PDTX model of BRAF V600E melanoma useful for testing the efficacy of vemurafenib. First, we validated the stability of the model that was similar to the original tumor with respect to histology, immunohistochemistry, mutational status, and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET/computed tomography (CT). Next, the sensitivity of the xenografts to vemurafenib was determined by tumor growth inhibition and decreased in standardized uptake value on [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT. Finally, this result, using personalized PDTX, allowed successful rechallenge with vemurafenib in a patient who was administered a lower dose of vemurafenib because of the onset of adverse events. Overall, we found that PDTX provides 'real-time' results in an animal that phenocopies the biology and expected vemurafenib responses of the tumor in a patient with BRAF V600E melanoma. Thus, this 'coclinical' trial using PDTX can help guide vemurafenib treatment for metastatic melanoma.",

While the BRAF V600E mutation is implemented in the clinic, no method for its detection has so far been established as reference.

We analysed genomic DNA from 127 malignant melanomas (77 patients) and 389 tumours from 141 colorectal cancer patients (383 liver metastases and 6 primary tumours) by Sanger sequencing and a single probe-based high-resolution melting assay (LightMix). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from a subset of these lesions (n = 77 and 304, respectively) was analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the V600E-specific antibody VE1. In a dilution series of V600E-mutated DNA in wild-type DNA, the detection limit for the LightMix assay was 1:1000 mutated alleles while it was 1:10 for Sanger sequencing. In line with this, we detected 15 additional mutated melanoma samples and two additional mutated metastatic colorectal cancer samples by the LightMix assay compared to Sanger sequencing. For the melanoma samples, we observed high concordance between DNA-based methods and analysis by IHC. However, in colorectal samples, IHC performed poorly with 12 samples being scored as V600E positive exclusively by IHC and nine samples being scored as V600E negative exclusively by IHC. In conclusion, the VE1 antibody is not recommendable for clinical tests of colorectal cancer samples. For melanoma samples, IHC may be useful as a screening tool guiding further analytical approaches.",

In an effort to produce a pre-clinical model of mutant BRAF function in melanoma, we have generated a mouse expressing BRAF V600E targeted to melanocytes. We show that in these transgenic mice, widespread benign melanocytic hyperplasia with histological features of nevi occurs, with biochemical evidence of senescence. Melanocytic hyperplasia progresses to overt melanoma with an incidence dependent on BRAF expression levels. Melanomas show CDKN2A loss, and genetic disruption of the CDKN2A locus greatly enhances melanoma formation, consistent with collaboration between BRAF activation and CDKN2A loss suggested from studies of human melanoma. The development of melanoma also involves activation of the Mapk and Akt signaling pathways and loss of senescence, findings that faithfully recapitulate those seen in human melanomas. This murine model of mutant BRAF-induced melanoma formation thus provides an important tool for identifying further genetic alterations that cooperates with BRAF and that may be useful in enhancing susceptibility to BRAF-targeted therapeutics in melanoma.",

Activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene are present in >70% of melanomas, 90% of which produce active mutant BRAF(V600E) protein. To define the impacts of oncogenic BRAF on the melanocyte transcriptome, massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on genetically matched normal human melanocytes with and without BRAF(V600E) expression. To enhance potential disease relevance by verifying expression of altered genes in BRAF-driven cancer tissue, parallel RNA-seq was also undertaken of two BRAF(V600E)-mutant human melanomas. BRAF(V600E) regulated expression of 1027 protein-coding transcripts and 39 annotated lncRNAs, as well as 70 unannotated, potentially novel, intergenic transcripts. These transcripts display both tissue-specific and multi-tissue expression profiles and harbor distinctive regulatory chromatin marks and transcription factor binding sites indicative of active transcription. Coding potential analysis of the 70 unannotated transcripts suggested that most may represent newly identified lncRNAs. BRAF-regulated lncRNA 1 (BANCR) was identified as a recurrently overexpressed, previously unannotated 693-bp transcript on chromosome 9 with a potential functional role in melanoma cell migration. BANCR knockdown reduced melanoma cell migration, and this could be rescued by the chemokine CXCL11.

Dabrafenib is the second approved selective BRAF inhibitor (after vemurafenib) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-positive melanoma.;This review covers the current data on the efficacy and safety of the selective BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in patients with metastatic BRAF V600 positive melanoma. The pharmacological, safety and efficacy data are discussed from Phase I, II, and III studies of dabrafenib monotherapy as well as in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib.;Dabrafenib has demonstrated comparable efficacy to vemurafenib in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients. Dabrafenib is well tolerated in patients with metastatic melanoma, including patients with brain metastases. Nevertheless side effects are common, but usually manageable. In the Phase III study testing dabrafenib, 53% of patients reported grade 2 or higher adverse events (AEs). Toxicities were similar to those seen in the early-phase trials, with the most common being cutaneous manifestations (hyperkeratosis, papillomas, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), pyrexia, fatigue, headache, and arthralgia. Combining a BRAF inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor, which may block paradoxical MAPK activation in BRAF wild type (skin) cells, may lower the incidence of squamoproliferative eruptions.",

BRAF(V600E) induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAF(V600E). Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAF(V600E) stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAF(V600E) signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAF(V600E) signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that targeting the oncogenic BRAF and S281-phosphorylated Mps1, especially when used in combination could potentially provide great therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.",

Accordingly, BRAF inhibitors such as Vemurafenib show a good anti-tumorigenic effect on metastases with the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Although an initial period of sustained tumor regression is usually observed after Vemurafenib treatment, tumors often relapse at the same site, and apoptosis induction of melanoma cells in vitro is incomplete. Here, we demonstrate, using a large panel of melanoma cell lines, that Vemurafenib induces features of stress-induced senescence in addition to apoptosis. This senescence phenotype is characterized by heterochromatin formation, changes in cell shape, and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Importantly, senescence features induced by BRAF(V600E) inhibition was also detected in human melanoma cells xenografted into nude mice.

We previously suggested that repeated NEAPP irradiation to spontaneously developed benign melanocytic tumors in RFP-RET-transgenic mice (RET-mice) not only suppresses tumor growth but also prevents malignant transformation. In this study, we first confirmed that transcript expression levels of tumor growth regulators (CyclinD1, D2, E1, E2, G2 and PCNA but not CyclinG1) and tumor invasion regulators [Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9 and -14 and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM)] in melanomas were significantly higher than those in benign melanocytic tumors in RET-mice. We then showed that transcript expression levels of CyclinE1, G1 and G2 and MMP-2 and -9 in melanomas from RET-mice were significantly decreased by single NEAPP irradiation, whereas transcript expression levels of CyclinD1, D2, E2, PCNA, MCAM and MMP-14 were comparable in untreated and NEAPP-treated melanomas.

Growth factor receptor up-regulation is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that PDGFRα up-regulation causes BRAF-I resistance. PDGFRα inhibition by PDGFRα-specific short hairpin (sh)RNA and by PDGFRα inhibitors restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFRα up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFRα inhibition, Shh inhibition by LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I. These effects are mediated by PDGFRα down-regulation and by ERK and AKT inhibition. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFRα up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFRα up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFRα or Shh inhibitors.

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib, potent and selective inhibitors of mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), exhibit remarkable activities in patients with V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. However, acquired drug resistance invariably develops after the initial treatment. Identification of acquired resistance mechanisms may inform the development of new therapies that elicit long-term responses of melanomas to BRAF inhibitors. Here we report that increased expression of AEBP1 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1) confers acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma. AEBP1 is shown to be highly upregulated in PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells because of the hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. This upregulates AEBP1 expression and thus leads to the activation of NF-κB via accelerating IκBa degradation. In addition, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway greatly reverses the PLX4032-resistant phenotype of melanoma cells. Furthermore, increased expression of AEBP1 is validated in post-treatment tumors in patients with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor. Therefore, these results reveal a novel PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway whose activation contributes to acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition, and suggest that this pathway, particularly AEBP1, may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma.

This study was to identify BRAF V600E-associated oncogenic pathways that predict resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We took in silico approaches to analyze the activities of 24 cancer-related pathways in melanoma cells and identify those whose activation was associated with BRAF V600E and used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We then experimentally confirmed the in silico findings. In a microarray gene expression dataset of 63 melanoma cell lines, we found that activation of multiple oncogenic pathways preferentially occurred in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. This finding was reproduced in 5 additional independent melanoma datasets. Further analysis of 46 melanoma cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation showed that 7 pathways, including TNFα, EGFR, IFNα, hypoxia, IFNγ, STAT3, and MYC, were significantly differently expressed in AZD6244-resistant compared with responsive melanoma cells. A SVM classifier built on this 7-pathway activation pattern correctly predicted the response of 10 BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in our experiments. We experimentally showed that TNFα, EGFR, IFNα, and IFNγ pathway activities were also upregulated in melanoma cell A375 compared with its sub-line DRO, while DRO was much more sensitive to AZD6244 than A375. In conclusion, we have identified specific oncogenic pathways preferentially activated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells and a pathway pattern that predicts resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, providing novel clinical implications for melanoma therapy.

We investigated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples with variable challenging interpretative attributes: metastases, core needle biopsies, sample tissues less than 60 mm(2), samples with greater than 50% necrosis, and/or samples with greater than 10% melanin pigmentation. Three pathologists independently scored 122 BRAF V600E IHC-labeled melanoma samples for percentage (0%-100%) of staining intensity (0-3+). Interscorer BRAF IHC discrepancies were resolved by consensus review. Lenient (≥1+, >0%) and stringent (≥2+, ≥10%) IHC scoring criteria were compared to BRAF V600 mutation (cobas) results (n = 118). Specimens with greater than 10% melanin pigmentation and metastatic samples produced the majority of interobserver IHC and IHC/cobas scoring discrepancies. Consensus review using stringent scoring criteria decreased the number of discrepant results, yielded very good interobserver reproducibility, and improved specificity and positive predictive value for BRAF p.V600E detection. BRAF p.V600K mutations accounted for 57.1% of false-negative IHC results when stringent, consensus criteria scoring were used. The cobas test detected 75.0% (8/12) of BRAF IHC-negative BRAF p.V600K mutations confirmed by next-generation sequencing. Molecular BRAF testing is the preferred screening test for BRAF inhibitor therapy eligibility because of superior sensitivity in challenging interpretative melanoma specimens.

Here we used a mouse model of melanoma in which melanocyte-specific expression of Braf(V618E) (analogous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation) led to the development of skin hyperpigmentation and nevi, as well as melanoma formation with incomplete penetrance. Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in this model led to accelerated and fully penetrant melanomagenesis and synchronous tumor formation. Treatment of Braf(V618E) transposon mice with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 resulted in tumor regression followed by relapse. Analysis of transposon insertions identified eight genes including Braf, Mitf, and ERas (ES-cell expressed Ras) as candidate resistance genes. Expression of ERAS in human melanoma cell lines conferred resistance to PLX4720 and induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1), a phenotype reverted by combinatorial treatment with PLX4720 and the AKT inhibitor MK2206. We show that ERAS expression elicits a prosurvival signal associated with phosphorylation/inactivation of BAD, and that the resistance of hepatocyte growth factor-treated human melanoma cells to PLX4720 can be reverted by treatment with the BAD-like BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Thus, we define a role for the AKT/BAD pathway in resistance to BRAF inhibition and illustrate an in vivo approach for finding drug resistance genes.",

The most prevalent melanoma mutation is BRAF(V600E), which constitutively activates downstream MAPK signalling. Vemurafenib is a potent RAF kinase inhibitor with remarkable clinical activity in BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma tumours. However, patients rapidly develop resistance to vemurafenib treatment. One resistance mechanism is the emergence of BRAF alternative splicing isoforms leading to elimination of the RAS-binding domain. Here we identify interference with pre-mRNA splicing as a mechanism to combat vemurafenib resistance. We find that small-molecule pre-mRNA splicing modulators reduce BRAF3-9 production and limit in-vitro cell growth of vemurafenib-resistant cells. In xenograft models, interference with pre-mRNA splicing prevents tumour formation and slows growth of vemurafenib-resistant tumours. Our results identify an intronic mutation as the molecular basis for a RNA splicing-mediated RAF inhibitor resistance mechanism and we identify pre-mRNA splicing interference as a potential therapeutic strategy for drug resistance in BRAF melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Targeted therapy against the BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of melanoma. Treatment with selective BRAF inhibitors results in a high initial response rate but limited duration of response. To counter this, investigators propose combining this therapy with other targeted agents, addressing the issue of redundancy and signaling through different oncogenic pathways. An alternative approach is combining BRAF/MAPK-targeted agents with immunotherapy. Preliminary evidence suggests that oncogenic BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) contributes to immune escape and that blocking its activity via MAPK pathway inhibition leads to increased expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDA). Recognition of MDAs is a critical component of the immunologic response to melanoma, and several forms of immunotherapy capitalize on this recognition. Among the various approaches to inhibiting BRAF/MAPK, broad MAPK pathway inhibition may have deleterious effects on T lymphocyte function. Here, we corroborate the role of oncogenic BRAF in immune evasion by melanoma cells through suppression of MDAs. We show that inhibition of the MAPK pathway with MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors or a specific inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) in melanoma cell lines and tumor digests results in increased levels of MDAs, which is associated with improved recognition by antigen-specific T lymphocytes. However, treatment with MEK inhibitors impairs T lymphocyte function, whereas T-cell function is preserved after treatment with a specific inhibitor of BRAF(V600E). These findings suggest that immune evasion of melanomas mediated by oncogenic BRAF may be reversed by targeted BRAF inhibition without compromising T-cell function. These findings have important implications for combined kinase-targeted therapy plus immunotherapy for melanoma.",

Substitution of different aromatic heterocycles for the phenyl based C-ring is evaluated herein as a potential means of improving the cellular potencies of these inhibitors. Substituted pyrazoles, particularly 3-tert-butyl-1-aryl-1H-pyrazoles, increase the cellular potencies without detrimental effects on the potency on isolated (V600E)BRAF. Thus, compounds have been synthesized that inhibit, with low nanomolar concentrations, (V600E)BRAF, its downstream signaling in cells [as measured by the reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)], and the proliferation of mutant BRAF-dependent cells.

The energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to be a major cellular target of biguanides. Based on our discovery of cross-talk between the AMPK and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) signaling pathways, we investigated the antitumor effects of combining phenformin with a BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 on the proliferation of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in vitro and on BRAF-driven tumor growth in vivo. Cotreatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines with phenformin and PLX4720 resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell viability, compared with the effects of the single agent alone. Moreover, treatment with phenformin significantly delayed the development of resistance to PLX4720 in cultured melanoma cells. Biochemical analyses showed that phenformin and PLX4720 exerted cooperative effects on inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, phenformin selectively targeted subpopulations of cells expressing JARID1B, a marker for slow cycling melanoma cells, whereas PLX4720 selectively targeted JARID1B-negative cells. Finally, in contrast to their use as single agents, the combination of phenformin and PLX4720 induced tumor regression in both nude mice bearing melanoma xenografts and in a genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(null)-driven mouse model of melanoma. These results strongly suggest that significant therapeutic advantage may be achieved by combining AMPK activators such as phenformin with BRAF inhbitors for the treatment of melanoma. ",

Over 40 different missense BRAF mutations have been found, but the vast majority (>90%) represent a single nucleotide change resulting in a valine-->glutamate mutation at residue 600 ((V600E)BRAF). In cells cultured in vitro, (V600E)BRAF is able to stimulate endogenous MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase] and ERK phosphorylation leading to an increase in cell proliferation, cell survival, transformation, tumorigenicity, invasion and vascular development. Many of these hallmarks of cancer can be reversed by treatment of cells with siRNA (small interfering RNA) to BRAF or by inhibiting MEK, indicating that BRAF and MEK are attractive therapeutic targets in cancer samples with BRAF mutations. In order to fully understand the role of oncogenic BRAF in cancer development in vivo as well as to test the in vivo efficacy of anti-BRAF or anti-MEK therapies, GEMMs (genetically engineered mouse models) have been generated in which expression of oncogenic BRaf is conditionally dependent on the Cre recombinase. The delivery/activation of the Cre recombinase can be regulated in both a temporal and spatial manner and therefore these mouse models can be used to recapitulate the somatic mutation of BRAF that occurs in different tissues in the development of human cancer. The data so far obtained following Cre-mediated activation in haemopoietic tissue and the lung indicate that (V600E)BRAF mutation can drive tumour initiation and that its primary effect is to induce high levels of cyclin D1-mediated cell proliferation.

BRAF/MEK inhibitors only show a temporary benefit due to rapid occurrence of resistance, whereas immunotherapy is mainly effective in selected subsets of patients. Thus, there is a need to identify new targets to improve treatment of metastatic melanoma. To this extent, we searched for markers that are elevated in melanoma and are under regulation of potentially druggable enzymes. Here, we show that the pro-proliferative transcription factor FOXM1 is elevated and activated in malignant melanoma. FOXM1 activity correlated with expression of the enzyme Pin1, which we found to be indicative of a poor prognosis. In functional experiments, Pin1 proved to be a main regulator of FOXM1 activity through MEK-dependent physical regulation during the cell cycle. The Pin1-FOXM1 interaction was enhanced by BRAF(V600E), the driver oncogene in the majority of melanomas, and in extrapolation of the correlation data, interference with\\ Pin1 in BRAF(V600E)-driven metastatic melanoma cells impaired both FOXM1 activity and cell survival. Importantly, cell-permeable Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides repressed the proliferation of melanoma cells in freshly isolated human metastatic melanoma ex vivo and in three-dimensional-cultured patient-derived melanoids. When combined with the BRAF(V600E)-inhibitor PLX4032 a robust repression in melanoid viability was obtained, establishing preclinical value of patient-derived melanoids for prognostic use of drug sensitivity and further underscoring the beneficial effect of Pin1-FOXM1 inhibitory peptides as anti-melanoma drugs. These proof-of-concept results provide a starting point for development of therapeutic Pin1-FOXM1 inhibitors to target metastatic melanoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Advanced melanoma has long been a challenging malignancy to treat due to a relative paucity of efficacious therapeutic options. However, the identification of activating BRAF mutations in approximately 50% of patients with cutaneous melanoma has ushered in the era of targeted therapy for melanoma patients. Similar to the first-in-class selective serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf inhibitor vemurafenib, dabrafenib is highly efficacious in melanoma patients with BRAF V600E mutations, with response rates of approximately 50% and progression-free survival of 6 months. There is data to suggest that dabrafenib not only shows activity in V600E-mutated melanoma, but also in non-V600E BRAF-mutated disease such as V600K. There is also early data to suggest that dabrafenib is effective in controlling metastases in the brain. Combining dabrafenib with the selective mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib has been effective in improving both the progression-free survival and overall survival of melanoma patients over those patients treated with dabrafenib alone. Dabrafenib is still being evaluated in several clinical trials in melanoma as well as a variety of other solid tumors with BRAF mutations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved dabrafenib as a single agent for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adult patients with BRAF V600E mutation. ",

BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA were used in combination with PLX4720 to inhibit PI3K and methyltransferase in cell lines and murine models.;Compared with melanoma, CRC lines show higher levels of PI3K/AKT pathway activation. CRC cell lines with mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA were less sensitive to growth inhibition by PLX4720 (P = 0.03), and knockdown of PTEN expression in sensitive CRC cells reduced growth inhibition by the drug. Combined treatment of PLX4720 with PI3K inhibitors caused synergistic growth inhibition in BRAF-mutant CRC cells with both primary and secondary resistance. In addition, methyltransferase inhibition was synergistic with PLX4720 and decreased AKT activation. In vivo, PLX4720 combined with either inhibitors of AKT or methyltransferase showed greater tumor growth inhibition than PLX4720 alone. Clones with acquired resistance to PLX4720 in vitro showed PI3K/AKT activation with EGF receptor (EGFR) or KRAS amplification.;We show that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a mechanism of both innate and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) CRC and suggest combinatorial approaches to improve outcomes in this poor prognosis subset of patients.",

These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation.

Automated immunohistochemical staining and BRAF pyrosequencing served as independent test methods. Test performance measures were compared without considering 1 method as a standard. Four well-fixed samples (2WT/2Mut) were used for testing of all protocols and indicated 2 correctly classifying procedures. Practical performance assessment employed 33 independent tissue samples, composed of 27 leukemias (by pyrosequencing: 8 wild-type; 18 mutated; 1 noninformative) and 6 melanomas (V600E; V600K; wild-type, 2 each).

Expression of MAAs such as MART-1 and gp100 is modulated by the MAPK signaling pathway, which is often deregulated in melanoma. The protein BRAF, a member of the MAPK pathway, is mutated in over 60% of melanomas providing an opportunity for the identification and approval by the FDA of a small molecule MAPK signaling inhibitor PLX4032 that functions to inactivate mutant BRAF(V600E). To this end, we characterized five patient derived primary melanoma cell lines with respect to treatment with PLX4032. Cells were treated with 5μM PLX4032 and harvested. Western blotting analysis, RT-PCR and in vitro transwell migration and invasion assays were utilized to determine treatment effects. PLX4032 treatment modulated phosphorylation of signaling proteins belonging to the MAPK pathway including BRAF, MEK, and ERK and abrogated cell phenotypic characteristics such as migration and invasion. Most significantly, PLX4032 led to an up regulation of many MAA proteins in three of the four BRAF mutated cell lines, as determined at the protein and RNA level. Interestingly, MAGE-A1 protein and mRNA levels were reduced upon PLX4032 treatment in two of the primary lines. Taken together, our findings suggest that the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4032 has therapeutic potential over and above its known target and in combination with specific melanoma targeting vaccine strategies may have further clinical utility.

Gain and loss of function experiments show that M-MITF regulates SIRT1 expression, thereby revealing a melanocyte-specific control of SIRT1. SIRT1 over-expression relieves the senescence-like phenotype and the proliferation arrest caused by MITF suppression, demonstrating that SIRT1 is an effector of MITF-induced proliferation in melanoma cells.

Interferon-alpha (IFN-α), an immune boosting agent, is FDA-approved for treatment of melanoma. In this study in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the antitumor potential of ixazomib and combination treatments with ixazomib and IFN-α were performed. Apoptosis induced by ixazomib was first observed at 12 hours and was maximal at 48 hours with similar levels of cell death compared to bortezomib. IFN-α alone had little effect on cell viability in vitro. However, the combination of ixazomib with IFN-α significantly enhanced ixazomib's ability to induce apoptotic cell death in BRAF V600E mutant and BRAF wild-type human melanoma tumor cells. The combination of ixazomib and IFN-α also enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma tumor cells; however, this was not seen in BRAF wild-type cells.

Morphologically, MLs associated with BRAFi therapy (BRAFi-MLs) may demonstrate alarming features of melanoma with an epithelioid cell phenotype with notable cytologic atypia. We sought to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular features of BRAFi-MLs. A retrospective review over a 4-year period revealed 20 patients in which 44 MLs (including 11 control nevi) were characterized by histopathology, review of clinical medical records, and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies (with anti-BRAF V600E, anti-BAP1, anti-cyclin D1, and anti-p16); the percentage of IHC+ cells was scored. Of the 20 patients, 3 (15%) whose BRAFi-MLs were biopsied had a second primary cutaneous melanoma. Of the 44 BRAFi-MLs tested, 37 (100%) of 37 MLs available for BRAF V600E testing lacked expression in contrast to 1 (9%) of 11 control nevi (lesions not associated with targeted therapy). A significantly higher level of cyclin D1 expression (>50% IHC+ cells) was more commonly seen in BRAFi-MLs (44%) than in control nevi (9%). No difference in p16 expression in melanocytes was seen between the 2 groups. BRAF mutation status distinctly differs between BRAFi-MLs from melanomas and nevi biopsied in patients who do not receive BRAFi therapy.

Furthermore, BRAFi-MLs with coexisting cutaneous keratinocyte toxicity developed during fewer days of targeted therapy.

Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.",

A range of different transporters deliver each specific amino acid into cells, some of which are increased in cancer. These amino acids consequently activate the mTORC1 pathway and drive cell cycle progression. The leucine transporter LAT1/4F2hc heterodimer assembles as part of a large complex with the glutamine transporter ASCT2 to transport amino acids. In this study, we show that the expression of LAT1 and ASCT2 is significantly increased in human melanoma samples and is present in both BRAF(WT) (C8161 and WM852) and BRAF(V600E) mutant (1205Lu and 451Lu) melanoma cell lines. While inhibition of LAT1 by BCH did not suppress melanoma cell growth, the ASCT2 inhibitor BenSer significantly reduced both leucine and glutamine transport in melanoma cells, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were significantly reduced in the presence of BenSer in melanoma cells in 2D and 3D cell culture. This included reduced expression of the cell cycle regulators CDK1 and UBE2C. The importance of ASCT2 expression in melanoma was confirmed by shRNA knockdown, which inhibited glutamine uptake, mTORC1 signaling and cell proliferation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that ASCT2-mediated glutamine transport is a potential therapeutic target for both BRAF(WT) and BRAF(V600E) melanoma.",

One such target is the V600E \"gain-of-function\" BRAF mutation found in 60% of melanomas; other mutations or molecular alterations cooperate with V600E BRAF, particularly those that cause loss of function of PTEN, upstream of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin. Rapid development of new agents, a better understanding of the target pathways and mechanisms of resistance, and carefully designed strategies to optimize combinations and sequences of these agents, potentially with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, may ultimately have the potential to overcome the previously insurmountable obstacle of therapy resistance in melanoma.",

We also demonstrate that volume normalization greatly reduces differences in transmembrane glucose transport and hexokinase-mediated phosphorylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that this loss of cell volume is due in large part to decreases in new protein translation as a consequence of vemurafenib treatment.

The neoadjuvant setting provides a double opportunity for a better knowledge of these drugs: a short-term evaluation of their intrinsic activity, and a deeper analysis of their action and resistance-induction mechanisms. BRAF inhibitors seem to be ideal candidates for the neoadjuvant setting, because of their prompt, repeatedly confirmed response in V600E BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. In this report we summarize studies focused on the neoadjuvant use of traditional medical treatments in advanced melanoma and anecdotal cases of this approach with the use of biologic therapies.

The conventional classification system for this disease is based on histological growth patterns, with division into four subtypes: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, nodular, and acral lentiginous. Major limitations of this classification system are absence of prognostic importance and little correlation with treatment outcomes. Recent preclinical and clinical findings support the notion that melanoma is not one malignant disorder but rather a family of distinct molecular diseases. Incorporation of genetic signatures into the conventional histopathological classification of melanoma has great implications for development of new and effective treatments. Genes of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway harbour alterations sometimes identified in people with melanoma. The mutation Val600Glu in the BRAF oncogene (designated BRAF(V600E)) has been associated with sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to agents that inhibit BRAF(V600E) or MEK (a kinase in the MAPK pathway). Melanomas arising from mucosal, acral, chronically sun-damaged surfaces sometimes have oncogenic mutations in KIT, against which several inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy. Some uveal melanomas have activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, rendering them potentially susceptible to MEK inhibition.

One rationale argues that novel biologically informed strategies are needed to maximally cripple melanoma cells up front before compensatory mechanisms emerge. As p53 is uncommonly mutated in melanoma, restoration of its function represents an attractive adjunct to selective BRAF inhibition.;Thirty-seven BRAF(V600E)-mutated melanoma lines were subjected to synergy studies in vitro using a combination of vemurafenib and nutlin-3 (Nt-3). In addition, cellular responses and in vivo efficacy were also determined. We also analyzed changes in the levels of canonical apoptotic/survival factors in response to vemurafenib.;Dual targeting of BRAF(V600E) and Hdm2 with vemurafenib and Nt-3, respectively, synergistically induced apoptosis and suppressed melanoma viability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Suppression of p53 in melanoma cells abrogated Nt-3's effects fully and vemurafenib's effects partially. A survey of canonical survival factors revealed that both vemurafenib and Nt-3 independently attenuated levels of the antiapoptotic protein, survivin. Genetic depletion of survivin reproduces the cytotoxic effects of the combination strategy.;These results show preclinical feasibility for overcoming primary vemurafenib resistance by restoring p53 function.

BRAFV600E has been implicated in different mechanisms underlying melanomagenesis, most of which due to the deregulated activation of the downstream MEK/ERK effectors. The first selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF, vemurafenib, after highly encouraging results of the phase I and II trial, was compared to dacarbazine in a phase III trial in treatment-naïve patients (BRIM-3). The study results showed a relative reduction of 63 % in risk of death and 74 % in risk of tumor progression. Considering all trials so far completed, median overall survival reached approximately 16 months for vemurafenib compared to less than 10 months for dacarbazine treatment. Vemurafenib has been extensively tested on melanoma patients expressing the BRAFV600E mutated form; it has been demonstrated to be also effective in inhibiting melanomas carrying the V600K mutation. In 2011, both FDA and EMA therefore approved vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma carrying BRAFV600 mutations. Some findings suggest that continuation of vemurafenib treatment is potentially beneficial after local therapy in a subset of patients with disease progression (PD). Among who continued vemurafenib >30 days after local therapy of PD lesion(s), a median overall survival was not reached, with a median follow-up of 15.5 months from initiation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. For patients who did not continue treatment, median overall survival from the time of disease progression was 1.4 months. A clinical phase I/II trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with the CTLA-4 inhibitor mAb ipilimumab. In the BRIM-7 trial vemurafenib is tested in association with GDC-0973, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2. Preliminary data seem to indicate that an additional inhibitor of mutated BRAF, GSK2118436, might be also active on a wider range of BRAF mutations (V600E-K-D-R); actually, treatment with such a compound is under evaluation in a phase III study among stage III-IV melanoma patients positive for BRAF mutations.

This leads to increased oncogenic properties such as tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and resistance to apoptosis. Blockade of the MAPK pathway with highly specific kinase inhibitors induces unprecedented tumor response rates in patients with advanced BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma. Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programed death-1/PD-L1 has also demonstrated striking anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. Tumor responses are likely limited by multiple additional layers of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. There is emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that MAPK inhibition has a beneficial effect on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a strong rationale for combined immunotherapy and MAPK pathway inhibition in melanoma. The T cell response has been the main focus in the studies reported to date. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are important in the induction of tumor-specific T cell responses, the impact of MAPK pathway activation in melanoma on DC function is critical for the melanoma directed immune response. BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells modulate DCs through the MAPK pathway because its blockade in melanoma cells can reverse suppression of DC function. As both MEK/BRAF inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade have recently taken center stage in the treatment of melanoma, a deeper understanding of how MAPK pathway inhibition affects the tumor immune response is needed.

Of the two BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines, A375P/Mdr cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutant were resistant and the wild-type BRAF SK-MEL-2 cells were sensitive to paclitaxel. In particular, paclitaxel caused the growth inhibition of SK-MEL-2 cells to a much greater extent than it caused growth inhibition of A375P cells. Paclitaxel exhibited no significant effect on the phosphorylation of MEK-ERK in any cell lines tested, regardless of both the BRAF mutation and the drug resistance, implying that paclitaxel activity is independent of MEK-ERK inhibition. In A375P cells, paclitaxel treatment resulted in a marked emergence of apoptotic cells after mitotic arrest, concomitant with a remarkable induction of p21(Cip1). However, paclitaxel only moderately increased the levels of p21(Cip1) in A375P/Mdr cells, which exhibited a strong resistance to paclitaxel. The p21(Cip1) overexpression partially conferred paclitaxel sensitivity to A375P/Mdr cells. Interestingly, we found an extremely low background expression level of p21(Cip1) in SK-MEL-2 cells lacking normal p53 function, which caused much greater G2/M arrest than that seen in A375P cells. Taken together, these results suggest that paclitaxel may be an effective anticancer agent through regulating the expression of p21(Cip1) for the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

We report sarcoidal-type granulomatous inflammation in two patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing treatment with combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy.

Unlike its high treatment response to selective BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) in metastatic melanoma, the treatment response in thyroid cancer is reported to be low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the resistance mechanism responsible for this low treatment response to BRAF inhibitor in order to maximize the effect of targeted therapy. We examined the expression of feedback regulation mechanisms and alterations in the upper signal transduction pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAF mutation. Also, we investigated the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid cancer cell lines, 8505C (anaplastic thyroid cancer) and BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) were selected and treated with PLX4032 and its drug sensitivity were examined and compared. Further investigation on the changes in signals responsible for the different treatment response to PLX4032 was carried out and the same experiment was performed on orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, 8505C cells presented drug resistance to PLX4032 treatment and this was mainly due to increased expression of c-Met. Effective inhibitions of c-Met, p-AKT, and p-ERK were achieved after dual treatment with BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752). Similar results were confirmed by in vivo study with orthotopic xenograft mouse model. c-Met-mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway contributes to the relative insensitivity of BRAF (V600E) mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to PLX4032. Dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met leads to sustained treatment response. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Our study evaluated the AQP1 protein expression in 78 melanoma patients, representing two predefined risk cohorts using the immune labeling technique with commercially available anti-AQP1 antibodies on routinely formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples. BRAF V600E mutation analyses were carried out successfully in 70 patients using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, followed by confirmatory analysis with the Sanger sequencing technique. AQP1-expressing melanoma cells were found in 52 cases (66.7%, median H-score=124.24). Significantly higher AQP1 H-scores (P=0.047) were found in the 'high-risk' patients. No correlations were found with the established histological markers, such as mitotic index (P=0.42), Clark level (P=0.95), and Breslow thickness (P=0.51). BRAF V600 mutation analyses were successful in 89%, and showed a two times higher mutation frequency in the 'high-risk' group.

OBJECTIVES To define the relative risk of PTC in patients with CM, and vice versa, and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses by using a unique population research database; and to assess the rate of BRAF v600e mutation in a group of patients with both diagnoses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective rev iew using the Utah Population Database (which is linked to medical records and the Utah Cancer Registry from 1966 to 2011) and tissue analysis in a tertiary care facility. Included were 4460 patients diagnosed with PTC and 14 569 with CM in Utah between 1966 and 2011 and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses. These were compared at a 5:1 ratio with matched, population-based controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statistically significant increased risk of PTC in patients with CM, and vice versa, and any first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses; and a significantly higher rate of BRAF v600e mutation in patients with both PTC and CM than would be expected for each individual condition alone. RESULTS Patients with CM had a 2.3-fold increased risk (P < .001) of being diagnosed as having PTC compared with population-based matched controls. Conversely, patients with PTC had a 1.8-fold increased risk (P < .001) of developing CM. First- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses of patients with PTC or CM did not show a statistically significant increased risk. Eight patients with both cancer diagnoses had tissue specimens tested, of which 4 (50%) were found to be positive for the BRAF v600e mutation in either their PTC or CM specimen, and 3 (38%) were found positive in both. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with either PTC or CMhave an increased risk of developing the other cancer as a second primary malignant neoplasm. Tissue specimens from patients with both cancers show a high rate of BRAF v600e mutation. Translational studies are needed to better define the associated genetic predisposition between PTC and CM and to test the efficacy of and implementation techniques for treatment plans using BRAF mutation as a therapeutic target.",

However vemurafenib, a type I mutant BRAF V600 inhibitor, induces an array of proliferative skin disorders from keratosis pilaris-like and keratoacanthoma-like lesions to locally aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC). Dual BRAF/MEK inhibition is known to lower the incidence of such manifestations, but it is not known whether it can counteract established lesions. Here we show, for the first time, a dramatic response and a restitution ad integro upon dual inhibition of a widespread proliferative affection induced by BRAF monotherapy. A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed with a BRAF V600E mutated metastatic melanoma. Following dacarbazine (DTIC) and ipilimumab, the patient was started on 960 mg twice daily vemurafenib (Zelboraf), which resulted in complete response, but the patient also developed grade IV skin toxicity. Despite dose-reduction to 720 mg twice daily the side effects persisted. We hypothesized that a switch to double inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with dabrafenib and trametinib could lead to improvement of the skin lesions, while preserving tumor control. The patient was closely followed for changes in skin lesions. We witnessed a rapid regression followed by complete disappearance of all side effects of vemurafenib except for grade I fatigue. The biopsied skin lesions show regression of established keratoacanthoma-like lesions with signs of apoptosis. Switching from the current standard of care vemurafenib therapy to the double BRAF/MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma patients results in rapid disappearance of established proliferative skin disorders.",

Fifty-two archival melanocytic lesions were assessed for PD-L1 expression, TIL infiltration, and BRAFmut simultaneously. IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression in cultured melanomas was assessed in parallel according to BRAF status.

Almost all melanocytes displaying PD-L1 expression were observed to be adjacent to TILs, irrespective of BRAF status. TIL(-) lesions were not more likely to be associated with BRAFmut, when compared with TIL(+) lesions. Baseline expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cell lines was virtually nil, regardless of BRAFmut status, and the intensity of IFN-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cell lines likewise did not correlate with BRAF mutational status.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in the BRAF kinase have been reported in a large number of cases of malignant melanoma. This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

Nevertheless, drug resistance develops in treated patients, and strategies to overcome primary and acquired resistance are required. To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in primary resistance to PLX4032, we investigated its effects on cell proliferation and signaling in a panel of 27 genetically characterized patient-derived melanoma cell lines. Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAF(V600E) and independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification; similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032.

We validated several putative PTEN ceRNAs and further characterized one, the ZEB2 transcript. We show that ZEB2 modulates PTEN protein levels in a microRNA-dependent, protein coding-independent manner. Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels. Our study genetically identifies multiple putative microRNA decoys for PTEN, validates ZEB2 mRNA as a bona fide PTEN ceRNA, and demonstrates that abrogated ZEB2 expression cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to promote melanomagenesis.",

Enrolled patients received oral dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) in continuous 21-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response, which was assessed by intention to treat in the protocol-defined population (patients who received second-line or later treatment); safety was also assessed in this population and was assessed at least once every 3 weeks, with adverse events, laboratory values, and vital signs graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The study is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336634.;Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 14, 2015, 59 patients from 30 centres in nine countries across North America, Europe, and Asia met eligibility criteria. Two patients who had previously been untreated due to protocol deviation were excluded; thus, 57 eligible patients were enrolled. 36 patients (63·2% [95% CI 49·3-75·6]) achieved an investigator-assessed overall response. Serious adverse events were reported in 32 (56%) of 57 patients and included pyrexia in nine (16%), anaemia in three (5%), confusional state in two (4%), decreased appetite in two (4%), haemoptysis in two (4%), hypercalcaemia in two (4%), nausea in two (4%), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in two (4%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia in five patients (9%), hyponatraemia in four (7%), and anaemia in three (5%). Four patients died during the study from fatal adverse events judged to be unrelated to treatment (one retroperitoneal haemorrhage, one subarachnoid haemorrhage, one respiratory distress, and one from disease progression that was more severe than typical progression, as assessed by the investigator).;Dabrafenib plus trametinib could represent a new targeted therapy with robust antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC.;GlaxoSmithKline.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer cells commonly undergo chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, to which the cells have to adapt for survival and proliferation. We report here that in melanoma cells intrinsic activation of the ER stress response/unfolded protein response (UPR) is, at least in part, caused by increased outputs of protein synthesis driven by oncogenic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and promotes proliferation and protects against apoptosis induced by acute ER stress. Inhibition of oncogenic BRAF(V600E) or MEK-attenuated activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) signaling of the UPR in melanoma cells. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and nascent protein synthesis and was recapitulated by knockdown of eIF4E. In line with this, introduction of BRAF(V600E) into melanocytes led to increases in eIF4E phosphorylation and protein production and triggered activation of the UPR. Similar to knockdown of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inhibition of XBP1 decelerated melanoma cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis induced by the pharmacological ER stress inducers tunicamycin and thapasigargin. Collectively, these results reveal that potentiation of adaptation to chronic ER stress is another mechanism by which oncogenic activation of the MEK/ERK pathway promotes the pathogenesis of melanoma.

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

Activated AMPK inhibits the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby reducing the extent of protein translation and suppressing both cell growth and cell cycle entry. Recent reports indicate that AMPK-mediated growth inhibition is achieved via an action of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in melanoma cells harboring the V600E mutant form of the BRAF oncogene. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of AICAR by measuring its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression of BRAF wild-type and V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. We also explored the mechanism underlying these effects. AICAR inhibited the proliferation of BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines more strongly than was the case with wild-type cell lines. The suppressive effect of AICAR on cell proliferation was associated with increased S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, AICAR suppressed phosphorylation of ERK and p70S6K in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cells, but rather increased phosphorylation in wild-type cells. Together, the results indicate that AICAR-induced AMPK activation in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in increases in apoptosis and S-phase arrest via downregulation of ERK and p70S6K activity. Thus, regulation of AMPK activity may be potentially useful as a therapy for thyroid cancer if the cancer harbors a BRAF V600E mutation.",

Melanoma is easily curable by surgical excision when detected early, but it is nearly incurable when discovered in its later stages owing to resistance to treatment. Unfortunately, treatment options traditionally used in melanoma have not shown a survival benefit. However, as the understanding of tumor biology and metastatic growth evolves, new therapeutic options for metastatic melanoma have shown impressive survival benefit. The blockade of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) by use of the monoclonal antibody, ipilimumab (Yervoy™, Bristol-Myers Squibb), produces favorable antitumor immune system responses and was recently approved by the US FDA for use in patients with advanced melanoma. In addition, targeting components of the MAPK pathway have also demonstrated survival advantage in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and vemurafenib (Zelboraf™, Plexxikon/Roche) was approved by the FDA in August 2011 for the first-line treatment of both metastatic and unresectable melanomas for patients whose tumors have V600E mutations in the BRAF gene.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Increased global protein synthesis and selective translation of mRNAs encoding proteins contributing to malignancy is common in cancer cells. This is often associated with elevated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 (eIF4E), the rate-limiting factor of cap-dependent translation initiation. We report here that in human melanoma downregulation of miR-768-3p as a result of activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has an important role in the upregulation of eIF4E and enhancement in protein synthesis. Melanoma cells displayed increased nascent protein production and elevated eIF4E expression, which was associated with the downregulation of miR-768-3p that was predicted to target the 3'-untranslated region of the eIF4E mRNA. Overexpression of miR-768-3p led to the downregulation of the endogenous eIF4E protein, reduction in nascent protein synthesis and inhibition of cell survival and proliferation. These effects were efficiently reversed when eIF4E was co-overexpressed in melanoma cells. On the other hand, introduction of anti-miR-768-3p into melanocytes upregulated endogenous eIF4E protein expression and increased global protein synthesis. Downregulation of miR-768-3p appeared to be mediated by activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, in that treatment of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells with the mutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 or exposure of either BRAF(V600E) or wild-type BRAF melanoma cells to the MEK inhibitor U0126 resulted in the upregulation of miR-768-3p and inhibition of nascent protein synthesis. This inhibition was partially blocked in cells cointroduced with anti-miR-768-3p. Significantly, miR-768-3p was similarly downregulated, which was inversely associated with the expression levels of eIF4E in fresh melanoma isolates. Taken together, these results identify downregulation of miR-768-3p and subsequent upregulation of eIF4E as an important mechanism in addition to phosphorylation of eIF4E responsible for MEK/ERK-mediated enhancement of protein synthesis in melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Immunotherapy and chemotherapy benefit few patients with metastatic melanoma, and even fewer experience durable survival benefit. These poor results may come from treating all melanomas as though they are biologically homogeneous. Recently, it has been shown that targeting specific activated tyrosine kinases (oncogenes) can have striking clinical benefits in patients with melanoma. In 2002, a V600E mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine kinase was described as present in more than 50% of all melanomas. The mutation appeared to confer a dependency by the melanoma cancer cell on activated signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The frequency and focality of this mutation (>95% of all BRAF mutations being at V600 position) suggested its importance in melanoma pathophysiology and potential as a target for therapy. The recent results of a phase 1 study with PLX4032/RG7204, a small molecule RAF inhibitor, confirm this hypothesis. Mucosal and acral-lentiginous melanomas, comprising 3% of all melanomas, frequently harbor activating mutations of c-kit and drugs targeting this mutation seem to confer similar benefits for these types of tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) has been used for treatment of melanomas harboring V600E mutation. Despite a high initial response rate, resistance to BRAFi is inevitable. Here, we demonstrate that BRAFi-resistant (BR) melanomas are susceptible to arginine deprivation due to inability to initiate re-expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1, a key enzyme for arginine synthesis) as well as ineffective autophagy. Autophagy and ASS1 re-expression are known to protect melanoma cells from cell death upon arginine deprivation. When melanoma cells become BR cells by long-term in vitro incubation with BRAFi, c-Myc-mediated ASS1 re-expression and the levels of autophagy-associated proteins (AMPK-α1 and Atg5) are attenuated. Furthermore, our study uncovers that downregulation of deubiquitinase USP28 which results in more active c-Myc degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome machinery is the primary mechanism for inability to re-express ASS1 upon arginine deprivation in BR cells. Overexpression of USP28 in BR cells enhances c-Myc expression and hence increases ASS1 transcription upon arginine deprivation, and consequently leads to cell survival. On the other hand, overexpression of Atg5 or AMPK-α1 in BR cells can redirect arginine deprivation-induced apoptosis toward autophagy. The xenograft models also confirm that BR tumors possess lower expression of ASS1 and are hypersensitive to arginine deprivation. These biochemical changes in BRAFi resistance which make them vulnerable to arginine deprivation can be exploited for the future treatment of BR melanoma patients. ",

Here we show (V600E)B-RAF copy-number gain as a mechanism of acquired B-RAF inhibitor resistance in 4 out of 20 (20%) patients treated with B-RAF inhibitor. In cell lines, (V600E)B-RAF overexpression and knockdown conferred B-RAF inhibitor resistance and sensitivity, respectively. In (V600E)B-RAF amplification-driven (versus mutant N-RAS-driven) B-RAF inhibitor resistance, extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation is saturable, with higher doses of vemurafenib down-regulating phosho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and re-sensitizing melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibitor. These two mechanisms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244/selumetinib or its combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib. In contrast to mutant N-RAS-mediated (V600E)B-RAF bypass, which is sensitive to C-RAF knockdown, (V600E)B-RAF amplification-mediated resistance functions largely independently of C-RAF. Thus, alternative clinical strategies may potentially overcome distinct modes of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation underlying acquired B-RAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma.",

Furthermore, inhibitors targeting \"active\" protein kinases have demonstrated significant utility in the therapeutic repertoire against cancer. Therefore, we pursued the development of specific kinase inhibitors targeting B-Raf, and the V600E allele in particular. By using a structure-guided discovery approach, a potent and selective inhibitor of active B-Raf has been discovered. PLX4720, a 7-azaindole derivative that inhibits B-Raf(V600E) with an IC(50) of 13 nM, defines a class of kinase inhibitor with marked selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays. PLX4720 preferentially inhibits the active B-Raf(V600E) kinase compared with a broad spectrum of other kinases, and potent cytotoxic effects are also exclusive to cells bearing the V600E allele. Consistent with the high degree of selectivity, ERK phosphorylation is potently inhibited by PLX4720 in B-Raf(V600E)-bearing tumor cell lines but not in cells lacking oncogenic B-Raf. In melanoma models, PLX4720 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis exclusively in B-Raf(V600E)-positive cells. In B-Raf(V600E)-dependent tumor xenograft models, orally dosed PLX4720 causes significant tumor growth delays, including tumor regressions, without evidence of toxicity.

This process can be inhibited using the antimalarial agent chloroquine (CQ), which impairs lysosomal function and prevents autophagosome turnover. Despite its activity, CQ is a relatively inadequate inhibitor that requires high concentrations to disrupt autophagy, highlighting the need for improved small molecules. To address this, we screened a panel of antimalarial agents for autophagy inhibition and chemically synthesized a novel series of acridine and tetrahydroacridine derivatives. Structure-activity relationship studies of the acridine ring led to the discovery of VATG-027 as a potent autophagy inhibitor with a high cytotoxicity profile. In contrast, the tetrahydroacridine VATG-032 showed remarkably little cytotoxicity while still maintaining autophagy inhibition activity, suggesting that both compounds act as autophagy inhibitors with differential effects on cell viability. Further, knockdown of autophagy-related genes showed no effect on cell viability, demonstrating that the ability to inhibit autophagy is separate from the compound cytotoxicity profiles. Next, we determined that both inhibitors function through lysosomal deacidification mechanisms and ultimately disrupt autophagosome turnover. To evaluate the genetic context in which these lysosomotropic inhibitors may be effective, they were tested in patient-derived melanoma cell lines driven by oncogenic BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B). We discovered that both inhibitors sensitized melanoma cells to the BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib.

In GIST, the development of secondary mutations leads to resistance; however, there have been no similar gatekeeper mutations found in melanoma. Although surgery remains an important component of the treatment of early GIST and melanoma, surgeons will need to continue to define the thresholds and timing for operation in the setting of metastatic disease with improved targeted therapies. Combination treatment strategies may result in more successful clinical outcomes in the management of melanoma in the future. ",

Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.",

Treatment with vemurafenib, which inhibits the most common activating-mutated form of B-Raf (B-Raf(V600E)), eventually results in resistance to therapy. VEGF-A is the principal driver of angiogenesis in primary and metastatic lesions. The bioactivity of VEGF-A is dependent upon alternative RNA splicing and pro-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF-A are upregulated in many disease states dependent upon angiogenesis, including cancers. Using techniques including RT-PCR, Western blotting, ELISA and luciferase reporter assays, the effect of vemurafenib on proliferation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the levels of pro- and anti-angiogenic VEGF-A isoforms was investigated in melanoma cell types expressing either wild-type B-Raf or B-Raf(V600E), including a primary melanoma culture derived from a highly vascularised and active nodule taken from a patient with a V600E mutant melanoma. The primary melanoma culture was characterised and found to have reverted to wild-type B-Raf. In B-Raf(V600E) A375 cells ERK1/2 phosphorylation, pro-angiogenic VEGF-A mRNA, total VEGF-A protein expression and VEGF-A 3'UTR activity were all decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by vemurafenib. Conversely vemurafenib treatment of wild-type B-Raf cells significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, pro-angiogenic VEGF-A mRNA and total VEGF-A expression in a concentration-dependent manner. A switch to pro-angiogenic VEGF-A isoforms, with a concomitant upregulation of expression by increasing VEGF-A mRNA stability, may be an additional oncogenic and pathological mechanism in B-Raf(V600E) melanomas, which promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis and melanoma-genesis. We have also identified the genetic reversal of B-Raf(V600E) to wild-type in an active melanoma nodule taken from a V600E-positive patient and continued vemurafenib treatment for this patient is likely to have had a detrimental effect by promoting B-Raf(WT) activity.

The small molecule inhibitors selective for mutant BRAF induce significant but short-lived clinical responses in a proportion of patients, but also lead to immune stimulatory bystander events, which then subside with the emergence of resistance to inhibition. Simultaneous BRAF and MEK inhibition, and especially combination of BRAF inhibitors with new immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade antibodies, may further enhance immune activation, or counteract immunosuppressive signals.

Mutations in the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) gene occur frequently in melanoma and lead to constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. We tested the hypothesis that BRM expression is modulated by oncogenic BRAF and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Expression of oncogenic BRAF in melanocytes and melanoma cells that are wild-type for BRAF decreased BRM expression and increased BRG1 expression. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) or selective inhibition of BRAF in melanoma cells that harbor oncogenic BRAF increased BRM expression and decreased BRG1 expression. Increased BRM expression was associated with increased histone acetylation on the BRM promoter. Over-expression of BRM in melanoma cells that harbor oncogenic BRAF promoted changes in cell cycle progression and apoptosis consistent with a tumor suppressive role. Upon inhibition of BRAF(V600E) with PLX4032, BRM promoted survival. PLX4032 induced changes in BRM function were correlated with increased acetylation of the BRM protein.

MIC-1 was overexpressed in approximately 67% of advanced melanomas, accompanied by fivefold to six-fold higher levels of secreted protein in serum of melanoma patients compared with normal individuals. Constitutively active mutant (V600E)B-Raf in melanoma regulated downstream MIC-1 expression. Indeed, small-interfering RNA-mediated targeting of MIC-1 or (V600E)B-Raf reduced expression and secretion by three-fold to fivefold. This decrease in MIC-1 levels reduced melanoma tumorigenesis by approximately threefold, but did not alter cultured cell growth, suggesting a unique function other than growth control. Instead, inhibition of MIC-1 was found to mechanistically retard melanoma tumor vascular development, subsequently affecting tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. This role in melanoma angiogenesis was confirmed by comparing MIC-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) function in chick chorioallantoic membrane and matrigel plug assays. Similar to VEGF in melanomas, MIC-1 stimulated directional vessel development, acting as a potent angiogenic factor. Thus, MIC-1 is secreted from melanoma cells together with VEGF to promote vascular development mediated by (V600E)B-Raf signaling.",

A model cell line system was used to examine the effects of dabrafenib and trametinib on MAPK and BCR-ABL1 signaling.;After 35 weeks on treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, complete hematologic response was observed without recourse to BCR-ABL1-targeted therapy. MEK inhibition was principally responsible for impaired proliferation of both mature and primitive myeloid precursors, as well as growth and hemoglobinization of erythroid precursors.

        "Doc_abstract":"In eukaryotic cells, the rate-limiting component for cap-dependent mRNA translation is the translation initiation factor eIF4E. eIF4E is overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies, but whether it has a role in melanoma remains obscure. We hypothesized that eIF4E promotes melanoma cell proliferation and facilitates the development of acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. We show that eIF4E is overexpressed in a panel of melanoma cell lines, compared with immortalized melanocytes. Knockdown of eIF4E significantly repressed the proliferation of a subset of melanoma cell lines. Moreover, in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines, vemurafenib inhibits 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, thus promoting its binding to eIF4E. Cap-binding and polysome profiling analysis confirmed that vemurafenib stabilizes the eIF4E-4E-BP1 association and blocks mRNA translation, respectively. Conversely, in cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib, there is an increased dependence on eIF4E for survival; 4E-BP1 is highly phosphorylated and thus eIF4E-4E-BP1 associations are impeded. Moreover, increasing eIF4E activity by silencing 4E-BP1/2 renders vemurafenib-responsive cells more resistant to BRAF inhibition. In conclusion, these data suggest that therapeutically targeting eIF4E may be a viable means of inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation and overcoming vemurafenib resistance. ",

As tumours may contain a mixture of mutant and wild type BRAF cells and this has been also put forward as a resistance mechanism, we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity/resistance of six, randomly selected, (WT)BRAF/(WT)NRAS lines to vemurafenib and found four sensitive. The sensitivity to the drug was accompanied by a potent inhibition of both phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT, and a significant induction of apoptosis while absent in lines with intrinsic or acquired resistance. Phospho-CRAF expression was low in all sensitive lines and high in resistant ones, and MEK inhibition can effectively potentiate the drug effect. A possible explanation for CRAF modulation is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a mediator of melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) signalling, since it can actually inhibit CRAF. Indeed, we measured cAMP and found that all four sensitive lines contained significantly higher constitutive cAMP levels than the resistant ones. Consequently, vemurafenib and cAMP stimulator combination resulted in a substantial synergistic effect in lines with both intrinsic and acquired resistance but only restricted to those where cAMP was effectively increased. The use of a cAMP agonist overcame such restriction. In conclusion, we report that (WT)BRAF/(WT)NRAS melanoma lines with low phospho-CRAF and high cAMP levels may be sensitive to vemurafenib and that CRAF inhibition through cAMP stimulation may overcome the resistance to the drug.

BRAF, a critical serine/threonine kinase in this pathway, is frequently activated by somatic mutation in melanoma. Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<.001, two-sided Fisher's exact test). By contrast, BRAF mutations in melanomas on chronically sun-damaged skin (1 of 12 patients) and melanomas on skin relatively or completely unexposed to sun, such as palms, soles, subungual sites (6 of 39 patients), and mucosal membranes (2 of 21 patients) are rare. We found no association of mutation status with clinical outcome or with the presence of an associated melanocytic nevus. The mutated BRAF allele was frequently found at an elevated copy number, implicating BRAF as one of the factors driving selection for the frequent copy number increases of chromosome 7q in melanoma. In summary, the uneven distribution of BRAF mutations strongly suggests distinct genetic pathways leading to melanoma. The high mutation frequency in melanomas arising on intermittently sun-exposed skin suggests a complex causative role of such exposure that mandates further evaluation.",

DNA analyses revealed that 6 of 35 (17%) cases of the primary cutaneous malignant melanoma possessed the BRAFV600E mutation. For immunohistochemical analyses, cytoplasmic positivity with anti-B-Raf was noted in 7 of 35 (20%) cases of primary melanoma and in all 10 positive controls.

The aim of the study was to characterize the spectrum of \"driver\" mutations in melanoma subtypes from 137 patients with skin melanoma and 14 patients with mucosal melanoma. In total 151 melanoma cases, the frequency of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS mutations was 55.0, 10.6, 4.0, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. BRAF mutations were found in 69% of cutaneous melanoma without UV exposure and in 43% of cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (p=0.045), rarely in acral and mucosal melanomas. Most of melanomas containing BRAF mutations, V600E (92%) and V600K (6.0%) were potentially sensitive to inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib. NRAS mutations were more common in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (26.0%), in acral and mucosal melanomas; the dominant mutations being Q61R/K/L (87.5%). KIT mutations were found in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (8.7%) and mucosal one (28.6%), but not in acral melanoma.

The combination of JQ1 and Vemurafenib acted synergistically in BRAF-mutant cell lines, resulting in marked apoptosis in vitro, with upregulation of proapoptotic proteins. In vivo, combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either drug alone. RNA sequencing of tumor tissues revealed almost four thousand genes that were uniquely modulated by the combination, with several anti-apoptotic genes significantly down-regulated. Collectively, our data provide a rationale for combined BET and BRAF inhibition as a novel strategy for the treatment of melanoma. ",

In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of melanoma cell lines that were BRAF mutant and PTEN null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTEN dependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor α5β1 integrin. This in turn abrogated the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. The protection conveyed by the induction of FN expression could be overcome through combined treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor. ",

The inhibition of oncogenic B-RAF with highly targeted compounds has produced remarkable albeit short-lived clinical responses in B-RAF mutant melanoma patients. Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors, and the identification of B-RAF targets may provide new strategies for managing melanoma. Oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) is known to promote the stabilizing phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, implicated in melanoma survival and chemoresistance. We now show that B-RAF(V600E) signaling also induces the transcription of Mcl-1 in melanocytes and melanoma. We demonstrate that activation of STAT3 serine-727 and tyrosine-705 phosphorylations is promoted by B-RAF(V600E) activity and that the Mcl-1 promoter is dependent on a STAT consensus-site for B-RAF-mediated activation. Consequently, suppression of STAT3 activity disrupted B-RAF(V600E)-mediated induction of Mcl-1 and reduced melanoma cell survival. We propose that STAT3 has a central role in the survival and contributes to chemoresistance of B-RAF(V600E) melanoma. ",

To circumvent nonspecific LeTx activation, a substrate preferably cleaved by gelatinases was substituted for the furin LeTx activation site.

This additional layer of tumor cell specificity would potentially decrease systemic toxicity from the reduction of nonspecific toxin activation while retaining antitumor efficacy in patients with V600E B-RAF melanomas.

One of the causes of this acquired resistance is the BRAF downstream kinase point mutation MEK1-C121S. This mutation confers resistance to not only vemurafenib, but also to the allosteric MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244). Here, we investigated the pharmacologic activities and effectiveness of the novel MEK inhibitor E6201 against BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1)-V600E mutant melanoma harboring the MEK1-C121S mutation. A cell-free assay confirmed that E6201 is an ATP-competitive MEK inhibitor, meaning it has a different binding mode with MEK compared with allosteric MEK inhibitors. E6201 is more effective against BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma compared with BRAF wild-type melanoma based on MEK inhibition. We found that the acquired MEK1-C121S mutation in BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma conferred resistance to both vemurafenib and selumetinib but not E6201. The effectiveness of E6201 in this preclinical study is a result of its binding with MEK1 far from the C121S point mutation so the mutation is unable to influence the MAPK pathway inhibitory activity. These results support further clinical investigation of E6201.",

However, as might be expected, acquired clinical resistance to these agents arises in most melanoma patients. PLX4032/vemurafenib resistance that arises in vivo in tumor matched short-term cultures or in vitro in melanoma cell lines is not caused by acquisition of secondary mutations in (V600E)B-RAF but rather is caused by upregulating platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) or N-RAS which results in resistance or sensitivity to mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK; MEK) kinase inhibitors, respectively. In this study, we define a targeted combinatorial strategy to overcome PLX4032/vemurafenib resistance in melanoma cell lines or short-term culture where the resistance is driven by PDGFRβ upregulation, achieving synergistic growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. PDGFRβ-upregulated, PLX4032-resistant (PPRM) cell lines show dual phospho (p)-ERK and p-AKT upregulation, and their growth inhibitory responses to specific small molecule inhibitors correlated with p-ERK, p-AKT, and p-p70S6K levels. Coordinate inhibition of (V600E)B-RAF inhibition and the RTK-PI3K-AKT-mTORC axis led to functionally significant rebound signaling, illustrating a robust and dynamic network connectivity. Combined B-RAF, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mTORC1/2 inhibition suppressed both immediate early and delayed compensatory signaling, resulting in a highly synergistic growth inhibitory response but less efficient cytotoxic response. In contrast, the combination of MEK1/2, PI3K, and mTORC1/2 inhibitors consistently triggered apoptosis in a highly efficient manner. Together, our findings offer a rational strategy to guide clinical testing in preidentified subsets of patients who relapse during treatment with (V600E)B-RAF inhibitors.",

Researchers retrospectively reviewed medical records of all patients at our institution with surgically incurable BRAF V600E mutated stage III or limited stage IV melanoma treated with induction vemurafenib, stopped electively during ongoing response, followed by consolidative radiation therapy with or without intervening surgery to debulk nodal metastases. In our six-patient cohort, the median duration of vemurafenib was 5.8 months and the median radiation dose was 57 Gy using conventional fractionation. This algorithm produced 100% locoregional control at 29+ months following radiation and a median progression-free survival of 32.5+ months. Three of six patients remained progression free, and three relapsed in a single organ and achieved ongoing complete response to subsequent therapy. Outcomes greatly exceeding those reported with either BRAF inhibition or radiation alone suggest unanticipated synergies with this therapeutic sequence for both in-field and distant melanoma control, which may be mediated by radiosensitization and immune activation, respectively. In patients with surgically incurable melanoma encompassed within a radiation field, induction vemurafenib and consolidative radiation therapy, rather than continuing vemurafenib until progression, also limit the duration of vemurafenib toxicity and preserve sensitivity to future BRAF inhibition.

RETp was assessed in 71 non-desmoplastic cutaneous melanomas (non-DMs) and 70 desmoplastic melanomas (DMs). Melanoma cell lines with RETp, RET wild type (RETwt), BRAF V600E mutation (BRAFmt) or BRAF wild type (BRAFwt) were assessed for functional activity. RETp frequency was significantly higher in DMs (61%) than in non-DMs (31%, P<0.001).

GDNF stimulation of RETp cell lines enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt of the RET-RAS-RAF-ERK and RET-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways, respectively.

However, in melanoma-a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease-TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (∼65%) of stage I-IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene.

Germ line mutations in BRAF have not been identified as causal in families predisposed to melanoma. However, a recent study suggested that a BRAF haplotype was associated with risk of sporadic melanoma in men. Polymorphisms or other variants in the BRAF gene may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance genes for nevus/melanoma susceptibility. We hypothesized that promoter variants would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk. Using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened peripheral blood DNA from 184 familial melanoma cases for BRAF promoter variants. We identified a promoter insertion/deletion in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described BRAF polymorphism in intron 11 (rs1639679) reported to be associated with melanoma susceptibility in males. We therefore investigated the contribution of this BRAF polymorphism to melanoma susceptibility in 581 consecutively recruited incident cases, 258 incident cases in a study of late relapse, 673 female general practitioner controls, and the 184 familial cases. We found no statistically significant difference in either genotype or allele frequencies between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the BRAF polymorphism in the two incident case series. Our results therefore suggest that the BRAF polymorphism is not significantly associated with melanoma and the promoter insertion/deletion linked with the polymorphism is not a causal variant.

        "Doc_abstract":"During progression of melanoma, malignant melanocytes can be reprogrammed into mesenchymal-like cells through a process similar to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with downregulation of the junctional protein E-cadherin and acquisition of a migratory phenotype. Recent evidence supports a role for SLUG, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin, as a melanocyte lineage transcription factor that predisposes to melanoma metastasis. However, the signals responsible for SLUG expression in melanoma are unclear and its role in the invasive phenotype is not fully elucidated. Here, we report that SLUG expression and activation is driven by SPARC (also known as osteonectin), a secreted extracellular matrix-associated factor that promotes EMT-like changes. Ectopic expression or knockdown of SPARC resulted in increased or reduced expression of SLUG, respectively. SLUG increase occurred concomitantly with SPARC-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin and P-cadherin, and induction of mesenchymal traits in human melanocytes and melanoma cells. Pharmacological blockade of PI3 kinase/AKT signaling impeded SPARC-induced SLUG levels and cell migration, whereas adenoviral introduction of constitutively active AKT allowed rescue of SLUG and migratory capabilities of SPARC knockdown cells. We also observed that pharmacological inhibition of oncogenic BRAF(V600E) using PLX4720 did not influence SLUG expression in melanoma cells harboring BRAF(V600E). Furthermore, SLUG is a bona fide transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin as well as a regulator of P-cadherin in melanoma cells and its knockdown attenuated invasive behavior and blocked SPARC-enhanced cell migration. Notably, inhibition of cell migration in SPARC-depleted cells was rescued by expression of a SLUG transgene. In freshly isolated metastatic melanoma cells, a positive association between SPARC and SLUG mRNA levels was also found. These findings reveal that autocrine SPARC maintains heightened SLUG expression in melanoma cells and indicate that SPARC may promote EMT-associated tumor invasion by supporting AKT-dependent upregulation of SLUG.",

When testing gene lists discriminative of BRAF, NRAS and MAPK alterations, we found that 112 BRAF-specific transcripts were able to distinguish the two immune-related phenotypes already described in melanoma, with the poor phenotype associated mostly with BRAF mutation. Noteworthy, such association was stronger in samples displaying low BRAF mRNA expression.

To employ an alternative approach, we have targeted the Hedgehog/GLI pathway, which is deregulated in melanomas, through the GLI1/2 inhibitor GANT61, alone or accompanied with the treatment by the BCL2 family inhibitor obatoclax in 9 melanoma cell lines. Thus, we targeted melanoma cells irrespective of their NRAS or BRAF mutational status. After GANT61 treatment, the cell viability was drastically diminished via apoptosis, as substantial nuclear DNA fragmentation was detected. In all tested melanoma cell lines, the combined treatment was more efficient than the application of each drug alone at the end of the cell growth with inhibitors. GANT61 was efficient also alone in most cell lines without the addition of obatoclax, which had only a limited effect when used as a single drug. In most cell lines, tumor cells were eradicated after 5-9 days of combined treatment in colony outgrowth assay.

We test whether markers of immune infiltration correlate with clinical outcome in ulcerated compared to non-ulcerated primary melanoma tumors.;Sixty-two stage II-III cutaneous melanomas, 32 ulcerated and 30 non-ulcerated, were analyzed for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for CD2, a marker previously shown to correlate with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in this patient population. IHC using antibody, VE1, to BRAF V600E was also performed on a subset of 41 tumors to assess the relationship of BRAF mutation to immune markers.;We found, using Cox regression models, that the presence of TILs was associated with improved OS (p = 0.034) and RFS (p = 0.002) in ulcerated melanoma tumors, but not in non-ulcerated melanoma (p = 0.632, 0.416). CD2 expression also was correlated with improved OS (p = 0.021) and RFS (p = 0.001) in ulcerated melanoma, but no relationship was seen in non-ulcerated melanoma (p = 0.427, 0.682). In this small population, BRAF status did not correlate with TILs or CD2+ count.;Our data show that immune markers including TILs and CD2 count correlate more closely with survival in ulcerated melanomas than that in non-ulcerated melanomas. We propose that immune biomarkers may be particularly relevant to ulcerated, as compared to non-ulcerated, melanomas and that this merits study in larger populations.",

In this study, we profiled immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a B-RafV600E/Pten-driven murine model of melanoma after administration of the B-Raf(V600E) small molecule inhibitor PLX4720. In this model, we found that as tumors developed, they gradually acquired immunosuppressive features, including accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells and loss of Th1 effector functions on CD4(+) TILs, such as CD40L and IFNγ expression. PLX4720 administration promoted development of a more immune stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in CD40L and IFNγ expression on intratumoral CD4(+) TILs and a reduced accumulation of Tregs and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells. Strikingly, CD40L or IFNγ blockade compromised the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit melanoma growth. Supporting this result, agonistic CD40 antibody was sufficient to evoke antitumor immunity and suppress tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results establish the critical role of immune-related changes, with key contributions for CD40L and IFNγ signaling in the antitumor responses triggered in vivo by B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors.",

However, little is known about the implication of BRAF and RKIP expression, or about the incidence of BRAF mutations in the formation of these cutaneous diseases. The RAS oncogene has been proposed to significantly contribute to skin cancer development. Moreover, numerous BRAF mutations have been detected in melanoma biopsy specimens and cell lines.;This study aimed to measure the mRNA levels of the genes BRAF and RKIP in AK, as well as their possible implication in the progress of AK to SCC. All biopsy specimens were also screened for BRAF mutations within exons 11 and 15.;Significant downregulation was noted for both genes in SCC, compared to normal tissue (for BRAF, p = 0.002; for RKIP, p < 0.001). RKIP expression levels were significantly higher than the corresponding levels of BRAF (p < 0.001), whereas the two genes showed a negative correlation not only in AK and SCC, but in the adjacent phenotypically normal skin tissue, as well. No mutation was detected, either in AK or SCC, within exons 11 and 15 of the BRAF gene.;Expression levels of the genes BRAF and RKIP were examined in 16 AKs and 12 SCCs by RT-qPCR. A novel allele-specific qPCR method, in combination with direct DNA sequencing, was performed in order to inspect the frequency of the V600E mutation in exon 15, as well as to examine the mutation status of the gene within exon 11.;Both BRAF and RKIP expression levels exhibit a decrease from normal skin tissue and AK, going to SCC. The decrease of RKIP mRNA levels in SCC, suggests one novel mechanism in the deregulation of the BRAF signaling pathway. Our results further indicate that BRAF does not appear to be frequently mutated either in pre-cancerous skin lesions (AK) or in non-melanoma skin tumors (SCC).",

Purified kinase assays have demonstrated that PLX-4032 and its related analogs are highly potent inhibitors of B-Raf activity, with 3-fold selectivity for the V600E mutation over the wild-type kinase. In preclinical models, PLX-4032 and its analogs inhibited the growth of BRAFV600E-positive melanoma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. In phase I clinical trials, PLX-4032 was well tolerated and objective responses were observed in several patients with BRAFV600E-positive tumors. Responses correlated well with inhibition of intratumoral phospho-ERK and cell proliferation, and reductions in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET scanning. A preliminary analysis of this phase I data suggested that progression-free survival was approximately 7 months, and phase II and III clinical trials are now underway.

To this purpose, we tested total cfDNA concentration, cfDNA integrity, BRAF(V600E) mutation and RASSF1A promoter methylation associated to cfDNA in a series of 76 melanoma patients and 63 healthy controls. The chosen biomarkers were assayed in cfDNA samples by qPCR. Comparison of biomarkers distribution in cases and controls was performed by a logistic regression model in both univariate and multivariate analysis. The predictive capability of each logistic model was investigated by means of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). To aid the reader to interpret the value of the AUC, values between 0.6 and 0.7, between 0.71 and 0.8 and greater than 0.8 were considered as indicating a weak predictive, satisfactory and good predictive capacity, respectively. The AUC value for each biomarker (univariate logistic model) was weak/satisfactory ranging between 0.64 (BRAF(V600E)) to 0.85 (total cfDNA). A good overall predictive capability for the final logistic model was found with an AUC of 0.95. The highest predictive capability was given by total cfDNA (AUC:0.86) followed by integrity index 180/67 (AUC:0.90) and methylated RASSF1A (AUC:0.89).An approach based on the simultaneous determination of three biomarkers (total cfDNA, integrity index 180/67 and methylated RASSF1A) could improve the diagnostic performance in melanoma.",

Of these, the majority fits into four categories: superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM). Thus far, there is very limited data combining BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis to explore differences between cutaneous melanoma subtypes. The aim of this study was to address this issue.;The frequency of BRAF and NRAS hotspot mutations, in exons 15 and 2, respectively, was assessed in 59 cutaneous melanomas comprising superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and ALM using single-strand conformational polymorphism and RFLP-PCR analysis.;Only 2 of 21 (9.5%) ALM showed BRAF exon 15 mutation compared with 9 of 14 (64.3%) superficial spreading malignant melanomas, 4 of 11 (36.4%) nodular melanomas, and 7 of 13 (53.4%) lentigo maligna melanomas (P < 0.01). However, our key finding is that the combined analysis of BRAF exon 15 and NRAS exon 2 showed that there were no significant differences in the overall mutation frequency between subtypes. In particular, 9 of 19 (47.4%) ALM without BRAF exon 15 mutation had an NRAS exon 2 mutation.;We show that the overall BRAF/NRAS frequency in mutation hotspots is not significantly different among cutaneous melanoma subtypes.

Recent reports indicate a high prevalence of somatic mutations of the BRAF gene in melanomas and melanocytic nevi. Here we report that germ-line single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BRAF are significantly associated with melanoma in German males, but not females. At-risk haplotypes of BRAF are shown. Based upon their frequencies, we estimate that BRAF could account for a proportion attributable risk of developing melanoma of 4% in the German population. The causal variant has yet to be determined. The burden of disease associated with this variant is greater than that associated with the major melanoma susceptibility locus CDKN2A, which has an estimated attributable risk of less than 1%.",

Most of the compounds showed potent antiproliferative activity against the WM3629 melanoma cell line and the most promising compound, compound 10d, was found to be a potent and selective CRAF inhibitor with an IC50 value of 38.6 nM, which shows greater than 270-fold selectivity over BRAF kinase (9.45 μM).",

Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a master gene regulating melanocyte development and functions as a \"lineage addiction\" oncogene in malignant melanoma. We have identified the receptor protein tyrosine kinase TYRO3 as an upstream regulator of MITF expression by a genome-wide gain-of-function cDNA screen and show that TYRO3 induces MITF-M expression in a SOX10-dependent manner in melanoma cells. Expression of TYRO3 is significantly elevated in human primary melanoma tissue samples and melanoma cell lines and correlates with MITF-M mRNA levels. TYRO3 overexpression bypasses BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence in primary melanocytes, inducing transformation of non-tumorigenic cell lines. Furthermore, TYRO3 knockdown represses cellular proliferation and colony formation in melanoma cells, and sensitizes them to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis; TYRO3 knockdown in melanoma cells also inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that TYRO3 may serve as a target for the development of therapeutic agents for melanoma.",

Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies. ",

We analysed the clinical benefit and safety of vemurafenib. Secondary analyses included the impact of brain metastases on median OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Fifty patients were enrolled, of whom 20% had stage IIIC and 80% stage IV disease. The majority were men (58%), with a median age of 58 years (51-69). Forty-three patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 (86%). Twenty patients had brain metastases (40%). Overall response rate was 53%. Complete response was achieved in five patients (10%), partial response in 21 patients (43%) and stable disease in seven patients (14%). Median OS was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval 5.6-12.7) and PFS was 3.6 months (95% confidence interval 2.9-5.9). Patients with brain metastasis had a response rate of 50% (nine partial response, one complete response), and median OS and PFS were, respectively, 4.3 and 3.1 months. Common adverse events were fatigue, arthralgia and cutaneous side effects. Sixteen per cent developed squamous cell carcinoma. Grade 3/4 was observed in 11 patients (22%). Six per cent required temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction because of toxic effects. This study confirms the considerable clinical benefit of vemurafenib for patients with brain metastasis, with manageable toxicity. ",

Owing to the lack of sufficient material from fresh specimens, we employed short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies. In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival. These data support the existence of several molecularly defined melanoma groups which likely reflect different clinical/biological behaviour, thus suggesting that a more extensive molecular classification of melanoma would significantly impact its clinical management.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if BRAF mutations occur in canine oral malignant melanomas. The canine BRAF gene was first cloned from normal canine testicular cDNA, and a novel previously unreported splice variant involving exon 5 was identified during this process. To screen canine melanoma samples for BRAF mutation in codon 599, cDNA and genomic DNA were isolated from canine malignant melanoma cell lines and primary tumor samples respectively, all from cases seen at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for exon 15 using primers based at the 5' end of exon 15 and the 5' end of intron 15 and the resultant products were directly sequenced. No mutations in codon 599 or exon 15 were identified in any of the 17 samples evaluated. However, all of the melanoma cell lines expressed BRAF and demonstrated high levels of basal ERK phosphorylation suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway is present. Therefore, similar to the case with human mucosal melanomas, canine oral malignant melanomas do not possess codon 599 BRAF mutations commonly identified in human cutaneous melanomas.

Concurrently, and by contrast, ipilimumab, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor, was shown to provide long-term clinical benefit, but only in a minority of patients. This situation generated an ongoing debate about how to best use these drugs in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. Recently, however, several new compounds and combinations of cell pathway signalling inhibitors and immunotherapies have been developed that look set to improve patient outcomes even further. In this Review, we discuss the existing evidence for the newest treatments for BRAF-mutant melanoma, including combined BRAF and MEK inhibition and PD-1-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, and assess future treatment strategies that could change metastatic melanoma from a rapidly fatal terminal illness to a chronic disease for most patients.",

Trametinib is the first-in-class mitogen-activated, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor that targets a kinase in the MAPK pathway that plays a key role in oncogenic cell proliferation, survival, invasion, tumor angiogenesis, and escape from apoptosis. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients whose tumors express the BRAF V600E or V600K gene mutations. Moreover, trametinib is also indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor). Trametinib is not indicated in patients who have received prior BRAF-inhibitor therapy due to poor response and possible cross-resistance. The most common adverse effects associated with the use of trametinib for both monotherapy and combination therapy are rash, diarrhea, peripheral edema, fatigue, and dermatitis. The recommended dosage of trametinib monotherapy is 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. With a daily dose of 2 mg, an estimated 30-day course of treatment would cost approximately $9135.;Trametinib, a novel MEK inhibitor, provides an alternative therapy for patients with BRAF V600 E/K metastatic melanoma as a single agent or in combination therapy for patients not previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.

More recently, the combination of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with MEK inhibitor trametinib has shown improved progression-free survival, compared to dabrafenib monotherapy, in a Phase II study and has received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, even when treated with the combination, most patients develop mechanisms of acquired resistance, and some of them do not achieve tumor regression at all, because of intrinsic resistance to therapy. Along with the development of BRAF inhibitors, immunotherapy made an important step forward: ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; anti-PD-1 agents achieved promising results in Phase I/II trials, and data from Phase III studies will be ready soon. The availability of such drugs, which are effective regardless of BRAF status, has made the therapeutic approach more complex, as first-line treatment with BRAF inhibitors may not be the best choice for all BRAF-mutated patients. The aim of this paper is to review the systemic therapeutic options available today for patients affected by BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma, as well as to summarize the mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors and discuss the possible strategies to overcome them. Moreover, since the molecular analysis of tumor specimens is now a pivotal and decisional factor in the treatment strategy of metastatic melanoma patients, the advances in the molecular detection techniques for the BRAF V600 mutation will be reported.

Almost 50% of melanomas harbour mutations in BRAF, mainly at codon 600, which result in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The selective inhibitors of mutant BRAF Val600, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, showed major tumour responses, resulting in improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with metastatic disease, compared with chemotherapy. Antitumour activity was also recorded in brain metastases. The growth of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas is a unique side-effect of BRAF inhibitor therapy that is induced by the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in cells with RAS mutations. Trametinib, which targets MEK downstream of BRAF, also produced an overall survival benefit compared with chemotherapy, although tumour responses were less frequent than they were with BRAF inhibitors. Despite this robust antitumour activity, most responses to these drugs are partial and disease progression is typically seen at a median of 5-7 months. Multiple resistance mechanisms have been identified, including those that lead to reactivation of the MAPK pathway and other pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and VEGF pathways. Some patients with BRAF Val600 mutant melanoma seem to also benefit from immunotherapies such as high-dose interleukin 2 and ipilimumab, which, by contrast with BRAF inhibitors, can produce durable complete responses.

Meanwhile, evidence has been provided that combinations between BRAF inhibitors and MEK1/2 inhibitors are more promising than single-agent treatments. Moreover, new treatment algorithms favor sequential treatment using BRAF inhibitors and newly developed immunotherapies targeting common T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In depth molecular analyses have uncovered new mechanisms of treatment resistance and recurrence, which may impact on future treatment decisions. Moreover, next-generation sequencing data have shown that recurrent lesions harbor specific genetic aberrations. At the same time, high throughput sequencing studies of melanoma unraveled a series of new treatment candidates for future treatment approaches such as ERBB4, GRIN2A, GRM3, and RAC1. More recent bioinformatic technologies provided genetic evidence for extensive tumor heterogeneity and tumor clonality of solid tumors, which might also be of relevance for melanoma. However, these technologies have not yet been applied to this tumor. In this review, an overview on the genetic basis of current treatment of melanoma, treatment resistance and recurrences including new treatment perspectives based on recent high-throughput sequencing data is provided.

Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.

Among them vemurafenib, a BrafV600E specific inhibitor, showed promising results in terms of response rate and increase in median survival time. However, its effectiveness is limited by development of resistance and the search for additional drugs for melanoma treatment is ongoing. The present study was performed to analyze the correlation between Braf expression and the expression of p300, a known down stream target of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which was recently shown by us to be a prognostic marker for melanoma progression and patient survival.;The expression of Braf and p300 expression were correlated and analyzed by Chi-square test. A total of 327 melanoma patient cases (193 primary melanoma and 134 metastatic melanoma) were used for the study. Classification & regression tree (CRT), Kaplan-Meier, and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to elucidate the significance of the combination of Braf and p300 expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma.;Our results demonstrate that Braf expression is inversely correlated with nuclear p300 and positively correlated with cytoplasmic p300 expression. Braf and cytoplasmic p300 were found to be associated with melanoma progression, tumor size and ulceration status. CRT analysis revealed that a combination of Braf and p300 expression (nuclear and cytoplasmic), could be used to distinguish between nevi and melanoma, and primary from metastatic melanoma lesions. The combination of Braf and nuclear p300 was significantly associated with patient survival and nuclear p300 was found to be an independent predictor of patient survival.;Our results indicate a cross-talk between Braf and p300 in melanoma and demonstrate the importance Braf and p300 expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma.",

Given that p53 is capable of antagonising PI3K/AKT activation we hypothesised that pharmacological restoration of p53 activity may increase the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma to MAPK-targeted therapy and eventually delay and/or prevent acquisition of drug resistance. To test this possibility we exposed a panel of vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant (innate and acquired) (V600E/K)BRAF melanomas to a (V600E/K)BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) alone or in combination with a direct p53 activator (PRIMA-1(Met)/APR-246). Strikingly, PRIMA-1(Met) synergised with vemurafenib to induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation of (V600E/K)BRAF melanoma cells in vitro and to inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Importantly, this drug combination decreased the viability of both vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant melanoma cells irrespectively of the TP53 status. Notably, p53 reactivation was invariably accompanied by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition, the activity of which was found as a dominant resistance mechanism to BRAF inhibition in our lines. From all various combinatorial modalities tested, targeting the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways through p53 reactivation or not, the PRIMA-1(Met)/vemurafenib combination was the most cytotoxic. We conclude that PRIMA-1(Met) through its ability to directly reactivate p53 regardless of the mechanism causing its deactivation, and thereby dampen PI3K signalling, sensitises (V600E/K)BRAF-positive melanoma to BRAF inhibitors.",

Features consistent with vitiligo were evident at clinical and ultraviolet light examination, as well as at in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy. The latter examination showed lack of normal brightly refractile papillary rings at the dermo-epidermal junction in lesional skin, as well as decreased brightness and half-rings with \"scalloped border-like\" features in adjacent non-lesional skin.

The present study aimed to define the immunologic basis of BRAF-inhibitor therapy using the Braf/Pten model of inducible, autochthonous melanoma on a pure C57BL/6 background. In the tumor microenvironment, BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 functioned by on-target mechanisms to selectively decrease both the proportions and absolute numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), while preserving numbers of CD8(+) effector T cells. In PLX4720-treated mice, the intratumoral Treg populations decreased significantly, demonstrating enhanced apopotosis. CD11b(+) myeloid cells from PLX4720-treated tumors also exhibited decreased immunosuppressive function on a per-cell basis. In accordance with a reversion of tumor immune suppression, tumors that had been treated with PLX4720 grew with reduced kinetics after treatment was discontinued, and this growth delay was dependent on CD8 T cells. These findings demonstrate that BRAF inhibition selectively reverses two major mechanisms of immunosuppression in melanoma and liberates host-adaptive antitumor immunity.",

In order to explore the antitumor activity of prenylation inhibition we investigated the response to zoledronic acid treatment in thirteen human melanoma cell lines with known BRAF, NRAS and PTEN mutational status. Effect of zoledronic acid on proliferation, clonogenic potential, apoptosis and migration of melanoma cells as well as the activation of downstream elements of the RAS/RAF pathway were investigated in vitro with SRB, TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays and videomicroscopy and immunoblot measurements, respectively. Subcutaneous and spleen-to-liver colonization xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the influence of zoledronic acid treatment on primary and disseminated tumor growth of melanoma cells in vivo. Zoledronic acid more efficiently decreased short-term in vitro viability in NRAS mutant cells when compared to BRAF mutant and BRAF/NRAS wild-type cells. In line with this finding, following treatment decreased activation of ribosomal protein S6 was found in NRAS mutant cells. Zoledronic acid demonstrated no significant synergism in cell viability inhibition or apoptosis induction with cisplatin or DTIC treatment in vitro. Importantly, zoledronic acid could inhibit clonogenic growth in the majority of melanoma cell lines except in the three BRAF mutant but PTEN wild-type melanoma lines. A similar pattern was observed in apoptosis induction experiments. In vivo zoledronic acid did not inhibit the subcutaneous growth or spleen-to-liver colonization of melanoma cells. Altogether our data demonstrates that prenylation inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach in NRAS mutant melanoma. Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that therapeutic sensitivity might be influenced by the PTEN status of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. However, further investigations are needed to identify drugs that have appropriate pharmacological properties to efficiently target prenylation in melanoma cells. ",

By contrast, activating mutations in B-RAF are rare in ocular melanoma. This study aimed to determine the role of wild-type B-Raf ((WT)B-Raf) in uveal melanoma cell growth. We used cell lines derived from primary tumors of uveal melanoma to assess the role of (WT)B-Raf in cell proliferation and to characterize its upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Melanoma cell lines expressing (WT)B-Raf and (WT)Ras grew with similar proliferation rates, showed constitutive activation of ERK1/2, and had similar levels of B-Raf expression and B-Raf kinase activity as melanoma cell lines expressing the activating V600E mutation ((V600E)B-Raf). They were equally as sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 for cell proliferation and transformation as (V600E)B-Raf cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of Raf-1 did not affect either ERK1/2 activation, whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of B-Raf reduced cell proliferation by up to 65% through the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation, irrespective of the mutational status of B-Raf. Pharmacological inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and siRNA-mediated depletion of PKA greatly reduced B-Raf activity, ERK1/2 activation, and cell proliferation in (WT)B-Raf cells, whereas it did not affect (V600E)B-Raf cells, demonstrating a key role of PKA in mediating (WT)B-Raf/ERK signaling for uveal melanoma cell growth. Moreover, inactivation or depletion of PKA did not affect Rap-1 activity, and Rap-1 depletion did not affect either B-Raf activity or ERK1/2 activation. This ruled out a role for Rap1 in the PKA-mediated B-Raf/ERK activation in (WT)B-Raf cells. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of cyclin D1 in mediating PKA/(WT)B-Raf signaling for cell proliferation. Altogether, our results suggest that the PKA/B-Raf pathway is a potential target for therapeutic strategies against (WT)B-Raf-expressing uveal melanoma.",

We describe the discovery and structure-activity relationship study of a series of 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-5-carboxamide analogues as novel dual inhibitors of EGFR and B-Raf(V600E) mutant. One of the most promising compounds, 6a, potently inhibited both of the kinases with IC50 values of 8.0 and 51 nM, respectively. The compound also strongly suppressed the proliferation of a panel of intrinsic and acquired resistant melanoma and/or colorectal cancer cells harboring overexpressed EGFR with submicromolar IC50 values. Further mechanism investigation revealed that 6a could sustainably inhibit the activation of the MAPK path way in the resistant SK-MEL-28 PR30 melanoma cancer cells and WiDr colorectal cancer cells with EGFR amplification. Our results support the hypothesis that the EGFR/B-Raf(V600E) dual inhibition might be a tractable strategy to overcome the intrinsic and acquired resistance of melanoma and/or colorectal cancers against the current B-Raf(V600E) inhibitor therapy.

PLX4720 is a selective inhibitor of mutant B-RAF and its analog, PLX4032, is currently undergoing clinical trials in melanoma. However, the effects of PLX4720 across the genotypic spectrum in melanoma remain unclear. Here, we describe that PLX4720 treatment rapidly induces hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in mutant N-RAS melanoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C-RAF is the major RAF isoform involved in this process. Importantly, PLX4720-induced hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway promotes resistance to apoptosis in both non-invasive and invasive mutant N-RAS melanoma cells but does not enhance cell cycle properties. These findings underscore the need to genotypically stratify melanoma patients before enrollment on a mutant B-RAF inhibitor trial.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations of BRAF occur in approximately 7% of all human tumors and in the majority of melanomas. These tumors are very sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), which causes loss of D-cyclin expression, hypophosphorylation of Rb, and G(1) arrest. Growth arrest is followed by differentiation or senescence and, in a subset of BRAF mutant tumors, by apoptosis. The former effects result in so-called \"stable disease\" and, in patients with cancer, can be difficult to distinguish from indolent tumor growth. The profound G(1) arrest induced by MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant tumors is associated with a marked decline in thymidine uptake and is therefore potentially detectable in vivo by noninvasive 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In SKMEL-28 tumor xenografts, MEK inhibition completely inhibited tumor growth and induced differentiation with only modest tumor regression. MEK inhibition also resulted in a rapid decline in the [(18)F]FLT signal in V600E BRAF mutant SKMEL-28 xenografts but not in BRAF wild-type BT-474 xenografts. The data suggest that [(18)F]FLT PET can effectively image induction of G(1) arrest by MEK inhibitors in mutant BRAF tumors and may be a useful noninvasive method for assessing the early biological response to this class of drugs.",

MAPK activation occurs via somatic mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 for over 70% of tumors and less frequently via V600E BRAF mutations. In this report, we describe the impact of dual pathway inhibition upon uveal melanoma cell lines with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY-142886) and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055. While synergistic reductions in cell viability were observed with AZD8055/selumetinib in both BRAF and GNAQ mutant cell lines, apoptosis was preferentially induced in BRAF mutant cells only. In vitro apoptosis assay results were predictive of in vivo drug efficacy as tumor regressions were observed only in a BRAF mutant xenograft model, but not GNAQ mutant model. We went on to discover that GNAQ promotes relative resistance to AZD8055/selumetinib-induced apoptosis in GNAQ mutant cells. For BRAF mutant cells, both AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were modulated by the combination; however, decreasing AKT phosphorylation alone was not sufficient and decreasing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not required for apoptosis. Instead, cooperative mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and MEK inhibition resulting in downregulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 was found to be critical for combination-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of combined MEK and mTOR kinase inhibition will be determined by tumor genotype, and that BRAF mutant malignancies will be particularly susceptible to this strategy.",

Exons 11 through 18 of the BRAF gene were screened from 33 primary UMs and 11 UM cell lines. Genomic polymerase chain reaction products were evaluated using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, followed by sequencing of aberrant products. The most common mutation, T1796A in the kinase domain of BRAF, was not observed in any of the primary UM samples. This mutation was also absent in 10 of the 11 UM cell lines.

We first analyzed a panel of 52 melanoma cell lines (n = 35, 11, 6 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization for unique alterations that associate with each mutation subgroup. Subsequently, those DNA copy number changes that correlated with a mutation subgroup were used to predict the mutation status of an independent panel of 43 tumors (n = 17, 13, 13 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively). BRAF mutant tumors were classified with a high rate of success (74.4%, P = 0.002), whereas NRAS mutants were not significantly distinguished from wild types (26/43, P = 0.12).

Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019).

Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage.

Using the PubMed database, an extensive literature search was performed for the following topics: vermurafenib, nevus, nevi, melanoma, pigmented lesion, cutaneous, adverse effect, side effect. The results of the search were used to secure all reports of new or changing pigmented lesions after initiating treatment with vemurafenib.;Vemurafenib is associated with both changes in existing pigmented lesions (including involution, alteration of color and size, and progression to melanoma) and the onset of new melanocytic lesions-nevi (in 5 patients) and primary melanomas (in 2 patients). Visual examination, dermoscopic evaluation, and reflectance confocal microscopy have been used to document the changes in existing or new melanocytic lesions subsequent to initiating treatment with vermurafenib. Histopathology analysis has shown these lesions to usually be either dysplastic nevi or new primary melanomas.;Vemurafenib-treated patients can develop new pigmented lesions (such as nevi) and/or morphological changes in their existing melanocytic lesions (such as involution, increase in size, or alternation of color). In addition, they can develop new primary malignant melanomas that either occur de novo on normal-appearing skin or develop in pre-existing melanocytic lesions. Therefore, total body skin examination should be considered prior to initiating treatment with vemurafenib. Regularly scheduled follow-up skin examinations are also recommended for patients while they are receiving this drug. In addition, for patients who are being treated with vemurafenib, either dermoscopic or photographic or visual modalities should be used to evaluate new or changing pigmented lesions. Also, biopsy for histopathology should be considered for vemurafenib-treated patients who develop new pigmented lesions or whose existing melanocytic lesions have morphological changes in size or color.",

Patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor (cohort A) or treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (BRAF-inhibitor naive; cohort B) were enrolled. Patients received 2 mg of trametinib orally once daily.;In cohort A (n = 40), there were no confirmed objective responses and 11 patients (28%) with stable disease (SD); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months. In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed.;Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy.

We observed that samples carrying NRAS mutations lie somewhere between those with or without BRAF mutations.

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma, a malignant tumor of melanocytes, causes the majority (75%) of all skin cancer-related deaths. The overall efficacy of different anti-cancer therapies on metastatic melanoma is quite limited, due to its high resistance to all forms of conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, leading to low patient survival rates. The present review identifies possible strategies for the treatment of advanced melanoma and describes two novel agents, Ipilimumab and Vemurafenib, which may now be useful for clinical practice. Ipilimumab, a humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, acts through immune-modulation since it blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), producing favourable antitumor immune system responses and reducing tolerance to tumor-associated antigens. Vemurafenib is a novel oral small-molecule kinase inhibitor with high selectivity and efficacy toward a specific mutated oncogenic BRAF-signalling mediator. The mechanism of action of Vemurafenib involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF(V600E) kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant MAPK pathway. However, as patients commonly develop Vemurafenib resistance, clinical trials of Vemurafenib in combination with Ipilimumab or other targeted or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents may provide more effective regimens with longterm clinical benefits, emphasizing the importance of simultaneously targeting several pathways. As both drugs had only modest effects on median survival, new therapeutic combinations are needed, such as BRAF inhibitors with MEK inhibitors or combinations of immunomodulators and pathway inhibitors. Such strategies should have the potential of maximizing antitumor effect while minimizing and improving clinical benefit. Nevertheless, these two new agents open a promising view into an effective management of melanoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is a common, often deadly malignancy, historically associated with limited treatment options for advanced disease. In recent years, systems-based research has resulted in significant clinical advancements. Strategic inhibition of mutated oncoproteins and targeting of immune checkpoints have emerged as very promising approaches. Vemurafenib, which received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2011, selectively inhibits BRAF(V600E) , a hyperactivated mutant signaling kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Another recently FDA-approved drug, ipilimumab, blocks the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) pathway from inhibiting T cell activation. Despite this apparent progress, compelling challenges remain for both researchers and clinicians. Responses to therapy remain unacceptably incomplete and, in most cases, resistance mechanisms quickly develop that lead to relapse and subsequent patient mortality. Combining therapeutic modalities may increase the percentage of responding patients as well as the magnitude and durability of response. Notably, combined therapies involving selective BRAF inhibitors (SBIs) and other inhibitors of MAPK-dependent or MAPK-independent resistance pathways appear particularly promising. Preclinical and clinical studies are needed to comprehensively evaluate the optimal combinations of therapies, to identify melanoma subtypes that will be most responsive, and to determine optimal dosing, timing, and route of delivery.",

Patients with mutant BRAF melanoma that progress on RAF inhibitors have limited treatment options, and drug removal from resistant tumors may elicit multiple effects. A frequent mechanism of resistance to RAF inhibitors is caused by expression of mutant BRAF splice variants. RAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines, generated in vivo, were tested as to whether or not mutant BRAF splice variants confer a fitness advantage in the presence of RAF inhibitor. Critically, cells expressing distinct mutant BRAF splice variants grow more efficiently in vitro and in vivo in the presence of the vemurafenib analog, PLX4720, compared with in the absence of inhibitor. PLX4720-treated BRAF splice variant-expressing cells exhibited levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 comparable to untreated parental cells. In addition, a reduction in phospho-ERK1/2 levels following treatment with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib (GSK1120212) phenocopied the fitness benefit provided by PLX4720.

Among them, ABCB5-expressing cells were proposed to display an enhanced tumorigenicity with stem cell-like properties. In addition, ABCB5(+) cells are thought to participate to chemoresistance through a potential efflux function of ABCB5. Nevertheless, the fate of these cells upon drugs that are used in melanoma chemotherapy remains to be clarified. Here we explored the effect of anti-melanoma treatments on the ABCB5-expressing cells. Using a melanoma xenograft model (WM266-4), we observed in vivo that ABCB5-expressing cells are enriched after a temozolomide treatment that induces a significant tumor regression. These results were further confirmed in a preliminary study conducted on clinical samples from patients that received dacarbazine. In vitro, we showed that ABCB5-expressing cells selectively survive when exposed to dacarbazine, the reference treatment of metastatic melanoma, but also to vemurafenib, a new inhibitor of the mutated kinase V600E BRAF and other various chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results show that anti-melanoma chemotherapy might participate to the chemoresistance acquisition by selecting tumor cell subpopulations expressing ABCB5. This is of particular importance in understanding the relapses observed after anti-melanoma treatments and reinforces the interest of ABCB5 and ABCB5-expressing cells as potential therapeutic targets in melanoma.",

To circumvent the problematic background mutation rates and identify new melanoma driver genes, we carried out a low-copy piggyBac transposon mutagenesis screen in mice. We induced eleven melanomas with mutation burdens that were 100-fold lower relative to human melanomas. Thirty-eight implicated genes, including two known drivers of human melanoma, were classified into three groups based on high, low, or background-level mutation frequencies in human melanomas, and we further explored the functional significance of genes in each group. For two genes overlooked by prevailing discovery methods, we found that loss of membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, O cooperated with the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) recurrent V600E mutation to promote cellular transformation. Moreover, for infrequently mutated genes often disregarded by current methods, we discovered recurrent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (Map3k1)-activating insertions in our screen, mirroring recurrent MAP3K1 up-regulation in human melanomas. Aberrant expression of Map3k1 enabled growth factor-autonomous proliferation and drove BRAF-independent ERK signaling, thus shedding light on alternative means of activating this prominent signaling pathway in melanoma. In summary, our study contributes several previously undescribed genes involved in melanoma and establishes an important proof-of-principle for the utility of the low-copy transposon mutagenesis approach for identifying cancer-driving genes, especially those masked by hypermutation.

The present study aims to elucidate this mechanism of c-Met TKI resistance by investigating key mTOR and Wnt signaling proteins in melanoma cell lines resistant to SU11274, a c-Met TKI. Xenografts from RU melanoma cells treated with c-Met TKIs SU11274 and JNJ38877605 showed a 7- and 6-fold reduction in tumor size, respectively. Resistant cells displayed upregulation of phosphorylated c-Met, mTOR, p70S6Kinase, 4E-BP1, ERK, LRP6, and active β-catenin. In addition, GATA-6, a Wnt signaling regulator, was upregulated, and Axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, was downregulated in resistant cells. Modulation of these mTOR and Wnt pathway proteins was also prevented by combination treatment with SU11274, everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, and XAV939, a Wnt inhibitor. Treatment with everolimus, resulted in 56% growth inhibition, and a triple combination of SU11274, everolimus and XAV939, resulted in 95% growth inhibition in RU cells. The V600E BRAF mutation was found to be positive only in MU cells. Combination treatment with a c-Met TKI and a BRAF inhibitor displayed a synergistic effect in reducing MU cell viability. These studies indicate activation of mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways in c-Met TKI resistant melanoma cells and suggest that concurrent targeting of c-Met, mTOR, and Wnt pathways and BRAF may improve efficacy over traditional TKI monotherapy in melanoma patients.

Analysis either by real-time PCR coupled with fluorescence melting curve analysis or by PCR followed by direct sequencing, along with studies for DNA mismatch repair status using immunohistochemistry, disclosed that 15 out of the 16 cases displayed wild-type genotypes, with a single case of vulvar primary melanoma, harboring the activating mutation BRAF(V600E). Investigations on whether this could reflect partly an efficient mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism were confirmed by normal expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2, suggesting that the lack of mutations could be explained by the operation of alternative pathogenetic mechanisms modulating downstream effectors of the signaling pathways.

        "Doc_abstract":"The incorporation of individualized molecular therapeutics into routine clinical practice for both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma are amongst the most significant advances of the last decades in medical oncology. In NSCLC activating somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene have been found to be predictive of a response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib or gefitinib. More recently the EML4-ALK fusion gene which occurs in 3-5% of NSCLC has been found to predict sensitivity to crizotinib an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase. Similarly in melanoma, 50% of cases have BRAF mutations in exon 15 mostly V600E and these cases are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib. In a Phase III study of advanced melanoma cases with this mutation vemurafenib improved survival from 64% to 84% at 6 months, when compared with dacarbazine. In both NSCLC and melanoma clinical benefit is not obtained in patients without these genomic changes, and moreover in the case of vemurafenib the therapy may theoretically induce proliferation of cases of melanoma without BRAF mutations. An emerging clinical challenge is that of acquired resistance after initial responses to targeted therapeutics. Resistance to the TKI's in NSCLC is most frequently due to acquisition of secondary mutations within the tyrosine kinase of the EGFR or alternatively activation of alternative tyrosine kinases such as C-MET. Mechanisms of drug resistance in melanoma to vemurafenib do not involve mutations in BRAF itself but are associated with a variety of molecular changes including RAF1 or COT gene over expression, activating mutations in RAS or increased activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRβ. Importantly these data support introducing re-biopsy of tumors at progression to continue to personalize the choice of therapy throughout the patient's disease course. ",

Resistance is often mediated by pathway reactivation through receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/SRC-family kinase (SFK) signaling or mutant NRAS, which drive paradoxical reactivation of the pathway. We describe pan-RAF inhibitors (CCT196969, CCT241161) that also inhibit SFKs. These compounds do not drive paradoxical pathway activation and inhibit MEK/ERK in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma. They inhibit melanoma cells and patient-derived xenografts that are resistant to BRAF and BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

Forty-two chemokine, cytokine, angiogenic, and growth factors were measured in the sera of 20 BRAF inhibitor-treated and four combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor-treated metastatic melanoma patients using a multiplex chemokine assay. The changes were correlated with Ki-67 and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor biopsies taken at the same time points, as well as clinical outcome, including response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Serum levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α were significantly increased, whereas CXCL8 significantly decreased from pretreatment (PRE) to early during treatment (EDT) serum samples. The decrease in serum CXCL8 levels from PRE to EDT significantly correlated with decreases in markers of melanoma proliferation (Ki-67) and increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T cells in corresponding tumor biopsies. In addition, a greater fold reduction in CXCL8 serum levels from PRE to EDT serum samples was associated with decreased overall survival. These results suggest that BRAF inhibition causes decreased CXCL8 secretion from melanoma cells and induce an immune response against the tumor associated with increased IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if CXCL8 is predictive of response and to confirm the functions of these chemokine and cytokine in BRAF-mutant melanoma under BRAF inhibition. ",

In vitro cell proliferation assays using the sulforhodamine B assay were conducted to determine TAK-733 potency and melanoma responsiveness. In vivo murine modeling with eleven patient-derived melanoma explants evaluated daily dosing of TAK-733 at 25 or 10 mg/kg. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate on-target activity and downstream inhibition by TAK-733 in both in vitro and in vivo studies. TAK-733 demonstrated broad activity in most melanoma cell lines with relative resistance observed at IC50 > 0.1 μmol/L in vitro. TAK-733 also exhibited activity in 10 out of 11 patient-derived explants with tumor growth inhibition ranging from 0% to 100% (P < 0.001-0.03). Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) and NRAS mutational status did not correlate with responsiveness to TAK-733. Pharmacodynamically, pERK was suppressed in sensitive cell lines and tumor explants, confirming TAK-733-mediated inhibition of MEK1/2, although the demonstration of similar effects in the relatively resistant cell lines and tumor explants suggests that escape pathways are contributing to melanoma survival and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TAK-733 exhibits robust tumor growth inhibition and regression against human melanoma cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, suggesting that further clinical development in melanoma is of scientific interest. Particularly interesting is the activity in BRAF wild-type models, where current approved therapy such as vemurafenib has been reported not to be active.",

Selective ERK inhibitors have been proposed as alternative salvage therapies. We show that ERK inhibition is more potent than MEK inhibition at suppressing MAPK activity and inhibiting the proliferation of multiple BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cell models. Nevertheless, melanoma cells often failed to undergo apoptosis in response to ERK inhibition, because the relief of ERK-dependent negative feedback activated RAS and PI3K signalling. Consequently, the combination of ERK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition was effective at promoting cell death in all resistant melanoma cell models, and was substantially more potent than the MEK/PI3K/mTOR inhibitor combination. Our data indicate that a broader targeting strategy concurrently inhibiting ERK, rather than MEK, and PI3K/mTOR may circumvent BRAF inhibitor resistance, and should be considered during the clinical development of ERK inhibitors.

Activation of the PI3K pathway can mediate resistance to these agents, providing a strong rationale for combination therapy in melanoma. Here, a panel of nine low-passage human metastatic melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutations was tested in cell proliferation and protein expression assays for sensitivity to inhibitors of MEK (selumetinib) and BRAF (vemurafenib) as single agents and in combination with inhibitors of pan-PI3K (ZSTK474), pan-PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235), individual PI3K isoforms (p110α, A66; p110β, TGX-221; p110γ, AS-252424; p110δ, idelalisib), or mTORC1/2 (KU-0063794). Selumetinib and vemurafenib potently inhibited cell proliferation in all cell lines, especially in those that expressed low levels of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT). ZSTK474 and BEZ235 also inhibited cell proliferation in all cell lines and enhanced the antitumor activity of selumetinib and vemurafenib in the majority of lines by either interacting synergistically or additively to increase potency or by inducing cytotoxicity by significantly increasing the magnitude of cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, ZSTK474 or BEZ235 combined with selumetinib to produce robust inhibition of pERK, pAKT, and pS6 expression and synergistic inhibition of NZM20 tumor growth. The inhibitors of individual PI3K isoforms or mTORC1/2 were less effective at inhibiting cell proliferation either as single agents or in combination with selumetinib or vemurafenib, although KU-0063794 synergistically interacted with vemurafenib and increased the magnitude of cell growth inhibition with selumetinib or vemurafenib in certain cell lines. Overall, these results suggest that the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is at least partly mediated by activation of the PI3K pathway and can be enhanced by combined inhibition of the BRAF/MEK and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways.

A better understanding of how melanoma-derived immunologically active molecules change in response to MAPK inhibition of BRAF mutated (BRAF) and BRAF wild type (BRAF) melanomas could help identify promising treatment combinations of small molecule inhibitors and immunotherapy. To this aim, we treated 13 BRAF and 13 BRAF mutated human melanoma cell lines with either a specific BRAF inhibitor or an MEK1/2 inhibitor and analyzed changes in the secretion of 42 selected cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. We also measured changes in the expression levels of immunologically relevant melanoma cell surface markers. The BRAF melanomas showed minimal changes in response to the inhibitors, whereas the BRAF cell lines showed, on average, a significant decrease in IFNα2, interleukin-7, Fractalkine, GCSF, GRO, TGFα2, interleukin-8, and VEGF, as well as a reduction in pERK and pMEK protein levels, upon MAPK pathway blockade. BRAF inhibition in BRAF cell lines also resulted in significant changes in the expression of several surface markers including upregulation of β2-microglobulin as well as a decrease in MIC A/B and TRAIL-R2. These results indicate that MAPK pathway inhibition leads to changes in the immunological properties of mutant BRAF melanoma cells and lends support for future studies aimed at designing effective treatment strategies that combine BRAF and MEK inhibition with immunotherapy.

Using immunohistochemistry, PTEN protein expression was lost or greatly reduced in 19% of tumors. Seven tumors with reduced PTEN yielded DNA amenable to sequencing, and three also showed mutation in BRAF but none in NRAS. In all, 11 (85%) of 13 tumors showing reduced PTEN expression were greater than 3.5 mm thick, and the association of increasing Breslow thickness and loss or reduction of PTEN expression was statistically significant (P<0.0001). Mutations in NRAS were not coincident with reduced PTEN expression, and the concurrent mutation of NRAS and BRAF was rare.",

The HMW-MAA-positive cells were isolated using immunomagnetic beads. After removing CD45(+) cells, CTC were identified by staining with MART-1- and gp100-specific antibodies (HMW-MAA(+), CD45(-), MART-1/gp100(+)). Single, isolated CTC were then subjected to BRAF and KIT mutational analysis.;CTC (HMW-MAA(+), CD45(-), MART-1/gp100(+)) were isolated from the blood of 11 patients and BRAF and KIT were sequenced in nine and four patients, respectively. The BRAF sequences identified in the CTC were inconsistent with those identified in autologous melanoma tumours in three patients and the KIT sequences were inconsistent in three patients. In addition, polyclonal BRAF mutations were identified in one patient and concomitant mutations in BRAF and KIT were identified in another patient.;Melanoma cells show clonal heterogeneity.

Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state.

In order to better understand the mechanistic basis for this resistance, we conducted a RNAi-based screen to identify genes that mediated chemoresistance to the RAF kinase inhibitor RAF265 in a BRAF (V600E) mutant melanoma cell line that is resistant to this drug. In this way, we found that knockdown of protein kinase D3 (PRKD3) could enhance cell killing of RAF and MEK inhibitors across multiple melanoma cell lines of various genotypes and sensitivities to RAF265. PRKD3 blockade cooperated with RAF265 to prevent reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway, interrupt cell cycle progression, trigger apoptosis, and inhibit colony formation growth.

The obtained models have a good predictive ability in both internal and external validation. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculations were employed to determine the detailed binding process and to compare the binding mode of the inhibitors with different activities. The binding free energies calculated by MM/PBSA gave a good correlation with the experimental biological activity. The decomposition of free energies by MM/GBSA indicates the van der Waals interaction is the major driving force for the interaction between the inhibitors and (V600E)B-RAF kinase.

Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in melanoma-an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials. However, clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or acquired resistance. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative 'druggable' targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies. Here we expressed ∼600 kinase and kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

Here, we show that melanoma cells that are driven by oncogenic BRAF are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of metformin because RSK sustains TORC1 activity even when AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated. We further show that AMPK targets the dual-specificity protein phosphatase DUSP6 for degradation and this increases ERK activity, which then upregulates the VEGF-A protein. Critically, this drives angiogenesis and accelerates the growth of BRAF-driven tumors in mice. Unexpectedly, however, when VEGF signaling is inhibited, instead of accelerating tumor growth, metformin inhibits tumor growth. Thus, we show that BRAF-driven melanoma cells are resistant to the antigrowth effects of AMPK and that AMPK mediates cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous effects that accelerate the growth of these cells in vivo.;Metformin inhibits the growth of most tumor cells, but BRAF-mutant melanoma cells are resistant to metformin in vitro, and metformin accelerates their growth in vivo. Unexpectedly, VEGF inhibitors and metformin synergize to suppress the growth of BRAF-mutant tumors, revealing a combination of drugs that may be effective in these patients.",

It was hypothesized that the early VO was not indicative of sexual maturation, but a result of a local effect on the vagina. An investigative study was conducted that mimicked the definitive study design, with rats given DAB or vehicle orally from Postnatal Day (PND) 7 to 35 and with necropsy subsets just before VO, at the first and second estrus, along with age-matched controls. Histopathology was performed on reproductive tissues, including immunohistochemistry for BRAF expression. VO occurred earlier in DAB females than in controls (PND 27.2 vs. 31.5); however, the timing of the first estrus was unaffected (PND 34.0 vs. 33.0). DAB-treated females evaluated just before VO (PND 22.0) had mostly immature reproductive tracts with no evidence of ovulation, similar to age-matched controls; however, DAB-treated females had keratinized and histologically open vaginas. Also, there was raised skin around the urogenital area, which correlated with hyperplasia/keratosis of the vulvar skin and keratinization of the distal vagina. BRAF expression (evaluated in controls) was localized to these tissues. Thus, early VO in rats given DAB likely represents a local effect accelerating vaginal keratinization to become open and not accelerated sexual maturation. ",

One hundred twenty relevant full text studies were categorized based on study design and cancer type. Publication bias was evaluated for each category and pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using random or fixed effect meta-analysis based on the percentage of heterogeneity. Twenty six studies on colorectal cancer (11,773 patients) and four studies on melanoma (674 patients) were included in our final meta-analysis. The average prevalence of BRAF mutation was 9.6% in colorectal cancer, and 47.8% in melanoma reports. We found that BRAF mutation increases the risk of mortality in colorectal cancer patients for more than two times; HR = 2.25 (95% CI, 1.82-2.83).

We recently showed that EphA2 is also upregulated by ultraviolet radiation and is able to induce apoptosis. These findings suggest that EphA2 may have different, even paradoxical, effects on viability depending on the cellular context and that EphA2 mediates a delicate balance between life and death of the cell. To functionally clarify EphA2's role in melanoma, we analyzed a panel of melanoma cell lines and found that EphA2 levels are elevated in a significant fraction of the samples. Specific depletion of EphA2 in high-expressing melanoma cells using short hairpin RNA led to profound reductions in cellular viability, colony formation and migration in vitro and a dramatic loss of tumorigenic potential in vivo. Stable introduction of EphA2 into low-expressing cell lines enhanced proliferation, colony formation and migration, further supporting its pro-malignant phenotype. Interestingly, transient expression of EphA2 and/or Braf(V600E) in non-transformed melanocytes led to significant and additive apoptosis. These results verify that EphA2 is an important oncogene and potentially a common source of 'addiction' for many melanoma cells. Moreover, acute induction of EphA2 may purge genetically susceptible cells, thereby uncovering a more aggressive population that is in fact dependent on the oncogene.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Conjunctival malignant melanoma is a rare disease associated with considerable mortality. Most published data have been based on case reports or series of referred patients. In addition, very little is known about the genetic and epigenetic profile of conjunctival melanoma and the resemblance to uveal, cutaneous and mucosal melanoma. The aim was to determine the incidence rate of conjunctival melanoma, and to relate clinicopathological features and treatment to prognosis. A further aim was to determine the prevalence of BRAF mutations in conjunctival melanoma, to determine whether BRAF mutations are early events in pathogenesis, and relate clinicopathological features and prognosis to BRAF-mutation status. Finally, we wanted to identify tumour-specific and prognostic microRNAs in conjunctival melanoma, and to compare these with the microRNA expression of other melanoma subtypes. In order to investigate these rare tumours, we studied all the conjunctival melanomas that had been surgically removed in Denmark over a period of 52 years (1960-2012). Tissue samples, clinical files, pathology reports and follow-up data were collected and re-evaluated. Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, we investigated BRAF mutations; and using microRNA expression profiling, we investigated differentially expressed microRNAs. The overall incidence of conjunctival melanoma was 0.5/1 000 000/year, and it increased in Denmark over 52 years. The increase was mainly caused by an increase in older patients (>65 years) and bulbar lesions. Clinicopathological features significantly associated with a poor prognosis were extrabulbar location, involvement of adjacent tissue structures, tumour thickness exceeding 2 mm and local tumour recurrence. Patients undergoing incisional biopsy and/or treatment involving excision without adjuvant therapy fared worse than patients treated with excision and any type of adjuvant treatment. We found that 35% (39/110) of conjunctival melanomas were BRAF-mutated, and the incidence of BRAF mutations was constant over time. BRAF-mutation status corresponded in conjunctival melanoma and paired premalignant lesions. BRAF mutations were more frequent in males, in young patients, and in tumours with a sun-exposed tumour location (bulbar conjunctiva or caruncle), with a mixed or non-pigmented colour, with absence of primary acquired melanosis, and with origin in a nevus. Immunohistochemistry was able to accurately detect BRAF V600E mutations. In univariate analysis, distant metastatic disease was associated with BRAF mutations. No prognostic associations with BRAF mutations were identified in multivariate analyses. MicroRNA expression analysis revealed 25 tumour-specific microRNAs in conjunctival melanoma. Five possibly oncogenic miRNAs (miR-20b-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-506-3p and miR-509-3p) were up-regulated. Seven microRNAs (miR-30d-5p, miR-138-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-500a-5p, miR-501-3p, miR-501-5p and miR-502-3p) were significantly and simultaneously up-regulated in both stage T1 and stage T2 tumours, and were associated with increased tumour thickness. The expression of the 25 tumour-specific microRNAs did not differ significantly between conjunctival melanoma and oral or nasal mucosal melanoma. In conclusion, the incidence of conjunctival melanoma increased in the Danish population from 1960 to 2012. From our findings of a distinct pattern of BRAF mutations and differentially expressed microRNAs, it is evident that conjunctival melanoma is closely related to cutaneous and other mucosal melanomas and bears less resemblance to uveal melanomas. This means that conjunctival melanoma patients may benefit from therapies that are effective for cutaneous and mucosal melanoma. Additionally, the identification of several up-regulated microRNAs may prove to be useful as prognostic or therapeutic targets in conjunctival melanoma. ",

Selective BRAF inhibitors and now MEK inhibitors have demonstrated response rates far higher than standard chemotherapeutic options and we review the phase I-III results for these agents in this article.

The protein kinase BRAF is mutated in about 40% of melanomas, and BRAF inhibitors improve progression-free and overall survival in these patients. However, after a relatively short period of disease control, most patients develop resistance because of reactivation of the RAF-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway, mediated in many cases by mutations in RAS. We found that BRAF inhibition induces invasion and metastasis in RAS mutant melanoma cells through a mechanism mediated by the reactivation of the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)-ERK pathway, increased expression and secretion of interleukin 8, and induction of protease-dependent invasion. These events were accompanied by a cell morphology switch from predominantly rounded to predominantly elongated cells. We also observed similar responses in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells. These data show that BRAF inhibitors can induce melanoma cell invasion and metastasis in tumors that develop resistance to these drugs. ",

BRAF is an element of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, which when constitutively active can lead to increased proliferation rate, enhanced survival, invasion and metastasis. The development of small molecule inhibitors of mutant BRAF kinase has changed the care of patients, especially with melanoma. Despite the success in treating melanoma with inhibitors of mutant BRAF and other elements of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, resistance limits the long-term responsiveness to these drugs. The resistance mechanisms to MAPK pathway inhibition are complex, occur at genomic and phenotypic levels, and frequently the same patient can simultaneously develop diverse mechanisms of resistance in different progressive metastases or even in the same lesion. In the current review, we summarize recent research on mutations in BRAF and their importance for the development of tumor.

Here, we present evidence that BRAF and INK4A have different effects on melanogenesis, a marker of melanocytic differentiation. Human melanoma cell line 624Mel harbors mutations in both BRAF and INK4A. The in vitro and in vivo growth of these cells was inhibited by either reduced expression of mutant BRAF using stable retroviral RNA interference (RNAi) or retrovirus-mediated stable expression of wild-type INK4A cDNA. Consistent with the observed growth inhibition, phosphorylation of S780 and S795 in pRB, both CDK4/6 targets, was suppressed in cells expressing either mutant BRAF RNAi or wild-type INK4A. Interestingly, melanoma cells expressing mutant BRAF RNAi had increased pigmentation, produced more mature melanosomes and melanin and expressed higher levels of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1, whereas melanogenesis was not induced by wild-type INK4A. We found that the melanocyte lineage-specific master control protein microphthalmia-associated transcription factor was upregulated by inhibition of mutant BRAF, which may be the cause for the melanogenic effect of BRAF RNAi.

We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor.

It is important to understand how BRAF mutations contribute to malignant traits including anchorage- and growth factor-independence. We have previously shown that efficient activation of ERK in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) requires both adhesion to the extracellular matrix and growth factors. Mutant V599E BRAF is sufficient to promote ERK activation independent of adhesion and growth factors. Here, we analysed regulation of G1 cell cycle events in NHEM and human melanoma cells. We show that S phase entry in NHEM requires both adhesion and growth factor signaling through the MEK-ERK pathway. This control correlates with induction of cyclin D1 and downregulation of p27Kip1, two key G1 cell cycle events. In melanoma cells expressing V599E BRAF, cyclin D1 was constitutively expressed independent of adhesion but dependent upon MEK activation and nuclear accumulation of ERK. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels by RNA interference inhibited S phase entry in melanoma cells. Importantly, expression of V599E BRAF in NHEM was sufficient to promote cyclin D1 promoter activity in the absence of adhesion. Additionally, p27Kip1 levels were downregulated in V599E BRAF-expressing melanoma cells and active BRAF was sufficient to downregulate p27Kip1 in serum-starved NHEM. Thus, adhesion-growth factor cooperation, leading to efficient activation of ERK, regulates cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 levels in human melanocytes and mutant BRAF overrides adhesion-growth factor control of these two G1 cell cycle proteins in melanomas. These findings provide important insight into how BRAF mutations contribute to aberrant human melanocyte proliferation.",

In addition, cellular effectors were investigated by ELISA kits, western blotting and flow cytometry.;The exposure to vemurafenib inhibited MO-1 cell proliferation at concentrations similar to those obtained in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, and an explanation of this sensitivity is the strong activation of Erk1/2 and the low expression of MITF.

We herein summarized our experience with 14 metastatic melanomas showing complete loss of immunohistochemical melanocytic markers (with or without heterologous differentiation). Patients included 11 men and 3 women aged 24 to 78 years (median, 67 y). Thirteen patients had histologically confirmed primary skin melanoma, and 1 had metastatic melanoma of unknown primary. Undifferentiated metastasis was diagnosed synchronous to primary tumor (n=1), following skin melanoma by 3 months to 9 years (n=11) and preceding it by 1 year (n=1). Sites of undifferentiated metastases were axillary (3), inguinal (1), or submandibular (1) lymph nodes, digestive tract (2), bone/soft tissue (2), lung/pleura (2), and disseminated (n=3). Histology of metastases mimicked undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma with variable myxoid and giant cell areas (n=10) and cytokeratin-positive undifferentiated small cell sarcoma (n=1). Three cases showed heterologous dedifferentiation: pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), teratocarcinosarcoma-like with prominent rhabdomyoblasts (n=1), and adenocarcinoma-like with metaplastic bone (n=1). All cases were negative for S100, melanoma cocktail, HMB45, Melan A, and SOX10. Other markers showed following results: smooth muscle actin (1/14), p16 (1/14), TP53 (2/12), pancytokeratin (4/14), desmin (5/14), h-caldesmon (0/9), and MDM2/CDK4 (0/5). SMARCB1 was intact in 8/8 cases. Genotyping showed BRAF(V600E) mutation (5/14), NRAS mutation (5/14), and BRAF/NRAS wild-type (4/14). In conclusion, undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is likely underrecognized and frequently mistaken for undifferentiated sarcoma or other neoplasms. Diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma at sites where melanoma metastasis are frequent (eg, inguinal and axillary region) should be made with great caution and warrants exploration of the remote history. Genotyping is a helpful surrogate marker in classifying such difficult cases. In the light of available targeted therapies, recognition of undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is mandatory for appropriate treatment.",

Since 2011 diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia has been easier because of discovery of the disease defining somatic mutation BRAF V600E mutation, which has been also known as driver mutation in malignant melanoma. The presence of this mutation enabled targeted molecular therapy in HCL as well. As first line therapy purine nucleoside analogues are the gold standard, but refractory/relapsed patient are candidates for targeted BRAF-inhibitor therapy. This manuscript serves as guidance in making diagnosis and standard treatment of HCL, and summarizes newest data about molecular therapy, including our single center experience collected from 75 patients. ;A hajas sejtes leukémia és a rokon kórképek (HSL-variáns és szplenikus marginális zóna limfóma, SMZL) elkülönítõ diagnosztikája igen nagy jelentõségû, mivel a betegek kezelése és a betegség kórjóslata nagymértékben különböznek egymástól. 2011 óta a hajas sejtes leukémia elkülönítését jelentõsen megkönnyíti a melanómában már ismert onkogén szomatikus mutáció, a BRAF V600E felfedezése a hajas sejtekben. Ennek a genetikai eseménynek a megismerése tette lehetõvé a terápiás fegyvertár BRAF-gátlószerekkel való bõvítését. A betegség kezelésére elsõ vonalban továbbra is purinnukleozid-analógok, elsõsorban a cladribin javasoltak. Munkánkban ismertetjük a diagnosztika fõbb lehetõségeit és nehézségeit, valamint a standard terápiás lehetõségeket, és ismertetjük egy molekulárisan célzott BRAF-gátlószerrel, a vemurafenibbel végzett kezelés eddigi eredményeit. A fentieken túlmenõen összefoglaljuk saját tapasztalatainkat, melyet a klinikánkon gondozott, ill. konzultált, hajas sejtes leukémiában szenvedõ 75 beteg kezelése, illetve nyomon követése során nyertünk.",

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF-activating mutations have been reported in several types of cancer, including melanoma ( approximately 70% of cases), thyroid (30-70%), ovarian (15-30%), and colorectal cancer (5-20%). Mutant BRAF has constitutive kinase activity and causes hyperactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. BRAF silencing induces regression of melanoma xenografts, indicating the essential role of BRAF for cell survival. We set up an inducible short hairpin RNA system to compare the role of oncogenic BRAF in thyroid carcinoma versus melanoma cells. Although BRAF knockdown led to apoptosis in the melanoma cell line A375, the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell ARO underwent growth arrest upon silencing, with little or no cell death. Reexpression of the thyroid differentiation marker, sodium iodide symporter, was induced after long-term silencing. The different outcome of BRAF down-regulation in the two cell lines was associated with an opposite regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression levels in response to the block of the BRAF mitogenic signal. These results were confirmed using a specific BRAF small-molecule inhibitor, PLX4032. Restoration of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression rescued melanoma cells from death. Altogether, our data indicate that oncogenic BRAF inhibition can have a different effect on cell fate depending on the cellular type. Furthermore, we suggest that a BRAF-independent mechanism of cell survival exists in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

In a population-based case series from North Carolina, 214 first primary invasive melanoma patients in the year 2000 were interviewed regarding their risk factors. Ambient solar UV exposures were estimated using residential histories and a satellite-based model. Cases were grouped on the basis of BRAF and NRAS somatic mutations, determined using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and radiolabeled DNA sequencing, and the risk profiles of these groups were compared. Mutually exclusive BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant cases occurred at frequencies of 43.0% and 13.6% with mean ages at diagnosis of 47.3 and 62.1 years, respectively. Tumors from patients with >14 back nevi were more likely to harbor either a BRAF mutation [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 3.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.4-7.0] or an NRAS mutation (age-adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.6-4.8) compared with patients with 0 to 4 back nevi. However, BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant tumors were distinctive in that BRAF-mutant tumors were characteristic of patients with high early-life ambient UV exposure (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.3). When ambient UV irradiance was analyzed by decadal age, high exposure at ages 0 to 20 years was associated with BRAF-mutant cases, whereas high exposure at ages 50 and 60 years was characteristic of NRAS-mutant cases. Our results suggest that although nevus propensity is important for the occurrence of both BRAF and NRAS-mutant melanomas, ambient UV irradiance influences risk differently based on the age of exposure. The association of BRAF mutations with early-life UV exposure provides evidence in support of childhood sun protection for melanoma prevention.",

The highly selective BRAF(V600) inhibitor, vemurafenib, was identified initially through a large-scale drug screen.;Here we examine vemurafenib's journey from discovery to clinical use in metastatic melanoma. Topics covered include preclinical data, single agent Phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials, resistance issues and mechanisms, adverse effects including the development of squamous cell cancers, and combination trials.;Due to its tolerance, low toxicity profile, rapid tumor response, and improved outcomes in melanoma patients with BRAF(V600) mutations, vemurafenib was advanced rapidly through clinical trials to receive FDA approval in 2011. While its efficacy is well documented, durability has become an issue for most patients who experience therapeutic resistance in approximately 6-8 months. In addition, a concerning toxicity observed in patients taking the drug include development of localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). It is hypothesized that drug resistance and SCC development result from a similar paradoxical activation of protein signaling pathways, specifically MAPK.

Detection of BRAFV600E in blood could have prognostic and predictive value and could be useful for monitoring response to BRAF-targeted therapy. We developed a rapid, sensitive method for the detection and quantification of BRAFV600E in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma and serum on the basis of a quantitative 5'-nuclease PCR (Taqman) in the presence of a peptide-nucleic acid. We validated the assay in 92 lung, colon, and melanoma archival serum and plasma samples with paired tumor tissue (40 wild-type and 52 BRAFV600E). The correlation of cfDNA BRAFV600E with clinical parameters was further explored in 22 metastatic melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. Our assay could detect and quantify BRAFV600E in mixed samples with as little as 0.005% mutant DNA (copy number ratio 1 : 20 000), with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 57.7% in archival serum and plasma samples. In 22 melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors, the median progression-free survival was 3.6 months for those showing BRAFV600E in pretreatment cfDNA compared with 13.4 months for those in whom the mutation was not detected (P=0.021). Moreover, the median overall survival for positive versus negative BRAFV600E tests in pretreatment cfDNA differed significantly (7 vs. 21.8 months, P=0.017). This finding indicates that the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of low-abundance BRAFV600E alleles in cfDNA using our assay can be useful for predicting treatment outcome. ",

Organ transplant recipients are at high risk for developing various tumors, including melanocytic ones. We studied a group of 129 melanocytic tumors including various subtypes of nevi (n: 114) and melanomas (n: 15) excised from transplant (n: 63) and control (non-immunosuppressed) patients (n: 66) as to BRAF mutation status. Mutation research was performed after extraction of DNA from archival material (paraffin-embedded tissue specimens) by sequence analysis. BRAFV600E accounted for the most prevalent mutation found (94%). Melanocytic tumors from transplant patients had a lower frequency of BRAF mutations than control lesions (45.4% vs 63.5%, p<.05). The explanation for this difference is currently unknown. The possibility exists that in transplant patients, factors linked to immunosuppression (most likely immunosuppressive drugs) induce additional mutations, or activate alternative signaling pathways, which compensates for the lower rate of activating BRAF mutations in tumors developing in these patients.",

While these early observations suggest that the BRAF targeted therapy will become part of the standard treatment paradigm for patients with advanced melanoma, it is also clear that a majority of these responses are incomplete and temporary.

Here, we investigated DNA methylation changes associated with melanoma progression and links between methylation patterns and other types of somatic alterations, including the most frequent mutations and DNA copy number changes. Our results revealed that the methylome, presenting in early stage samples and associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, gradually decreased in the medium and late stages of the disease. An inverse relationship among the other predefined groups and promoter methylation was also revealed except for histologic subtype, whereas the more aggressive, nodular subtype melanomas exhibited hypermethylation as well. The Breslow thickness, which is a continuous variable, allowed for the most precise insight into how promoter methylation decreases from stage to stage. Integrating our methylation results with a high-throughput copy number alteration dataset, local correlations were detected in the MYB and EYA4 genes. With regard to the effects of DNA hypermethylation on melanoma patients' survival, correcting for clinical cofounders, only the KIT gene was associated with a lower overall survival rate. In this study, we demonstrate the strong influence of promoter localized DNA methylation changes on melanoma initiation and show how hypermethylation decreases in melanomas associated with less favourable clinical outcomes.

The current study uses BRAFV600E expressing WM793 melanoma cells to derive data aimed at investigating the molecular determinant of cell invasion following treatment with clinical BRAF inhibitors.;Small-molecule inhibitors targeting BRAF reduced MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway activation and cell survival; yet, viable cell subpopulations persisted. The residual cells exhibited an elongated cell shape, prominent actin stress fibers and retained the ability to invade 3-D dermal-like microenvironments. BRAF inhibitor treatments were associated with reduced expression of RND3, an antagonist of RHOA activation, and elevated RHOA-dependent signaling. Restoration of RND3 expression or RHOA knockdown attenuated the migratory ability of residual cells without affecting overall cell survival. The invasive ability of BRAF inhibitor treated cells embedded in collagen gels was diminished following RND3 re-expression or RHOA depletion. Conversely, melanoma cell movement in the absence of BRAF inhibition was unaffected by RND3 expression or RHOA depletion.;These data reveal a novel switch in the requirement for RND3 and RHOA in coordinating the movement of residual WM793 cells that are initially refractive to BRAF inhibitor therapy. These results have important clinical implications because they suggest that combining BRAF inhibitors with therapies that target the invasion of drug-resistant cells could aid in controlling disease relapse.",

Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor function of STAG2 and STAG3. ",

Herein, we provide a detailed biological characterization of SAR260301, and show that this compound has outstanding biochemical and cellular selectivity for the PI3Kβ isoform versus the α, δ, and γ isoforms and a large panel of protein and lipid kinases. We demonstrate that SAR260301 blocks PI3K pathway signaling preferentially in PTEN-deficient human tumor models, and has synergistic antitumor activity when combined with vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) or selumetinib (MEK inhibitor) in PTEN-deficient/BRAF-mutated human melanoma tumor models. Combination treatments were very well tolerated, suggesting the potential for a superior safety profile at optimal dosing using selective compounds to inhibit multiple signaling pathways. Together, these experiments provide a preclinical proof-of-concept for safely combining inhibitors of PI3Kβ and BRAF or MEK kinase modulators to improve antitumor activity in PTEN-deficient/BRAF-mutant melanoma, and support the evaluation of SAR260301-based combinations in clinical studies.

In GM, we report somatic mutations in KIT and TP53. Conversely, AGN had frequent BRAF V600E mutations, which were not seen in any of the GM.

He had metastases to the right clavicle, brain, liver, adrenal gland, and the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. He progressed on treatment with alpha-interferon. He was found to have a 4.5-cm mass in the left frontotemporal lobe and underwent gross total resection followed by adjuvant CyberKnife stereotactic irradiation. He was subsequently started on ipilimumab. Treatment was stopped due to kidney injury. He was then placed on dabrafenib and trametinib. He returned for follow-up complaining of severe headache and developed an episode of seizure. MRI showed a large area of edema at the left frontal lobe with midline shift. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Intracranial hemorrhage was found intra-operatively. Pathology from surgery did not find tumor cells, reported as organizing hemorrhage and necrosis with surrounding gliosis; immunohistochemistry for S100 and HMB45 were negative.;This case demonstrates the life-threatening adverse effects that can be seen with the newer targeted biological therapies.

Immunoblot analysis was used to measure nuclear localization of key cellular proteins. The in vivo activity of oral SINE was evaluated in NOD/SCID mice bearing A375 or CHL-1 human melanoma xenografts.

Naturally ABCB1 expressing cells including V600E BRAF-mutated and BRAF wild-type melanoma cells and cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for ABCB1 were used as cell culture models. ABCB1 expression and function were studied by the use of fluorescent and cytotoxic ABCB1 substrates in combination with ABCB1 inhibitors.;Docking experiments predicted PLX4032 to interact stronger with ABCB1 than PLX4720. Experimental studies using different cellular models and structurally different ABCB1 substrates confirmed that PLX4032 interfered stronger with ABCB1 function than PLX4720. For example, PLX4032 (20 µM) induced a 4-fold enhanced rhodamine 123 accumulation compared to PLX4720 (20 µM) in ABCB1-transduced UKF-NB-3 cells and reduced the IC₅₀ for the cytotoxic ABCB1 substrate vincristine in this model by 21-fold in contrast to a 9-fold decrease induced by PLX4720.;PLX4032 exerted stronger effects on ABCB1-mediated drug transport than PLX4720.

The current review indicated that BRAF represents an important target in cancer, in part because it is present in 7% of all cancers and also because it represents the first intracellular signaling molecule that is activated by point mutations for which single-agent therapy appears to have efficacy. Therapy for advanced melanoma has progressed slowly over the past 3 decades, although significant advances have been made in other cancers with the application of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies. However, in melanoma, cytotoxic chemotherapies have severe limits, chemotherapy does not convincingly improve on the natural history of metastatic disease and has no role in the adjuvant setting, and cytokine therapy may have a niche in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings but confers only a modest benefit to a small proportion of patients at the cost of severe toxicity. Thus, there are few other cancers in which completely novel therapies are so highly prioritized in clinical research. Understanding network of signal-transduction pathways and how that network may adapt to BRAF inhibition or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition will point to the next generation of clinical trials investigating rational combination regimens. The current investigations in melanoma will create a set of hypotheses to be tested in each cancer that harbors BRAF mutations.",

Initial studies have shown that BRAF mutations occur at a high frequency in melanocytic nevi and metastatic lesions, but recent data have revealed much lower incidence of these mutations in early-stage melanoma, implying that other factors may contribute to melanoma pathogenesis in a wild-type (WT) BRAF context. To identify such contributing factors, we used microarray gene expression profiling to screen for differences in gene expression between a panel of melanocytic and melanoma cell lines with WT BRAF and a group of melanoma cell lines with the V599E BRAF mutation. We found that SPRY2, an inhibitor homologous to SPRY4, which was previously shown to suppress Ras/ERK signaling via direct binding to Raf-1, had reduced expression in WT BRAF cells. Using small interfering RNA-mediated SPRY2 knockdown, we showed that SPRY2 acts as an inhibitor of ERK signaling in melanocytes and WT BRAF melanoma cells, but not in cell lines with the V599E mutation. We also show that SPRY2 and SPRY4 directly bind WT BRAF but not the V599E and other exon 15 BRAF mutants. These data suggest that SPRY2, an inhibitor of ERK signaling, may be bypassed in melanoma cells either by down-regulation of its expression in WT BRAF cells, or by the presence of the BRAF mutation.",

Notably, clinical studies revealed the distinct features in the Chinese population differing from those in Caucasians, which give hints to variant mechanisms underlying. Therefore, it is of great importance to generate a cell line with similar background for melanoma research in Chinese even Asian patients. However, most melanoma cell lines in use are derived from Caucasians, thus, we established one novel metastatic melanoma cell line, FLFMM-34, derived from a Han Chinese woman. The cell line showed positive for S100, HMB45, vimentin and melan-A. Chromosome analysis revealed multiple structural aberrations. Gene-mutation analysis identified that FLFMM-34 cells had BRAF(V600E) mutation and deletions of exon 2 and 3 in p16/CDKN2A. Importantly, two novel mutations including TP53(P33R) and TP53(R142H) have been detected. RT-PCR results showed that FLFMM-34 cells expressed a higher mRNA level of cyclinD1 than three other melanoma cell lines, WM793B, 1205Lu and A2058. In addition, in vivo mice model demonstrated that the cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors associated with lymphoid node metastases. In conclusion, these data indicate that FLFMM-34 cell line can be employed as a suitable model for melanoma research in Chinese Han population. ",

Novel insights into the epidemiology and biology of melanoma allowed the development of newer therapies. The discovery of mutations in BRAF, a part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, allowed the development of two BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which significantly improved the outcome of metastatic melanoma treatment. This article reviews the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety profile of dabrafenib.

Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

A small number of studies have evaluated Spitz nevi and have failed to detect any lesions possessing a BRAF mutation. Only one study included categories of atypical Spitz nevus and borderline lesions suspected to be spitzoid melanomas, along with classic Spitz nevi and spitzoid melanomas. We examined a spectrum of spitzoid lesions that included 48 Spitz nevi, some with atypical features, seven atypical (borderline) Spitz tumors, and 13 spitzoid melanomas. BRAF mutations were detected in 12 of 68 spitzoid lesions, of which two were spitzoid melanomas and 10 were Spitz nevi. Five of the 10 Spitz nevi with BRAF mutations were altered by more than usual cytologic atypia and/or architectural atypia overlapping with dysplastic nevi, or irritation/inflammation; one desmoplastic Spitz nevus had a BRAF mutation.

Our results show that tumor regression resulting from BRAF suppression is inducible, reversible, and tightly regulated in these models. Analysis of regressing tumors showed the primary mechanism of action for BRAF to be increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. In a metastatic melanoma model, conditional BRAF suppression slowed systemic tumor growth as determined by in vivo bioluminescence imaging.

The sequence analysis of exon 1 of the BRAF gene in our laboratory has shown that the sequence derived from NT_007914 is correct (Kumar et al., 2003). Due to the correctness of the latter, sequence numbering of codons and nucleotides after exon 1 are changed by +1 and +3, respectively.), one tandem CT1789-90TC base change represented a novel mutation and another mutation caused a G466R amino-acid change within the glycine-rich loop in the kinase domain.

In the light of this, we sought to explore the potential relationship between CXCR4 mRNA expression with established histopathologic prognosticators and BRAF status in melanoma. Archived consecutive samples (n=107) of primary cutaneous melanoma were retrieved and assessed for the following: CXCR4 mRNA (semiquantitative RT-PCR) and BRAF exon 15 status (DNA Sanger sequencing). Statistical analyses included correlation between CXCR4 mRNA levels and established histopathologic prognosticators as well as the BRAF status using univariate and multiple linear methods. Multivariable analyses revealed a significant correlation between elevated CXCR4 mRNA (low ΔCt value) and the presence of BRAF mutation (P=0.02). Absence of a brisk host response was associated with elevated CXCR4 mRNA expression (P=0.04). CXCR4 mRNA was significantly lower in AJCC stage 2 compared with stage 1 after controlling for significant clinical prognosticators (P=0.02). The association between elevated CXCR4 mRNA and absence of a brisk host response suggests that CXCR4 may be involved in regulation of the host immune response in melanoma and is a molecule of potential utility as a biomarker for recruiting melanoma patients for immunotherapy.

Personalized medicine based on genetic and genomic changes within tumors is being applied more widely, with increased use of therapies targeted to somatic mutations and amplifications. Somatic mutations associated with resistance also are being used to select against therapies. Somatic point mutation testing being used clinically includes direct sequencing, short sequencing and single nucleotide interrogation. Single amplifications are commonly assessed using FISH or CISH; high throughput assessment of amplifications and deletions is done mainly on a research basis. Melanomas contain complex mutational profiles that allow them to be sub-grouped by their genetic and genomic profile, each of which then can be evaluated pre-clinically to determine their response to targeted therapies. BRAF V600E mutations are the most common found in melanoma; specific inhibitors of mutant BRAF have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. In addition, other melanoma sub-groups have been identified genetically, which respond to other inhibitors.

Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.

We aimed to assess the use of MEK162, a small-molecule MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with NRAS-mutated or Val600 BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma.;In our open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 study, we assigned patients with NRAS-mutated or BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma to one of three treatment arms on the basis of mutation status. Patients were enrolled at university hospitals or private cancer centres in Europe and the USA. The three arms were: twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for NRAS-mutated melanoma, twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma, and twice-daily MEK162 60 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors was permitted, but previous MEK inhibitor therapy was not allowed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an objective response (ie, a complete response or confirmed partial response). We report data for the 45 mg groups. We assessed clinical activity in all patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 and in patients assessable for response (with two available CT scans). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01320085, and is currently recruiting additional patients with NRAS mutations (based on a protocol amendment).;Between March 31, 2011, and Jan 17, 2012, we enrolled 71 patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 45 mg. By Feb 29, 2012 (data cutoff), median follow-up was 3·3 months (range 0·6-8·7; IQR 2·2-5·0). No patients had a complete response. Six (20%) of 30 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma had a partial response (three confirmed) as did eight (20%) of 41 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma (two confirmed). The most frequent adverse events were acneiform dermatitis (18 [60%] patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and 15 [37%] patients with the BRAF-mutated melanoma), rash (six [20%] and 16 [39%]), peripheral oedema (ten [33%] and 14 [34%]), facial oedema (nine [30%] and seven [17%]), diarrhoea (eight [27%] and 15 [37%]), and creatine phosphokinase increases (11 [37%] and nine [22%]). Increased creatine phosphokinase was the most common grade 3-4 adverse event (seven [23%] and seven [17%]). Four patients had serious adverse events (two per arm), which included diarrhoea, dehydration, acneiform dermatitis, general physical deterioration, irregular heart rate, malaise, and small intestinal perforation. No deaths occurred from treatment-related causes.;To our knowledge, MEK162 is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and might offer a new option for a cancer with few effective treatments.;Novartis Pharmaceuticals.",

Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient. By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system, we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer, which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells.",

Overexpression or silencing of Twist1 attenuated or aggravated induction of apoptosis through PLX4032 or GSK1120212, respectively.

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the time to progression (TTP) with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway upstream inhibition strategy in BRAF mutated melanoma patients. BRAF mutation positive metastatic melanoma patients were identified within the Dermatology Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) network and were treated first with a MEKi and upon progression with a selective BRAFi. A total of 23 melanoma patients (six females, 17 males, aged 47-80 years) were retrospectively analysed for TTP. The total median TTP was 8.9 months.

A higher RR for MEKi (39%, nine partial responses and 0 complete responses) than previously reported was observed. Our analysis suggests that the reversed inhibition of the MAPK pathway is feasible in BRAF mutated melanoma. The median TTP (8.9 months) is close to the promising BRAF- and MEKi combination therapy (median progression-free survival (PFS) 9.4 months). The total treatment duration of the MAPK inhibition when a MEKi is administered first is similar compared to the reversed sequence, but TTP shifts in favour to the MEKi. This approach is feasible with reasonable tolerability. This clinical investigation encourages further studies in prospective clinical trials to define the optimal treatment schedule for the MAPK pathway inhibition and should be accompanied by molecular monitoring using repeated biopsies.",

We previously showed that coordinated losses of several melanocytic antigens are generally attributable to down-regulation of antigen gene expression rather than irreversible mutation. Treatment of melanoma cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitors blocks ERK activation and increases steady-state levels of mRNAs and corresponding protein expression for the melanocytic antigens Melan-A/MART-1, gp100, and tyrosinase. Although the degree of MEK inhibitor enhancement of antigen expression varied among different cell lines irrespective of their antigen expression status, all showed detectable responses. Notably, the antigen-enhancing effects of the MEK inhibitors could not be attributed to the master melanocytic regulator MITF-M. Because MAPK pathway activation via constitutively active mutant forms of BRAF is common in melanomas, correlation between BRAF function and antigen expression was investigated. No simple correlation of endogenous BRAF mutational status and antigen levels was observed, but transient overexpression of V600E BRAF increased ERK activation and reduced Melan-A/MART-1 levels in antigen-positive cell lines. These data indicate that whereas multiple factors may regulate antigen expression in melanomas, enhancement of MAPK signaling can act as a negative influence. Blocking such signaling with MEK inhibitors accordingly augments antigen levels, thereby enhancing Melan-A/MART-1-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses to antigen-negative cells following MEK inhibition treatment. Consequently, MAPK inhibition may assist targeting of melanomas for immunotherapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This review is intended to provide an updated role of molecular genetics and various targeted therapies that have been developed to treat advanced stages of melanoma. Because of the declining success in melanoma therapy, the curative treatment for advanced stage melanoma has been a challenge for clinicians. Several mutations such as N-RAS, p53, BRAF including mutant-BRAF that lead to activation of kinase pathway, are implicated in the development of malignant melanoma. However, the current literature depicts that the prognostic role of BRAF mutation in disease progression is still controversial. While its higher level in advanced stage disease is associated with decreased overall survival (OS), some studies show that it failed to confer as an independent prognostic predictor of the disease. This has also led researchers to accomplish newer therapeutic strategies that lead to improved disease-response and grant survival benefits. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor agent, is one of the few available targeted therapies that is FDA approved and provides promising results in metastatic disease. However, its resistance at an early stage is of great concern. Recent implementation of combinational therapies including \"targeted therapy\", immunotherapy, and biological agents has appealed many researchers to define the adjunctive role of available therapies and their limitations in advanced stage and metastatic melanoma. This commends the need for future multi-institutional studies to confirm the clinical validity of different therapeutic strategies on a large scale population. ",

We investigated the effects of two different inhibitors of MAPK signaling in proliferative and invasive melanoma cell cultures with various mutations in the MAPK pathway. Proliferative melanoma cells were more susceptible to pathway inhibition than invasive phenotype cells, irrespective of BRAF mutation status, while invasive phenotype cell response was dependent on BRAF mutation status. Critically, MAPK pathway inhibition of proliferative phenotype cells resulted in acquisition of invasive phenotype characteristics. These results show that melanoma cell phenotype is an important factor in MAPK pathway inhibition response. This suggests that while current therapeutic strategies target proliferative melanoma cells, future approaches should also account for the invasive phenotype population.",

The purpose of this study is to explore effects of pharmacological B-Raf inhibition in conjunctival melanoma cell lines.;The B-Raf genotypes were assessed by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Cytotoxicity, cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis rate and phosphorylation rate of ERK and Akt were analysed in three different conjunctival melanoma cell lines under the influence of the B-Raf inhibitor PLX 4720 at various concentrations.;The cell lines CRMM-1 and CM2005.1 showed the B-Raf V600E mutation, whereas CRMM-2 expressed a B-Raf wild type. CM2005.1 was highly sensitive to PLX 4720, showing a complete cytotoxic effect for >1 µM, as well as a significant concentration-dependent reduction of the proliferation rate and viability rate. Even though CRMM-1 also carries the B-Raf V600E mutation, it did not react as sensitive to PLX 4720 inhibition as CM2005.1, but showed a significant concentration-dependent reduction regarding proliferation and viability. PLX 4720 had only slight impact on CRMM-2 in high concentrations (10 µM) regarding cytotoxicity, proliferation and viability. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that PLX 4720 acted predominantly antiproliferative and not via an induction of apoptosis. The phosphorylation rate of ERK was significantly reduced in CRMM-1 and CM2005.1, while it remained unchanged in CRMM-2. The phosphorylation rate of Akt was significantly elevated in CRMM-2.;Proliferation inhibition of conjunctival melanoma cells by PLX 4720 depends on their B-Raf genotype.

Several treatments for metastatic melanoma with a mutation in the BRAF gene have been approved. They extend life but are more expensive than the previous standard of care (dacarbazine). Vemurafenib, the first drug in this class, costs $13,000 per month ($207,000 for a patient with median survival). Patients failing vemurafenib are often given ipilimumab, an immunomodulator, at $150,000 per course. Assessment of cost-effectiveness is a valuable tool to help navigate the transition toward targeted cancer therapy.;We performed a cost-utility analysis to compare three strategies for patients with BRAF+ metastatic melanoma using a deterministic expected-value decision tree model to calculate the present value of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy. We performed sensitivity analyses on all variables.;In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vemurafenib compared with dacarbazine was $353,993 per QALY gained (0.42 QALYs added, $156,831 added). The ICER for vemurafenib followed by ipilimumab compared with vemurafenib alone was $158,139. In sensitivity analysis, treatment cost had the largest influence on results: the ICER for vemurafenib versus dacarbazine dropped to $100,000 per QALY gained with a treatment cost of $3600 per month.;The cost per QALY gained for treatment of BRAF+ metastatic melanoma with vemurafenib alone or in combination exceeds widely-cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness.

Acquired resistance to these agents has led to greater interest in ERK, a downstream target of the MAPK pathway. De novo design efforts of a novel scaffold derived from SCH772984 by employing hydrogen bond interactions specific for ERK in the binding pocket identified 1-(1H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-6-yl)ureas as a viable lead series.

The median overall survival from first SRS procedure was 6.7, 11.2 months if treated with a BRAF inhibitor and 4.5 months for BRAF-WT. Actuarial survival rates for BRAF-M patients on an inhibitor were 54 % at 6 months and 41 % at 12 months from the time of SRS. In contrast, BRAF-WT had overall survival rates of 28 % at 6 months and 19 % at 12 months. Overall survival was extended for patients on a BRAF inhibitor at or after the first SRS. The median time to intracranial progression was 3.9 months on a BRAF inhibitor and 1.7 months without. The local control rate for all treated tumors was 92.5 %, with no difference based on BRAF status. Patients with higher KPS, fewer treated intracranial metastases, controlled systemic disease, RPA Class 1 and BRAF-M patients had extended overall survival. Overall, patients with BRAF-M treated with both SRS and BRAF inhibitors, at or after SRS, have increased overall survival from the time of SRS. As patients live longer as a result of more effective systemic and local therapies, close surveillance and early management of intracranial disease with SRS will become increasingly important. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Emergence of clinical resistance to BRAF inhibitors, alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors, limits clinical responses in melanoma. Inhibiting HSP90 offers an approach to simultaneously interfere with multiple resistance mechanisms. Using the HSP90 inhibitor AT13387, which is currently in clinical trials, we investigated the potential of HSP90 inhibition to overcome or delay the emergence of resistance to these kinase inhibitors in melanoma models. In vitro, treating vemurafenib-sensitive cells (A375 or SK-MEL-28) with a combination of AT13387 and vemurafenib prevented colony growth under conditions in which vemurafenib treatment alone generated resistant colonies. In vivo, when AT13387 was combined with vemurafenib in a SK-MEL-28, vemurafenib-sensitive model, no regrowth of tumors was observed over 5 months, although 2 of 7 tumors in the vemurafenib monotherapy group relapsed in this time. Together, these data suggest that the combination of these agents can delay the emergence of resistance. Cell lines with acquired vemurafenib resistance, derived from these models (A375R and SK-MEL-28R) were also sensitive to HSP90 inhibitor treatment; key clients were depleted, apoptosis was induced, and growth in 3D culture was inhibited. Similar effects were observed in cell lines with acquired resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors (SK-MEL-28RR, WM164RR, and 1205LuRR). These data suggest that treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor, such as AT13387, is a potential approach for combating resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma. Moreover, frontline combination of these agents with an HSP90 inhibitor could delay the emergence of resistance, providing a strong rationale for clinical investigation of such combinations in BRAF-mutated melanoma.",

As such, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer, including melanomas, which frequently harbour activating mutations in the NRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations, we show that ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome formation, as well as the translation of growth-related messenger RNAs containing a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth in mice. Our findings indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of tumours characterized by deregulated MAPK signalling, such as melanoma.",

Here, we investigated the relationship of TERT promoter mutations and BRAF mutations with the most relevant clinicopathological parameters, individually and coexisting, in order to evaluate their role as independent prognostic markers and to determine the effect of their coexistence. A TERT promoter alteration was found in 20 of 53 cases (38 %), significantly associated with histological type, increasing tumor thickness and mitotic rate, more advanced pathologic tumor (pT) stage, and absence of regression. A BRAF mutation was found in 21 of 53 cases (40 %), significantly associated with tumor thickness and presence of metastases in the sentinel lymph node. Coexistence of a TERT promoter and BRAF mutation was detected in 11 of 53 cases (21 %). This was associated with increasing thickness, high mitotic rate, lymph node metastasis, presence of ulceration, and absence of regression. Coexistence of a mutation in the TERT promoter and in the BRAF gene correlated with more prognostically relevant factors than either mutation alone. Our data lead us to hypothesize that TERT promoter and BRAF mutations cooperate in cutaneous melanoma.

LC of individual metastases was compared based on BRAF mutation status using statistical techniques to control for measurements of multiple metastases within each patient. CNS progression was defined as either local failure or development of new lesions.;Of the 69 metastases, BRAF was mutated in 30 and wild-type in 39. With a median follow-up of 30 months for all patients and a median follow-up of 5.5 months for treated lesions, 1-year LC was significantly better among metastases with mutated vs. wild-type BRAF (69 vs. 34%, RR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01). BRAF mutation was found to be a significant predictor of LC after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in both univariate [RR = 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01)] and multivariate [RR = 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01)] analyses. There was also a trend toward improved CNS progression free survival (PFS) at 1 year (26 vs. 0%, p = 0.06), favoring BRAF-mutated patients.;In this retrospective study, MBM treated with GK had significantly improved LC for patients with BRAF mutation vs. wild-type.

Patients were treated with a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) and a MEK inhibitor (cobimetinib or trametinib), and were imaged at baseline and shortly thereafter with (18)F-FDG PET/CT.

At the same time, adoptive cell transfer has significant effects against metastatic melanoma; however, it is difficult to apply on a broad scale because of the problems related to cell preparation. To overcome these problems, we developed immune cell therapy using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The benefit of our method is that a large number of cells can be readily obtained. We focused on macrophages for immune cell therapy because macrophage infiltration is frequently observed in solid cancers. In this study, the efficacy of human iPS cell-derived myeloid cell lines (iPS-ML) genetically modified to express type I IFNs against human melanoma cells was examined. The morphology, phagocytic ability, and surface markers of iPS-ML were similar to those of macrophages. The iPS-ML that express type I IFNs (iPS-ML-IFN) showed significant effects in inhibiting the growth of disseminated human melanoma cells in SCID mice. The infiltration of iPS-ML into the tumor nests was confirmed immunohistologically. The iPS-ML-IFNs increased the expression of CD169, a marker of M1 macrophages that can activate antitumor immunity. The iPS-ML-IFNs could infiltrate into tumor tissue and exert anticancer effects in the local tumor tissue.

Here, we investigated the growth-inhibitory and antiangiogenic properties of PD0325901, a novel MEK inhibitor, in human melanoma cells. PD0325901 effects were determined in a panel of melanoma cell lines with different genetic aberrations. PD0325901 markedly inhibited ERK phosphorylation and growth of both BRAF mutant and wild-type melanoma cell lines, with IC(50) in the nanomolar range even in the least responsive models. Growth inhibition was observed both in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models, regardless of BRAF mutation status, and was due to G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle (cyclin D1, c-Myc, and p27(KIP1)) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and survivin) regulators were modulated by PD0325901 at the protein level. Gene expression profiling revealed profound modulation of several genes involved in the negative control of MAPK signaling and melanoma cell differentiation, suggesting alternative, potentially relevant mechanisms of action. Finally, PD0325901 inhibited the production of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin 8 at a transcriptional level. In conclusion, PD0325901 exerts potent growth-inhibitory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic activity in melanoma lines, regardless of their BRAF mutation status. Deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of MEK inhibitors will likely translate into more effective treatment strategies for patients experiencing malignant melanoma.",

Twenty-eight lesions were conjunctival nevi, of which 20 were excised from children younger than 18 years. Fifteen lesions were conjunctival primary acquired melanosis (PAM; 11 without atypia and 4 with atypia) and five were conjunctival melanomas. To detect the BRAF T1799A mutation, both a newly developed kit (Mutector; TrimGen, Sparks, MD) and direct DNA sequence analysis of exon 15 after PCR amplification were used.;The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in 14 of 28 (50%) conjunctival nevi analyzed, but in none of the 15 conjunctival PAMs, with and without atypia. The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in two of the five (40%) conjunctival melanomas. There was no difference in the BRAF mutation detected in conjunctival nevi in children or adults, as the BRAF mutation was detected in 50%.;The results showed that conjunctival nevi, similar to skin nevi, have a high frequency of oncogenic BRAF mutations. Furthermore, the results suggest that the oncogenic event leading to BRAF mutations affect only conjunctival nevi and not conjunctival PAM.

Potentially, BRAF mutation analysis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies could enhance the detection of micrometastases and improve the accuracy of nodal staging for patients with melanoma. Nodal nevi are small aggregates of benign nevus cells that are commonly encountered in the SLNs of patients with melanoma. The status of the BRAF gene in nodal nevi is not known, but this unresolved issue is of critical importance to any future detection strategies that use genetic alterations as biomarkers of metastatic spread. Twenty-six nodal nevi from 26 patients were evaluated for the thymine (T)-->adenine (A) missense mutation at nucleotide 1796 of the BRAF gene using the LigAmp assay, which can detect 1 mutant allele among 10,000 wild-type alleles. For each case, a matching volume of adjacent lymphoid tissue was used as a negative control. BRAF mutations were detected in 13 of the 26 nodal nevi, but in just 1 of the 26 adjacent controls (50% vs. 4%, P<0.0005, Fisher exact). Novel strategies that rely on detection of putative melanoma-specific markers for the diagnosis of micrometastatic melanoma in SLNs need to take into account the molecular genetic profile of the benign nodal nevus. Indeed, these nodal nevi, like melanoma, frequently harbor activating mutations of the BRAF oncogene underscoring the potentially confounding impact of these inclusions on melanoma detection.",

Advances in the understanding of tumour biology and immune regulation have led to the development of targeted agents that have changed clinical practice, with further improvements expected with new compounds and combinations. The first major advance was the development of selective mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors (BRAF and MEK inhibitors) and immune checkpoint blockade with a CTLA4 antibody (ipilimumab). These drugs proved vastly superior to conventional chemotherapy, however response, resistance and toxicity were limitations. The second major advance is the development of other immune checkpoint blocking agents, including PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, and the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in combination, with a higher proportion of durable responses coupled with less toxicity.

B-RAF has been identified as the most mutated gene in these invasive cells and therefore an attractive therapeutic target. However, for uncertain reasons, chemotherapy inhibiting B-Raf has not been clinically effective. This has raised questions whether this pathway is important in melanoma metastasis or whether targeting a protein other than B-Raf in the signaling cascade could more effectively inhibit this pathway to reduce lung metastases. Here, we investigated the role played by (V600E)B-Raf in melanoma metastasis and showed that targeting this signaling cascade significantly reduces lung metastases. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition was used in mice to reduce expression (activity) of each member of the signaling cascade and effects on metastasis development were measured. Targeting any member of the signaling cascade reduced metastasis but inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (Mek) 1 and Mek 2 almost completely prevented lung tumor development. Mechanistically, metastatic inhibition was mediated through reduction of melanoma cell extravasation through the endothelium and decreased proliferative capacity. Targeting B-Raf with the pharmacologic inhibitor BAY 43-9006, which was found ineffective in clinical trials and seems to act primarily as an angiogenesis inhibitor, did not decrease metastasis, whereas inhibition of Mek using U0126 decreased cellular proliferative capacity, thereby effectively reducing number and size of lung metastases. In summary, this study provides a mechanistic basis for targeting Mek and not B-Raf in the mutant (V600E)B-Raf signaling cascade to inhibit melanoma metastases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A prominent mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF (V600) -mutant melanoma is associated with the upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Evidences suggested that this resistance mechanism is part of a more complex cellular adaptation process. Using an integrative strategy, we found this mechanism to invoke extensive transcriptomic, (phospho-) proteomic and phenotypic alterations that accompany a cellular transition to a de-differentiated, mesenchymal and invasive state. Even short-term BRAF-inhibitor exposure leads to an early adaptive, differentiation state change-characterized by a slow-cycling, persistent state. The early persistent state is distinct from the late proliferative, resistant state. However, both differentiation states share common signaling alterations including JUN upregulation. Motivated by the similarities, we found that co-targeting of BRAF and JUN is synergistic in killing fully resistant cells; and when used up-front, co-targeting substantially impairs the formation of the persistent subpopulation. We confirmed that JUN upregulation is a common response to BRAF inhibitor treatment in clinically treated patient tumors. Our findings demonstrate that events shared between early- and late-adaptation states provide candidate up-front co-treatment targets. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Treatment of melanoma cells by sodium arsenite or statins (simvastatin and lovastatin) dramatically modified activities of the main cell signaling pathways resulting in the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and in a downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels. Through heme degradation and the production of carbon monoxide and biliverdin, HO-1 plays a protective role in different scenario of oxidative stress followed by mitochondrial apoptosis. Both sodium arsenite and statins could be efficient inducers of apoptosis in some melanoma cell lines, but often exhibited only modest proapoptotic activity in others, due to numerous protective mechanisms. We demonstrated in the present study that treatment by sodium arsenite or statins with an additional inhibition of HO-1 expression (or activation) caused a substantial upregulation of apoptosis in melanoma cells. Sodium arsenite- or statin-induced apoptosis was independent of BRAF status (wild type versus V600E) in melanoma lines. Monotreatment required high doses of statins (20-40 μM) for effective induction of apoptosis. As an alternative approach, pretreatment of melanoma cells with statin at decreased doses (5-20 μM) dramatically enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, due to suppression of the NF-κB and STAT3-transcriptional targets (including COX-2) and downregulation of cFLIP-L (a caspase-8 inhibitor) protein levels. Furthermore, combined treatment with sodium arsenite and TRAIL or simvastatin and TRAIL efficiently induced apoptotic commitment in human neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our findings on enhancing effects of combined treatment of cancer cells using statin and TRAIL provide the rationale for further preclinical evaluation.",

Treatment of these patients with B-Raf inhibitors has been associated with a clear clinical benefit. Unfortunately, multiple resistance mechanisms have been identified and new potent and selective inhibitors are currently needed. In this work, five different type II inhibitors, which bind (V600E)B-Raf in its DFG-out conformation, have been studied using molecular dynamics, free energy calculations and energy decomposition analysis. The ranking of calculated MM-PB/GBSA binding affinities is in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones. The per-residue decomposition of ΔGbinding, within the MM-GBSA approach, has been used to identify the key residues governing the allosteric binding of the studied compounds to the (V600E)B-Raf protein kinase. Results indicate that although van der Waals interactions are key determinants for binding, hydrogen bonds also play an important role. This work also provides a better structural understanding of the binding of DFG-out inhibitors to (V600E)B-Raf, which can be used in a further step for rational design of a new class of B-Raf potent inhibitors.

Enrolled patients received a 12-week run-in of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). Patients with changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements <25% from baseline were then randomised to sorafenib or placebo for a further 12 weeks (ie to week 24). Patients with > or =25% tumour shrinkage after the run-in continued on open-label sorafenib, whereas those with > or =25% tumour growth discontinued treatment. This analysis focussed on secondary RDT end points: changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements from baseline after 12 weeks and overall tumour responses (WHO criteria) at week 24, progression-free survival (PFS), safety and biomarkers (BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutational status). Of 37 melanoma patients treated during the run-in phase, 34 were evaluable for response: one had > or =25% tumour shrinkage and remained on open-label sorafenib; six (16%) had <25% tumour growth and were randomised (placebo, n=3; sorafenib, n=3); and 27 had > or =25% tumour growth and discontinued. All three randomised sorafenib patients progressed by week 24; one remained on sorafenib for symptomatic relief. All three placebo patients progressed by week-24 and were re-started on sorafenib; one experienced disease re-stabilisation. Overall, the confirmed best responses for each of the 37 melanoma patients who received sorafenib were 19% stable disease (SD) (ie n=1 open-label; n=6 randomised), 62% (n=23) progressive disease (PD) and 19% (n=7) unevaluable. The overall median PFS was 11 weeks. The six randomised patients with SD had overall PFS values ranging from 16 to 34 weeks. The most common drug-related adverse events were dermatological (eg rash/desquamation, 51%; hand-foot skin reaction, 35%). There was no relationship between V600E BRAF status and disease stability. DNA was extracted from the biopsies of 17/22 patients. Six had V600E-positive tumours (n=4 had PD; n=1 had SD; n=1 unevaluable for response), and 11 had tumours containing wild-type BRAF (n=9 PD; n=1 SD; n=1 unevaluable for response). In conclusion, sorafenib is well tolerated but has little or no antitumour activity in advanced melanoma patients as a single agent at the dose evaluated (400 mg b.i.d.).

The majority of melanoma-associated B-Raf mutations involve a single point mutation, V600E, which results in greatly elevated B-Raf kinase activity and constitutive activation of MAPK/ERK downstream. Here we show that B-Raf(V600E) increases resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and promotes ERK-dependent phosphorylation of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bad that are involved in setting thresholds for apoptosis. ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Bim resulted in degradation of this BH3-only protein, whereas phosphorylation of Bad has previously been shown to result in its sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins. Consistent with this, inhibition of ERK activity in a panel of melanoma cell lines resulted in stabilization of Bim and dephosphorylation of Bad. Furthermore, apoptosis induced through overexpression of Bad or Bim was efficiently blocked by coexpression of mutant B-Raf(V600E). However, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Bim and Bad expression conferred only modest protection against cytotoxic drugs, whereas oncogenic B-Raf strongly protected against the same stimuli. These observations suggest that B-Raf-initiated inactivation of Bad and Bim only partly contributes to the anti-apoptotic activities of this oncogene and that other points within the cell death machinery are also targeted by deregulated ERK signaling.",

Clinical data were extracted to determine extracranial and intracranial objective response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A bait-capture, next-generation sequencing assay was used to identify mutations in pretreatment tumors that could explain primary resistance to vemurafenib.;Among patients with intracranial disease treated with vemurafenib, 27 were included in survival analyses and 22 patients were assessable for response. The extracranial and intracranial objective response rates were 71% and 50%, respectively. Discordant responses were observed between extracranial and intracranial metastatic sites in 4 of 19 evaluable patients. Median PFS was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6-7.9); median intracranial PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI: 2.7-7.9), median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.3-not reached), with a 30.4% 1-year OS rate.

The miRNA array data revealed that the expression of miR-524-5p was decreased in cells with an active MAPK/ERK pathway and confirmed that the expression of miR-524-5p is inversely associated with the activity of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We demonstrated that miR-524-5p directly binds to the 3'-untranslated regions of both BRAFandERK2 and suppresses the expression of these proteins.

Moreover, tumors overexpressing miR-524-5p were significantly smaller than those of the negative control mice.

Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning BRAFi-based therapy is therefore an important issue. Here we identified a previously unsuspected mechanism of BRAFi resistance driven by elevated Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation that is observed in a cohort of melanoma patients after vemurafenib treatment. Specifically, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, show increased levels of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared with naïve cells. We also observed these findings in clinical melanoma specimens. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling and was instead correlated with the noncanonical Hh pathway, involving TGFβ/SMAD (transforming growth factor-β/Sma- and Mad-related family) signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored sensitivity to vemurafenib-resistant cells, an effect associated with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a three-dimensional skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphthalmia transcription factor upregulation. Gant61 monotherapy did not alter the drug sensitivity of naïve cells, but could reverse the resistance of melanoma cells chronically treated with vemurafenib. We further noted that alternating dosing schedules of Gant61 and vemurafenib prevented the onset of BRAFi resistance, suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of therapeutic escape. Our results suggest that targeting the Hh pathway in BRAFi-resistant melanoma may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to restore vemurafenib sensitivity, reducing or even inhibiting the acquired chemoresistance in melanoma patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 October 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.348.",

Accordingly, we investigated the effect of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutation on the response to the stimulation and inhibition of epidermal and fibroblast growth factor receptors in melanoma cells. In the three BRAF mutant, two NRAS mutant and two double wild-type cell lines growth factor receptor expression had been verified by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation and migration were determined by the analysis of 3-days-long time-lapse videomicroscopic recordings. Of note, a more profound response was found in motility as compared to proliferation and double wild-type cells displayed a higher sensitivity to EGF and FGF2 treatment when compared to mutant cells. Both baseline and induced activation of the growth factor signaling was assessed by immunoblot analysis of the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors Erk1/2. Low baseline and higher inducibility of the signaling pathway was characteristic in double wild-type cells. In contrast, oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutation did not influence the response to EGF or FGF receptor inhibitors in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that the oncogenic mutations in melanoma have a profound impact on the motogenic effect of the activation of growth factor receptor signaling.

Vemurafenib treatment led to the release of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from the melanoma cells that increased the differentiation state of the fibroblasts, an affect associated with fibronectin deposition, increase in α-smooth muscle actin expression, and the release of neuregulin (NRG). At the same time, vemurafenib directly activated the fibroblasts through paradoxical stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, causing them to secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Treatment with the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination reversed the release of HGF. Adhesion of melanoma cells to fibronectin was critical in amplifying the fibroblast-derived NRG- and HGF-mediated PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT) survival signaling in the melanoma cells following BRAF inhibition. In coculture studies, combination treatment with inhibitors of BRAF/MET/HER kinase was ineffective at reversing the fibroblast-mediated therapeutic escape from BRAF inhibition. Instead, it was noted that combined BRAF/PI3K inhibition overcame fibroblast-mediated drug resistance in vitro and was associated with enhanced antitumor effects in an in vivo xenograft model. Thus, we show that melanoma cells and fibroblasts remodel their microenvironment in response to BRAF inhibition and that these adaptations allow tumor cells to evade therapy through increased PI3K/AKT survival signaling.

The series benefits from very low metabolism, and pharmacokinetics (PK) that can be modulated by methylation of the NH groups of the imidazolone, resulting in compounds with fewer H-donors and a better PK profile. These compounds have great potential in the treatment of mutant BRAF melanomas.",

Oncogenic mutations in the G-protein α-subunit q and 11 have been described in about 85% of uveal melanomas and confer constitutive activation. Multiple signaling pathways are induced as a consequence of GNAQ/11 activation, which include the MEK/ERK kinase cascade. We analyzed the transcriptional profile of cell lines treated with a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor to identify gene targets of activated GNAQ and to evaluate the biologic importance of these genes in uveal melanoma.;We conducted microarray analysis of uveal melanoma cell lines with GNAQ mutations treated with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. For comparison, we used cells carrying BRAF(V600E) and cells without either mutation. Changes in the expression of selected genes were then confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting.;We found that GNAQ mutant cells have a MEK-dependent transcriptional output and identified a unique set of genes that are downregulated by MEK inhibition, including the RNA helicase DDX21 and the cyclin-dependent kinase regulator CDK5R1 whereas Jun was induced. We provide evidence that these genes are involved in cell proliferation, tumor cell invasion, and drug resistance, respectively. Furthermore, we show that selumetinib treatment regulates the expression of these genes in tumor tissues of patients with metastatic GNAQ/11 mutant uveal melanoma.;Our findings define a subset of transcriptionally regulated genes by selumetinib in GNAQ mutant cells and provide new insights into understanding the biologic effect of MEK inhibition in this disease.",

The unification of genotype-specific cell line data revealed the enrichment for the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins to be associated with the presence of a BRAF mutation and oncogenic NRAS to be associated with increased receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators (cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin dependent kinase 2, and cyclin dependent kinase 3), MAPK pathway components (Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2), interferon regulators (tyrosine kinase-2), GTPase regulators (Ras-Rasb interactor 1), and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A) were common to all genotypes. Treatment of a BRAF-mutant/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) null melanoma cell line with vemurafenib led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, phospholipase C1, and β-catenin with increases in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, signal transduction and activator of signaling 3, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α noted. In NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEK inhibition led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway components, Src family kinases, and protein kinase Cδ with decreased phosphorylation seen in STAT3 and ERK1/2.

Mutations of B-Raf occur with the highest incidences in melanoma, and the most common mutant, V600E, renders B-Raf constitutively active. The sodium proton exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein responsible for regulating intracellular pH, cell volume, cell migration, and proliferation. A screen of protein kinases that bind to NHE1 revealed that B-Raf bound to the cytosolic regulatory tail of NHE1. Immunoprecipitation of NHE1 from HeLa and HEK cells confirmed the association of B-Raf with NHE1 in vivo. The expressed and purified C-terminal 182 amino acids of the NHE1 protein were also shown to associate with B-Raf protein in vitro. Because treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib decreased NHE1 activity in HeLa and HEK cells, we examined the role of B-Raf in regulating NHE1 in malignant melanoma cells. Melanoma cells with the B-Raf(V600E) mutation demonstrated increased resting intracellular pH that was dependent on elevated NHE1 activity. NHE1 activity after an acute acid load was also elevated in these cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of B-Raf activity by either sorafenib, PLX4720, or siRNA reduction of B-Raf levels abolished ERK phosphorylation and decreased NHE1 activity. These results demonstrate that B-Raf associates with and stimulates NHE1 activity and that B-Raf(V600E) also increases NHE1 activity that raises intracellular pH.",

We found that expression of constitutively active N-RAS(Q61K) and B-RAF(V600E) downregulated the proapoptotic Bim protein in an immortalized melanocyte cell line. Bim is one of the main proapoptotic mediators of anoikis. Western blot analysis showed that detachment increased Bim expression in melanocytes, and Annexin V staining indicated that detachment induced cell death significantly in melanocytes. Blocking Bim expression by using RNAi vectors or by expressing N-RAS(Q61K) significantly inhibited anoikis in melanocytes. In summary, this report indicates that N-RAS(Q61K) and B-RAF(V600E) contribute to melanoma's resistance to apoptosis in part by downregulating Bim expression, suggesting that Bim is a possible treatment target for overriding melanoma's inherent defenses against cell death.",

In this article, we review the current state of targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors.;Despite major advancements in targeted therapy of metastatic melanoma, most patients relapse and show progressive disease after 5-7 months with single inhibition of BRAF or MEK. Acquired resistance is virtually universal and mediated by diverse mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent or independent mechanisms. Recent evidence favours concurrent targeting of BRAF and MEK in patients with BRAFV600-mutated melanoma instead of BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. The combination delays the onset of acquired resistance, resulting in increased progression-free and overall survival. A growing number of early trials evaluate the efficacy of inhibitors targeting additional pathways such as phospho-inositide 3-kinase/AKT in conjunction with BRAF or MEK. Even though consistent and mature phase III study results are not yet available for these combinations, the repertoire of targeted therapy in metastatic melanoma is wide and promising.;The short era of single BRAF inhibition in BRAF-mutated melanoma is soon taken over by dual concurrent inhibition of MEK and BRAF.",

The main objective of our work was to investigate the relationship between mutant BRAF DNA in plasma and clinical response. Thirty-eight stage IV patients with a V600 mutated BRAF melanoma were included prior to any treatment. DNA was extracted from plasma and mutant DNA was detected using the amplification-refractory mutation system method. Before the beginning of any treatment, the corresponding BRAF mutation was detected in 29 of the 38 tested plasma samples (76.3% positive per cent agreement). We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Altogether, these results suggest that plasmatic mutant BRAF DNA is a prognostic factor of OS, correlated with tumor burden. In addition, it represents an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations before treatment. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib yield high response rates and improved overall survival in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic melanoma. Treatment traditionally continues until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity. Acquired drug resistance and toxicity are key challenges with the use of these drugs. Resistance to vemurafenib usually develops within 6-8 months. Management of drug toxicity typically involves stopping vemurafenib until resolution, before restarting at a lower dose, or permanently ceasing vemurafenib therapy. We have recently considered whether intermittent dosing could be used as an alternative to dose reduction/termination in the management of vemurafenib toxicity. One patient treated with intermittent vemurafenib was an 89-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma, who initially showed a good response to continuous dosing. Recurrent toxicity meant that the continuous vemurafenib dosage was repeatedly ceased before restarting at a lower dose. Ten months after vemurafenib was first begun, an intermittent dosing regimen was introduced in an attempt to control toxicity. This continued for 2 months, before cessation due to continued unacceptable toxicity. A further 24 months later, the patient remains fit and well in complete clinical remission, with no recurrence of her previous melanoma and no new primary malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, a continued response after the cessation of selective BRAF inhibitors has never before been described in melanoma. Induction of an immune response and/or epigenetic changes could explain continued disease response after cessation of vemurafenib therapy. Care should be taken when extrapolating the findings from the continued response after vemurafenib cessation to other tumour types. We recommend the collection and analysis of data to investigate the clinical responses seen after cessation of vemurafenib due to intolerable toxicities, which could help further explain vemurafenib's mechanism of action.

Sixteen cases developed in subungual areas. Nodular melanoma was the most common histopathological subtype (63.6%). The most frequent cell types affected were epithelioid and spindled. HMB-45 staining was strongly positive in 66.7% of AAMs; 4 (12.1%) were negative for HMB-45, and 3 of these were complete-type AAMs. Of 33 total patients, BRAF mutations were detected in 2 AAM cases, and KIT aberrations were present in 11 cases (33.3%). Four cases (12.1%), all of which were complete-type AAMs, had KIT mutations. KIT aberrations were weakly correlated with c-kit staining. Twenty patients were TNM stage I or II, and mean survival was 30.14 ± 4.54 months.;The study is limited by the small number of patients.;Physicians should be aware of rare and hard-to-diagnose AAMs. We expect that tyrosine kinase inhibitors would be effective for KIT-mutated patients with complete-type AAMs.",

GAB2 has recently been implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, and increased copy numbers are found in a subset of melanomas. We sought to determine the association of increased copy numbers of GAB2 among melanoma subtypes in the context of genetic alterations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;A total of 85 melanomas arising from sun-protected (n = 23) and sun-exposed sites (n = 62) were analyzed for copy number changes using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and for gain-of-function mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;GAB2 amplifications were found in 9% of the cases and were associated with melanomas arising from acral and mucosal sites (P = 0.005). Increased copy numbers of the KIT locus were observed in 6% of the cases. The overall mutation frequencies for BRAF and NRAS were 43.5% and 14%, respectively, and were mutually exclusive. Among the acral and mucosal melanomas studied, the genetic alteration frequency was 26% for GAB2, 13% for KIT, 30% for BRAF, and 4% for NRAS. Importantly, the majority of GAB2 amplifications occurred independent from genetic events in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;GAB2 amplification is critical for melanomas arising from sun-protected sites.

We identify multiple branch points (BP) in intron 8 of both wild-type (wt) and vemurafenib-resistant BRAF RNA. In wt BRAF, BPs are located at -29A, -28A and -26A, whereas in a vemurafenib-resistant BRAF splicing mutant, BPs map to -22A, -18A and -15A, proximal to the intron 8 3' splice site. This finding of a distal-to-proximal shift of the branch point sequence in BRAF splicing in response to point-mutations in intron 8 provides insight into the regulation of BRAF alternative splicing upon vemurafenib resistance.

To investigate the stage in which those mutations occur in the currently proposed sequential malignant transformation of melanocytes, 22 benign melanocytic nevi, 23 melanocytic atypical nevi, and 25 primary cutaneous melanoma from 63 different patients were examined for BRAF mutations using DNA extracted from microdissected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues, and a two-round PCR-RFLP-based strategy. A subset of samples was sequenced for mutation confirmation. Sixteen benign (73%) and eleven atypical (52%) melanocytic nevi, and thirteen melanoma (56%) demonstrated BRAF mutations at codon 599, and no statistically significant differences were detected among all three types of lesions. No mutations were demonstrated in microdissected epidermal keratinocytes adjacent to melanocytic lesions having BRAF mutations. No correlation was detected between BRAF mutational status and age, sun exposure, and Clark's level in malignant melanoma.

We show here that BRAFi (or BRAFi + MEKi) therapy in patients frequently led to rebound phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in their melanomas early on-treatment. In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT. Thus, adaptive or genetic upregulation of AKT critically participates in melanoma survival during BRAFi therapy. ",

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is found in the majority of melanomas, with either somatic missense mutations of BRAF or, considerably more rarely, mutations of N-RAS. The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found. So far, ancillary molecular studies are not regularly applied in the routine diagnostic procedures performed when malignant melanoma is suspected. In the future, however, the development of targeted molecular therapies will require that molecular pathological techniques are used to identify the melanoma patients who will most probably benefit from a particular therapy.",

However, in melanoma, activating mutations in Ras are rarely observed and are limited to N-Ras in UV-exposed cells. In this study, we identify constitutively activated ERK in almost all melanoma cell lines and in tumor tissues tested, which is in contrast to normal melanocytes and several early stage radial growth phase melanoma lines where ERK can be activated by serum or growth factors. Constitutive activation of ERK is preceded by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and c-RAF. In all of the melanoma cell lines tested, Ras is constitutively activated without underlying mutations. On the contrary, activating mutations in the kinase domain of BRAF are present in the majority of the cell lines tested. Furthermore, ERK activation can be partially inhibited from the cell surface using inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor but not interleukin 8 signaling pathways. These data suggest that melanoma growth, invasion, and metastasis are attributable to constitutively activated ERK apparently mediated by excessive growth factors through autocrine mechanisms and BRAF kinase activation.",

In BRAF WT cells and those with mutations that activate or result in high levels of the BRAF activator RAS, BRAF inhibition can lead to ERK activation, resulting in tumorigenic transformation. We describe a patient with malignant melanoma who developed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the absence of RAS mutations during vemurafenib treatment. BRAF inhibition promoted patient CLL proliferation in culture and in murine xenografts and activated MEK/ERK in primary CLL cells from additional patients. BRAF inhibitor-driven ERK activity and CLL proliferation required B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation, as inhibition of the BCR-proximal spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) reversed ERK hyperactivation and proliferation of CLL cells from multiple patients, while inhibition of the BCR-distal Bruton tyrosine kinase had no effect. Additionally, the RAS-GTP/RAS ratio in primary CLL cells exposed to vemurafenib was reduced upon SYK inhibition. BRAF inhibition increased mortality and CLL expansion in mice harboring CLL xenografts; however, SYK or MEK inhibition prevented CLL proliferation and increased animal survival. Together, these results suggest that BRAF inhibitors promote B cell malignancies in the absence of obvious mutations in RAS or other receptor tyrosine kinases and provide a rationale for combined BRAF/MEK or BRAF/SYK inhibition.

While RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PLX4032) have proven effective in BRAF mutant melanoma, they are surprisingly ineffective in BRAF mutant CRCs, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear. Compared to BRAF mutant melanoma cells, BRAF mutant CRC cells were less sensitive to vemurafenib, and P-ERK suppression was not sustained in response to treatment. Although transient inhibition of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib was observed in CRC, rapid ERK re-activation occurred through EGFR-mediated activation of RAS and CRAF. BRAF mutant CRCs expressed higher levels of phospho-EGFR than BRAF mutant melanomas, suggesting that CRCs are specifically poised for EGFR-mediated resistance. Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of MAPK signaling in BRAF mutant CRC cells and markedly improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings support evaluation of combined RAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAF mutant CRC patients.;BRAF valine 600 (V600) mutations occur in 10% to 15% of colorectal cancers, yet these tumors show a surprisingly low clinical response rate (~5%) to selective RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, which have produced dramatic response rates (60%–80%) in melanomas harboring the identical BRAF V600 mutation.

In two-way comparisons, melanomas arising on skin with signs of chronic sun-induced damage and skin without such signs could be correctly classified with 84 percent accuracy.

AZD6244 is a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor that markedly reduces tumor P-MAPK levels, but it produces few clinical responses in melanoma patients. An improved understanding of the determinants of resistance to AZD6244 may lead to improved patient selection and effective combinatorial approaches. The effects of AZD6244 on cell growth and survival were tested in a total of 14 Braf-mutant and 3 wild-type human cutaneous melanoma cell lines. Quantitative assessment of phospho-protein levels in the Braf-mutant cell lines by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis showed no significant association between P-MEK or P-MAPK levels and AZD6244 sensitivity, but activation-specific markers in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway correlated with resistance. We also identified resistant cell lines without basal activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. RPPA characterization of the time-dependent changes in signaling pathways revealed that AZD6244 produced durable and potent inhibition of P-MAPK in sensitive and resistant Braf-mutant cell lines, but several resistant lines showed AZD6244-induced activation of AKT. In contrast, sensitive cell lines showed AZD6244 treatment-induced upregulation of PTEN protein and mRNA expression. Inhibition of AKT, TORC1/2, or insulin-like growth factor I receptor blocked AZD6244-induced activation of AKT and resulted in synergistic cell killing with AZD6244. These findings identify basal and treatment-induced regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as a critical regulator of AZD6244 sensitivity in Braf-mutant cutaneous melanoma cells and the novel regulation of PTEN expression by AZD6244 in sensitive cells, and suggest new combinatorial approaches for patients.",

Strikingly, the biological consequences of the failure of MC1R variants to suppress PI3K/AKT signaling are highly context dependent.

We demonstrate that a subgroup of WT/WT melanomas display high basal phosphorylation of ErbB3 that is associated with autocrine production of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). In WT/WT melanoma cells displaying high levels of phospho-ErbB3, knockdown of NRG1 reduced cell viability and was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ErbB3, its coreceptor ErbB2, and its downstream target, AKT. Similar effects were observed by targeting ErbB3 with either siRNAs or the neutralizing ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies huHER3-8 and NG33. In addition, pertuzumab-mediated inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization decreased AKT phosphorylation, cell growth in vitro, and xenograft growth in vivo. Pertuzumab also potentiated the effects of MEK inhibitor on WT/WT melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate that targeting ErbB3-ErbB2 signaling in a cohort of WT/WT melanomas leads to tumor growth reduction. Together, these studies support the rationale to target the NRG1-ErbB3-ErbB2 axis as a novel treatment strategy in a subset of cutaneous melanomas.",

We hypothesized that somatic mutations in the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway, which promotes proliferation and survival, may coincide with BRAF(V600) mutations and contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance.;We performed a somatic mutation profiling study using the 454 FLX pyrosequencing platform in order to identify candidate cancer genes within the MAPK and PI3K pathways of melanoma patients. Somatic mutations of theses candidate cancer genes were then confirmed using Sanger sequencing.;As expected, BRAF(V600) mutations were seen in 51% of the melanomas, whereas NRAS mutations were seen in 19% of the melanomas. However, PI3K pathway mutations, though more heterogeneous, were present in 41% of the melanoma, with PTEN being the highest mutated PI3K gene in melanomas (22%). Interestingly, several novel PI3K pathway mutations were discovered in MTOR, IRS4, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, PIK3R5, and NFKB1. PI3K pathway mutations co-occurred with BRAF(V600) mutations in 17% of the tumors and co-occurred with 9% of NRAS mutant tumors, implying cooperativity between these pathways in terms of melanoma progression.;These novel PI3K pathway somatic mutations could provide alternative survival and proliferative pathways for metastatic melanoma cells. They therefore may be potential chemotherapeutic targets for melanoma patients who exhibit resistance to BRAF(V600) inhibitors.",

To address this, we have tested pairwise combinations of an array of small-molecule inhibitors on early-passage melanoma cultures using combinatorial drug screening. Results reveal several inhibitor combinations effective for melanomas with activating RAS or BRAF mutations, including mutant BRAF melanomas with intrinsic or acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Inhibition of both EGF receptor and AKT sensitized treatment-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cultures to vemurafenib. Melanomas with RAS mutations were more resistant to combination therapies relative to BRAF mutants, but were sensitive to combinations of statins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. These results show the use of combinatorial drug screening for discovering unique treatment regimens that overcome resistance phenotypes of mutant BRAF- and RAS-driven melanomas.;We have used drug combinatorial screening to identify effective combinations for mutant BRAF melanomas, including those resistant to vemurafenib, and mutant RAS melanomas that are resistant to many therapies.

BRaf is activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks allow bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR, and many receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2. It is this adaptive response to targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single-agent kinase inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all cancers treated with single-agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus, understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination therapies for durable clinical responses.",

Characterization of gene copy numbers was performed by quantitative PCR and, as an alternative method, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to define the CCND1 amplification pattern at the single cell level. Samples with amplified CCND1 (32%) were further analyzed for copy number alterations for the TAOS1, FGF3, FGF19, FGF4 and EMS1 genes. Co-amplification of the CCND1 and TAOS1 was present in 15% of tumors and was more frequent in ulcerated lesions (P=0.017). Furthermore, 56% of primary melanomas had either BRAF or NRAS mutations, but these two mutations were not present in any of the lesions analyzed. Of these cases, 34% also had CCND1 amplification. There was a significant relationship between NRAS activating mutations and UV exposure (P=0.005). We did not find correlations between CCND1 gene amplification status and any of the patients' clinicopathological parameters. However, CCND1 amplification simultaneously with either BRAF or NRAS activation mutations was observed mainly in primary tumors with ulcerated surfaces (P=0.028).

Mechanisms of clinical resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition are unknown. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on pretreatment and drug-resistant tumors from five patients with acquired resistance to dabrafenib/trametinib. In three of these patients, we identified additional mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the pretreatment tumor, including a novel activating mutation in MEK2 (MEK2(Q60P)). MEK2(Q60P) conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The continued MAPK signaling-based resistance identified in these patients suggests that alternative dosing of current agents, more potent RAF/MEK inhibitors, and/or inhibition of the downstream kinase ERK may be needed for durable control of BRAF-mutant melanoma.

Checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies administered as infusions every 2-3 weeks, blocking the checkpoints PD-1 or CTLA-4, thus, preventing downregulation of the immune system. BRAF and MEK inhibitors are small molecules, they are given orally and block a certain signaling pathway in tumor cells. The activation of this pathway has to be demonstrated by molecular analysis of tumor tissue first. This strategy is currently registered for 40-50 % of melanomas harboring a BRAF V600 mutation, while the combination of a BRAF plus MEK inhibitor has been proven more efficient than a BRAF inhibitor alone.;A fascinating development has started in the melanoma field due to immunotherapeutic and molecular-targeted treatment strategies.

After progression during or post immunotherapy, these patients were given BRAF inhibitor therapy and developed rapid CRs. Based on the concomitant presence of autoimmune manifestations (including vitiligo and hypophysitis), we postulated that there was a synergistic effect between the prior immune therapy and the BRAF targeting agents. Accordingly, the inhibitors were gradually weaned off beginning at 3 months and were stopped completely at 9-12 months. The three patients remain well and in CR off of all therapy at up to 15 months radiographic follow-up. The institution of the BRAF therapy was associated with development of severe rheumatoid-like arthritis in 2 patients which persisted for months after discontinuation of therapy, suggesting it was not merely a known toxicity of BRAF inhibitors (arthralgias). On immunologic analysis, these patients had high levels of non-T-regulatory, CD4 positive effector phenotype T-cells, which persisted after completion of therapy. Of note, we had previously reported a similar phenomenon in patients with metastatic melanoma who failed high dose interleukin-2 and were then placed on a finite course of temozolomide with rapid complete responses that have remained durable for many years after discontinuation of temozolomide. We postulate that a finite course of cytotoxic or targeted therapy specific for melanoma given after apparent failure of prior immunotherapy can result in complete and durable remissions that may persist long after the specific cytotoxic or targeted agents have been discontinued suggesting the existence of sequence specific synergism between immunotherapy and these agents. Here, we discuss these cases in the context of the literature on synergy between conventional or targeted cytotoxic therapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment. ",

Mutational activation of BRAF is the most prevalent genetic alteration in human melanoma, resulting in constitutive melanoma hyperproliferation. A selective BRAF inhibitor showed remarkable clinical activity in patients with mutated BRAF. Unfortunately, most patients acquire resistance to the BRAF inhibitor, highlighting the urgent need for new melanoma treatment strategies. Green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) inhibits cell proliferation independently of BRAF inhibitor sensitivity, suggesting that increased understanding of the anti-melanoma activity of EGCG may provide a novel therapeutic target. Here, by performing functional genetic screening, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a critical factor in the suppression of melanoma cell proliferation. We demonstrated that tumor-overexpressed 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) activates PP2A through adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway eliciting inhibitions of oncoproteins and activation of tumor suppressor Merlin. Activating 67LR/PP2A pathway leading to melanoma-specific mTOR inhibition shows strong synergy with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in the drug-resistant melanoma. Moreover, SET, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, is overexpressed on malignant melanoma. Silencing of SET enhances 67LR/PP2A signaling. Collectively, activation of 67LR/PP2A signaling may thus be a novel rational strategy for melanoma-specific treatment. ",

Combining selective BRAF and MEK inhibition, such as the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib, has been shown to improve the response rate and progression-free survival in patients with advanced melanoma while significantly alleviating the paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. This combination treatment results in a reduction in skin toxicity relative to that seen with a BRAF inhibitor alone; however, addition of the MEK inhibitor adds other toxicities, such as pyrexia and gastrointestinal or ocular toxicity. While combined BRAF-MEK inhibition appears primed to become a standard molecular approach for BRAF-mutant melanoma, the utility of the combination has to be considered in the rapidly changing landscape of immunotherapeutics, such as immune checkpoint blockade using anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and anti-programmed death-1/programmed death-L1 antibodies.

However, the contribution of the ER to the early stages of normal cell transformation is largely unknown. Using primary human melanocytes and biopsies of human naevi (moles), we show that the extent of ER stress induced by cellular oncogenes may define the mechanism of activation of premature senescence. Specifically, we found that oncogenic forms of HRAS (HRAS(G12V)) but not its downstream target BRAF (BRAF(V600E)), engaged a rapid cell-cycle arrest that was associated with massive vacuolization and expansion of the ER. However, neither p53, p16(INK4a) nor classical senescence markers--such as foci of heterochromatin or DNA damage--were able to account for the specific response of melanocytes to HRAS(G12V). Instead, HRAS(G12V)-driven senescence was mediated by the ER-associated unfolded protein response (UPR). The impact of HRAS on the UPR was selective, as it was poorly induced by activated NRAS (more frequently mutated in melanoma than HRAS). These results argue against premature senescence as a converging mechanism of response to activating oncogenes and support a direct role of the ER as a gatekeeper of tumour control.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We recently identified the secreted protein IGFBP7 as a factor required for an activated BRAF oncogene to induce senescence or apoptosis in primary human cells. In human melanomas containing an activating BRAF mutation (BRAF-positive melanomas), IGFBP7 is epigenetically silenced, which seems to be a critical step in melanoma genesis. Restoration of IGFBP7 function by the addition of recombinant IGFBP7 (rIGFBP7) induces apoptosis in BRAF-positive human melanoma cell lines, and systemically administered rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses the growth of BRAF-positive primary tumors in xenografted mice. Here we further evaluate the role of IGFBP7 in the treatment of BRAF-positive melanoma and other malignancies. We find that in human metastatic melanoma samples IGFBP7 is epigenetically silenced and at an even higher frequency than that found in primary melanomas. Using a murine experimental metastasis assay, we show that systemic administration of rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses the growth of metastatic disease and prolongs survival. An analysis of the NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines reveals that in addition to melanoma, IGFBP7 induces apoptosis in several other cancer types, in particular colorectal cancer cell lines. In general, IGFBP7 induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines that have an activating mutation in BRAF or RAS, and that are sensitive to chemical inhibition of BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling. Significantly, systemically administered rIGFBP7 blocks the growth of colorectal tumors containing an activating RAS or BRAF mutation in mouse xenografts. The results presented here, in conjunction with those from previous studies, justify the further development of IGFBP7 as an anticancer agent.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of BAY 87-2243, a small molecule that inhibits the first OXPHOS enzyme (complex I), in melanoma in vitro and in vivo.;BAY 87-2243 decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and induced partial depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lowering of total cellular ATP levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and reduced cell viability. The latter was rescued by the antioxidant vitamin E and high extracellular glucose levels (25 mM), indicating the involvement of ROS-induced cell death and a dependence on glycolysis for cell survival upon BAY 87-2243 treatment. BAY 87-2243 significantly reduced tumor growth in various BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenografts and patient-derived melanoma mouse models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that inhibition of mutated BRAF using the specific small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib increased the OXPHOS dependency of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. As a consequence, the combination of both inhibitors augmented the anti-tumor effect of BAY 87-2243 in a BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenograft model.;Taken together, our results suggest that complex I inhibition has potential clinical applications as a single agent in melanoma and also might be efficacious in combination with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has risen at a rate significantly higher than that for other malignancies. This increase persists despite efforts to educate the public about the dangers of excess exposure to UV radiation from both the sun and tanning beds. Melanoma affects a relatively younger population and is notorious for its propensity to metastasize and for its poor response to current therapeutic regimens. These factors make prevention an integral component to the goal of decreasing melanoma-related mortality. Transformation of melanocytes into malignant melanoma involves the interplay between genetic factors, UV exposure, and the tumor microenvironment. The roles of UV radiation in the etiology of melanoma are mediated by both direct damage of DNA through formation of photoproducts and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Many of the promising antioxidant agents under development for the prevention of melanoma are derived from foodstuffs. B-Raf is a member of the Raf kinase family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway. About 50 % of melanomas harbor activating BRAF mutations. BRAF mutations are found in 59 % of the melanomas arising in skin with intermittent sun exposure, such as trunk and arms, as compared with only 23 % of the acral melanomas, 11 % of mucosal melanomas, and 0 % of uveal melanomas. Two new agents, ipilimumab and vemurafenib, have been shown to improve outcome of advanced melanoma as presented at the plenary session of the 2011 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Vemurafenib is the first personalized compound which demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAFV600 mutation and represents the first drug of a class that exerts its anti-proliferative activity through inhibition of a highly specific molecular target. GSK2118436 (dabrafenib), the second BRAF inhibitor, in phase I and II trial obtained similar results to vemurafenib. A phase III trial is now ongoing. Taken together, the early clinical development of vemurafenib and dabrafenib clearly confirms that BRAF inhibitors can halt or reverse disease in patients with melanomas carrying this mutation, improving survival times compared with historically standard treatments (chemotherapy and interleukin-2). The clinical development of other new BRAF inhibitors such as RAF265 and LGX818 is now ongoing. Combination strategies of BRAF inhibitors with ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and/or MEK inhibitors or metformin are now under investigation in clinical trials. ",

Fifty-nine patients treated with single-agent vemurafenib were prospectively analyzed. Vemurafenib plasma concentration (n = 159) was measured at days 15, 30, 60, and 90 after treatment initiation. Clinical and biological determinants (including plasma vemurafenib concentration) for efficacy and safety were assessed using Cox's model and multivariate stepwise logistic regression. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 5.0 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 2.0-6.0) and 11.0 (95% CI 7.0-16.0) months, respectively. Twenty-nine patients (49 %) experienced any grade ≥3 toxicity and the most frequent grade ≥2 toxicity was skin rash (37 %). Severe toxicities led to definitive discontinuation in seven patients (12 %). Grade ≥2 skin rash was not statistically associated with better objective response at day 60 (p = 0.06) and longer PFS (hazard ratio 0.47; 95 % CI 0.21-1.08; p = 0.075).

Historically, systemic therapies have been largely ineffective, because melanoma is usually resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, during the past few years, several targeted therapies have proved effective in this challenging disease. These recent advances have been facilitated by an improved understanding of the driving genetic aberrations of melanoma, particularly mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, demonstrated an overall survival advantage in phase III trials and is an appropriate option for first-line therapy in metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma. Dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, also have been shown to be effective in phase III trials for BRAF mutant melanoma and may be additional treatment options as monotherapy or in combination pending regulatory approval. Additionally, imatinib is a promising targeted therapy for patients whose tumors harbor a KIT mutation in exons 11 and 13. Although these targeted agents cause objective responses and clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, resistance invariably develops. New targets and strategies to overcome acquired resistance are urgently needed. Furthermore, no effective targeted therapy has been developed for NRAS mutant tumors or in melanomas with as yet unknown driver mutations.

Until recently this mutation had however only been identified in one case of posterior uveal melanoma. Despite this apparent lack of the BRAF mutation, inappropriate downstream activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway has been described in posterior uveal melanoma. Based on the already recognised morphological and cytogenetic heterogeneity in uveal melanoma, we hypothesised that the BRAF mutation may be present in uveal melanoma but only in some of the tumour cells. In this study, we analysed 20 ciliary body and 30 choroidal melanomas using a nested PCR-based technique resulting in the amplification of a nested product only if the mutation was present. This sensitive technique can identify mutated DNA in the presence of wild-type DNA. The mutation was identified in 4 of 20 (20%) ciliary body and 11 of 30 (40%) choroidal melanomas. Further analysis of separate areas within the same choroidal melanoma demonstrated that the mutation was not present in the entire tumour. In conclusion, the T1799A BRAF mutation is present in a proportion of posterior uveal melanomas but within these tumours the distribution of the mutation is heterogeneous.",

        "Doc_abstract":"For decades, therapy for advanced melanoma has lagged behind most of the cancer field owing to its intrinsic resistance to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and limited impact of cytokine-based immunotherapy. The opportunity to develop molecularly targeted therapy emerged with the discovery of activating mutations in BRAF, a component of the long studied MAP kinase pathway. These mutations are found in approximately 50 % of patients with regionally advanced or metastatic melanoma and appear to be one of the initiating steps in the development of primary melanoma. Additional oncogenic events, particularly those that affect tumor suppressor genes, are essential for development of invasive and metastatic melanoma. Nonetheless, mutated BRAF retains its central contribution to melanoma pathophysiology even in advanced stage disease as manifested by the remarkable antitumor effects and alteration the natural history of metastatic melanoma of selective BRAF inhibitors. After initial response, resistance commonly emerges within a few months' time and the field has focused on delineating molecular mechanisms of resistance toward the goal of improving upon the early therapeutic effects of single agent BRAF inhibition. Combination regimens are currently undergoing clinical investigation. NRAS and CKIT mutant melanoma represent the next oncogene defined melanoma subsets for which initial targeted therapy approaches are being explored, with early evidence suggesting progress with MEK and CKIT inhibitors, respectively. A considerable subset of patients have melanomas that are not defined by the presence of BRAF, NRAS, or CKIT mutations and, thus, the elucidation of the entire melanoma genome is being pursued with the hope of identifying additional therapeutic targets.",

Does Spitz naevus progress into spitzoid melanoma? Are ambiguous spitzoid tumours genuine entities?;BRAF, NRAS and HRAS mutations were analysed using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing.;Both Spitz naevi and spitzoid melanoma had a lower combined BRAF and NRAS mutation frequency compared with common acquired naevi (P = 0.0001) and common forms of melanoma (P = 0.0072), respectively. To look for evidence of progression from Spitz naevi to spitzoid melanoma, HRAS was analysed in 21 spitzoid melanomas, with no mutations identified. The binomial probability of this was 0.03 based on an assumption of a 15% mutation frequency in Spitz naevi with unbiased progression. Under these assumptions, HRAS mutations must be rare/absent in spitzoid melanoma. Thus, Spitz naevi seem unlikely to progress into spitzoid melanoma, implying that ambiguous spitzoid tumours cannot be intermediate degrees of progression. In addition, the data suggest that HRAS mutation is a potential marker of benign behaviour, in support of which none of three HRAS mutant spitzoid cases metastasized.;First, the morphological similarity of spitzoid tumours reflects an underlying molecular similarity, namely a relative lack of dependence on BRAF/NRAS mutations. Second, Spitz naevi do not appear to progress into spitzoid melanoma, and consequently ambiguous spitzoid tumours are likely to be unclassifiable Spitz naevi or spitzoid melanoma rather than genuine entities. Third, HRAS mutation may be a marker of Spitz naevus, raising the possibility that other molecular markers for discriminating Spitz naevi from spitzoid melanoma can be discovered.",

Additional targets have been identified, and novel agents that impact on various signaling pathways or modulate the immune system hold the promise of a whole new therapeutic landscape for patients with metastatic melanoma.

Here, we establish a mechanism of resistance and subsequently identified a suitable drug combination to overcome the resistance. Single treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib or dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitors) alone or in combination with trametinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor) resulted in overexpression of Mcl-1. Overexpression of Mcl-1 in A375 and SK-MEL-28 by transfection completely blocked BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitor-mediated inhibition of cell survival and apoptosis. Melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors showed massive expression of Mcl-1 as compared to respective sensitive cell lines. Silencing of Mcl-1 using siRNA completely sensitized resistant melanoma cells to growth suppression and induction of apoptosis by BRAF inhibitors. In vivo, vemurafenib resistant A375 xenografts implanted in athymic nude mice showed substantial tumor growth inhibition when treated with a combination of vemurafenib and Mcl-1 inhibitor or siRNA. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses demonstrated enhanced expression of Mcl-1 and activation of ERK1/2 in vemurafenib-resistant tumors whereas level of Mcl-1 or p-ERK1/2 was diminished in the tumors of mice treated with either of the combination. Biopsied tumors from the patients treated with or resistant to BRAF inhibitors revealed overexpression of Mcl-1.

Demographic, treatment patterns, response, and survival data were collected from medical charts. Clinical data on 283 patients with active BRAF V600E-mutant MBM treated with vemurafenib were provided by 70 US oncologists. Mean age was 57.2 years, 60.8% were male, 67.5% had ECOG performance status of 0-1, and 43.1% used corticosteroids at vemurafenib initiation. Median follow-up was 5.7 months. Following vemurafenib initiation, 48.1% of patients experienced intracranial response and 45.6% experienced extracranial response. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for overall survival was 59% at 12 months. Multivariate analyses showed associations between intracranial response and both corticosteroid use and vemurafenib as initial therapy after MBM diagnosis. Larger size (5-10 mm vs. < 5 mm) and number of brain metastases (≥ 5 vs. < 2) and progressive extracranial disease at treatment initiation were associated with decreased intracranial response and increased risk of disease progression. Multiple extracranial sites (2 vs. < 2) and the absence of local treatments were also associated with increased risk of progression. Increased risk of death was associated with ≥ 2 extracranial disease sites, progressive extracranial disease, and ≥ 5 brain metastases.

The manufacturer of vemurafenib, Roche Products Limited, was invited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to submit evidence of the drug's clinical- and cost-effectiveness for its licenced indication, to inform the Institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. This article summarises the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and also includes a summary of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) decision. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The ERG's analysis of the submitted economic model assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. It also included an assessment of the reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to impact substantially on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. The clinical evidence was derived from BRIM 3 (BRAF Inhibitor in Melanoma 3), a well-designed, multi-centre, multi-national, phase III, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Clinical outcome results from the October 2011 data cut showed that median overall survival for patients treated with vemurafenib was 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months for those treated with dacarbazine. The ERG's main concern with the trial was the potential for confounding because of the early introduction of the crossover from the comparator drug to vemurafenib or another BRAF inhibitor. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was considered above the NICE threshold, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The ERG questioned the submitted economic model on a number of grounds, particularly the approach used to project trial results. After the ERG had made appropriate corrections to the model and employed an alternative form of projective modelling, the ICER per quality-adjusted life year more than doubled. Additional evidence was submitted by the manufacturer for consideration at a second AC meeting and at their third meeting the AC concluded that vemurafenib could be recommended as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma.

Because inhibitions of targets in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway result in G(0)-G(1) cell-cycle arrest, vemurafenib-resistant cancer cells are expected to escape this cell-cycle arrest and progress to the subsequent G(2)-M phase. We hypothesized that a combined therapy using vemurafenib with a G(2)-M phase blocking agent will trap resistant cells and overcome vemurafenib resistance. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the combination index (CI) values of our novel tubulin inhibitor ABI-274 and vemurafenib on parental human A375 and MDA-MB-435 melanoma cell lines to be 0.32 and 0.1, respectively, suggesting strong synergy for the combination. We then developed an A375RF21 subline with significant acquired resistance to vemurafenib and confirmed the strong synergistic effect. Next, we studied the potential mechanisms of overcoming vemurafenib resistance. Flow cytometry confirmed that the combination of ABI-274 and vemurafenib synergistically arrested cells in the G(1)-G(2)-M phase, and significantly increased apoptosis in both parental A375 and the vemurafenib-resistant A375RF21 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the combination treatment effectively reduced the level of phosphorylated and total AKT, activated the apoptosis cascade, and increased cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, but had no significant influence on the level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Finally, in vivo coadministration of vemurafenib with ABI-274 showed strong synergistic efficacy in the vemurafenib-resistant xenograft model in nude mice. Overall, these results offer a rational combination strategy to significantly enhance the therapeutic benefit in patients with melanoma who inevitably become resistant to current vemurafenib therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Somatic mutations in the BRAF gene have been identified as the most frequent and relevant to develop targeted molecular therapies in melanoma. Recently, seminal clinical trials have provided indisputable evidence that BRAF inhibitors improve response rate, progression free and overall survival in BRAFV600 mutated metastatic melanoma patients, thus representing the novel standard of care. Dermatological \"off target\" effects of these so-called 'targeted therapies' have to be considered, however, and among them the most intriguing are cutaneous adverse reactions. Skin toxicity is of relevance for at least three reasons: (1) it worsens the patient's quality of life and may be difficult to manage, (2) its heterogeneous clinical presentation differs from the clinico-pathological pictures observed in patients who do not receive BRAF inhibitors, and; (3) onset of skin cancer represents a model of carcinogenesis which may help to better understand the potential visceral tumorigenesis induced by BRAF inhibitors. This manuscript summarizes and critically reviews the state of the art of skin toxicity associated with BRAF inhibitors. Special attention will be paid to clinical presentation and histopathological findings, as well as related challenges for clinicians, pathologists, and basic scientists. ",

Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocked activation of P70S6K and S6, but it also increased activation of AKT and failed to induce cell death. Combined treatment with rapamycin and PX-866, a PI3K inhibitor, blocked the activation of S6 and AKT and resulted in marked cell death when combined with PLX4720.

Although B- or C-RAF dysregulation represents prominent resistance mechanisms, resistance-associated point mutations in RAF oncoproteins are surprisingly rare. To gain insights herein, we conducted random mutagenesis screens to identify B- or C-RAF mutations that confer resistance to RAF inhibitors. Whereas bona fide B-RAF(V600E) resistance alleles were rarely observed, we identified multiple C-RAF mutations that produced biochemical and pharmacologic resistance. Potent C-RAF resistance alleles localized to a 14-3-3 consensus binding site or a separate site within the P loop. These mutations elicited paradoxical upregulation of RAF kinase activity in a dimerization-dependent manner following exposure to RAF inhibitors. Knowledge of resistance-associated C-RAF mutations may enhance biochemical understanding of RAF-dependent signaling, anticipate clinical resistance to novel RAF inhibitors, and guide the design of \"next-generation\" inhibitors for deployment in RAF- or RAS-driven malignancies.",

However, these agents are associated with the development of other nonmelanoma skin lesions, in particular squamoproliferative lesions such as keratoacanthomas (KAs), squamous cell carcinomas, and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses. The molecular pathogenesis of these lesions is of interest, not only for therapeutic reasons, but also for the insight it might provide into the development of similar lesions in a sporadic setting. We used next-generation sequencing to compare the mutational profiles of lesions after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, with similar lesions arising sporadically. HRAS mutations were common among the BRAF inhibitor-induced lesions, being identified in 56%, compared with 14% of lesions in the sporadic group (P = 0.002). Thus, despite similar histomorphological appearances, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be different. In addition, within the BRAF inhibitor-associated group, the lesions designated as KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses had a similar mutational profile (mutations in PIK3CA, APC, and HRAS), which was distinct to that seen in squamous cell carcinomas (FGFR3, CDKN2A, and STK11). We have previously noted histological overlap between KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses, and this finding supports the notion that they may represent morphological or temporal variants of a single lesion type.

The pharmacological, safety, and efficacy data come from the Phase I, II, and III studies of trametinib monotherapy, as well as those in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. The most common adverse effects of trametinib therapy are rash, dermatitis, diarrhea, and fatigue. The Phase III METRIC study showed significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in favor of trametinib over standard dacarbazine or paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, trametinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a single agent for the treatment of patients with V600E-mutated metastatic melanoma. Progression-free survival and response rates for trametinib monotherapy were lower than those noted with BRAF inhibitors. The second step in developing trametinib was to use the combination of trametinib with the BRAF inhibitor, eg, dabrafenib, to postpone the progression on MEK or BRAF inhibitors. The recently published data showed significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in favor of the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib over vemurafenib therapy or dabrafenib alone, with good tolerance. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma, and their use seems to be currently the best approach. While BRAF-MEK inhibition is a standard, molecular targeted therapy in BRAF-mutated melanomas, its future utility has to be established in the rapidly changing landscape of immunotherapeutics. ",

However, the majority of patients receiving BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) manifest disease progression within a year. We have recently shown that melanoma patients treated with BRAFi exhibit an increase in melanoma-associated antigens and in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in response to therapy. To characterize such a T-cell infiltrate, we analyzed the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) β chain-coding genes in tumor biopsies obtained before the initiation of BRAFi and 10-14 d later. We observed an increase in the clonality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of 8 patients receiving BRAFi, with a statistically significant 21% aggregate increase in clonality. Over 80% of individual T-cell clones detected after initiation of BRAFi treatment were new clones. Interestingly, the comparison of tumor infiltrates with clinical responses revealed that patients who had a high proportion of pre-existing dominant clones after the administration of BRAFi responded better to therapy than patients who had a low proportion of such pre-existing dominant clones following BRAFi. These data suggest that although the inhibition of BRAF in melanoma patients results in tumor infiltration by new lymphocytes, the response to treatment appears to be related to the presence of a pre-existing population of tumor-infiltrating T-cell clones.",

What is lacking is a systematic characterization of the regulatory relationships between genes whose expression is related to metastatic potential. Such a characterization would produce a molecular taxonomy for melanoma which could feasibly be used to identify epigenetic mechanisms behind changes in metastatic behaviour. To achieve this we carried out three separate DNA microarray analyses on a total of 86 cultures of melanoma. Significantly, multiple testing correction revealed that previous reports describing correlations of gene expression with activating mutations in BRAF or NRAS were incorrect and that no gene expression patterns correlate with the mutation status of these MAPK pathway components. Instead, we identified three different sample cohorts (A, B and C) and found that these cohorts represent melanoma groups of differing metastatic potential. Cohorts A and B were susceptible to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-mediated inhibition of proliferation and had low motility. Cohort C was resistant to TGFbeta and demonstrated high motility. Meta-analysis of the data against previous studies linking gene expression and phenotype confirmed that cohorts A and C represent transcription signatures of weakly and strongly metastatic melanomas, respectively. Gene expression co-regulation suggested that signalling via TGFbeta-type and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways underwent considerable change between cohorts. These results suggest a model for the transition from weakly to strongly metastatic melanomas in which TGFbeta-type signalling upregulates genes expressing vasculogenic/extracellular matrix remodelling factors and Wnt signal inhibitors, coinciding with a downregulation of genes downstream of Wnt signalling.",

Therapy resistance is explained by defects in proapoptotic signalling. Thus, efficient induction of apoptosis in tumor cells appears as predominant therapeutic goal. In apoptosis control of melanoma, the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins plays a decisive role. In particular, members of the subfamily of BH3-only proteins function as proapoptotic triggers, and mimetics of these proteins are already in clinical trials in other cancers. Recent experimental work has revealed that the effects of different treatments in melanoma are related to the activation of BH3-only proteins, and also the proapoptotic effects of BRAF inhibitors are prevented by knockdown of the BH3-only protein Bim. Thus, melanoma therapy might be critically improved by the combination of survival pathway antagonists as BRAF inhibitors with BH3 mimetics.",

We also compared them with a group of 22 spitzoid neoplasms, which were confirmed to be negative for fusions in ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, and RET. Features with the highest discriminatory value included diameter of the lesion, dermal architecture, and certain cytomorphologic features. Specifically, cases with a large diameter (≥9 mm) and wedge-shaped, plexiform dermal architecture of nests of large, spindle-shaped cells were most likely to have an ALK fusion. NTRK1-fused cases were most likely of the fusions to have Kamino bodies and were typically arranged in smaller nests with smaller predominantly spindle-shaped cells, occasionally forming rosettes. BRAF fusion cases were the only fusion subtype to have a predominance of epithelioid cells, were less organized in nests, and commonly had a sheet-like growth pattern or dysplastic Spitz architecture. BRAF fusion cases were most likely to have high-grade nuclear atypia, to be diagnosed as spitzoid melanoma, to have a positive result by melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, and to develop copy number gains in the kinase domain of the fusion protein.

Furthermore, image analysis also provided estimates of the frequency of metastasis-initiating cells (∼1/120,000 cells). Finally, we determined that the degree of pigmentation is a key feature defining cells with metastatic capability.

Identifying patients at an early tumour stage is therefore one of the most significant steps for treatment. In the last decades, molecular pathology rapidly established itself in melanoma research. We present new molecular methods, their significance and their application, especially focusing on BRAF( V600) mutation and BRAF-inhibiting tumor targeting therapy. Resistance to tumor targeting therapies and cell line experiments, which have evidenced a sub population with stem cell properties, illustrate melanoma heterogeneity.

Inhibitor of Rb-Raf-1 interaction RRD-251 was tested against the melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-5, and SK-MEL-2. RRD-251 was found to be a potent inhibitor of melanoma cell proliferation, irrespective of V600E B-Raf mutation status of the cell lines. In a SK-MEL-28 xenograft experiment, RRD-251 exerted a significant suppression of tumor growth compared with vehicle (P = 0.003). Similar to in vitro effects, tumors from RRD-251-treated animals showed decreased Rb-Raf-1 interaction in vivo. Growth suppressive effects of RRD-251 were associated with induction of apoptosis as well as a G(1) arrest, with an accompanying decrease in S-phase cells. RRD-251 inhibited Rb phosphorylation and downregulated E2F1 protein levels in these cells. Real-time PCR analysis showed that RRD-251 caused downregulation of cell-cycle regulatory genes thymidylate synthase (TS) and cdc6 as well as the antiapoptotic gene Mcl-1. Combinatorial treatment of RRD-251 and DTIC resulted in a significantly higher apoptosis in DTIC resistant cell lines SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-5, as revealed by increased caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. Because aberrant Rb/E2F pathway is associated with melanoma progression and resistance to apoptosis, these results suggest that the Rb-Raf-1 inhibitor could be an effective agent for melanoma treatment, either alone or in combination with DTIC.",

The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622.;97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%).;Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic and expression alterations of CCND1 with a focus on primary cutaneous melanomas, to define BRAF and NRAS mutation status, and correlate the data with clinical-pathological parameters. CCND1 amplification was associated with ulceration and the localization of the metastasis. After correction for the mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes, CCND1 amplification in samples without such mutations was associated with ulceration and sun exposure. The cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and was correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes. Primary melanomas with BRAF(V600) or NRAS(Q61 ) mutations exhibited lower CCND1 mRNA level. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation, and shorter survival time. These observations suggest that CCND1 alterations are linked to melanoma progression and are modified by BRAF and NRAS mutations. Our data show that CCND1 amplification could have a prognostic relevance in cutaneous melanoma and highlight that altered CCND1 gene expression may influence the metastatic progression, survival, and the localization of metastases.",

We first show that low expression of miR-579-3p is a negative prognostic factor correlating with poor survival. Expression levels of miR-579-3p decrease from nevi to stage III/IV melanoma samples and even further in cell lines resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-579-3p acts as an oncosuppressor by targeting the 3'UTR of two oncoproteins: BRAF and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2. Moreover miR-579-3p ectopic expression impairs the establishment of drug resistance in human melanoma cells. Finally, miR-579-3p is strongly down-regulated in matched tumor samples from patients before and after the development of resistance to targeted therapies. ",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective novel therapies. Molecularly targeted treatments have demonstrated efficacy in certain cancers e.g. in HER2- positive breast cancer and in chronic myeloid leukaemia. Several pathways are currently being investigated as potential molecular targets in melanoma. The best studied is BRAF which is frequently mutated in melanoma. A multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, which targets BRAF, has shown promising activity in preclinical studies and is currently being tested in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic disease. In addition to BRAF, therapies which target other components of the Raf/Ras/MAPK pathway are being investigated. Other novel targets currently being investigated include the PI3/AKT pathway, tyrosine kinases, angiogenesis, poly (ADP ribose) polymerases, survivin and heat shock protein 90.

Here, we identified and characterized the small molecule SBI-0640756 (SBI-756), a first-in-class inhibitor that targets eIF4G1 and disrupts the eIF4F complex. SBI-756 impaired the eIF4F complex assembly independently of mTOR and attenuated growth of BRAF-resistant and BRAF-independent melanomas. SBI-756 also suppressed AKT and NF-κB signaling, but small-molecule derivatives were identified that only marginally affected these pathways while still inhibiting eIF4F complex formation and melanoma growth, illustrating the potential for further structural and functional manipulation of SBI-756 as a drug lead. In the gene expression signature patterns elicited by SBI-756, DNA damage, and cell-cycle regulatory factors were prominent, with mutations in melanoma cells affecting these pathways conferring drug resistance. SBI-756 inhibited the growth of NRAS, BRAF, and NF1-mutant melanomas in vitro and delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of Nras/Ink4a melanomas in vivo. Furthermore, combining SBI-756 and a BRAFi attenuated the formation of BRAFi-resistant human tumors.

Global miRNA expression profiles of a set of melanoma lymph node metastases, melanoma cell lines, and melanocyte cultures were determined using Agilent array. Deregulated miRNAs were evaluated in relation with clinical characteristics, patient survival, and mutational status for BRAF and NRAS. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed between melanocytes and melanomas as well as melanoma cell lines. In melanomas, miR-193a, miR-338, and miR-565 were underexpressed in cases with a BRAF mutation. Furthermore, low expression of miR-191 and high expression of miR-193b were associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. In conclusion, our findings show miRNA dysregulation in malignant melanoma and its relation to established molecular backgrounds of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations.

Clinical trial registries and meeting abstracts were used to obtain information regarding ongoing trials. All peer-reviewed articles containing information regarding the clinical safety and efficacy of vemurafenib were evaluated for inclusion.;Before the recent approval (March 2011) of ipilimumab, there was no first-line standard-of-care therapy, with proven overall survival benefit, for the treatment of malignant metastatic melanoma. Unlike ipilimumab, which acts through immune-modulation, vemurafenib is a novel, molecularly targeted therapeutic with preferential efficacy toward a specific mutated oncogenic BRAF-signaling mediator. In recently published results of a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing dacarbazine with vemurafenib, vemurafenib prolonged progression-free and overall survival, with confirmed objective response rate of 48% (95% CI 42 to 55) versus 5% (95% CI 3 to 9) for patients who received dacarbazine (p < 0.001).;Vemurafenib offers a novel, first-line, personalized therapy for patients who have mutated BRAF. Clinical trials of vemurafenib in combination with ipilimumab or other targeted or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents may provide more effective regimens with long-term clinical benefit.",

However, little is known about the expression of various HDACs and their associations with BRAF/NRAS mutation status, clinicopathologic characteristics, and patient outcome. The present study extensively profiled HDAC class 1 and their targets/regulators utilizing immunohistochemistry in human melanoma samples from patients with stage IV melanoma, known BRAF/NRAS mutational status, and detailed clinicopatholgical data. HDAC8 was increased in BRAF-mutated melanoma (P=0.016), however, no association between expression of other HDACs and NRAS/BRAF status was identified. There was also a correlation between HDAC1, HDAC8 expression, and phosphorylated NFκb p65 immunoreactivity (P<0.001). Increased cytoplasmic HDAC8 immunoreactivity was independently associated with an improved survival from both diagnosis of primary melanoma and from first detection of stage IV disease to melanoma death on multivariate analysis (HR 0.992, 95% CI 0.987-0.996; P<0.001 and HR 0.993, 95% CI 0.988-0.998; P=0.009, respectively). These results suggest not only that HDAC8 may be a prognostic biomarker in melanoma, but also provide important data regarding the regulation of HDACs in melanoma and a rational basis for targeting them therapeutically.

Transient partial response was obtained, which was followed by further disease progression. Then retreatment with vemurafenib was applied. The patient developed very short-term tumor regression and significant biochemical response (serum lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) to the treatment.

Here, we evaluate BI-847325, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases, in treatment-naïve and drug-resistant BRAF-mutant melanoma models. BI-847325 potently inhibited growth and survival of melanoma cell lines that were both BRAF inhibitor naïve and resistant in 2D culture, 3D cell culture conditions, and in colony formation assays. Western blot studies showed BI-847325 to reduce expression of phospho-ERK and phospho-histone 3 in multiple models of vemurafenib resistance. Mechanistically, BI-847325 decreased the expression of MEK and Mcl-1 while increasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein BIM. Strong suppression of MEK expression was observed after 48 hours of treatment, with no recovery following >72 hours of washout. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mcl-1 enhanced the effects of BI-847325, whereas Mcl-1 overexpression reversed this in both 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid melanoma models. In vivo, once weekly BI-847325 (70 mg/kg) led to durable regression of BRAF-inhibitor naïve xenografts with no regrowth seen (>65 days of treatment). In contrast, treatment with the vemurafenib analog PLX4720 was associated with tumor relapse at >30 days. BI-847325 also suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired PLX4720 resistance. Analysis of tumor samples revealed BI-847325 to induce apoptosis associated with suppression of phospho-ERK, total MEK, phospho-Histone3, and Mcl-1 expression. Our studies indicate that BI-847325 is effective in overcoming BRAF inhibitor resistance and has long-term inhibitory effects upon BRAF-mutant melanoma in vivo, through a mechanism associated with the decreased expression of both MEK and Mcl-1.",

The effects of BRAFi on melanoma cell proliferation and survival have been extensively studied, and several mechanisms involved in acquired resistance to the growth suppressive activity of these drugs have been identified. Much less is known about the impact of BRAFi, and in particular of dabrafenib, on the invasive potential of melanoma cells. In the present study, the BRAF-mutant human melanoma cell line A375 and its dabrafenib-resistant subline A375R were analyzed for invasive capacity, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, and secretion of VEGF-A and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, under basal conditions or in response to dabrafenib. The consequences of inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway on A375R cell responses to dabrafenib were also evaluated. We found that A375R cells were more invasive and secreted higher levels of VEGF-A and MMP-9 as compared with A375 cells. Dabrafenib reduced invasiveness, VEGFR-2 expression and VEGF-A secretion in A375 cells, whereas it increased invasiveness, VEGF-A and MMP-9 release in A375R cells. In these latter cells, the stimulating effects of dabrafenib on the invasive capacity were markedly impaired by the anti-VEGF‑A antibody bevacizumab, or by AKT1 silencing. A375R cells were not cross-resistant to the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458A. Moreover, this inhibitor given in combination with dabrafenib efficiently counteracted the stimulating effects of the BRAFi on invasiveness and VEGF-A and MMP-9 secretion. Our data demonstrate that melanoma cells with acquired resistance to dabrafenib possess a more invasive phenotype which is further stimulated by exposure to the drug. Substantial evidence indicates that continuing BRAFi therapy beyond progression produces a clinical benefit. Our results suggest that after the development of resistance, a regimen combining BRAFi with bevacizumab or with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway might be more effective than BRAFi monotherapy.

In addition, it is now accepted that cancers can arise from and be maintained by the cancer stem cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC), commonly expanded in vitro as tumorspheres from several solid tumors, including melanoma (melanospheres). Here, we investigated the potential targeting of MEK pathway by exploiting highly reliable in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical models of melanomas based on melanospheres, as melanoma initiating cells (MIC) surrogates.

Currently, limited data exist on the sequencing of these agents in patients with the BRAFV600 mutation. The aim of this analysis was to identify factors that could potentially be used to optimise the order in which ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors are administered in this patient population.;This was a retrospective, single-institution, analysis of patients treated with vemurafenib 960 mg or dabrafenib 150 mg twice-daily and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses as part of a clinical trial or expanded access program. Eligible patients tested positive for the BRAFV600 mutation and had sequentially received treatment with vemurafenib or dabrafenib followed by ipilimumab, or vice versa.;In total, 34 BRAF-mutation positive patients were eligible, comprising six patients who received ipilimumab followed by a BRAF inhibitor, and 28 patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor who subsequently received ipilimumab. Of these 28 patients, 12 (43%) had rapid disease progression resulting in death and were unable to complete ipilimumab treatment as per protocol. These patients were classified as having rapid disease progression. Median overall survival for rapid progressors was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.0-6.3), compared with 18.6 months (95% CI: 3.2-41.3; p < 0.0001) for those patients who were able to complete ipilimumab treatment. Baseline factors associated with rapid progression were elevated lactate dehydrogenase, a performance status of 1 and the presence of brain metastases. Patients were more likely to have rapid disease progression if they had at least two of these risk factors at baseline.;Our analysis suggests it may be possible to identify those patients at high risk of rapid disease progression upon relapse with a BRAF inhibitor who might not have time to subsequently complete ipilimumab treatment.

In both BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma cells, MEK inhibition increased MITF expression, which in turn elevated levels of PGC1α. In contrast, mTORC1/2 inhibition triggered cytoplasmic localization of MITF, decreasing PGC1α expression and inhibiting OxPhos. Analysis of tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma progressing on BRAF inhibitor ± MEK inhibitor revealed that PGC1α levels were elevated in approximately half of the resistant tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Sunlight is the main environmental cause of most cutaneous melanomas. Exposure to intense bursts of ultraviolet radiation, especially in childhood, starts the transformation of benign melanocytes into a malignant phenotype. Paradoxically, outdoor workers have a decreased risk of melanoma compared with indoor workers, suggesting that chronic sunlight exposure can have a protective effect. Further, some melanomas form on sun-exposed regions; others do not. Although some melanomas arise from pre-existing melanocytic naevi (moles), many arise de novo. These observations suggest that melanoma arises from multiple pathways, with initiating and promoting factors differing for each.;Janet Maldonado and colleagues recently studied the distribution of BRAF gene mutations in 115 patients with invasive primary melanomas (J Natl Cancer Inst 2003; 95: 1878-80). These researchers found that BRAF mutations were statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on intermittently sun-exposed skin than elsewhere. By contrast, BRAF mutations in melanomas on chronically sun-damaged skin were rare. These findings strongly suggest that distinct genetic pathways lead to melanoma. WHERE NEXT? The study of gene-environment interactions is clearly the next arena for epidemiological research into melanoma. The recent identification of polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1 receptor could open up an avenue of investigation into a molecular distinction between those individuals whose melanomas arise on chronic sun-exposed skin from those in whom tumours will develop on sun-protected skin or from melanocytic naevi. If a dual pathway for melanoma is supported by other investigations, public-health messages can be tailored to the population at risk.",

Each new lesion was photographed, a clinical diagnosis recorded and, where appropriate, a biopsy taken. Human papillomavirus (HPV) and p16 immunohistochemistry analyses were performed.;The most frequently observed lesions were verrucal keratotic squamoproliferative lesions (49%), Grover's disease (27%) and reactive hyperkeratotic lesions on the soles, at points of friction (22%). Eighteen squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) occurred in 20% of patients. Most SCCs appeared between weeks 6 and 24 following commencement of therapy on both sun-damaged and nonsun-damaged skin. All SCCs were well differentiated, five were of the keratoacanthoma type, and two were SCC in situ. Other lesions observed included seborrhoeic keratoses, epidermal cysts, acneiform eruptions, hair loss and changes in hair structure. HPV was negative in 15 of the 16 tissues studied and p16 expression was higher in SCCs compared with verrucal keratoses.;Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy. Highly oncogenic HPV infection is unlikely to be a contributor to the formation of SCCs or verrucal keratoses.",

Along with some benign melanocytic tumors, the majority shows BRAF or NRAS mutation, but it is not known whether these are essential to all forms of melanocytic neoplasia. We screened 79 melanocytic tumors of different types for BRAF and NRAS mutations and looked at MAPK pathway activity using immunohistochemistry in a subset. Significant differences in BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency were found: 14/16 (87.5%) in common acquired naevi (CANs), 9/12 (75%) in CMs, 0/26 in Spitz naevi and 3/25 (12%) in blue naevi (p < 0.01). We looked at whether Spitz and blue naevi showed a compensatory increase in BRAF exon 11 and/or NRAS exons 1 and 2 mutations to account for the low BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency. NRAS mutations were found in only 1/16 (6.3%) Spitz naevi and 0/15 blue naevi. In addition, NRAS mutations were found in 2/11 (18.2%) CANs and 3/12 (25%) CMs. None of the tumors showed BRAF exon 11 mutations. Despite their low combined BRAF and NRAS mutation frequency, Spitz naevi showed strong MAPK pathway activation as measured by cytoplasmic expression of dually phosphorylated ERK1/2, while blue naevi had weak pathway activation. We conclude that BRAF and NRAS mutations are not necessary for melanocytic tumor development and that some types of tumor must arise by alternative mechanisms.",

We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable solid tumours, especially those with melanoma and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases.;We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321.;We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response.

The recent identification of causative genetic alterations has revealed mutations in signaling pathways that offer targets for therapy. Identifying morphologic surrogates that can identify patients whose tumors express such alterations (or functionally equivalent alterations) would be clinically useful for therapy stratification and for retrospective analysis of clinical trial data.;We defined and assessed a panel of histomorphologic measures and correlated them with the mutation status of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS in a cohort of 302 archival tissues of primary cutaneous melanomas from an academic comprehensive cancer center. Melanomas with BRAF mutations showed distinct morphological features such as increased upward migration and nest formation of intraepidermal melanocytes, thickening of the involved epidermis, and sharper demarcation to the surrounding skin; and they had larger, rounder, and more pigmented tumor cells (all p-values below 0.0001). By contrast, melanomas with NRAS mutations could not be distinguished based on these morphological features. Using simple combinations of features, BRAF mutation status could be predicted with up to 90.8% accuracy in the entire cohort as well as within the categories of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Among the variables routinely recorded in cancer registries, we identified age < 55 y as the single most predictive factor of BRAF mutation in our cohort. Using age < 55 y as a surrogate for BRAF mutation in an independent cohort of 4,785 patients of the Southern German Tumor Registry, we found a significant survival benefit (p < 0.0001) for patients who, based on their age, were predicted to have BRAF mutant melanomas in 69% of the cases. This group also showed a different pattern of metastasis, more frequently involving regional lymph nodes, compared to the patients predicted to have no BRAF mutation and who more frequently displayed satellite, in-transit metastasis, and visceral metastasis (p < 0.0001).;Refined morphological classification of primary melanomas can be used to improve existing melanoma classifications by forming subgroups that are genetically more homogeneous and likely to differ in important clinical variables such as outcome and pattern of metastasis.

Biologic and initial preclinical data support their integration with innovative molecular targeted therapies, opening enormous perspectives for researchers in the effort of finding a definitive cure. Main open challenges are the definition of reliable research models, assessment of effective schedules, safety issues and designing of personalized approaches.",

We report a high prevalence of BRAF(V599E) mutation in sporadic PTC and in PTC-derived cell lines. The BRAF(V599E) mutation was detected in 23 of 50 PTC (46%) and in three of four PTC-derived cell lines. The prevalence of the BRAF(V599E) mutation in PTC is the highest reported to date in human carcinomas, being only exceeded by melanoma. PTC with RET/PTC rearrangement as well as the TPC-1 cell line (the only one harboring RET/PTC rearrangement) did not show the BRAF(V599E) mutation. BRAF(V599E) mutation was not detected in any of 23 nodular goiters, 51 follicular adenomas and 18 follicular carcinomas. A distinct mutation in BRAF (codon K600E) was detected in a follicular adenoma. Activating mutations in RAS genes were detected in 15% of FA, 33% of FTC and 7% of PTC. BRAF(V599E) mutation did not coexist with alterations in any of the RAS genes in any of the tumors. These results suggest that BRAF(V599E) mutation is frequent in the etiopathogenesis of PTC. The BRAF(V599E) mutation appears to be an alternative event to RET/PTC rearrangement rather than to RAS mutations, which are rare in PTC. BRAF(V599E) may represent an alternative pathway to oncogenic MAPK activation in PTCs without RET/PTC activation.",

In all, 62 archival biliary tract cancers, including 15 gallbladder cancers, 15 extrahepatic, and 10 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas from the United States, and 22 gallbladder carcinomas from Chile were analyzed for the V599E mutation of the BRAF gene using three distinct methods: direct sequencing, a primer extension method (Mutector assay), and the highly sensitive quantitative Gap Ligase Chain Reaction.

The V599E somatic mutation of the BRAF gene is absent in biliary tract cancers, at least in the two geographic populations (United States and Chile) examined.

Rational drug combinations may improve outcomes in this setting. We assessed the therapeutic combination of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) with small-molecule inhibitors of the MAP kinase signaling pathway in melanoma. Cell lines and tumor models containing either mutant BRAF or NRAS, or wild-type for both, were exposed to small-molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK. Expression of EDNRB was analyzed and the therapeutic impact of combining the anti-EDNRB ADC with the BRAF and MEK inhibitors was assessed. Increased expression of EDNRB in response to inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK was observed and augmented the antitumor activity of the ADC. Enhanced target expression and ADC antitumor activity were realized irrespective of the response of the tumor model to the BRAF or MEK inhibitors alone and could be achieved in melanoma with mutant NRAS, BRAF, or neither mutation. Cells that acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition through long-term culture retained drug-induced elevated levels of EDNRB expression. Expression of EDNRB was not enhanced in normal human melanocytes by inhibition of BRAF and the combination of the ADC with MAPK inhibitors was well-tolerated in mice. The anti-EDNRB ADC combines well with BRAF and MEK inhibitors and could have therapeutic use in the majority of human melanoma cases.",

Major melanoma genes, including BRAF, NRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, CTNNB1, CDK4 and PTEN, were examined for mutations. Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13, 10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes 1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain.

However, molecular mechanisms of regulation of MAP2 gene expression in melanoma are not understood. Here, we show that in melanoma cells MAP2 expression is induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-cytidine, and MAP2 promoter is progressively methylated during melanoma progression, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in silencing of MAP2 in melanoma. In support of this, methylation of MAP2 promoter DNA in vitro inhibits its activity. Because MAP2 promoter activity levels in melanoma cell lines also correlated with activating mutation in BRAF, a gene that is highly expressed in neurons, we hypothesized that BRAF signaling is involved in MAP2 expression. We show that hyperactivation of BRAF-MEK signaling activates MAP2 expression in melanoma cells by two independent mechanisms, promoter demethylation or down-regulation of neuronal transcription repressor HES1.

In this study, the authors tested the prognostic significance and clinicopathologic correlations of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations in patients with metastatic melanoma.;Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively on melanoma patients who were clinically tested for BRAF (exon 15) and NRAS (exons 1 and 2) mutations at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Analyses were performed to identify significant associations of mutations with tumor and patient characteristics and with survival from the diagnosis of stage IV disease.;The genotypes of the full cohort (n = 677) were 47% BRAF mutation, 20% NRAS mutation, and 32% wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (\"WT\"). Tumor mutation status was associated (P = .008) with the risk of central nervous system involvement at the diagnosis of stage IV disease, with a higher prevalence observed in BRAF-mutant (24%) and NRAS-mutant (23%) patients than in WT patients (12%). Among patients with nonuveal melanoma who underwent mutation testing within 6 months of stage IV diagnosis (n = 313), patients with NRAS mutations had a median survival of 8.2 months from stage IV diagnosis, which was shorter than the median survival of WT patients (15.1 months; P = .004). Multivariate analysis of this population incorporating age, sex, metastases (M1) category, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and mutation status confirmed that NRAS mutations are associated independently with decreased overall survival (vs WT; P = .005; hazard ratio, 2.05).;Patients with BRAF or NRAS mutations were more likely than WT patients to have central nervous system involvement at the time they were diagnosed with distant metastatic disease.

We developed a permutation-based framework to address this challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis. Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2), three of which-RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19-harbored recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy.

By direct sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis, we identified BRAF and NRAS mutations in 51.6% and 12.9% of malignant melanoma cases, respectively, while none of clear cell sarcoma harbored BRAF or NRAS mutations.

No fusion transcript could be detected in any of the malignant melanoma cases. Additionally, immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of clear cell sarcoma and malignant melanoma had insulin-like growth factor 2 and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 expression; however the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1R was significantly higher in clear cell sarcoma compared to melanoma (p = .006).

To date, role of autophagy during BRAF inhibition in thyroid cancer remains unknown.;In this study, we investigate if autophagy is activated in vemurafenib treated BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells, and whether autophagy inhibition improves or impairs the treatment efficacy of vemurafenib.;Autophagy level was determined by western blot assay and transmission electron microscopy. The combined effects of autophagy inhibitor and vemurafenib were assessed in terms of cell viability in vitro and tumor growth rate in vivo. Whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was in response to vemurafenib-induced autophagy was also analyzed.;Vemurafenib induced a high level of autophagy in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy by either a pharmacological inhibitor or interfering RNA knockdown of essential autophagy genes augmented vemurafenib-induced cell death. Vemurafenib-induced autophagy was independent of MAPK signaling pathway and was mediated through the ER stress response. Finally, administration of vemurafenib with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine promoted more pronounced tumor suppression in vivo.;Our data demonstrate that vemurafenib induces ER stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib.",

The authors investigated the role of these pathways in uveal melanoma cells.;The effects of PI3K and mTOR activation and inhibition on the proliferation of human uveal melanoma cell lines expressing either activated (WT)B-Raf or (V600E)B-Raf were investigated. Interactions among PI3K, mTOR, and B-Raf/ERK were studied.;Inhibition of PI3K deactivated P70S6 kinase, reduced cell proliferation by 71% to 84%, and increased apoptosis by a factor of 5.0 to 8.4 without reducing ERK1/2 activation, indicating that ERK plays no role in mediating PI3K in these processes. In contrast, rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR did not significantly affect cell proliferation because it simultaneously stimulated PI3K/Akt activation and cyclin D1 expression. Regardless of B-Raf mutation status, cotreatment with the PI3K inhibitor effectively sensitized all melanoma cell lines to the B-Raf or ERK1/2 inhibition-induced reduction of cell proliferation. B-Raf/ERK and PI3K signaling, but not mTOR signaling, converged to control cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, p70S6K required the activation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that PI3K/Akt and mTOR/P70S6K interact with B-Raf/ERK.;Activated PI3K/Akt attenuates the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on cell proliferation and thus serves as a negative feedback mechanism.

        "Doc_abstract":"The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

In BRAF V600-mutant melanomas, the expression of EGFR has been associated with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In this study, we assessed EGFR expression and downstream signaling activity in a panel of melanoma cell lines and we investigated the effects of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on expression of EGFR and its downstream effectors in a subgroup of BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. Three out of 10 melanoma cell lines expressed EGFR. Downstream signaling via ERK and AKT was responsive to either stimulation by EGF or inhibition by erlotinib. Constitutive activation of ERK occurred in all the cell lines investigated whereas constitutive activation of AKT only in three cell lines. Constitutive activation of ERK and AKT was independent from EGFR expression. Vemurafenib did not affect EGFR expression in general, but it increased EGFR phosphorylation in the cell line SkMel5. Induced EGFR phosphorylation was sensitive to treatment with erlotinib. Vemurafenib efficiently blocked ERK activation in all the BRAF-mutant cell lines tested, whereas its effects on AKT activation were dissimilar in the different cell lines. Our data suggest that EGFR is functional but usually inactive in EGFR high-expressing cell lines. Basal EGFR expression unlikely represents a biomarker for predicting the sensitivity to vemurafenib in melanoma, but EGFR activation might represent a mechanism of vemurafenib resistance in a subset of melanoma cells.

Skin toxicities including squamous cell carcinoma, are the most severe adverse events. Another BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, and a MEK inhibitor, trametinib, have shown excellent efficacy in clinical studies. Melanoma also has high immunogenicity, and cytokines or cell immunotherapy have shown some efficacy. Recently, the importance of immune checkpoints which adjust T-cell activation, such as the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), -B7 or the programmed cell death protein-1(PD1)-PD1 ligand(PDL1), have been clarified. Targeting those immune checkpoints is expected to be effective for enhancing tumor immunity. CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab has been reported to improve overall survival in two phase III studies. Major adverse events were autoimmune response such as colitis, eruption, liver dysfunction and endocrineopathies.

A separate set of nevi that displayed histological features frequently found in nevi present at birth (\"congenital pattern nevi\") but lacked a definitive history of presence at birth showed an inverse mutation pattern with common BRAF mutations (20/28 or 71%) and less frequent NRAS mutations (7/28 or 25%). Thus, nevi that develop in utero are genetically distinct from those that develop later, and histopathologic criteria alone are unable to reliably distinguish the two groups.

In this case report, we describe alterations of tumor morphology and patterns of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) expression in a patient who received GSK2118436, a second-generation RAF inhibitor, for stage IV (M1c) metastatic melanoma. To explore the effects of GSK2118436 on the expression patterns of CDKI (p16, p21, p27, p57), we immunohistochemically evaluated in vivo melanoma cells pre- and posttreated with GSK2118436. After GSK2118436 treatment, the melanoma cells decreased in size and demonstrated hyperchromatic nuclei and indistinct nucleoli. p16 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of pretreated melanoma cells and in the nucleus and cytoplasm in posttreated melanoma cells. Expression of both p27 (nucleus) and p57 (cytoplasm) was increased in posttreated melanoma cells and no significant difference in p21 expression was noted in either pre- or posttreated tumor cells. These findings may help explain the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells retain the ability to proliferate. The persistent activation of pro-oncogenic activities of CDKI (eg, p27 and p57) and/or compartmentalization of p16 in cytoplasm or nucleus may allow tumor cells to bypass BRAF-induced senescence mechanisms. Furthermore, awareness of changes in tumor morphology after treatment with RAF inhibitors may be helpful in histologic evaluation of the spectrum of dermatologic toxicity, which may occur on targeted therapy.",

The MAPK pathways play critical roles in a wide variety of cancer types, from hematologic malignancies to solid tumors. Aberrations include altered expression levels and activation states of pathway components, which can sometimes be attributable to mutations in individual members. The V600E mutation of BRAF was initially described in 2002 and has been found at particularly high frequency in melanoma and certain subtypes of colorectal cancer. In the relatively short time since this discovery, a family of drugs has been developed that specifically target this mutated BRAF isoform, which, after results from phase I/II and III clinical trials, was granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in August 2011. Although these drugs produce clinically meaningful increases in progression-free and overall survival, due to acquired resistance they have not improved mortality rates. New drugs targeting other members of the MAPK pathways are in clinical trials or advanced stages of development. It is hoped that combination therapies of these new drugs in conjunction with BRAF inhibitors will counteract the mechanisms of resistance and provide cures. The clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing is leading to a greater understanding of the genetic architecture of tumors, along with acquired mechanisms of drug resistance, which will guide the development of tumor-specific inhibitors and combination therapies in the future.",

Genomic DNA for genotyping was isolated from 6 regular Spitz nevi and 14 atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations (including 1 melanoma with spitzoid histomorphology). NRAS1, NRAS2 and KRAS were analyzed, in addition to BRAFV600E. A mutation in BRAFV600E was noted in only one case-that of a regular Spitz nevus. IGFBP7 expression appeared to be maintained in this case, but was absent in 7/17 cases, which included 5 atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations. Lack of expression of IGFBP7 in atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations with histologically concerning features but BRAF-WT indicates that the evolutionary path in atypical spitzoid nevomelanocytic proliferations is genetically distinct from that of IGFBP7-negative BRAF-positive melanoma.

Malignant melanoma is a dreadful cancer type that has been associated with the rapid dissemination of primary tumors to multiple sites, including bone, brain, liver and lungs. The discovery that approximately 40%-50% of malignant melanomas contain a mutation in BRAF at codon 600 gave scientists a new approach to tackle this disease. However, clinical studies on patients have shown that although BRAFi (BRAF inhibitors) trigger early anti-tumor responses, the majority of patients later develop resistance to the therapy. Recent studies have shown that WNT5A plays a key role in enhancing the resistance of melanoma cells to BRAFi. The focus of the current review will be on melanoma development, signaling pathways important to acquired resistance to BRAFi, and why WNT5A inhibitors are attractive candidates to be included in combinatorial therapies for melanoma.

In normal cells, the activity of BRaf is tightly regulated. Gain-of-function mutations like those identified in melanoma frequently lead to enhanced cell-survival and unrestrained growth. The activating mutation of BRaf will also induce the cells to senesce. However, the mechanism by which the oncogenic BRaf induces the senescent barrier remains poorly defined. microRNAs have regulatory functions toward the expression of genes that are important in carcinogenesis. Here we show that expression of several microRNAs is altered when the oncogenic version of BRaf is introduced in cultured primary melanocytes and these cells undergo premature cellular senescence. These include eight microRNAs whose expression rates are significantly stimulated and three that are repressed. While most of the induced microRNAs have documented negative effects on cell cycle progression, one of the repressed microRNAs has proven oncogenic functions. Ectopic expression of some of these induced microRNAs increased the expression of senescence markers and induced growth arrest and senescence in primary melanocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that the change in microRNA expression rates may play a vital role in senescence induced by the oncogenic BRaf.",

Targeting just a few out of several potential mutations, BRAF-Inhibitors such as PLX 4032 achieved already tremendous results in the therapy of metastatic melanoma. Up to now, the correlation of clinical, histomorphologic, and genetic features is, however, not understood. Even more, is it not well known precisely what kind of molecular changes predispose the primary melanoma for metastasis. The identification of morphological surrogates and prognostic parameters in tumors with such genetic alteration seems therefore crucial when differentiating and classifying this heterogeneous tumor entity in more detail and thus facilitates the stratification of prognosis as well as therapy.

Despite these advances, resistance remains an issue, as illustrated recently by the clinical experience with vemurafenib. Such acquired resistance appears to be the result of parallel pathway activation, such as PI3K, to overcome single-agent inhibition. In this report, we describe the cytotoxicity and anti-tumour activity of the novel MEK inhibitor, E6201, in a broad panel of melanoma cell lines (n = 31) of known mutational profile in vitro and in vivo. We further test the effectiveness of combining E6201 with an inhibitor of PI3K (LY294002) in overcoming resistance in these cell lines.;The majority of melanoma cell lines were either sensitive (IC50 < 500 nM, 24/31) or hypersensitive (IC50 < 100 nM, 18/31) to E6201. This sensitivity correlated with wildtype PTEN and mutant BRAF status, whereas mutant RAS and PI3K pathway activation were associated with resistance. Although MEK inhibitors predominantly exert a cytostatic effect, E6201 elicited a potent cytocidal effect on most of the sensitive lines studied, as evidenced by Annexin positivity and cell death ELISA. Conversely, E6201 did not induce cell death in the two resistant melanoma cell lines tested. E6201 inhibited xenograft tumour growth in all four melanoma cell lines studied to varying degrees, but a more pronounced anti-tumour effect was observed for cell lines that previously demonstrated a cytocidal response in vitro. In vitro combination studies of E6201 and LY294002 showed synergism in all six melanoma cell lines tested, as defined by a mean combination index < 1.;Our data demonstrate that E6201 elicits a predominantly cytocidal effect in vitro and in vivo in melanoma cells of diverse mutational background. Resistance to E6201 was associated with disruption of PTEN and activation of downstream PI3K signalling. In keeping with these data we demonstrate that co-inhibition of MAPK and PI3K is effective in overcoming resistance inherent in melanoma.",

Cells attached to microcarrier beads were perfused with 26 mm [1,6-(13)C2]glucose under normoxic conditions at 37 °C and monitored by (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Excellent agreement between model-predicted and experimentally measured values of the rates of oxygen and glucose consumption, lactate production, and glutamate pool size validated the model. ATP production by glycolytic and oxidative metabolism were compared under hyperglycemic normoxic conditions; 51% of the energy came from oxidative phosphorylation and 49% came from glycolysis. Even though the rate of glutamine uptake was ∼ 50% of the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, the rate of ATP production from glutamine was essentially zero (no glutaminolysis). De novo fatty acid production was ∼ 6% of the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux was 3.6% of glycolysis, and three non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway exchange fluxes were calculated. Mass spectrometry was then used to compare fluxes through various pathways under hyperglycemic (26 mm) and euglycemic (5 mm) conditions. Under euglycemic conditions glutamine uptake doubled, but ATP production from glutamine did not significantly change.

Of the 160 inhibitors tested, 20 achieved >50% growth inhibition in both cell lines. Six of the 20 were cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, including two CDK4 inhibitors. Fascaplysin, a synthetic CDK4 inhibitor, was further tested in 8 melanoma cell lines. The concentration of fascaplysin required to inhibit growth by 50% (IC50 value) ranged from 0.03 to 0.22 µM. Fascaplysin also inhibited clonogenic growth and induced apoptosis. Sensitivity to PD0332991, a therapeutic CDK4/6 inhibitor was also evaluated in the melanoma cell lines. PD0332991 IC50 values ranged from 0.13 to 2.29 µM. Similar to fascaplysin, PD0332991 inhibited clonogenic growth of melanoma cells and induced apoptosis. Higher levels of CDK4 protein correlated with lower sensitivity to PD0332991 in the cell lines. Combined treatment with PD0332991 and the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032, showed additive anti-proliferative effects in the BRAF mutant cell line Malme-3M.

However, most patients treated with vemurafenib eventually develop resistance largely due to reactivation of MAPK signaling. Inhibitors of MAPK signaling, including MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib, failed to show significant clinical benefit in patients with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Here, we describe that cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib show reactivation of MAPK signaling and upregulation of cyclin D1 and are sensitive to inhibition of LY2835219, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6. LY2835219 was demonstrated to inhibit growth of melanoma A375 tumor xenografts and delay tumor recurrence in combination with vemurafenib. Furthermore, we developed an in vivo vemurafenib-resistant model by continuous administration of vemurafenib in A375 xenografts. Consistently, we found that MAPK is reactivated and cyclin D1 is elevated in vemurafenib-resistant tumors, as well as in the resistant cell lines derived from these tumors. Importantly, LY2835219 exhibited tumor growth regression in a vemurafenib-resistant model. Mechanistic analysis revealed that LY2835219 induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner in vemurafenib-resistant cells whereas it primarily mediated cell-cycle G1 arrest in the parental cells. Similarly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 induced significantly higher rate of apoptosis in the resistant cells than in parental cells, suggesting that elevated cyclin D1 activity is important for the survival of vemurafenib-resistant cells. Altogether, we propose that targeting cyclin D1-CDK4/6 signaling by LY2835219 is an effective strategy to overcome MAPK-mediated resistance to B-RAF inhibitors in B-RAF V600E melanoma.",

This suggests that BRAF and NRAS 'double mutants' may not provide advantage for tumour growth, or may even be selected against during tumorigenesis. However, by applying mutant-allele-specific-amplification-PCR method to short-term melanoma lines, one out of 14 tumours was found to harbour both BRAFV600E and the activating NRASQ61R mutations. On the other hand, analysis of 21 melanoma clones isolated by growth in soft agar from this tumour indicated that 16/21 clones harboured a BRAFV600E, but were wild-type for NRAS, whereas the remaining had the opposite genotype (NRASQ61R/wild-type BRAF). When compared to BRAFV600E clones, NRASQ61R clones displayed reduced growth in soft agar, but higher proliferative ability in vitro in liquid medium and even in vivo after grafting into SCID/SCID mice. These data suggest that NRAS and BRAF activating mutations can coexist in the same melanoma, but are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level. Moreover, the presence of NRASQ61R or BRAFV600E is associated with distinct in vitro and in vivo growth properties of neoplastic cells.",

Further, their association to mismatch-repair-deficient tumors has suggested the involvement of the RAS/RAF pathway in the tumorigenesis of microsatellite-unstable colon cancers, and that RAS and RAF mutations are alternative genetic events. We determined whether colorectal mismatch-repair-deficient tumors with BRAF mutations show a specific genotype when compared with tumors with wild-type BRAF, and whether they can be associated with a particular clinicopathological feature.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer of pigment-producing cells, derivates of the neural crest. Surgical resection is the most effective form of treatment during initial phases of the disease. Advanced stages are usually treated by adjuvant immunotherapy (interferon alpha) or dacarbazine + multiferon. Response and survival rates are extremely poor. The emerging approach of personalized medicine brings about significant advances in the treatment of melanoma. Apart from administration of imatinib for a small subgroup of melanomas harbouring KIT mutations, the most promising approach is the use of B-RAF kinase inhibitors. The previously tested RAF inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib) did not perform better compared to conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. However, the results are much more promising with the recently developed inhibitor PLX4032 (Plexxikon; RG7204, Roche Pharmaceuticals; vemurafenib). This inhibitor targets tumours harbouring B-RAF(V600E) of B-RAF(V600K) activating mutations, which are present in 40-70% of malignant melanomas. An absence of the above mentioned activating mutations or parallel presence of activating RAS mutations (e.g. RAS(G12D)) should be used as contraindications. The use of PLX4032 provides better outcome than any of the currently used therapies, including partial or complete response recorded in 81% of patients, and prolonged median survival. Currently, this drug is being tested in phase II and III trials. The incidence of PLX4032-related adverse effects is relatively high; acquired resistance repeatedly occurring within several months of treatment may also represent a significant problem. Combined therapy is probably needed to further increase the complete response rate and to prolong survival. This should either include some of the currently used chemotherapeutics, or alternatively it may employ inhibitors of some of the kinases capable of stimulating the MEK and ERK kinases independently of B-RAF (e.g. COT). Nevertheless, even PLX4032 monotherapy should be viewed as a significant improvement of the current state-of-the-art treatment of malignant melanoma.",

The BRAF oncogene has recently emerged as a critical regulator of this process in melanoma, bringing to the fore the importance of metabolic reprogramming in the pathogenesis and treatment of metastatic melanoma. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of oncogenic reprogramming of metabolism in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma, and highlight emerging evidence supporting a metabolic basis for MAPK pathway inhibitor resistance and metabolic vulnerabilities that may be exploited to overcome this.

Among the newly identified cancer genes was PPP6C, encoding a serine/threonine phosphatase, which harbored mutations that clustered in the active site in 12% of sun-exposed melanomas, exclusively in tumors with mutations in BRAF or NRAS. Notably, we identified a recurrent UV-signature, an activating mutation in RAC1 in 9.2% of sun-exposed melanomas. This activating mutation, the third most frequent in our cohort of sun-exposed melanoma after those of BRAF and NRAS, changes Pro29 to serine (RAC1(P29S)) in the highly conserved switch I domain. Crystal structures, and biochemical and functional studies of RAC1(P29S) showed that the alteration releases the conformational restraint conferred by the conserved proline, causes an increased binding of the protein to downstream effectors, and promotes melanocyte proliferation and migration.

Recent clinical trials of combined RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK inhibition have produced improved efficacy, but patients ultimately develop resistance. To identify molecular alterations driving clinical acquired resistance, we performed whole-exome sequencing on paired pretreatment and postprogression tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer treated with RAF inhibitor combinations. We identified alterations in MAPK pathway genes in resistant tumors not present in matched pretreatment tumors, including KRAS amplification, BRAF amplification, and a MEK1 mutation. These alterations conferred resistance to RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK combinations through sustained MAPK pathway activity, but an ERK inhibitor could suppress MAPK activity and overcome resistance. Identification of MAPK pathway reactivating alterations upon clinical acquired resistance underscores the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and suggests therapeutic options to overcome resistance.;RAF inhibitor combinations represent promising approaches in clinical development for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Initial characterization of clinical acquired resistance mechanisms to these regimens identified several MAPK pathway alterations driving resistance by reactivating MAPK signaling, highlighting the critical dependence of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers on MAPK signaling and offering potential strategies to overcome resistance.",

We have shown that wild type RASA1, but not identified mutants, suppresses soft agar colony formation and tumor growth of BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines via its RasGAP activity toward R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform. Moreover, R-Ras increased and RASA1 suppressed Ral-A activation among Ras downstream effectors. In addition to mutations, loss of RASA1 expression was frequently observed in metastatic melanoma samples on melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) and a low level of RASA1 mRNA expression was associated with decreased overall survival in melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. Thus, these data support that RASA1 is inactivated by mutation or by suppressed expression in melanoma and that RASA1 plays a tumor suppressive role by inhibiting R-Ras, a previously less appreciated member of the Ras small GTPases.

It is well established that c-Myc and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) contribute to metabolic reprogramming by driving the expression of glycolytic target genes. More recently, the c-Myc-related transcription factor MondoA has been shown to restrict glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis via its induction of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Three recent studies demonstrate that complex and cancer type-specific interactions between c-Myc, MondoA and HIF-1α underlie metabolism, tumourigenesis and drug response. In triple-negative breast cancer, c-Myc blocks MondoA-dependent activation of TXNIP to stimulate aerobic glycolysis. In contrast, in neuroblastoma, N-Myc requires MondoA for metabolic reprogramming and tumourigenesis. Finally, the therapeutic response of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells to vemurafenib requires downregulation of c-Myc and HIF-1α and upregulation of MondoA-TXNIP, and the subsequent reprogramming away from aerobic glycolysis. In this minireview we highlight the findings in these three studies and present a working model to explain why c-Myc and MondoA function cooperatively in some cancers and antagonistically in others.

The four topics discussed at this meeting were: Molecular and Immunological Advances, Combination Therapies, News in Immunotherapy, and Tumor Microenvironment and Biomarkers. Until recently systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma patients was ineffective, but recent advances in tumor biology and immunology have led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). New therapies, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors as well as other signaling pathway inhibitors, are being tested in patients with metastatic melanoma either as monotherapy or in combination, and all have yielded promising results. These include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases (BRAF, MEK, and VEGFR), the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway [PI3K, AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)], activators of apoptotic pathway, and the cell cycle inhibitors (CDK4/6). Various locoregional interventions including radiotherapy and surgery are still valid approaches in treatment of advanced melanoma that can be integrated with novel therapies. Intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance occur with targeted therapy such as BRAF inhibitors, where most responses are short-lived. Given that the reactivation of the MAPK pathway through several distinct mechanisms is responsible for the majority of acquired resistance, it is logical to combine BRAF inhibitors with inhibitors of targets downstream in the MAPK pathway. For example, combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitors (e.g., dabrafenib/trametinib) have been demonstrated to improve survival compared to monotherapy. Application of novel technologies such sequencing have proven useful as a tool for identification of MAPK pathway-alternative resistance mechanism and designing other combinatorial therapies such as those between BRAF and AKT inhibitors. Improved survival rates have also been observed with immune-targeted therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma. Immune-modulating antibodies came to the forefront with anti-CTLA-4, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway blocking antibodies that result in durable responses in a subset of melanoma patients. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with melanoma as well. These agents are being studied in combination with targeted therapies in attempt to produce longer-term responses than those more typically seen with targeted therapy. Other combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for this patient population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Both combination targeted therapy approaches and different immunotherapies were discussed. Similarly to the previous meetings, the importance of biomarkers for clinical application as markers for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into contemporary clinical management of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. ",

Primary melanocytes displayed an effective G(2) checkpoint response to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage. Thirty-seven percent of melanoma cell lines displayed a significant defect in G(2) checkpoint function. Checkpoint function was melanoma subtype-specific with \"epithelial-like\" melanoma lines, with wild type NRAS and BRAF displaying an effective checkpoint, while lines with mutant NRAS and BRAF displayed defective checkpoint function. Expression of oncogenic B-Raf in a checkpoint-effective melanoma attenuated G(2) checkpoint function significantly but modestly. Other alterations must be needed to produce the severe attenuation of G(2) checkpoint function seen in some BRAF-mutant melanoma lines. Quantitative trait analysis tools identified mRNA species whose expression was correlated with G(2) checkpoint function in the melanoma lines. A 165 gene signature was identified with a high correlation with checkpoint function (p < 0.004) and low false discovery rate (≤ 0.077). The G(2) checkpoint gene signature predicted G(2) checkpoint function with 77-94% accuracy. The signature was enriched in lysosomal genes and contained numerous genes that are associated with regulation of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression. The core machinery of the cell cycle was not altered in checkpoint-defective lines but rather numerous mediators of core machinery function were.

CD103(+) DCs were required to promote anti-tumoral effects upon blockade of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1; however, PD-L1 inhibition only led to partial responses. Systemic administration of the growth factor FLT3L followed by intratumoral poly I:C injections expanded and activated CD103(+) DC progenitors in the tumor, enhancing responses to BRAF and PD-L1 blockade and protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. Thus, the paucity of activated CD103(+) DCs in tumors limits checkpoint-blockade efficacy and combined FLT3L and poly I:C therapy can enhance tumor responses to checkpoint and BRAF blockade.",

Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor, with most patients harboring mutations in the BRAF or NRAS oncogenes, leading to the overactivation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. The current therapeutic approaches are based on therapies targeting mutated BRAF and the downstream pathway, and on monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoint blockade. However, treatment resistance and side effects are common events of these therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence supports that melanoma is a hormone-related cancer. Melanoma incidence is higher in males than in females, and females have a significant survival advantage over men. Estrogens exert their effects through estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) that affect cancer growth in an opposite way: ERα is associated with a proliferative action and ERβ with an anticancer effect. ERβ is the predominant ER in melanoma, and its expression decreases in melanoma progression, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Thus, ERβ is now considered as an effective molecular target for melanoma treatment. 17β-estradiol was reported to inhibit melanoma cells proliferation; however, clinical trials did not provide the expected survival benefits.

        "Doc_abstract":"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3)K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade. All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 5' end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF (and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers. ",

At the DNA level, this has included approaches such as comparative genomic hybridization. At the RNA level, this has consisted of gene expression profiling using various assay methodologies. In certain instances, markers identified using these platforms have been further examined and developed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. In this article, we will review recent progress in the development of novel molecular markers for melanoma that are nearing clinical application.

Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs.

Using A375 (BRAF-mutated) and Hs294t (non BRAF-mutated but highly metastatic) human melanoma cell lines, we found that in vitro treatment with silymarin resulted in a dose-dependent: (i) reduction in cell viability; (ii) enhancement of either Go/G1 (A375) or G2-M (Hs294t) phase cell cycle arrest with corresponding alterations in cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases; and (iii) induction of apoptosis. The silymarin-induced apoptosis of human melanoma cells was associated with a reduction in the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), an increase in the levels of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax), and activation of caspases. Further, oral administration of silymarin (500 mg/kg body weight/2× a week) significantly inhibited (60%, P < 0.01) the growth of BRAF-mutated A375 melanoma tumor xenografts, and this was associated with: (i) inhibition of cell proliferation; (ii) induction of apoptosis of tumor cells; (iii) alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins; and (iv) reduced expression of tumor angiogenic biomarkers in tumor xenograft tissues.

Activating mutations in BRAF have recently been identified in melanomas, colorectal cancers, and thyroid and ovarian tumours. In the present study, an extensive characterization of BRAF and KRAS mutations has been performed in 264 epithelial and non-epithelial ovarian neoplasms. The epithelial tumours ranged from adenomas and borderline neoplasms to invasive carcinomas including serous, mucinous, clear cell, and endometrioid lesions. It is shown that BRAF mutations in ovarian tumours occur exclusively in low-grade serous neoplasms (33 of 91, 36%); these included serous borderline tumours (typical and micropapillary variants), an invasive micropapillary carcinoma and a psammocarcinoma. KRAS mutations were identified in 26 of 91 (29.5%) low-grade serous tumours, 7 of 49 (12%) high-grade serous carcinomas, 2 of 6 mucinous adenomas, 22 of 28 mucinous borderline tumours, and 10 of 18 mucinous carcinomas. Of note, two serous borderline tumours were found to harbour both BRAF and KRAS mutations. The finding that at least 60% of serous borderline tumours harbour mutations in two members of the ERK-MAP-kinase pathway (BRAF 36%, KRAS 30%) compared with 12% of high-grade serous carcinomas (BRAF 0%, KRAS 12%) indicates that the majority of serous borderline tumours do not progress to serous carcinomas.

The aim of this study is to assess the status of the MAP kinase pathways in the pathogenesis of acral melanomas.

The absence of RAS and positivity for MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2 were most seen in invasive cases with high thickness.

In a series of patients, we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases, but brain metastases developed. This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to treatment resistance in brain metastases. Matched brain and extracerebral metastases from melanoma patients had identical ERK, p-ERK, and AKT immunohistochemistry staining patterns, but there was hyperactivation of AKT (p-AKT) and loss of PTEN expression in the brain metastases. Mutation analysis revealed no differences in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutation status in matched brain and extracerebral metastases. In contrast, AKT, p-AKT, and PTEN expression was identical in monolayer cultures derived from melanoma brain and extracerebral metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells stimulated by astrocyte-conditioned medium showed higher AKT activation and invasiveness than melanoma cells stimulated by fibroblast-conditioned medium. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling resensitized melanoma cells isolated from a vemurafenib-resistant brain metastasis to vemurafenib. Brain-derived factors appear to induce hyperactivation of the AKT survival pathway and to promote the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells in the brain. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling shows potential for enhancing and/or prolonging the antitumor effect of BRAF inhibitors or other anticancer agents in melanoma brain metastases.",

The molecular genetic study of the BRAF gene showed the presence of a missense thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 1796, resulting in the V599E substitution, in 24 of 60 PTCs (40%), none of six follicular adenomas, and none of five follicular carcinomas or one anaplastic carcinoma. Moreover, nine of 60 PTCs (15%) presented RET/PTC expression. A genetico-clinical association analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutation and development of PTCs of the classic papillary histotype (P = 0.038). On the contrary, no link could be detected between expression of BRAF(V599E) and age at diagnosis, gender, dimension, and local invasiveness of the primary cancer, presence of lymph node metastases, tumor stage, and multifocality of the disease. These data clearly confirm that BRAF(V599E) is the more common genetic alteration found to date in adult sporadic PTCs, that it is unique for this thyroid cancer histotype, and that it might drive the development of PTCs of the classic papillary subtype.",

However, not all BRAF-V600E melanomas respond to MAPK inhibition. Therefore, it is important to understand why tumors with the same oncogenic driver have variable responses to MAPK inhibitors. Here, we show that concurrent loss of PTEN and activation of the Notch pathway is associated with poor response to the ERK inhibitor SCH772984, and that co-inhibition of Notch and ERK decreased viability in BRAF-V600E melanomas. Additionally, patients with low PTEN and Notch activation had significantly shorter progression free survival when treated with BRAF inhibitors. Our studies provide a rationale to further develop combination strategies with Notch antagonists to maximize the efficacy of MAPK inhibition in melanoma. Our findings should prompt the evaluation of combinations co-targeting MAPK/ERK and Notch as a strategy to improve current therapies and warrant further evaluation of co-occurrence of aberrant PTEN and Notch activation as predictive markers of response to therapy.",

The prognosis of leptomeningeal metastases is poor and standard treatment, which includes radiotherapy and chemotherapy, is mostly ineffective. Melanoma represents one of the tumors with the highest incidence of leptomeningeal metastases. For such a disease, the BRAF inhibitors have recently been demonstrated to be effective on melanoma brain metastases harboring the V600EBRAF mutation.;We report a case of a 39-year-old Italian woman with advanced melanoma with brain, lung and peritoneum metastases harboring the V600EBRAF mutation. In August 2010 she was enrolled into the BRIM3 trial and after the randomization process she received dacarbazine. After two cycles, there was evidence of disease progression in her peritoneum and lung. For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy. She had a partial response that was maintained until 13 weeks of treatment. In January 2011 she developed symptoms typical for brain metastases and received a diagnosis of leptomeningeal involvement of melanoma cells after an examination of her cerebral spinal fluid; magnetic resonance imaging was negative for meningitis or brain metastases. Analysis of her cerebral spinal fluid sample confirmed that the melanoma cells still carried the V600EBRAF mutation. After a few days, our patient went into a coma and died.;Starting with a clinical case, we discuss the pathogenesis of leptomeningeal metastases and whether the leptomeninges may represent a sanctuary where melanoma cells may generate resistance and/or BRAF inhibitors cannot reach an adequate concentration for significant activity. We assess whether treatment with BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients should be interrupted as soon as disease progression appears or continued beyond progression, through the administration of additional compounds.",

External beam radiation therapy is an option for nodal beds where the risk of local recurrence is very high. In-transit melanoma metastases may be treated locally with surgery, immunotherapy, radiation, or heated limb perfusion. For metastatic melanoma, the options include chemotherapy or immunotherapy; targeted anti-BRAF and anti-KIT therapy is under active investigation. Standard chemotherapy yields objective tumor responses in approximately 10%-20% of patients, and sustained remissions are uncommon. Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 yields objective tumor responses in a minority of patients; however, some of these responses may be durable.

Despite worldwide efforts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, cases of melanoma continue to rise at an alarming rate of 2.5% annually in the United States. Although early primary melanomas are curable through surgery, treatment of advanced disease remains difficult and the strategies employed in the last 30 years have not significantly improved cure rates, which are less than 5%. The recent identification of activating mutations in BRAF in over 60% of cases of melanoma has caused much excitement in the melanoma community and may offer the first opportunity for a rational treatment program. Combination therapy using the RAF inhibitor, BAY 43-9006, and chemotherapy has led to impressive responses in some melanoma patients and provides a new paradigm for therapeutic intervention in this intractable disease. Besides activating mutations in BRAF, melanomas have constitutive activity in a number of other signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis, including PI3 kinase/Akt, NFB, Src, and STAT3. With more and more selective small molecule inhibitors becoming available, there are good prospects for treating advanced melanoma using new combinations of signal transduction inhibitors and chemotherapy.

Targeting BRAF is an effective therapy for advanced melanoma, but patients progress due to the development of resistance. This 'acquired resistance' is thought to be based on a minority of tumour cell populations that are resistant and will eventually re-establish tumour growth even in the presence of drug. In particular, mutations, amplifications or overexpression of genes encoding regulators of the MAPK pathway can confer this resistance, because it allows the melanoma cells to bypass inhibitor action by stimulating ERK activation through alternative routes. Furthermore, there are mechanisms that produce resistance by enhancing the tolerance of melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of the drug. These compensatory mechanisms can activate survival signals in the melanoma cells without reactivating ERK. Besides these cell-autonomous resistance mechanisms, stromal fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment have been identified as a potential source of resistance, because these cells can produce growth factors that reactivate ERK through paracrine signalling. Understanding and further identifying mechanisms of resistance is crucial for the future treatment of advanced melanoma, because this can inform the design of improved therapies with more durable responses.

Expression of 4E-BP1 transcript, total 4E-BP1 protein, and p-4E-BP1 was examined. The relationship between 4E-BP1 transcript and protein expression was assessed in a subset of patient tumors (n = 41). The association between total and p-4E-BP1 levels and survival was examined in the larger cohort of patients (n = 72).;4E-BP1 was hyperphosphorylated in 4 of 7 melanoma cell lines harboring both BRAF and PTEN mutations compared with untransformed melanocytes or RAS/RAF/PTEN wild-type melanoma cells. 4E-BP1 transcript correlated with 4E-BP1 total protein levels as measured by the semiquantitative reverse-phase protein array (P = 0.012). High levels of p-4E-BP1 were associated with worse overall and post-recurrence survival (P = 0.02 and 0.0003, respectively).;Our data show that translation initiation is a common event in human metastatic melanoma and correlates with worse prognosis. Therefore, effective inhibition of the pathways responsible for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation should be considered to improve the treatment outcome of metastatic melanoma patients.",

However, after decades of basic research into the signal transduction pathways that promote cancer cell survival, chemoresistance, growth, and crosstalk with the immune system, targeted therapies have now been developed that offer improved survival for patients with metastatic melanoma. Some of the most promising therapies that have been developed include ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody that enhances T-cell activity in the tumour, and selective BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib that blocks tumour cell proliferation in patients with activating BRAF mutations. Although these treatments offer substantial hope for patients, they are not without their drawbacks, which include adverse side-effects, drug resistance, and eventual relapse. Nanotherapeutics holds significant promise to circumvent these shortcomings and has the additional advantage of potentially functioning as a diagnostic device.

Indeed, several receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as RAS, are mutated in a small number of melanoma cases. Moreover, genetic alterations in the phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, especially in PTEN, suggest that this route also poses opportunities for therapeutic exploitation. We will review here the genetic evidence suggesting the utility of targets on these pathways. We will also summarize the recent clinical data that have accumulated from initial trials designed to test BRAF inhibition and targeting of other molecules.

Under normal physiologic conditions, the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) signalling cascade interaction is initiated by ligation of a receptor-linked tyrosine kinase by its cognate growth factor. It has been demonstrated in many systems that aberrant autocrine or paracrine stimulation of growth factor receptors is pathogenic in large part because of MAPK activation. As one of the key downstream effector pathways of mutated RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS), pharmacologic inhibition of components of the MAPK pathway has been pursued as a means to indirectly inhibit RAS, which remains a technical challenge for direct pharmacologic inhibition. RAF and MEK are the two non-membrane-bound, serine-threonine and tyrosine-threonine kinases, within the pathway that have been most extensively explored as drug targets. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in cancer clarified which cancer types and subsets of certain cancers are most dependent on activation of the MAPK pathway for growth and survival.

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic process accounts for the vast majority of melanoma associated mortality, and also results in difficulties in the effective treatment. Therefore, identification of novel biomarkers could contribute to melanoma prognosis, and may also provide new opportunities for efficient cancer treatment. Several signaling pathways have been identified as key regulators in melanoma progression, including the frequent activation of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway through the mutant BRAF or NRAS genes. Besides, alterations of CCND1 may also be of great importance. The oncogene plays a significant role in the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle, and its transcriptional activation is primarily carried out by the Ras/MAPK cascade. One of our aims was to determine the genetic and gene expression alterations of CCND1 during melanoma progression, considering the mutation status of BRAF and NRAS genes. Analysis of CCND1 copy number alterations revealed significant association with poor clinical outcome in primary melanomas, which was influenced by the mutation status of BRAF or NRAS in the term of sun exposure. Regarding gene expression, CCND1 mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and were correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation status of BRAF and NRAS. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation and shorter survival time. However, the proportion of cells expressing the protein showed a heterogeneous distribution, influencing the association with clinical-pathological parameters. Therefore melanoma cell lines with different biological behavior were also analyzed for protein expression. These experiments revealed an increasing CCND1 protein level throughout primary cancer progression, which then decreased in the metastasis. The other purpose of our study was to determine the role of 7q31 region in melanoma progression, which was found frequently altered using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). 7q31 is a gene dense locus, including the FRA7G fragile site, which serves as a mutation hot spot. In its close vicinity TES (focal adhesions) and CAV1 (lipid rafts) genes are located. Using interphase FISH, significant associations were found between 7q31 copy number alterations and poor clinical outcome. Both mRNA and protein levels of CAV1 decreased in thick lesions whereas primary melanomas forming multiple metastases were featured by decreased TES mRNA level. ;A melanoma okozta halálozások legfõbb oka a metasztázisok megjelenése, mely a túlélésen túl jelentõsen csökkenti az alkalmazott terápiák hatékonyságát is. Ezért szükséges olyan biomarkerek felkutatása, melyek hozzájárulnak a melanoma prognózisához, és sikeresen alkalmazhatók a terápiás hatékonyság növelésére. Számos jelátviteli útvonal szerepét bizonyították már a melanoma progressziójában. Ezek közül kiemelkedõ jelentõségû a Ras/MAPK útvonal aktivációja. A BRAF- és NRAS-mutációk korai megjelenése mellett fontos, hogy az útvonal egyik fõ célmolekulája a sejtciklus G1/S fázis átmenetét szabályozó CCND1. Vizsgálataink egyik részében a CCND1 genetikai és génexpressziós eltéréseit tanulmányoztuk a melanomaprogresszió során, figyelembe véve a BRAF és NRAS gének mutációs státuszát. Eredményeink a CCND1-kópiaszám eltéréseinek szignifikáns összefüggését tárták fel a kedvezõtlen klinikai kimenetellel primer melanomákban, mely összefüggést befolyásolta a BRAF és NRAS gének mutációs státusza a napsugárzásnak való kitettség függvényében. Génexpressziós vizsgálataink során a CCND1 mRNS-szintjének szignifikáns csökkenését figyeltük meg a többszörös áttétképzõ primer tumorokban, mely korrelációt mutatott mind a BRAF és NRAS mRNS-szintekkel, mind pedig ez utóbbi gének mutációs státuszával. A CCND1 protein fokozott expressziója pedig áttétképzéssel, rövidebb túléléssel és nagyobb Breslow-vastagsággal társult. A CCND1-et kifejezõ sejtek aránya azonban heterogén eloszlást mutatott, mely befolyásolta a klinikopatológiai paraméterekkel való összefüggést. Kísérleteinket ezért eltérõ biológiai karakterû sejtvonalakon végzett vizsgálatokkal egészítettük ki. Ez alapján a progresszió elõrehaladtával a CCND1-expresszió fokozódik, majd az áttétben lecsökken. További célunk volt az array komparatív genomhibridizációs (aCGH) vizsgálatok során gyakori eltérést mutató 7q31-es régió szerepének vizsgálata a melanoma progressziójában. A lókusz rendkívül géndenz, mely magában foglalja a mutációs forrópontként mûködõ FRA7G fragilis helyet. Ennek környezetében lokalizálódik a fokális adhéziók egy kulcsmolekuláját kódoló TES gén, valamint a membrán-lipidtutajok multifunkciós alapköve, a CAV1. Interfázisos FISH-vizsgálataink szignifikáns összefüggést mutattak a 7q31 kópiaszám-eltérései és a kedvezõtlen prognózis között. A CAV1 mRNS-expresszió lecsökkent vastag melanomákban, mely változás fehérjeszinten is tapasztalható volt, míg a TES mRNS-szint csökkenése a többszörös áttétképzõ primer mintákat jellemezte."},

These novel targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the management of advanced refractory cancer. The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. In this review, the role of Raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an overview is given of Raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate (BAY 43-9006 or sorafenib). Sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed that targets Raf kinases (Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and b-raf V600E), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-beta) or tumor progression (Flt-3, c-kit).

In current practice, most patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanomas will see both modalities. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combining immunotherapy with MAPK inhibition may have synergistic effects. First, mouse models show that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can be enhanced by vaccination. Rapid tumor destruction by vemurafenib could provide a vaccine-like stimulus to adoptively transferred T cells. Second, both in mice and in early clinical trials, melanoma metastases treated with MAPK inhibitors seem to display increased T-cell infiltrates. Third, MAPK inhibition upregulates the expression of some melanoma antigens and, therefore, may enhance T-cell recognition of vemurafenib-treated melanomas. Fourth, vemurafenib may sensitize tumor cells to immune destruction. Finally, some investigators have found that an optimal antitumor effect from MAPK inhibition is dependent on an intact host immune response. Currently, the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has initiated a phase II trial combining the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ACT using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors to investigate the safety and efficacy of this combination. The proposed mechanisms for synergy between these two modalities can be complex, and their optimal combination may require testing a variety of sequences and schedules.",

The advent of specific CDK 4/6 inhibitors targeting the G1-S transition, with an improved therapeutic index, is a significant step forward. Potential synergy exists with the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with existing therapies targeting the MAPK pathway, particularly in subsets of metastatic melanomas such as NRAS and BRAF mutants.

Current targeted therapies focus on decreasing the activity of this pathway; however, we do not fully understand how these therapies impact tumor biology, especially given that melanoma is a heterogeneous disease. Using a three-dimensional (3D), collagen-embedded spheroid melanoma model, we observed that MEK and BRAF inhibitors can increase the invasive potential of ∼20% of human melanoma cell lines. The invasive cell lines displayed increased receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity and activation of the Src/FAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling axis, also associated with increased cell-to-cell adhesion and cadherin engagement following MEK inhibition. Targeting various RTKs, Src, FAK and STAT3 with small molecule inhibitors in combination with a MEK inhibitor prevented the invasive phenotype, but only STAT3 inhibition caused cell death in the 3D context. We further show that STAT3 signaling is induced in BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cells. Our findings suggest that MEK and BRAF inhibitors can induce STAT3 signaling, causing potential adverse effects such as increased invasion. We also provide the rationale for the combined targeting of the MAPK pathway along with inhibitors of RTKs, SRC or STAT3 to counteract STAT3-mediated resistance phenotypes.",

To investigate this, we used mass spectrometry to complete a global phosphoproteomic analysis of a BRAFV600E thyroid cancer cell line (SW1736) after treatment with the mutation-selective inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) and MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244).

The abundance of phosphopeptides containing consensus motifs for acidophilic kinases increased after short-term inhibition with these compounds. We showed that coinhibition of the pleiotropic acidophilic protein kinase CK2 (CK2) and BRAFV600E synergistically reduced proliferation in patient-derived melanomas and thyroid cancer cells harboring the BRAF lesion. We investigated this mechanism and show a role for CK2 in controlling AKT activation that was not reliant on changes to PTEN or PDK1 phosphorylation.

The amplified loci carried additional genes, many of which could potentially play a role in melanoma. Distinct patterns of copy number changes showed that alterations in CDKN2A tended to be more clustered in cell lines with mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes; the PTEN locus was targeted mainly in conjunction with BRAF mutations. Amplification of CCND1, CDK4, and other loci was significantly increased in cell lines without BRAF-NRAS mutations and so was the loss of chromosome arms 13q and 16q. Our data suggest involvement of distinct genetic pathways that are driven either through oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations complemented by aberrations in the CDKN2A and PTEN genes or involve amplification of oncogenic genomic loci and loss of 13q and 16q.

For example, treatment based on EGFR mutation status has attained successful results. However, in spite of excellent initial response to oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), progression-free survival is still limited. Current research has focused mostly on acquired resistance mechanisms, such as overexpression of AXL and loss of the Mediator MED12. In this review, in contrast, we discuss adaptive, rather than acquired, resistance. Adaptive resistance can occur almost immediately after starting targeted therapy through a rapid rewiring of cancer cell signaling. By losing ERK negative feedback on receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression, cancer cells are exposed to the stimuli of several ligands, and the ensuing activation of several RTKs reprograms all the canonical signaling pathways. The overexpression of several RTKs was observed in breast cancer cell lines treated with a MEK inhibitor and in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines treated with BRAF inhibitors. This rebound effect of overexpression of several RTKs, including ERBB3, also occurs in lung cancers driven by Kras or EGFR mutations when treated with MEK, PI3K or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Synthetic lethality can be effectively induced by co-targeting these overexpressed RTKs. We speculate that in patients with EGFR mutations, adaptive resistance occurs in a significant proportion of patients. Rebiopsies performed hours after starting treatment with EGFR TKIs can identify which RTKs are overexpressed after treatment. Efficient co-targeting of these RTKs can induce synthetic lethality and help overcome the limited effect of EGFR TKI monotherapy. ",

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are important regulators of apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by numerous cell death signalling platforms. In this report we investigated the impact of IAPs for cell death regulation in malignant melanoma. Suppression of IAPs strongly sensitized a panel of melanoma cells to death ligand-induced cell death, which, surprisingly, was largely mediated by apoptosis, as it was completely rescued by addition of caspase inhibitors. Interestingly, the absence of necroptosis signalling correlated with a lack of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) mRNA and protein expression in all cell lines, whereas primary melanocytes and cultured nevus cells strongly expressed RIPK3. Reconstitution of RIPK3, but not a RIPK3-kinase dead mutant in a set of melanoma cell lines overcame CD95L/IAP antagonist-induced necroptosis resistance independent of autocrine tumour necrosis factor secretion. Using specific inhibitors, functional studies revealed that RIPK3-mediated mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) phosphorylation and necroptosis induction critically required receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 signalling. Furthermore, the inhibitor of mutant BRAF Dabrafenib, but not Vemurafenib, inhibited necroptosis in melanoma cells whenever RIPK3 is present. Our data suggest that loss of RIPK3 in melanoma and selective inhibition of the RIPK3/MLKL axis by BRAF inhibitor Dabrafenib, but not Vemurafenib, is critical to protect from necroptosis. Strategies that allow RIPK3 expression may allow unmasking the necroptotic signalling machinery in melanoma and points to reactivation of this pathway as a treatment option for metastatic melanoma.

Different from genetically engineered models, sporadic canine melanocytic neoplasms share several characteristics with human disease that could make dogs a more relevant preclinical model. Canine melanomas rarely arise in sun-exposed sites. Most occur in the oral cavity, with a subset having intra-epithelial malignant melanocytes mimicking the in situ component of human mucosal melanoma. The spectrum of canine melanocytic neoplasia includes benign lesions with some analogy to nevi, as well as invasive primary melanoma, and widespread metastasis. Growing evidence of distinct subtypes in humans, differing in somatic and predisposing germ-line genetic alterations, cell of origin, epidemiology, relationship to ultraviolet radiation and progression from benign to malignant tumors, may also exist in dogs. Canine and human mucosal melanomas appear to harbor BRAF, NRAS, and c-kit mutations uncommonly, compared with human cutaneous melanomas, although both species share AKT and MAPK signaling activation. We conclude that there is significant overlap in the clinical and histopathological features of canine and human mucosal melanomas.

Over the last 40 years no one drug or combination of drugs demonstrated any impact on survival in metastatic melanoma. In contrast, in 2011 a number of new drugs will be approved. In 2011 immunomodulation with ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the ligand CTLA-4, has been approved for patients with advanced melanoma in first- and second-line treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in second-line treatment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Also in 2011, a significant survival benefit of the combination of ipilimumab with dacarbazine compared with dacarbazine alone for first-line treatment was reported. Other monoclonal antibodies targeting T-cell ligands, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), also show promise. Various inhibitors of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) yield high response rates in patients harbouring the BRAF-V600E mutation. A significant impact on both progression-free and overall survival was demonstrated for vemurafenib compared with dacarbazine in a phase-III trial. Approval is expected in 2011. Both drugs had only modest effects of 2-3 months on median survival, so combination therapies must be explored. BRAF inhibitors in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors show great potential. Moreover, combinations of immunomodulators and pathway inhibitors are expected to be very active, and phase-III trials are planned. Pegylated interferon-α2b was approved in 2011 on the basis of the results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18991 phase-III trial demonstrating a sustained impact on relapse-free survival in patients with lymph-node-positive melanoma.

Materials and methods Patients with newly diagnosed melanoma metastases were identified from institutional database A retrospective review of brain MRI was performed focusing on lesion number, size, T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted signal characteristics, hemorrhage, necrosis, enhancement pattern and edema. Genomic (BRAF status), treatment and survival data was collected. Results 98 patients were included in final analysis. A strong correlation was found between size of the largest lesion and the percent of lesions with T1-weighted hyperintense signal (R = 0.49), percent of lesions with size >1 cm (0.55), and the lesions that are clearly hemorrhagic (0.43). The analyzed imaging parameters were found to be independent of BRAF mutation status. The median survival of subjects with single lesion (9.1 months) was significantly higher than the median survival of subjects with more than 1 lesion (4.9 months) (p = 0.002). Patients with 2-18 lesions had significantly longer survival (5.6 months) than with >18 lesions (2 months) (p < 0.001).

Despite the spectacular achievements of targeted therapies (BRAF inhibitors) or immuno-therapies (anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1), most patients with melanoma will need additional treatments. Here we used a photoactive NADPH analogue called NS1 to induce cell death by inhibition of NADPH oxidases NOX in melanoma cells, including melanoma cells isolated from patients. In contrast, healthy melanocytes growth was unaffected by NS1 treatment.NS1 established an early Endoplasmic Reticulum stress by the early release of calcium mediated by (a) calcium-dependent redox-sensitive ion channel(s). These events initiated autophagy and apoptosis in all tested melanoma cells independently of their mutational status. The autophagy promoted by NS1 was incomplete. The autophagic flux was blocked at late stage events, consistent with the accumulation of p62, and a close localization of LC3 with NS1 associated with NS1 inhibition of NOX1 in autophagosomes. This hypothesis of a specific incomplete autophagy and apoptosis driven by NS1 was comforted by the use of siRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors blocking different processes.

Although discoveries of frequent mutations including BRAF have already made clinically significant impact on patient care, there is a growing body of literature suggesting a role for additional mutations, driver and passenger types, in disease pathophysiology. Although some mutations have been strongly associated with clinical phenotypes of melanomas (such as physical distribution or morphologic subtype), the function or implications of many of the recently identified mutations remains less clear.

Melanocytic neoplasms in affected individuals harbored BRAF mutations, showed loss of BAP1 expression, and histologically resembled so-called \"atypical Spitz tumors\" (ASTs). ASTs are an ill-defined and probably heterogenous group of melanocytic tumors that display histologic features seen in both Spitz nevi and melanomas. Their biological behavior cannot be reliably predicted. In view of the histologic similarities of the familial tumors and ASTs, we hypothesized that a subset of ASTs might harbor genetic alterations seen in the familial tumors. To address this hypothesis, we analyzed 32 sporadic ASTs for BRAF mutations and for BAP1 expression. Nine (28%) sporadic ASTs showed loss of BAP1 expression, of which 8 (89%) had concomitant BRAF mutations. Only 1 of the BAP1-positive ASTs (4%) had a BRAF mutation (P<0.0001). BRAF-mutated, BAP1-negative tumors were primarily located in the dermis and were composed entirely or predominantly of epithelioid melanocytes with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and well-defined cytoplasmic borders. Nuclei were commonly vesicular and exhibited substantial pleomorphism and conspicuous nucleoli. The combination of BRAF mutation and loss of nuclear BAP1 expression thus characterizes a subset of ASTs with distinct histologic features. The typical morphology of these tumors and BAP1 immunohistochemistry provide pathologic clues that will enable accurate identification of this subset. Future studies are necessary to determine whether this subset has a predictable clinical behavior.",

Because direct pharmacological inhibition of the RAS proto-oncogene has thus far been unsuccessful, we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug combination(s) that can mimic RAS inhibition. Here, leveraging an inducible mouse model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activates apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic neuroblastoma RAS homolog (NRAS) extinction, which triggers both of these effects. Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition. Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify nonobvious coextinction target(s) for combined pharmacological inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanomas.",

It is thus important to have a better understanding of the molecular resistance mechanisms to improve patient survival benefit from these agents. Here we show that BRAFV600E is a negative regulator of the AKT pathway. Expression of BRAFV600E in NIH3T3 cells significantly suppresses MEK inhibitor (RG7167) or mTORC1 inhibitor (rapamycin) induced AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) and downstream signal activation. Treatment-induced pAKT elevation is found in BRAF wild type melanoma cells but not in a subset of melanoma cell lines harboring BRAFV600E. Knock-down of BRAFV600E in these melanoma cells elevates basal pAKT and downstream signals, whereas knock-down of CRAF, MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 or treatment with a BRAF inhibitor have no impact on pAKT. Mechanistically, we show that BRAFV600E interacts with rictor complex (mTORC2) and regulates pAKT through mTORC2. BRAFV600E is identified in mTORC2 after immunoprecipitation of rictor. Knock-down of rictor abrogates BRAFV600E depletion induced pAKT. Knock-down of BRAFV600E enhances cellular enzyme activity of mTORC2. Aberrant activation of AKT pathway by PTEN loss appears to override the negative impact of BRAFV600E on pAKT. Taken together, our findings suggest that in a subset of BRAFV600E melanoma cells, BRAFV600E negatively regulates AKT pathway in a rictor-dependent, MEK/ERK and BRAF kinase-independent manner.

We profile adaptive responses across a panel of melanoma cell lines using multiplex biochemical measurement, single-cell assays, and statistical modeling and show that adaptation involves at least six signaling cascades that act to reduce drug potency (IC50) and maximal effect (i.e., Emax ≪ 1). Among these cascades, we identify a role for JNK/c-Jun signaling in vemurafenib adaptation and show that RAF and JNK inhibitors synergize in cell killing. This arises because JNK inhibition prevents a subset of cells in a cycling population from becoming quiescent upon vemurafenib treatment, thereby reducing drug Emax. Our findings demonstrate the breadth and diversity of adaptive responses to RAF/MEK inhibition and a means to identify which steps in a signaling cascade are most predictive of phenotypic response.

However, the molecular consequences of RAF inhibition in melanoma cells remained largely elusive. Here, we investigated the effects of the pan-RAF inhibitor L-779,450, which inhibited cell proliferation both in BRAF-mutated and wild-type melanoma cell lines. It furthermore enhanced apoptosis in combination with the death ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and overcame TRAIL resistance in melanoma cells. Enhanced apoptosis coincided with activation of mitochondrial pathways, seen by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Subsequently, caspase-9 and -3 were activated. Apoptosis induction by L-779,450/TRAIL was prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression and was dependent on Bax. Thus, activation of Bax by L-779,450 alone was demonstrated by Bax conformational changes, whereas Bak was not activated. Furthermore, the BH3-only protein Bim was upregulated in response to L-779,450.

Furthermore, a mass spectrometry-based genotyping platform was used to analyze 30 acral melanomas and 28 mucosal melanomas to profile 238 known somatic mutations in 19 oncogenes. ALK break points were identified in four acral cases (6.9%). Eight (13.8%) cases harbored BRAF mutations, six (10.3%) had NRAS mutations, four (6.9%) had KIT mutations, two (3.5%) had EGFR mutations, two (3.5%) had KRAS mutations, two (3.5%) had MET mutations, one (1.7%) had an HRAS mutation, and one (1.7%) had a PIK3CA mutation. Two cases exhibited co-occurring mutations, and one case with a BRAF mutation had a translocation in ALK.

Here, we report that DNMT3B plays a pro-tumorigenic role in human melanoma and that DNMT3B loss dramatically suppresses melanoma formation in the Braf/Pten mouse melanoma model. Loss of DNMT3B results in hypomethylation of the miR-196b promoter and increased miR-196b expression, which directly targets the mTORC2 component Rictor. Loss of RICTOR in turn prevents mTORC2 activation, which is critical for melanoma formation and growth. These findings establish Dnmt3b as a regulator of melanoma formation through its effect on mTORC2 signaling. Based on these results, DNMT3B is a potential therapeutic target in melanoma. ",

To better understand the mechanisms that determine the long-term responses of mutant B-Raf melanoma cells to B-Raf inhibitor, we used chronic selection to establish B-Raf (V600E) melanoma clones with acquired resistance to the new oncogenic B-Raf inhibitor UI-152. Whereas the parental A375P cells were highly sensitive to UI-152 (IC50<0.5 μM), the resistant sub-line (A375P/Mdr) displayed strong resistance to UI-152 (IC50>20 μM). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated the absence of an increase in the levels of P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter in A375P/Mdr cells, suggesting that resistance was not attributable to P-glycoprotein overexpression. In UI-152-sensitive A375P cells, the anti-proliferative activity of UI-152 appeared to be due to cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 with the induction of apoptosis. However, we found that A375P/Mdr cells were resistant to the apoptosis induced by UI-152. Interestingly, UI-152 preferentially induced autophagy in A375P/Mdr cells but not in A375P cells, as determined by GFP-LC3 puncta/cell counts. Further, autophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) partially augmented growth inhibition of A375P/Mdr cells by UI-152, which implies that a high level of autophagy may protect UI-152-treated cells from undergoing growth inhibition. Together, our data implicate high rates of autophagy as a key mechanism of acquired resistance to the oncogenic B-Raf inhibitor, in support of clinical studies in which combination therapy with autophagy targeted drugs is being designed to overcome resistance.

The current inhibitors of ERK1/2 target ATP binding or the catalytic site and are therefore limited in their utility for elucidating the complex biological roles of ERK1/2 through its phosphorylation and regulation of over 100 substrate proteins. To overcome this limitation, a combination of computational and experimental methods was used to identify low-molecular-mass inhibitors that are intended to target ERK1/2 substrate-docking domains and selectively interfere with ERK1/2 regulation of substrate proteins. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of compounds with a thienyl benzenesulfonate scaffold that were designed to inhibit ERK1/2 substrates containing an F-site or DEF (docking site for ERK, FXF) motif. Experimental evidence shows the compounds inhibit the expression of F-site containing immediate early genes (IEGs) of the Fos family, including c-Fos and Fra1, and transcriptional regulation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex. Moreover, this class of compounds selectively induces apoptosis in melanoma cells containing mutated BRaf and constitutively active ERK1/2 signalling, including melanoma cells that are inherently resistant to clinically relevant kinase inhibitors. These findings represent the identification and initial characterization of a novel class of compounds that inhibit ERK1/2 signalling functions and their potential utility for elucidating ERK1/2 and other signalling events that control the growth and survival of cancer cells containing elevated ERK1/2 activity.

In particular, we discuss agents that block mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, as well as other emerging approaches such as antibody-drug conjugates, cell-cycle targeting, and novel genetically-informed clinical trials.;Despite the incredible advances in melanoma therapeutics over the last several years, a clear need to develop more effective therapies remains.

However, BRAF inhibitors are found to induce cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC). Population-based background rates of cuSCC and non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (non-cuSCC) in the metastatic melanoma population may contextualize safety signals from randomized clinical trials or the clinics. However, these background rates are lacking.;We conducted a historical cohort study to evaluate the background rates of new-onset non-melanoma skin lesions and non-cuSCC among 2,814 metastatic malignant melanoma patients diagnosed in 1997-2010, identified through the Danish Cancer Registry and the National Pathology Registry. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cancer before the metastatic melanoma diagnosis, other than skin cancers. We determined the incidence of non-melanoma malignant skin lesions and non-cuSCC that occurred post metastatic melanoma diagnosis, censoring patients at death, emigration, or December 31, 2011 (end of study period), whichever came first.;The median age at metastatic melanoma diagnosis was 64 years. Over 40% of patients died within one year of metastatic diagnosis and ~70% died within 5 years. The percentages of patients with prior history or prevalent disease at metastatic melanoma diagnosis included: 8.6% with cuSCC or basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 3.9% with actinic keratosis (AK), and 0.7% with Bowen's disease. No patients had past or current non-cuSCC per study exclusion criterion. The incidence of non-melanoma skin lesions during the 6 months post-metastatic melanoma diagnosis was as follows: BCC, 1.8% (42.5 per 1000 person-years [PY]); AK, 0.8% (18.6 per 1000 PY); cuSCC, 0.1% (1.7 per 1000 PY); Bowen's disease, 0.04% (0.8 per 1000 PY); and keratoacanthoma (KA), 0%.

However, melanoma, especially metastatic melanoma, has become one of the most threatening malignancies. Thus, the identification of exact molecular mechanisms and the key components involved in such mechanisms is urgently needed in order to provide new therapeutic options for patients with melanoma. Here, we identified MED27 as a potential melanoma target and explored its role and the associated molecular mechanism involved in melanoma progression. MED27 was found to be highly expressed in melanoma cells and tumor tissues. Its silencing led to melanoma cell proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction accompanied by the inactivation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling and the activation of Bax/Cyto-C/Caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. In addition, silencing of MED27 led to the decrease of iNOS expression through inhibiting the activation of a serial of upstream key proteins of NF-κB signaling pathway and the translocation of p50/p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus. MED27 was also found to be able to interact with NF-κB and p300 and to be acetylated by p300. Furthermore, the results in a xenograft tumor model indicated that melanoma progression was effectively suppressed by MED27 knockdown accompanied by the down-regulation of p-AKT, p-ERK, p-MEK1/2, MMP-9, Bcl-2 and iNOS expressions in the tumor tissues. Taken together, our study not only demonstrated the new function of MED27 as an oncogenic protein and the associated molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma progression, but also provided a possibility for the development of MED27 as a new anticancer target in melanoma therapy.

We evaluated whether pharmacological reactivation of the AMPK function could exert antitumor effects on melanoma cells bearing this pathway constitutively active because of a mutation in NRAS or BRAF genes. Nine melanoma cell lines were treated with the AMPK activators 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleoside (AICAR) and phenformin. The activation of AMPK enzymatic activity, phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase, in-vitro proliferation, cell cycle, and in-vivo growth of xenografts in nude mice were evaluated. AICAR and phenformin promoted phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of AMPK, as well as phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Drug treatment of either BRAF-mutant or NRAS-mutant melanomas, at doses not inducing cell death, was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in melanoma cell proliferation because of cell cycle arrest in either the G0/G1 or the S phase, associated with an increased expression of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor. Melanomas isolated from subcutaneously implanted mice, 25 days from treatment with AICAR, showed increased staining of the senescence-associated marker β-galactosidase, high p21 expression, and evidence of necrosis.

Despite the latest success of BRAF V600E-targeted therapies, responses are typically short lived and relapse is all but certain. Furthermore, a percentage (40%) of melanoma cells is BRAF wild type. Emerging evidence suggests a role for normal host cells in the occurrence of drug resistance. In the current study, we compared a variety of cell culture models with an organotypic incomplete skin culture model (the \"dermal equivalent\") to investigate the role of the tissue microenvironment in the response of melanoma cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox). In the dermal equivalent model, consisting of fibroblasts embedded in type I collagen matrix, melanoma cells showed a decreased cytotoxic response when compared with less complex culture conditions, such as seeding on plastic cell culture plate (as monolayers cultures) or on collagen gel. We further investigated the role of the microenvironment in p53 induction and caspase 3 and 9 cleavage. Melanoma cell lines cultured on dermal equivalent showed decreased expression of p53 after Dox treatment, and this outcome was accompanied by induction of interleukin IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Here, we show that the growth of melanoma cells in the dermal equivalent model inflects drug responses by recapitulating important pro-survival features of the tumor microenvironment. These studies indicate that the presence of stroma enhances the drug resistance of melanoma in vitro, more closely mirroring the in vivo phenotype. Our data, thus, demonstrate the utility of organotypic cell culture models in providing essential context-dependent information critical for the development of new therapeutic strategies for melanoma. We believe that the organotypic model represents an improved screening platform to investigate novel anti-cancer agents, as it provides important insights into tumor-stromal interactions, thus assisting in the elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms.

PGC1α is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, protects against oxidative stress and reprograms melanoma metabolism to influence drug sensitivity and survival. Here, we provide data indicating that PGC1α suppresses melanoma metastasis, acting through a pathway distinct from that of its bioenergetic functions. Elevated PGC1α expression inversely correlates with vertical growth in human melanoma specimens. PGC1α silencing makes poorly metastatic melanoma cells highly invasive and, conversely, PGC1α reconstitution suppresses metastasis. Within populations of melanoma cells, there is a marked heterogeneity in PGC1α levels, which predicts their inherent high or low metastatic capacity.

Our group previously reported that in vitro riluzole treatment reduces cell growth in three-dimensional (3D) soft agar colony assays by 80% in cells with wildtype phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation. However, melanoma cell lines harboring constitutive activating mutations of the PI3K pathway (PTEN and NRAS mutations) showed only a 35% to 40% decrease in colony formation in soft agar in the presence of riluzole. In this study, we have continued our preclinical studies of riluzole and its effect on melanoma cells alone and in combination with inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway: the AKT inhibitor, API-2, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin. We modeled these combinatorial therapies on various melanoma cell lines in 3D and 2D systems and in vivo. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is more effective at halting melanoma anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor progression than either agent alone. PI3K signaling changes associated with this combinatorial treatment shows that 3D (nanoculture) modeling of cell signaling more closely resembles in vivo signaling than monolayer models. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is effective at halting tumor cell progression independent of BRAF mutational status. This makes this combinatorial therapy a potentially viable alternative for metastatic melanoma patients who are BRAF WT and are therefore ineligible for vemurafenib therapy. ",

Here we sought to determine the utility and reproducibility of immunohistochemical detection of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in melanoma tissue, an approach of potential assistance in defining patients with innate resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy. To this end, a published and a revised method that retained sensitivity but with greater specificity for HGF detection, were evaluated in cells known to endogenously express HGF, and in models where HGF is upregulated via cytokine induction and via overexpression by gene transfection. Consequent patient evaluation in collaboration with the Melanoma Institute Australia of a cohort of 41 melanoma specimens with extensive clinical annotation failed to validate HGF immunohistochemistry as a predictor of response to BRAF inhibitors. Targeted therapies for advanced melanoma and other cancers show great promise, and rigorous validation studies are thus indicated for approaches that seek to personalize such therapies to maximize therapeutic efficacy.

The MITF gene is amplified in ~20% of melanomas and MITF mutation can predispose to melanoma development.

The growing insight into the molecular pathology and the discovery of frequent mutations made it possible to define melanoma subgroups suitable for targeted therapies. In approximately 50% of melanomas activating mutations of the BRAF gene were identified and can be treated with specific inhibitors. Further mutations which can be approached by targeted therapies are found on the c-Kit and NRAS genes. Another promising approach is immunotherapy aimed to activate cytotoxic T cells.

Multiple genetic and molecular defects, including an activating mutation in the BRaf kinase gene, are associated with melanoma, and the resulting alterations in signal transduction pathways regulating proliferation and apoptosis are thought to contribute to its chemoresistance. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets BRaf kinase, is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas. Although sorafenib has shown little promise as a single agent in melanoma patients, recent clinical trials suggest that, when combined with chemotherapy, it may have more benefit. We evaluated the ability of sorafenib to augment the cytotoxic effects of melphalan, a regional chemotherapeutic agent, and temozolomide, used in systemic and regional treatment of melanoma, on a panel of 24 human melanoma-derived cell lines and in an animal model of melanoma. Marked differences in response to 10 micromol/L sorafenib alone were observed in vitro across cell lines. Response to sorafenib significantly correlated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) downregulation and loss of Mcl-1 expression (P < 0.05). Experiments with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 suggest a unique role for ERK downregulation in the observed effects. Sorafenib in combination with melphalan or temozolomide led to significantly improved responses in vitro (P < 0.05). In the animal model of melanoma, sorafenib in combination with regional melphalan or regional temozolomide was more effective than either treatment alone in slowing tumor growth. These results show that sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy provides a novel approach to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy in the regional treatment of in-transit melanoma.",

ROS production in the absence or presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), tiron, and trolox was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM).

Furthermore, tiron and trolox caused inhibition of cell survival in two additional cell cultures containing TICs, FO-1 and MM1, established from a melanoma and a mesothelioma patient, respectively. NAC, instead, impaired survival of the MM1 cells but not of the FO-1 cells. However, when used in combination, NAC enhanced the inhibitory effect of PLX4032 (BRAF V600E inhibitor) and Gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor), on FO-1 and PT4 cell survival.

It occurs predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults, manifesting as a deep, painless, slow-growing mass. CCS is sometimes confused with other types of melanoma because of its melanocytic differentiation. Although BRAF and KIT mutations are well-known melanocytic tumour-promoting mutations frequently found in cutaneous melanoma, they are rare or absent in CCS. We present two cases of CCS with different clinical and genetic features. Both female patients, aged 25 and 20 years, presented with a palpable nodule on a lower extremity. Biopsies of both tumours revealed features diagnostic of CCS. Each tumour cell was positive for S100 protein and HMB-45. However, one patient's tumour was localized to the dermis, with many multinucleated giant cells, whereas the other was located in the deep subcutaneous fat layer near bone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of a characteristic Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein (EWSR)1 gene rearrangement in both cases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR product revealed an EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 type 1 fusion transcript in both cases. In addition, we detected BRAF mutation in the dermal type and KIT mutation in the subcutaneous type. It is of interest that the BRAF and KIT mutations are known to be very rare in CCS. On the basis of our observations, we suggest that mutation inhibitors may be useful in selected patients with mutated CCS lineages.",

Herein, we tested the hypothesis that distinct molecular alterations arising in primary melanoma cells might persist as these tumors progress to invasion and metastasis. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 1 (RSK1; official name RPS6KA1) was significantly hyperactivated in human melanoma lines and metastatic tissues derived from nodular compared with superficial spreading melanoma. RSK1 was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-380 in nodular but not superficial spreading melanoma and did not directly correlate with BRAF or MEK activation. Nodular melanoma cells were more sensitive to RSK1 inhibition using siRNA and the pharmacological inhibitor BI-D1870 compared with superficial spreading cells. Gene expression microarray analyses revealed that RSK1 orchestrated a program of gene expression that promoted cell motility and invasion. Differential overexpression of the prometastatic matrix metalloproteinase 8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 in metastatic nodular compared with metastatic superficial spreading melanoma was observed. Finally, using an in vivo zebrafish model, constitutive RSK1 activation increased melanoma invasion. Together, these data reveal a novel role for activated RSK1 in the progression of nodular melanoma and suggest that melanoma originating from different histologic subtypes may be biologically distinct and that these differences are maintained as the tumors invade and metastasize.

We present the histology and clinical course of 3 additional cases of MNH, 2 of which were metastatic. CD117 was strongly positive in all cases with available archival materials--the tumors and background neurocristic hamartoma of 3 cases, and 1 lymph node metastasis; however, KIT sequencing for exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 was negative. Mutational analyses of recurrent mutations of 17 cancer genes, including BRAF and KIT, were also negative. Although our series is small, KIT overexpression in MNH does not seem to correlate with gene mutation. The lack of BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, and KIT mutations seems to support the notion that MNH may be distinct from conventional melanoma and from other dermal melanomas, such as malignant blue nevi and melanoma arising in congenital nevi.",

New therapeutic strategies like kinase inhibitors for BRAF-mutant melanoma and immune checkpoint blockers proved to prolong survival times within clinical trials, and many of them have already entered routine clinical use. However, these different treatment modalities have not yet been tested against each other, which complicate therapy decisions. We performed an explorative analysis of survival data from recent clinical trials. Thirty-five Kaplan-Meier survival curves from 17 trials were digitised, re-grouped by matching inclusion criteria and treatment line, and averaged by therapy strategy. Notably, the survival curves grouped by therapy strategy revealed a very high concordance, even if different agents were used. The greatest survival improvement was observed with the combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors as well as with Programmed-death-1 (PD1) blockers with or without cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blockers, respectively, with these two treatment strategies showing similar survival outcomes. For first-line therapy, averaged survival proportions of patients alive at 12 months were 74.5% with BRAF plus MEK inhibitor treatment versus 71.9% with PD-1 blockade. This explorative comparison shows the kinase inhibitors as similarly effective as immune checkpoint blockers with regard to survival. However, to confirm these first trends for implementation into an individualised treatment of melanoma patients, data from prospective clinical trials comparing the different treatment strategies head-to-head have to be awaited.

The prognosis for melanoma patients with distal metastasis is bleak, with median survival of six months even with the latest available treatments. The most commonly mutated oncogenes in melanoma are BRAF and NRAS accounting approximately 60% and 20% of cases, respectively. In malignant melanoma, accumulating evidence suggests that multiple signaling pathways are constitutively activated and play an important role in cell proliferation, cell survival, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic regimens. Phytochemicals are gaining considerable attention because of their low toxicity, low cost, and public acceptance as dietary supplements. Cell culture and animals studies have elucidated several cellular and molecular mechanisms by which phytochemicals act in the prevention and treatment of metastatic melanoma. Several promising phytochemicals, such as, fisetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resveratrol, curcumin, proanthocyanidins, silymarin, apigenin, capsaicin, genistein, indole-3-carbinol, and luteolin are gaining considerable attention and found in a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, roots, and herbs.

Although the results obtained with BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients are impressive, several mechanisms of acquired resistance have emerged. To overcome this obstacle constitutes the new challenge in melanoma therapy. Given the major role that MAPKs play in melanoma, understanding their functions and the interconnection among them and with other signaling pathways represents a step forward toward this goal.",

Melanoma is highly resistant to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, although modern targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitors are showing some promise. Photodynamic therapy (PDT, the combination of photosensitizing dyes and visible light) has been tested in the treatment of melanoma with some promising results, but melanoma is generally considered to be resistant to it. Optical interference by the highly-pigmented melanin, the antioxidant effect of melanin, the sequestration of photosensitizers inside melanosomes, defects in apoptotic pathways, and the efflux of photosensitizers by ATP-binding cassette transporters have all been implicated in melanoma resistance to PDT. Approaches to overcoming melanoma resistance to PDT include: the discovery of highly active photosensitizers absorbing in the 700-800-nm near infrared spectral region; interventions that can temporarily reduce the amount or pigmentation of the melanin; compounds that can reverse apoptotic defects or inhibit drug-efflux of photosensitizers; and immunotherapy approaches that can take advantage of the ability of PDT to activate the host immune system against the tumor being treated.",

At present, there are limited systemic therapies to treat advanced stages of melanoma, and the key to improved survival remains early detection. Recent discoveries have allowed for a clearer picture of the molecular events leading to melanoma development and progression. Since identifying prevalent activating mutations of the BRAF kinase in melanomas, there has been a flood of additional molecular studies to further clarify the role of this pathway and others in melanomagenesis. In particular, recent genetic studies have demonstrated specific genotype-phenotype correlations that provide the first major insights into the molecular subclassification of melanoma and the heterogeneous nature of this malignancy. In this article, we review the most up-to-date molecular discoveries in melanoma biology and provide a framework for understanding their significance in melanoma development and progression. We also provide details on the development of novel therapies based on these recent molecular discoveries and insight into current and planned clinical trials. It is expected that these latest studies in melanoma will help define the critical molecular events involved in disease onset and progression and allow us to move rapidly toward a true molecular classification.

We investigated the anticancer activity of MEK inhibition in a panel of cell lines derived from radial growth phase (WM35) and vertical growth phase (WM793) of primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas (1205Lu, 451Lu, WM164, and C8161) in a three-dimensional spheroid model and found that the metastatic lines were completely resistant to MEK inhibition (U0126 and PD98059) but the earlier stage cell lines were not. Similarly, these same metastatic melanoma lines were also resistant to inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (LY294002 and wortmannin). Under adherent culture conditions, the MEK inhibitors blocked growth through the induction of cell cycle arrest and up-regulation of p27, but this was readily reversible following inhibitor washout. However, when the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MEK inhibitors were combined, the growth and invasion of the metastatic melanoma three-dimensional spheroids were blocked. Taken together, these results suggest that the most aggressive melanomas are resistant to strategies targeting one signaling pathway and that multiple signaling pathways may need to be targeted for maximal therapeutic efficacy. It is further suggested that BRAF mutational status is not predictive of response to MEK inhibition under three-dimensional culture conditions.",

Aberrant expression, dysregulation of their enzymatic activity or imbalances between HDACs and histone acetyltransferases are likely involved in the development and progression of cancer. Pharmacologic inhibition of HDACs shows potent antitumor activity in a panel of malignancies such as colon or gastric cancer and multiple myeloma. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of HDACs in melanoma and evaluate the application of HDAC inhibition from an experimental and clinical perspective. The molecular functions of HDACs can be classified into histone and non-histone effects with diverse implications in proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. HDAC inhibition results in G1 cell cycle arrest, induces apoptosis and increases the immunogenicity of melanoma cells. Some studies proposed that HDAC inhibition may overcome the resistance of melanoma cells to BRAF inhibition. Several inhibitors such as vorinostat, entinostat and valproic acid have recently been tested in phase I and early phase II trials, yet most agents show limited efficacy and tolerability as single agents. The most frequent adverse events of HDAC inhibition comprise haematological toxicity, fatigue, nausea and laboratory abnormalities. Existing evidence supports the hypothesis that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) may sensitize melanoma cells to immunotherapy and targeted therapy and hence bear therapeutic potential concurrent with immune checkpoint blockade or BRAF and MEK inhibition.",

Some promise has been shown in treating certain melanomas by targeting activated signaling pathways resulting from specific mutations in proteins, such as BRAF and NRAS. Recently, the identification of embryonic signaling pathways in melanoma has helped us better understand certain biological characteristics, such as cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity, and has provided novel insight pertinent to diagnosis and therapy. For instance, our studies have shown that the TGF-β family member, Nodal, is expressed in melanoma and is responsible, at least in part, for tumor cell plasticity and aggressiveness. Since the majority of normal adult tissues do not express Nodal, we reason that this embryonic morphogen could be used to identify and target aggressive melanoma cells. We have also identified that molecular cross-talk between the Notch and Nodal pathways may represent a mechanism responsible for the overexpression of Nodal in melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"In the initial period after melanoma was recognised as a disease entity in the early 1800's, it was subclassified on the basis of its presumed origin (from a precursor naevus, from a melanocytic precursor lesion acquired during adult life or in previously blemish-fee skin). In 1967 the eminent American pathologist, Dr Wallace Clark, proposed a histogenetic classification for melanoma in which the disease was subdivided predominantly on the basis of histopathological features of the intra-epidermal component of the tumour adjacent to any dermal invasive component. The subtypes were superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) and nodular melanoma (NM). Whilst additional entities, including acral lentiginous melanoma, mucosal melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma and naevoid melanoma have since been recognised, SSM, LMM and NM remain in the latest (2006) version of the WHO melanoma classification. Clark's histogenetic classification has been criticised because the criteria upon which it is based include clinical features (such as the site of the melanoma) and non-tumourous histopathological features (such as the character of the associated epidermis and the degree of solar elastosis) and also because of overlap in defining features, lack of an independent association with patient outcome and minimal relevance as a determinant of clinical management. However, such criticisms fail to acknowledge its importance in highlighting the myriad of clinical and histological guises of melanoma, which if not recognized by clinicians and pathologists will inevitably lead to a delay in diagnosis and a concomitant adverse clinical outcome. Recently, mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in melanomas involving NRAS (15-20%), BRAF (50%), CKIT (2%), and GNAQ/GNA11 (50% of uveal melanomas) have been identified. This might herald the beginning of a new molecular classification of melanoma in which the biologically distinct subsets share a common oncogenic mechanism, behave clinically in a similar fashion and require similar clinical management. These discoveries are already being successfully exploited as therapeutic targets in clinical trials of metastatic melanoma patients with promising activity. Whilst there remains much to be discovered in this rapidly evolving field, there is already great optimism that more rational and effective therapies for melanoma patients will soon be widely available.",

Importantly, a subset of tumors harboring activating KIT mutations have been found to respond to c-Kit inhibitor-based therapy, with improved patient survival at advanced tumor stages. We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series. Furthermore, we identify SF3B1 mutations as a recurrent genetic event in mucosal melanomas. Our findings provide an insight into the genetic diversity of anorectal melanomas, and suggest significant potential for alternative targeted therapeutics in addition to c-Kit inhibitors for this melanoma subtype.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 14 October 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.179.",

In a quest for alternative therapy targets, we had previously identified Signal Sequence Receptor 2 (SSR2) as a gene with high expression in a subgroup of human primary melanomas. Now we show that SSR2 exerts a prosurvival functionality in human melanoma cells and that high expression levels of SSR2 are associated with an unfavourable disease outcome in primary melanoma patients. Consistent with SSR's role in translocation of proteins from the ribosome across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, our data supports induction of SSR2 as a part of the ER stress response. This response included SSR2 upregulation upon development of therapy resistance to BRAF inhibitors, as well as the dependency of cell survival of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells on SSR2. Complementary gain and loss of function data showed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to ER stress as an inducer of SSR2 via transcriptional regulation through X-Box Binding Protein 1s (XBP1s) and support an ER stress-UPR-Transcription Factor XBP1s-SSR2 response axis in human melanocytic cells. Together with its dispensability for survival in normal human cells, these data propose SSR2 as a potential therapeutic target in (therapy-resistant) human melanoma. ",

Currently, dual BRAF and MEK inhibition are ongoing in clinical trials with the goal of overcoming the acquired resistance that has unfortunately developed in some vemurafenib patients. FDG-PET measures of metabolic activity are increasingly employed as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for guiding single-agent or combination therapies by gauging initial drug response and monitoring disease progression. However, since tumors are inherently heterogeneous, investigating the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition on FDG uptake in a panel of different melanomas could help interpret imaging outcomes.;18 F-FDG uptake was measured in vitro in cells with wild-type and mutant (V600) BRAF, and in melanoma cells with an acquired resistance to vemurafenib. We treated the cells with vemurafenib alone or in combination with MEK inhibitor GDC-0973. PET imaging was used in mice to measure FDG uptake in A375 melanoma xenografts and in A375 R1, a vemurafenib-resistant derivative. Histological and biochemical studies of glucose transporters, the MAPK and glycolytic pathways were also undertaken.;We demonstrate that vemurafenib is equally effective at reducing FDG uptake in cell lines harboring either heterozygous or homozygous BRAFV600 but ineffective in cells with acquired resistance or having WT BRAF status. However, combination with GDC-0973 results in a highly significant increase of efficacy and inhibition of FDG uptake across all twenty lines. Drug-induced changes in FDG uptake were associated with altered levels of membrane GLUT-1, and cell lines harboring RAS mutations displayed enhanced FDG uptake upon exposure to vemurafenib. Interestingly, we found that vemurafenib treatment in mice bearing drug-resistant A375 xenografts also induced increased FDG tumor uptake, accompanied by increases in Hif-1α, Sp1 and Ksr protein levels. Vemurafenib and GDC-0973 combination efficacy was associated with decreased levels of hexokinase II, c-RAF, Ksr and p-MEK protein.;We have demonstrated that 18 F-FDG-PET imaging reflects vemurafenib and GDC-0973 action across a wide range of metastatic melanomas. A delayed post-treatment increase in tumor FDG uptake should be considered carefully as it may well be an indication of acquired drug resistance.;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01271803.",

The selected CoMFA model gives the best statistical values (q(2) = 0.753, r(2) = 0.962).

The actual predictive powers of both models were rigorously validated with an external test set, which gave satisfactory predictive r(2) values for CoMFA and CoMSIA models, 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. In addition, y-randomization test was also performed to validate our 3D-QSAR models.

However, there have been few RIP3 inhibitors reported as yet. B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors are an important anticancer drug class for metastatic melanoma therapy. In this study, we found that 6 B-Raf inhibitors could inhibit RIP3 enzymatic activity in vitro. Among them, dabrafenib showed the most potent inhibition on RIP3, which was achieved by its ATP-competitive binding to the enzyme. Dabrafenib displayed highly selective inhibition on RIP3 over RIP1, RIP2 and RIP5. Moreover, only dabrafenib rescued cells from RIP3-mediated necroptosis induced by the necroptosis-induced combinations, that is, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Fas ligand plus Smac mimetic and the caspase inhibitor z-VAD. Dabrafenib decreased the RIP3-mediated Ser358 phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and disrupted the interaction between RIP3 and MLKL. Notably, RIP3 inhibition of dabrafenib appeared to be independent of its B-Raf inhibition. Dabrafenib was further revealed to prevent acetaminophen-induced necrosis in normal human hepatocytes, which is considered to be mediated by RIP3. In acetaminophen-overdosed mouse models, dabrafenib was found to apparently ease the acetaminophen-caused liver damage. The results indicate that the anticancer B-Raf(V600E) inhibitor dabrafenib is a RIP3 inhibitor, which could serve as a sharp tool for probing the RIP3 biology and as a potential preventive or therapeutic agent for RIP3-involved necroptosis-related diseases such as acetaminophen-induced liver damage.

Ipilimumab is the first agent associated with a documented improved overall survival benefit in this patient population. A striking attribute of CTLA-4 blockade is the durability of objective responses, leading to speculation of a possible cure for some patients. Many tumor responses achieved with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibition were durable in the phase I trials and were seen in a higher proportion of patients with melanoma than typically observed with ipilimumab. Biomarker development to identify the subset of patients with melanoma who will achieve durable clinical benefit with checkpoint blockade is critical; tumor PD-L1 expression has been promising in early studies. The contrast between unprecedented response rates but limited durability of responses achieved with BRAF and MEK inhibition in BRAF(V600)-mutated melanoma and the impressive durability but relatively low rate of response achieved with immune checkpoint blockade is striking. Preclinical data on potential synergies between CTLA-4/PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and MAPK-targeted therapy is emerging, and combined immune checkpoint blockade and MAPK inhibition are being explored in clinical trials. Other promising approaches to increase the number of patients with melanoma who benefit from durable responses with immune checkpoint blockade include concurrent or sequenced CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and combination with other immunotherapeutic strategies.

Activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS are the source of extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway activation. We show that melanoma cell lines, originating in different metastatic sites, with BRAF or NRAS mutations, in addition to active mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK, also have highly activated stress activated protein kinase (SAPK)-p38. This is in direct contrast to carcinoma cells in which the activity of the two kinases appears to be mutually exclusive; high level of p38 activity inhibits, through a negative feedback, ERK activity and prevents tumorigenesis. Melanomas are insensitive to ERK inhibition by p38 and utilize p38-signaling pathway for migration and growth in vivo. We found a positive functional loop linking the high ERK activity to surface expression of alphaVbeta3-integrin. This integrin, by interacting with vitronectin, induces p38 activity and increases IL-8 production, enhancing cell migration. Because the negative loop from p38 to ERK is lost, the two kinases can remain simultaneously activated. Inhibition of ERK and p38 activities is more effective in blocking in vivo growth than inhibition of each kinase individually. Future therapies might have to consider targeting of both pathways.",

Data analysis using stringent criteria revealed several upregulated and downregulated genes in cell lines with B-RAF and N-RAS mutations compared with cell lines without mutations. We found 29 genes specifically upregulated and 32 genes downregulated in cell lines with B-RAF mutations, whereas 70 genes were upregulated and 39 downregulated in cell lines with N-RAS mutations; 11 genes showed overlapping upregulation and 45 downregulation. The micro-array data for nine selected genes were validated by the real-time PCR technique. Expression of a large number of genes, that encode members or regulators of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways or are involved in metastasis or invasion, was affected in cell lines with mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS. Upregulated genes in cell lines with mutations included dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), sprouty 2 (SPRY2), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (AKT3) and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14); downregulated genes included interleukin 18 (IL18), Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) and inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2).

Initial success in targeting this pathway is evidenced by the high percentage of melanoma patients who undergo tumor remission. However, the beneficial effects of these targeted therapies are usually short-lived due to the development of resistance, which leads to disease progression. As a result, studies have focused on the acquired forms of resistance that develop following continued exposure to therapy. Conversely, far fewer studies have investigated the adaptive forms of resistance, which activate rapidly, promote cell survival, and may underlie the development of acquired resistance by providing melanoma cells the time to develop additional mutations.

Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the cells by hemocytometer. ERβ transcriptional activity was evaluated by gene reporter assay. Global DNA methylation was analyzed by restriction enzyme assay and ERβ isoforms were identified by qRT-PCR. We demonstrated that ERβ is expressed in a panel of human melanoma cell lines (BLM, WM115, A375, WM1552). In BLM (NRAS-mutant) cells, ERβ agonists significantly and specifically inhibited cell proliferation. ERβ activation triggered its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of ERβ agonists was associated with an altered expression of G1-S transition-related proteins. In these cells, global DNA was found to be hypomethylated when compared to normal melanocytes; this DNA hypomethylation status was reverted by ERβ activation. ERβ agonists also decreased the proliferation of WM115 (BRAF V600D-mutant) cells, while they failed to reduce the growth of A375 and WM1552 (BRAF V600E-mutant) cells. Finally, we could observe that ERβ isoforms are expressed at different levels in the various cell lines. Specific oncogenic mutations or differential expression of receptor isoforms might be responsible for the different responses of cell lines to ERβ agonists.;Our results demonstrate that ERβ is expressed in melanoma cell lines and that ERβ agonists differentially regulate the proliferation of these cells.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) identified two groups corresponding to thin and thick melanomas. The most striking difference between them was the much greater abundance of SCNAs in thick melanomas, whereas mutation frequency did not significantly change between the two groups. We found novel mutations and focal SCNAs in genes that are embryonic regulators of axon guidance, predominantly in thick melanomas. Analysis of publicly available microarray datasets provided further support for a potential role of Ephrin receptors in melanoma progression. In addition, we have identified a set of SCNAs, including amplification of BRAF and ofthe epigenetic modifier EZH2, that are specific for the group of thick melanomas that developed metastasis during the follow-up.

Primary sites of origin include the head and neck, anorectum and vulvovaginal regions. It is uniquely different from cutaneous melanoma with respect to epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis. The etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, exposure to UV light is not an apparent risk factor. Furthermore, distinct molecular features including a lower incidence of BRAF oncogene mutations but a higher incidence of KIT oncogene mutations suggest divergent genetic etiologies. Mucosal melanomas generally present at a later stage, are more aggressive and carry a worse prognosis regardless of the stage at diagnosis. Establishing standardized treatment guidelines has been challenging due to the rarity of the disease. Early detection provides the best chance at survival but is often difficult due to anatomic location. Surgery remains the primary therapeutic intervention if complete resection is technically feasible given the anatomic location. Radiotherapy may be used to achieve local control when resection is not feasible, or adjuvantly to enhance locoregional control, but most studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival. There are no consensus guidelines on the optimal systemic therapy, and regimens are often extrapolated from data based on therapies used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the company and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) final decision in October 2014. The clinical evidence for dabrafenib was derived from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BREAK-3) involving 230 patients randomized 2:1 to receive either dabrafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) was reported in the dabrafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. Vemurafenib is considered a more appropriate comparator than is dacarbazine. The clinical evidence for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib, the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted. Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) generated by the company were £60,980 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and £11,046 per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus vemurafenib. The ERG considered the economic model structure developed by the company to derive the ICERs to be overly complex and based on unsubstantiated assumptions, most importantly in relation to the projection of OS. Applying the latest OS data from BREAK-3 to a less complex model structure increased the estimated ICER for dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine from £60,980 to £112,727 per QALY gained. Since the results from the ITC were considered by the ERG to be neither reliable nor robust, the ERG also considered a cost-effectiveness comparison to be inappropriate due to a lack of meaningful or reliable data. In spite of limitations in the data, the AC took the view that dabrafenib and vemurafenib were \"likely\" of similar clinical effectiveness. Since the overall costs of these two drugs were similar, the AC recommended the use of dabrafenib in patients with unresectable, advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. ",

New data on targeted therapies confirmed previous findings, with combined BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) plus MEK inhibitor (cobimetinib) improving progression-free survival (PFS) compared to vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive tumors (CoBRIM trial). Positive results were also seen with combined dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E/K metastatic melanoma and encorafenib plus binimetinib in BRAFV600-mutant cutaneous melanoma. Even more interesting news centered on the use of combination immunotherapy, in particular the randomized, double-blind CheckMate 067 study in which median PFS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was 11.5 months, compared to 2.9 months with ipilimumab alone (HR 0.42) and 6.9 months with nivolumab alone (HR 0.57). Of interest, in patients with ≥5% PD-L1 expression, median PFS was 14 months with the combination or with nivolumab alone compared with 3.9 months in the ipilimumab group, while in the PD-L1 negative cohort, the combination remained superior to both monotherapies. Given that combination therapy was accompanied by a high occurrence of side-effects, this raises the suggestion that combination therapy might be reserved for PD-L1 negative patients only, with PD-L1 positive patients achieving the same benefit from nivolumab monotherapy. However, overall survival data are awaited and the equivalence of single agent to the combination remains unconvincing. Interesting data were also reported on the combination of T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec) with ipilimumab, and the anti-PD-1 agent MEDI4736 (durvolumab) combined with dabrafenib plus trametinib. Emerging data also suggested that predictive markers based on immunoprofiling and mismatch repair deficiency may be of clinical use. In conclusion, the use of combination approaches to treat patients with melanoma, as well as other cancers, is no longer a just a wish for the future but is today a clinical reality with a rapidly growing evidence-base. Moreover, the most exciting consideration is that this is far from the end of the story, but rather a fantastic introduction.",

Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis and DNA sequencing, 557 consecutively-collected CMM patients originating from South Italy were screened for CDKN2A germline mutations; subsets of them were screened for mutations in the BRAF and BRCA2 genes. Seven CDKN2A mutations were detected in 14 (2.5%) CMM patients. Relative risk of carrying a CDKN2A mutation for CMM patients was demonstrated to significantly increase with the presence of familial recurrence of melanoma (risk ratio (RR)=6.31; p=0.0009), multiple primary melanomas (RR=3.43; p=0.0014), and early onset age (RR=4.56; p=0.0026). All CDKN2A mutations were observed in non-Sardinian patients (14/441; 3.2%), whereas BRAF and BRCA2 genes were found mutated in Sardinian patients (3/116; 2.6%). Such indicators of the presence of CDKN2A mutations will be useful in counselling patients about undergoing genetic testing. Our findings strongly suggest that mutation rates of candidate cancer genes may deeply vary among CMM patients from different geographical areas.",

Instead, they are characterized by activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, two highly homologous α subunits of Gαq/11 heterotrimeric G proteins, and in PLCB4 (phospholipase C β4), the downstream effector of Gαq signaling. We analyzed genomics data from 136 uveal melanoma samples and found a recurrent mutation in CYSLTR2 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) encoding a p.Leu129Gln substitution in 4 of 9 samples that lacked mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, and PLCB4 but in 0 of 127 samples that harbored mutations in these genes. The Leu129Gln CysLT2R mutant protein constitutively activates endogenous Gαq and is unresponsive to stimulation by leukotriene. Expression of Leu129Gln CysLT2R in melanocytes enforces expression of a melanocyte-lineage signature, drives phorbol ester-independent growth in vitro, and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. Our findings implicate CYSLTR2 as a uveal melanoma oncogene and highlight the critical role of Gαq signaling in uveal melanoma pathogenesis. ",

While melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, the ability to prime immunity with vaccines has not generally translated into objective disease regression.

The mechanism by which CSPG4 affects melanoma progression is only partly understood, in particular the involvement of other receptor tyrosine kinases and the tumor microenvironment. We have previously reported on a mimotope-based vaccine against CSPG4 in a human melanoma xenograft model that resulted in reduction of tumor growth. Herein we describe the influence of hypoxia on the response to polyclonal anti-CSPG4-antibodies induced by this vaccine in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib to enhance therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously targeting multiple signaling pathways. Melanoma cells were treated with polyclonal anti-CSPG4-antibodies and vemurafenib. Proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated in a real-time setting in the impedance-based x-CELLigence® system. Western blotting and quantitative PCR arrays were used to determine protein and mRNA expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and signaling pathway proteins. A melanoma xenograft model was used to detect HIF1α and CAIX expression in vivo. Hypoxia enhanced the antiproliferative response to vemurafenib. The migration and invasion capacities of vemurafenib-treated melanoma cells were increased, in spite of vemurafenib-decreased expression of HIF1α and CAIX. Polyclonal anti-CSPG4-antibodies reduced the Transwell migration of vemurafenib-treated, BRAF V600E-mutant and CSPG4-expressing melanoma cells in hypoxia. This was associated with the downregulation of phosphorylated AKT, a kinase contributing to tumor cell migration. Our results highlight CSPG4 as a potential target for modulating treatment resistance to vemurafenib induced by the hypoxic microenvironment.",

We review the most common cutaneous adverse events associated with vemurafenib, based on data from clinical trials, and our own experiences of treating patients in trials and clinical practice.

This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemical analysis using an N-Ras (Q61R) antibody to detect the presence of the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma patients. A total of 98 primary cutaneous melanomas that have undergone examination of NRAS mutation were retrieved from a multicentric database. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanoma tissues were analyzed for BRAF and NRAS mutations by independent, blinded observers using both conventional DNA molecular techniques and immunohistochemistry with the novel anti-human N-Ras (Q61R) monoclonal antibody (clone SP174). The antibody showed a sensitivity of 100% (14/14) and a specificity of 100% (83/83) for detecting the presence of an NRASQ61R mutation. Of the NRAS-mutated cases, none of the non-Q61R cases stained positive with the antibody (0/7). There were three cases with discordant NRAS mutational results. Additional molecular analysis confirmed the immunohistochemically obtained NRAS result in all cases, suggesting that a multiple analytical approach can be required to reach the correct sample classification. The reported immunohistochemical method is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma patients, and represents a valuable supplement to traditional mutation testing. If validated in further studies, genetic testing would only be required for immunohistochemistry-negative patients to detect non-Q61R mutations. ",

However, various observations suggest that other melanoma susceptibility genes have not yet been identified. To search for new susceptibility loci, we used the MeLiM swine as an animal model of hereditary melanoma to perform a genome scan for linkage to melanoma. Founders of the affected MeLiM stock were crossed with each other and with healthy Duroc pigs, generating MeLiM, F1 and backcross families. As we had previously excluded the MeLiM CDKN2A gene, we paid special attention to CDK4 and MC1R, as well as to other candidates such as BRAF and the SLA complex, mapping them on the swine radiation hybrid map and/or isolating close microsatellite markers to introduce them into the genome scan. The results revealed, first, that swine melanoma was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance, preferably in black animals. Second, 4 chromosomal regions potentially involved in melanoma susceptibility were identified on Sus Scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 1, 2, 7 and 8, respectively, in intervals 44-103, 1.9-18, 59-73 and 47-62 cM. A fifth region close to MC1R was revealed on SSC 6 by analyzing an individual marker located at position 7.5 cM. Lastly, CDK4 and BRAF were unlikely to be melanoma susceptibility genes in the MeLiM swine model. The 3 regions on SSC 1, 6 and 7, respectively, have counterparts on human chromosomes (HSA) 9p, 16q and 6p, harboring melanoma candidate loci. The 2 others, on SSC 2 and 8, have counterparts on HSA 11 and 4, which might therefore be of interest for human studies.",

Despite the implied importance of PI3K signaling in PTENNull melanomas, mutational activation of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα (PIK3CA), is rarely detected. Since PTEN has both PI3-lipid phosphatase-dependent and -independent tumor suppressor activities, we investigated the contribution of PI3K signaling to BRAFV600E-induced melanomagenesis using mouse models, cultured melanoma cells, and PI3K pathway-targeted inhibitors. These experiments revealed that mutationally activated PIK3CAH1047R cooperates with BRAFV600E for melanomagenesis in mice. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PI3Ks prevented growth of BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas in vivo and in tissue culture. Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E and PI3K had more potent effects on the regression of established BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas and cultured melanoma cells than individual blockade of either pathway. Surprisingly, growth of BRAFV600E/PIK3CAH1047R melanomas was dependent on the protein kinase AKT; however, AKT inhibition had no effect on growth of BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas. These data indicate that PTEN silencing contributes a PI3K-dependent, but AKT-independent, function in melanomagenesis. Our findings enhance our knowledge of how BRAFV600E and PI3K signaling cooperate in melanomagenesis and provide preclinical validation for combined pathway-targeted inhibition of PI3K and BRAFV600E in the therapeutic management of BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"The cullin-based CRL4-CDT2 ubiquitin ligase is emerging as a master regulator of cell proliferation. CRL4-CDT2 prevents re-initiation of DNA replication during the same cell cycle \"rereplication\" through targeted degradation of CDT1, SET8 and p21 during S-phase of the cell cycle. We show that CDT2 is overexpressed in cutaneous melanoma and predicts poor overall and disease-free survival. CDT2 ablation inhibited a panel of melanoma cell lines through the induction of SET8- and p21-dependent DNA rereplication and senescence. Pevonedistat (MLN4924), a specific inhibitor of the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), inhibits the activity of cullin E3 ligases, thereby stabilizing a vast number of cullin substrates and resulting in cancer cell inhibition in vitro and tumor suppression in nude mice. We demonstrate that pevonedistat is effective at inhibiting the proliferation of melanoma cell lines in vitro through the induction of rereplication-dependent permanent growth arrest as well as through a transient, non-rereplication-dependent mechanism. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated heterozygous deletion of CDKN1A (encoding p21) or SET8 in melanoma cells demonstrated that the rereplication-mediated cytotoxicity of pevonedistat is mediated through preventing the degradation of p21 and SET8 and is essential for melanoma suppression in nude mice. By contrast, pevonedistat-induced transient growth suppression was independent of p21 or SET8, and insufficient to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Pevonedistat additionally synergized with the BRAF kinase inhibitor PLX4720 to inhibit BRAF melanoma, and suppressed PLX4720-resistant melanoma cells. These findings demonstrate that the CRL4-CDT2-SET8/p21 degradation axis is the primary target of inhibition by pevonedistat in melanoma and suggest that a broad patient population may benefit from pevonedistat therapy.;The identification of new molecular targets and effective inhibitors is of utmost significance for the clinical management of melanoma. This study identifies CDT2, a substrate receptor for the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase, as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma. CDT2 is required for melanoma cell proliferation and inhibition of CRL4(CDT2) by pevonedistat suppresses melanoma in vitro and in vivo through the induction of DNA rereplication and senescence through the stabilization of the CRL4(CDT2) substrates p21 and SET8. Pevonedistat also synergizes with vemurafenib in vivo and suppresses vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. These findings show a significant promise for targeting CRL4(CDT2) therapeutically.",

The mutational rate was 36.7% in patients with disease-free course and 51.7% in those with subsequent distant metastasis (p = 0.031). No difference in overall survival (p = 0.119) but a trend for worse distant-metastasis-free survival (p = 0.061) was observed in BRAF mutant compared to BRAF wild-type patients.

An interesting significant prognostic impact was observed in patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less, with the mutation present in 6 of 7 patients dying from melanoma. In conclusion, no significant survival differences were found according to BRAF-V600 tumor mutations in patients with primary melanoma but an increasing impact of the mutational status was observed in the subgroup of patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less.

The development of small-molecule inhibitors that mimic natural antagonists of either antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family or the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), known as BH3- or SMAC-mimetics, respectively, are helping us to understand the mechanisms behind apoptotic resistance. Studies using BH3-mimetics indicate that the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein MCL-1 and its antagonist NOXA are particularly important regulators of BCL-2 family signaling, while SMAC-mimetic studies show that both XIAP and the cIAPs must be targeted to effectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells.

We found that STIM1 and Orai1 isoforms were abundantly expressed in human melanoma tissues and multiple melanoma/melanocyte cell lines. We confirmed that these cell lines exhibited SOCE, which was inhibited by knockdown of STIM1 or Orai1, or by a pharmacological SOCE inhibitor. Inhibition of SOCE suppressed melanoma cell proliferation and migration/metastasis. Induction of SOCE was associated with activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and was inhibited by inhibitors of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) or Raf-1, suggesting that SOCE-mediated cellular functions are controlled via the CaMKII/Raf-1/ERK signaling pathway.

Prognostication by current clinicopathological parameters does not provide sufficient means for identifying patients who are at risk of developing metastases and in need of adjuvant therapy. Actin-regulating formins may account for invasive properties of cancer cells, including melanoma. Here, we studied formin-like protein 2 and 3 (FMNL2 and FMNL3) in melanoma by analysing their role in the invasive properties of melanoma cells and by evaluating whether FMNL2 expression is associated with melanoma outcome. Immunohistochemical characterization of FMNL2 in a cohort of 175 primary cutaneous stage I-II melanomas indicated that high FMNL2 reactivity correlates with poor outcome as evaluated by recurrence free survival (p < 0.0001) or disease specific survival (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, Breslow's thickness (p < 0.05) and FMNL2 expression (p < 0.001) remained as independent prognostic factors. Cellular studies revealed that FMNL2 is a component of filopodia in many melanoma cell lines. Inhibition of either FMNL2 or the closely related FMNL3 affected the maintenance of melanoma cell morphology and reduced migration. Finally, inhibition of the BRAF, PI3K and MAPK oncogenic pathways markedly reduced expression of both FMNL2 and FMNL3 in melanoma cells. The results suggest a major role for FMNL2/FMNL3 formins in melanoma biology and raise the possibility that the novel targeted melanoma drugs may interfere with the cellular properties regulated by these formins.

When comparing melanoma deceased patients who had extremely high levels of S-100β, (2.2+0.45 μg/L) we showed significantly lower levels in alive patients (0.26+0.02 μg/L) and certainly in normal controls (0.07+0.02 μg/L). In individual patients, kinetic evaluations showed earlier response to therapy, or recurrence and non-response, as shown only later by CT evaluations.;S-100β can serve as a useful biomarker for the assessment of treatment response and prognosis, especially after using new immunological treatments, such as anti-BRAF, ipilimumab or anti-PD1 in malignant melanoma patients. Additional biomarkers, such as LDH, β2M and TK may also serve as part of a biomarkers panel, for improved detection of recurrence and metastasis of melanoma patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The genetic alterations contributing to melanoma pathogenesis are incompletely defined, and few independent prognostic features have been identified beyond the clinicopathological characteristics of the primary tumor. We used transcriptome profiling of 46 primary melanomas, 12 melanoma metastases, and 16 normal skin (N) samples to find genes associated with melanoma development and progression. Results were confirmed using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR and replicated in an independent set of 330 melanomas using AQUA analysis of tissue microarray (TMA). Transcriptome profiling revealed that transcription factor HMGA2, previously unrecognized in melanoma pathogenesis, is significantly upregulated in primary melanoma and metastases (P-values=1.2 × 10(-7) and 9 × 10(-5)) compared with N. HMGA2 overexpression is associated with BRAF/NRAS mutations (P=0.0002). Cox proportional hazard regression model and log-rank test showed that HMGA2 is independently associated with disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR)=6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.8-22.3, P=0.004), overall survival (OS) (stratified log-rank P=0.008), and distant metastases-free survival (HR=6.4, 95% CI=1.4-29.7, P=0.018) after adjusting for American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and age at diagnosis. Survival analysis in an independent replication TMA of 330 melanomas confirmed the association of HMGA2 expression with OS (P=0.0211). Our study implicates HMGA2 in melanoma progression and demonstrates that HMGA2 overexpression can serve as an independent predictor of survival in melanoma.",

It was recently reported that gain-of-function KIT mutations and/or copy number increases are more common in mucosal and acral melanomas. Thus, we studied the frequency and pattern of KIT aberrations in mucosal and acral melanomas in Korea. We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case. Of the 97 mucosal or acral melanoma specimens, 49 were tested for KIT gene copy number changes using quantitative PCR. Increased KIT copy number was identified in 15 patients: seven (40%) of 20 acral melanomas and eight (31%) of 26 mucosal melanomas. Our study implicates that a significant proportion of acral and mucosal melanomas have KIT mutations in Asian population.",

As many as 14% of high grade and up to 66% of certain subtypes of low grade pediatric glioma have the BRAFV600E mutation. Small molecule inhibitors that selectively target BRAFV600E are FDA approved for melanoma and have shown significant efficacy in treating BRAFV600E glioma in pre-clinical trials. Despite showing initial anti-tumor activity, acquired drug resistance significantly limits the benefit from being treated with BRAFV600E inhibitors. Here, we have identified molecular responses to BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment in human glioma models that have substantial clinical implications. Specifically, we show that BRAFV600E inhibitor resistant cells upregulate pro-survival mediators such as Wnt, and additionally increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity, including EGFR and Axl, promoting resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition. Our results suggest strategies to circumvent acquired resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitor therapy, and thereby improve outcomes for patients with BRAFV600E gliomas.",

Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and altered expression of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin are critical for melanoma development and progression. Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1), a Ras family member of the small GTPases, has emerged as a key mediator in these two important processes. In this study, we have shown Rap1 activation in cells derived from two human metastatic melanomas and also in three of seven cutaneous metastatic melanoma tissues. We found increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity in the tumors with detected Rap1 activity that interestingly harbored neither BRAF nor N-Ras mutation, suggesting a role for Rap1 in ERK activation in vivo. We also showed Rap1 and ERK activation by both hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (an activator of Epac, a Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor) in two human melanoma cell lines. In addition, the activation of ERK by HGF was reduced, at least in part, by small interfering RNAs against Rap1 and a dominant-negative Rap1. Finally, a functional role for Rap1 activation was shown by Rap1-induced alpha(v)beta(3) integrin activation and consequent increased melanoma cell migration in vitro. Taken together, these results show that Rap1 is involved in the activation of MAPK pathway and integrin activation in human melanoma and suggest a potential role for Rap1 in melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis.",

We analyzed 15 conventional melanomas (CMs), 3 melanomas arising in congenital nevi (CNMs), and 5 spitzoid melanomas (SMs), using various platforms, including whole genome or exome sequencing, the molecular inversion probe assay, and/or targeted sequencing. CMs demonstrated a high burden of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with each case containing a TERT promoter (TERT-p) mutation, 13/15 containing an activating BRAF V600 mutation, and >80% of the identified SNVs consistent with UV damage. In contrast, the three CNMs contained an activating NRAS Q61 mutation and no TERT-p mutations. SMs were characterized by chromosomal rearrangements resulting in activated kinase signaling in 40%, and an absence of TERT-p mutations, except for the one SM that succumbed to hematogenous metastasis. We conclude that pediatric CM has a very similar UV-induced mutational spectrum to that found in the adult counterpart, emphasizing the need to promote sun protection practices in early life and to improve access to therapeutic agents being explored in adults in young patients. In contrast, the pathogenesis of CNM appears to be distinct. TERT-p mutations may identify the rare subset of spitzoid melanocytic lesions prone to disseminate.",

Clinical evidence has revealed that p16(INK4A), an allosteric inhibitor of CDK4/6, is inactivated in over half of human melanomas, and numerous animal models have demonstrated that p16(INK4A) deletion promotes melanoma. FBXO4, a specificity factor for the E3 ligase that directs timely cyclin D1 proteolysis, has not been studied in melanoma. We demonstrate that Fbxo4 deficiency induces Braf-driven melanoma and that this phenotype depends on cyclin D1 accumulation in mice, underscoring the importance of this ubiquitin ligase in tumor suppression. Furthermore, we have identified a substrate-binding mutation, FBXO4 I377M, that selectively disrupts cyclin D1 degradation while preserving proteolysis of the other known FBXO4 substrate, TRF1. The I377M mutation and Fbxo4 deficiency result in nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1, a key transforming neoplastic event. Collectively, these data provide evidence that FBXO4 dysfunction, as a mechanism for cyclin D1 overexpression, is a contributor to human malignancy. ",

Their stemness potential was confirmed in vivo by limiting dilution assays. We explored the sensitivity of eGFP+mCSCs to chemotherapy (CHT), BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) or CIK cells, as single agents or in sequence, in vitro. First, we treated MCs in vitro with fotemustine or dabrafenib (BRAF-mutated cases); then surviving MCs, enriched in mCSCs, were challenged with autologous CIK cells. CIK cell activity against chemoresistant mCSCs was confirmed vivo in two distinct immunodeficient murine models.;We visualized eGFP+mCSCs (14±2.1%) in 11 MCs. The tumorigenic precursor rate in vivo was higher within eGFP-positive MCs (¼2) compared with the eGFP-negative counterpart (¼870). In vitro mCSCs were relatively resistant to CHT and BRAFi, but killed by CIK cells (n=11, 8/11 autologous), with specific lysis ranging from 95% (E/T 40:1) to 20% (E/T 1:3). In vivo infusion of autologous CIK cells into mice bearing xenografts from 3 distinct melanoma demonstrated significant tumor responses involving CHT-spared eGFP+mCSCs (p=0.001).
