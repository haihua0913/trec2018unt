Mutation specific antibodies against NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins could offer additional data on tumor heterogeneity. The specificity and sensitivity of NRAS(Q61R) immunohistochemistry have recently been reported excellent. We aimed to determine the utility of immunohistochemistry using SP174 anti-NRAS(Q61R) and VE1 anti-BRAF(V600E) antibodies in the theranostic mutation screening of melanomas.;142 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 79 patients were analyzed using pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry.;23 and 26 patients were concluded to have a NRAS-mutated or a BRAF-mutated melanoma respectively. The 23 NRAS (Q61R) and 23 BRAF (V600E) -mutant samples with pyrosequencing were all positive in immunohistochemistry with SP174 antibody and VE1 antibody respectively, without any false negative. Proportions and intensities of staining were varied. Other NRAS (Q61L) , NRAS (Q61K) , BRAF (V600K) and BRAF (V600R) mutants were negative in immunohistochemistry. 6 single cases were immunostained but identified as wild-type using pyrosequencing (1 with SP174 and 5 with VE1). 4/38 patients with multiple samples presented molecular discordant data. Technical limitations are discussed to explain those discrepancies. Anyway we could not rule out real tumor heterogeneity.;In our study, we showed that combining immunohistochemistry analysis targeting NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins with molecular analysis was a reliable theranostic tool to face challenging samples of melanoma.",

Our studies with melanoma tumor cells that are BRAF(V600E/K) and BRAF(WT) showed that, paradoxically, while PLX4032 inhibited ERK1/2 in the highly sensitive BRAF(V600E/K), it activated the pathway in the resistant BRAF(WT) cells, via RAF1 activation, regardless of the status of mutations in NRAS or PTEN. The persistently active ERK1/2 triggered downstream effectors in BRAF(WT) melanoma cells and induced changes in the expression of a wide-spectrum of genes associated with cell cycle control. Furthermore, PLX4032 increased the rate of proliferation of growth factor-dependent NRAS Q61L mutant primary melanoma cells, reduced cell adherence and increased mobility of cells from advanced lesions. The results suggest that the drug can confer an advantage to BRAF(WT) primary and metastatic tumor cells in vivo and provide markers for monitoring clinical responses.",

The mutant NRAS subset of melanoma is more aggressive and associated with poorer outcomes compared to non-NRAS mutant melanoma. The aggressive nature and complex molecular signaling conferred by this transformation has evaded clinically effective treatment options. This review examines the major downstream effectors of NRAS relevant in melanoma and the associated advances made in targeted therapies that focus on these effector pathways. We outline the history of MEK inhibition in mutant NRAS melanoma and recent advances with newer MEK inhibitors. Since MEK inhibitors will likely be optimized when combined with other targeted therapies, we focus on recently identified targets that can be used in combination with MEK inhibitors. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"GAB2 is a scaffold protein with diverse upstream and downstream effectors. MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are known effectors of GAB2. It is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human tumors including melanoma. Here we show a previously undescribed role for GAB2 in NRAS-driven melanoma. Specifically, we found that GAB2 is co-expressed with mutant NRAS in melanoma cell lines and tumor samples and its expression correlated with metastatic potential. Co-expression of GAB2(WT) and NRAS(G12D) in melanocytes and in melanoma cells increased anchorage-independent growth by providing GAB2-expressing cells a survival advantage through upregulation of BCL-2 family of anti-apoptotic factors. Of note, collaboration of GAB2 with mutant NRAS enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo and led to an increased vessel density with strong CD34 and VEGFR2 activity. We found that GAB2 facilitiated an angiogenic switch by upregulating HIF-1α and VEGF levels. This angiogenic response was significantly suppressed with the MEK inhibitor PD325901. These data suggest that GAB2-mediated signaling cascades collaborate with NRAS-driven downstream activation for conferring an aggressive phenotype in melanoma. Second, we show that GAB2/NRAS signaling axis is non-linear and non-redundant in melanocytes and melanoma, and thus are acting independent of each other. Finally, we establish a link between GAB2 and angiogenesis in melanoma for the first time. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that GAB2 is a novel regulator of tumor angiogenesis in NRAS-driven melanoma through regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF expressions mediated by RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling.

        "Doc_abstract":"NRAS mutations are a common oncogenic event in skin cancer, occurring frequently in congenital nevi and malignant melanoma. To study the role of NRAS in zebrafish, a transgenic approach was applied to generate fish that express human oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) under the control of the melanocyte-restricted mitfa promoter. By screening the progeny of the injected animals, two strains stably expressing the NRAS transgene were identified: Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(1) and Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(2). Stable expression of this transgene results in hyperpigmented fish displaying a complete ablation of the normal pigment pattern. Although oncogenic NRAS expression alone was found to be insufficient to promote tumor formation, loss of functional p53 was found to collaborate with NRAS expression in the genesis of melanoma. The tumors derived from these animals are variably pigmented and closely resemble human melanoma. Underscoring the pathological similarities between these tumors and human disease and suggesting that common pathways are similar in these models and human disease, gene set enrichment analysis performed on microarray data found that the upregulated genes from zebrafish melanomas are highly enriched in human tumor samples. This work characterizes two zebrafish melanoma models that will be useful tools for the study of melanoma pathogenesis.",

However, cutaneous melanoma is a heterogeneous disease with many clinicopathologic subtypes. Of these, the majority fits into four categories: superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM). Thus far, there is very limited data combining BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis to explore differences between cutaneous melanoma subtypes. The aim of this study was to address this issue.;The frequency of BRAF and NRAS hotspot mutations, in exons 15 and 2, respectively, was assessed in 59 cutaneous melanomas comprising superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and ALM using single-strand conformational polymorphism and RFLP-PCR analysis.;Only 2 of 21 (9.5%) ALM showed BRAF exon 15 mutation compared with 9 of 14 (64.3%) superficial spreading malignant melanomas, 4 of 11 (36.4%) nodular melanomas, and 7 of 13 (53.4%) lentigo maligna melanomas (P < 0.01). However, our key finding is that the combined analysis of BRAF exon 15 and NRAS exon 2 showed that there were no significant differences in the overall mutation frequency between subtypes. In particular, 9 of 19 (47.4%) ALM without BRAF exon 15 mutation had an NRAS exon 2 mutation.;We show that the overall BRAF/NRAS frequency in mutation hotspots is not significantly different among cutaneous melanoma subtypes.

In melanoma, aberrant neuroblastoma-RAS (NRAS) signaling fuels tumor progression in about 20% of patients. Current therapeutics for NRAS-driven malignancies barely affect overall survival. To date, pathway interference downstream of mutant NRAS seems to be the most promising approach. In this study, data revealed that mutant NRAS induced Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) expression, and pharmacologic inhibition of Plk1 stabilized the size of NRAS mutant melanoma xenografts. The combination of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and Plk1 inhibitors resulted in a significant growth reduction of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro, and regression of xenografted NRAS mutant melanoma in vivo. Independent cell cycle arrest and increased induction of apoptosis underlies the synergistic effect of this combination. Data further suggest that the p53 signaling pathway is of key importance to the observed therapeutic efficacy. This study provides in vitro, in vivo, and first mechanistic data that an MEK/Plk1 inhibitor combination might be a promising treatment approach for patients with NRAS-driven melanoma. As mutant NRAS signaling is similar across different malignancies, this inhibitor combination could also offer a previously unreported treatment modality for NRAS mutant tumors of other cell origins.

Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition. Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify nonobvious coextinction target(s) for combined pharmacological inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanomas.",

D. Anderson Cancer Center. Analyses were performed to identify significant associations of mutations with tumor and patient characteristics and with survival from the diagnosis of stage IV disease.;The genotypes of the full cohort (n = 677) were 47% BRAF mutation, 20% NRAS mutation, and 32% wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (\"WT\").

Among patients with nonuveal melanoma who underwent mutation testing within 6 months of stage IV diagnosis (n = 313), patients with NRAS mutations had a median survival of 8.2 months from stage IV diagnosis, which was shorter than the median survival of WT patients (15.1 months; P = .004). Multivariate analysis of this population incorporating age, sex, metastases (M1) category, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and mutation status confirmed that NRAS mutations are associated independently with decreased overall survival (vs WT; P = .005; hazard ratio, 2.05).;Patients with BRAF or NRAS mutations were more likely than WT patients to have central nervous system involvement at the time they were diagnosed with distant metastatic disease.

By laser microdissection we were able to selectively dissect and genotype cells either from the nevus or from the melanoma part of 46 melanomas that developed in association with a nevus. In 25 cases we also genotyped a control nevus of the same patients. Available tissue was also immunostained using the BRAF(V600E)-mutation specific antibody VE1.

No significant differences in the distribution of BRAF or NRAS mutations could be found between melanoma and associated nevi or between melanoma associated nevi and control nevi. In concordant cases immunohistochemistry showed a higher expression (intensity of immunohistochemistry) of the mutated BRAF(V600E)-protein in melanomas compared to their associated nevi.

Detailed histological (biopsy and post-mortem) studies, tissue culture, and high-resolution cytogenetic analysis, including chromosome and array comparative genomic hybridization, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, and Sanger sequencing, were performed on tissues from a white male who succumbed at 17 months of age to congenital melanoma associated with a bathing-trunk nevus. We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the biology of congenital melanocytic proliferations, showing that amplification of mutated NRAS seems to represent a new genetic mechanism leading to melanoma in the context of neurocutaneous melanocytosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

        "Doc_abstract":"Although targeting the V600E activating mutation in the BRAF gene, the most common genetic abnormality in melanoma, has shown clinical efficacy in melanoma patients, response is, invariably, short lived. To better understand mechanisms underlying this acquisition of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy in previously responsive melanomas, we induced vemurafenib resistance in two V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cell lines, A375 and DM443, by serial in vitro vemurafenib exposure. The resulting approximately 10-fold more vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, A375rVem and D443rVem, had higher growth rates and showed differential collateral resistance to cisplatin, melphalan, and temozolomide. The acquisition of vemurafenib resistance was associated with significantly increased NRAS levels in A375rVem and D443rVem, increased activation of the prosurvival protein, AKT, and the MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and P38, which correlated with decreased levels of the MAPK inhibitor protein, GSTP1. Despite the increased NRAS, whole exome sequencing showed no NRAS gene mutations. Inhibition of all three MAPKs and siRNA-mediated NRAS suppression both reversed vemurafenib resistance significantly in A375rVem and DM443rVem. Together, the results indicate a mechanism of acquired vemurafenib resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cells that involves increased activation of all three human MAPKs and the PI3K pathway, as well as increased NRAS expression, which, contrary to previous reports, was not associated with mutations in the NRAS gene. The data highlight the complexity of the acquired vemurafenib resistance phenotype and the challenge of optimizing BRAF-targeted therapy in this disease. They also suggest that targeting the MAPKs and/or NRAS may provide a strategy to mitigate such resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma. ",

Recently, our lab showed that simultaneous activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and targeted inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by PLX4720 synergistically induces apoptosis across a spectrum of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines. As a follow-up to that study, treatment of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma lines with WNT3A and the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 also induces apoptosis. The susceptibility of BRAF-mutant lines and NRAS-mutant lines to apoptosis correlates with negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by ERK/MAPK signaling and dynamic decreases in abundance of the downstream scaffolding protein, AXIN1. Apoptosis-resistant NRAS-mutant lines can sensitize to AZD6244 by pretreatment with AXIN1 siRNA, similar to what we previously reported in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicate that NRAS-mutant melanoma share with BRAF-mutant melanoma the potential to regulate apoptosis upon MEK inhibition through WNT3A and dynamic regulation of cellular AXIN1. Understanding the cellular context that makes melanoma cells susceptible to this combination treatment will contribute to the study and development of novel therapeutic combinations that may lead to more durable responses.",

While BRAF inhibitors are initially effective for BRAF-mutant melanoma, no FDA-approved targeted therapies exist for BRAF-inhibitor-resistant BRAF(V600), NRAS mutant, or wild-type melanoma.;The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SCH772984, a novel inhibitor of ERK1/2, was determined in a panel of 50 melanoma cell lines. Effects on MAPK and AKT signaling by western blotting and cell cycle by flow cytometry were determined.;Sensitivity fell into three groups: sensitive, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 1 μM; intermediately sensitive, IC50 1-2 μM; and resistant, >2 μM. Fifteen of 21 (71%) BRAF mutants, including 4 with innate vemurafenib resistance, were sensitive to SCH772984. All three (100%) BRAF/NRAS double mutants, 11 of 14 (78%) NRAS mutants and 5 of 7 (71%) wild-type melanomas were sensitive. Among BRAF(V600) mutants with in vitro acquired resistance to vemurafenib, those with MAPK pathway reactivation as the mechanism of resistance were sensitive to SCH772984. SCH772984 caused G1 arrest and induced apoptosis.;Combining vemurafenib and SCH722984 in BRAF mutant melanoma was synergistic in a majority of cell lines and significantly delayed the onset of acquired resistance in long term in vitro assays. Therefore, SCH772984 may be clinically applicable as a treatment for non-BRAF mutant melanoma or in BRAF-mutant melanoma with innate or acquired resistance, alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors.",

To test this notion, we analyzed the presence of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in 170 melanomas with established NRAS/BRAF mutational status and well-documented clinical follow-up by immunohistochemistry. Several notable observations were obtained: (i) phospho-ERK staining was very heterogeneous within the tumor; (ii) in most cases, ERK was phosphorylated in only a minority of tumor cells; (iii) the percentage of phospho-ERK-positive cells was not correlated with the mutational status of NRAS and/or BRAF; (iv) the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) was expressed homogeneously in virtually all melanoma samples not reflecting the inhomogeneity of phospho-ERK; and, finally, (v) neither the portion of phospho-ERK-positive tumor cells nor the RKIP staining intensity showed any correlation to the clinical course of the patients. Furthermore, the ability of BRAF mutant melanoma cells to downregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was shown in melanoma cell lines cultured at high densities or under nonadherent conditions.

In mice, activation of a RAS-containing pathway is a necessary step in the pathogenesis of murine melanomas. Because PTEN negatively regulates on the downstream effects of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), we hypothesized that the loss of PTEN/MMAC1 and the activation of RAS may be largely equivalent because RAS is a known positive upstream regulator of PI3-K. We expanded our previous survey of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations and analyzed the RAS status of 53 cutaneous melanoma cell lines, 18 glioma cell lines, and 17 uncultured cutaneous melanoma metastasis. Overall, 51% of the cell lines had alterations in either PTEN/MMAC1 or RAS. We found 16 cell lines (30%) with alterations in PTEN/MMAC1 and 11 cell lines (21%) with activating NRAS mutations; only 1 cell line had concurrent alterations in both genes. Moreover, glioma cell lines with a high frequency of PTEN/MMAC1 inactivation had no identifiable RAS alterations. Ectopic expression of PTEN in several cutaneous melanoma cell lines suppressed colony formation irrespective of PTEN/MMAC1 status; furthermore, PTEN expression in cell lines carrying activated RAS also suppressed colony formation. The relative reciprocity of PTEN/MMAC1 abrogation and NRAS activation suggests that the two genetic changes, in a subset of cutaneous melanomas, are functionally overlapping.",

We aimed to assess the use of MEK162, a small-molecule MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with NRAS-mutated or Val600 BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma.;In our open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 study, we assigned patients with NRAS-mutated or BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma to one of three treatment arms on the basis of mutation status. Patients were enrolled at university hospitals or private cancer centres in Europe and the USA. The three arms were: twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for NRAS-mutated melanoma, twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma, and twice-daily MEK162 60 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors was permitted, but previous MEK inhibitor therapy was not allowed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an objective response (ie, a complete response or confirmed partial response). We report data for the 45 mg groups. We assessed clinical activity in all patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 and in patients assessable for response (with two available CT scans). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01320085, and is currently recruiting additional patients with NRAS mutations (based on a protocol amendment).;Between March 31, 2011, and Jan 17, 2012, we enrolled 71 patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 45 mg. By Feb 29, 2012 (data cutoff), median follow-up was 3·3 months (range 0·6-8·7; IQR 2·2-5·0). No patients had a complete response. Six (20%) of 30 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma had a partial response (three confirmed) as did eight (20%) of 41 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma (two confirmed). The most frequent adverse events were acneiform dermatitis (18 [60%] patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and 15 [37%] patients with the BRAF-mutated melanoma), rash (six [20%] and 16 [39%]), peripheral oedema (ten [33%] and 14 [34%]), facial oedema (nine [30%] and seven [17%]), diarrhoea (eight [27%] and 15 [37%]), and creatine phosphokinase increases (11 [37%] and nine [22%]). Increased creatine phosphokinase was the most common grade 3-4 adverse event (seven [23%] and seven [17%]). Four patients had serious adverse events (two per arm), which included diarrhoea, dehydration, acneiform dermatitis, general physical deterioration, irregular heart rate, malaise, and small intestinal perforation.

Therefore, in recent years the search for new molecules that inhibit these proteins has been intensified. After many years with no new treatments for melanoma, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved vemurafenib. However, many patients have already acquired resistance and have experienced severe side effects. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate a new set of compounds including allylic isothiouronium salts (1, 2 and 3), N-phenyl-substituted analog (4) and isothiosemicarbazide salts (5 and 6) for their potential antimelanoma activity. To this end, viability assay, cell cycle analysis, expression of NRAS and BRAF, as well as migration and invasion assay were performed with different melanoma cell lines. Isothiouronium salts 1-3 presented CC50 (concentration required to reduce the cell number by 50%) in a range of 7-28 μM. Furthermore, salt 1 significantly decreased the expression of NRAS. However, cells incubated with these salts did not disturb the cell cycle phases; instead, an increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed. Regarding potential antiinvasion effects, both 1 and 2 prevented cell migration as well as cell invasion. Finally, when salts 1 and 2 were associated with vemurafenib, a marked decrease in cell viability was observed when compared to the compounds incubated alone. Briefly, the salts exhibited interesting results, especially 1, which decreased the expression of NRAS, increased apoptotic cells and, when combined with vemurafenib, resulted in a synergistic effect. Therefore, we intend to test compound 1 in pre-clinical studies.",

Overall, mutations in NRAS or BRAF were found in 242 of 294 tumours (82%) and were found to be mutually exclusive in all but two cases (0.7%). Multiple metastases were analysed in 57 of the cases and mutations were identical in all except three, indicating that BRAF and NRAS mutations occur before metastasis. Association with preexisting nevi was significantly higher in BRAF mutated tumours (P=0.014). In addition, tumours with BRAF mutations showed a significantly more frequent moderate to pronounced infiltration of lymphocytes (P=0.013).

Reduced gene dosage at MTAP showed a borderline association with BRAF mutation (P = 0.04) and reduced gene dosage at the interferon gene cluster was borderline associated with wild type NRAS (P = 0.05). Reduced gene dosage in the CDKN2A regions coding for CDKN2A was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P = 0.03).

Single-dose experiments showed a decreased survival after transfection with MYC, wild-type NRAS or mutated NRAS. Co-transfection with MYC and mutated NRAS decreased survival up to 4 Gy, whereas at higher doses no shift in radiosensitivity was seen. Flow cytometry data indicated that differences in radiosensitivity could be explained at least in part by a difference in the distribution of cells in the phases of the cell cycle. After transfection of cells with either NRAS or MYC, the number of cells in G1 phase decreased with a concomitant increase of cells in the G2/M phase. When the cell line transfected with activated NRAS was manipulated so that the distribution of the cells in the phases of the cell cycle resembled th at of the parental line at the time of irradiation, the survival of the cells was improved. Similar experiments with the cell line containing MYC did not result in an alteration of the distribution of the cells in the cycle, or the survival after single-dose fractions, suggesting the presence of a distinct mechanism for influencing radiation sensitivity. Both NRAS and MYC transfection decrease the radiation sensitivity of human melanoma cells, but the underlying mechanisms seem different.

Both baseline and induced activation of the growth factor signaling was assessed by immunoblot analysis of the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors Erk1/2. Low baseline and higher inducibility of the signaling pathway was characteristic in double wild-type cells. In contrast, oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutation did not influence the response to EGF or FGF receptor inhibitors in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that the oncogenic mutations in melanoma have a profound impact on the motogenic effect of the activation of growth factor receptor signaling. Since emerging molecularly targeted therapies aim at the growth factor receptor signaling, the appropriate mutational analysis of individual melanoma cases is essential in both preclinical studies and in the clinical trials and practice.

A considerable divergence in the spectrum of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides was noted at the cell line level. The unification of genotype-specific cell line data revealed the enrichment for the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins to be associated with the presence of a BRAF mutation and oncogenic NRAS to be associated with increased receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators (cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin dependent kinase 2, and cyclin dependent kinase 3), MAPK pathway components (Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2), interferon regulators (tyrosine kinase-2), GTPase regulators (Ras-Rasb interactor 1), and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A) were common to all genotypes. Treatment of a BRAF-mutant/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) null melanoma cell line with vemurafenib led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, phospholipase C1, and β-catenin with increases in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, signal transduction and activator of signaling 3, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α noted. In NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEK inhibition led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway components, Src family kinases, and protein kinase Cδ with decreased phosphorylation seen in STAT3 and ERK1/2. Together these data present the first systems level view of adaptive and basal phosphotyrosine signaling in BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma. ",

Several candidate genes are localized at this sequence; however, their role in melanoma has not been clearly defined. The aim of this study was to develop an accurate method for determining the amplification pattern of six candidate genes that map to this amplicon core and to elucidate the possible relationship between BRAF, NRAS mutations and CCND1 copy number alterations, all of which are key components of the MAP kinase pathway. Characterization of gene copy numbers was performed by quantitative PCR and, as an alternative method, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to define the CCND1 amplification pattern at the single cell level. Samples with amplified CCND1 (32%) were further analyzed for copy number alterations for the TAOS1, FGF3, FGF19, FGF4 and EMS1 genes. Co-amplification of the CCND1 and TAOS1 was present in 15% of tumors and was more frequent in ulcerated lesions (P=0.017). Furthermore, 56% of primary melanomas had either BRAF or NRAS mutations, but these two mutations were not present in any of the lesions analyzed. Of these cases, 34% also had CCND1 amplification. There was a significant relationship between NRAS activating mutations and UV exposure (P=0.005). We did not find correlations between CCND1 gene amplification status and any of the patients' clinicopathological parameters. However, CCND1 amplification simultaneously with either BRAF or NRAS activation mutations was observed mainly in primary tumors with ulcerated surfaces (P=0.028). We assume that co-amplification of these candidate genes in the 11q13 region or CCND1 gene alterations along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone.",

One key is to better understand the cross-talk between epidermal keratinocytes and pigment-producing melanocytes. Here, using a bigenic mouse model system combining mutant oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) (constitutively active RAS) or mutant activated CDK4(R24C/R24C) (prevents binding of CDK4 by kinase inhibitor p16(INK4A)) with an epidermis-specific knockout of the nuclear retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα(ep-/-)) results in increased melanoma formation after chronic ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation compared with control mice with functional RXRα. Melanomas from both groups of bigenic RXRα(ep-/-) mice are larger in size with higher proliferative capacity, and exhibit enhanced angiogenic properties and increased expression of malignant melanoma markers. Analysis of tumor adjacent normal skin from these mice revealed altered expression of several biomarkers indicative of enhanced melanoma susceptibility, including reduced expression of tumor suppressor p53 and loss of PTEN, with concomitant increase in activated AKT. Loss of epidermal RXRα in combination with UVB significantly enhances invasion of melanocytic cells to draining lymph nodes in bigenic mice expressing oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) compared with controls with functional RXRα. These results suggest a crucial role of keratinocytic RXRα to suppress formation of UVB-induced melanomas and their progression to malignant cancers in the context of driver mutations such as activated CDK4(R24C/R24C) or oncogenic NRAS(Q61K).;These findings suggest that RXRα may serve as a clinical diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma progression and metastasis.",

Towards finding new pharmacological strategies that overcome NRAS mutant melanoma, we performed a cell proliferation-based combination screen using a collection of well-characterized small molecule kinase inhibitors and α-Mangostin. We found that α-Mangostin significantly enhances Sorafenib pharmacological efficacy against an NRAS mutant melanoma cell line. The synergistic effects of α-Mangostin and Sorafenib were associated with enhanced inhibition of activated AKT and ERK, induced ER stress, and reduced autophagy, eventually leading to apoptosis. The structure of α-Mangostin resembles several inhibitors of the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). MITF expression, which is regulated by RXR, was modulated by α-Mangostin. Molecular docking revealed that α-Mangostin can be accommodated by the ligand binding pocket of RXR and may thereby compete with RXR-mediated control of MITF expression.

In WT/WT melanoma cells displaying high levels of phospho-ErbB3, knockdown of NRG1 reduced cell viability and was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ErbB3, its coreceptor ErbB2, and its downstream target, AKT. Similar effects were observed by targeting ErbB3 with either siRNAs or the neutralizing ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies huHER3-8 and NG33. In addition, pertuzumab-mediated inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization decreased AKT phosphorylation, cell growth in vitro, and xenograft growth in vivo. Pertuzumab also potentiated the effects of MEK inhibitor on WT/WT melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate that targeting ErbB3-ErbB2 signaling in a cohort of WT/WT melanomas leads to tumor growth reduction.

To look for evidence of progression from Spitz naevi to spitzoid melanoma, HRAS was analysed in 21 spitzoid melanomas, with no mutations identified. The binomial probability of this was 0.03 based on an assumption of a 15% mutation frequency in Spitz naevi with unbiased progression. Under these assumptions, HRAS mutations must be rare/absent in spitzoid melanoma. Thus, Spitz naevi seem unlikely to progress into spitzoid melanoma, implying that ambiguous spitzoid tumours cannot be intermediate degrees of progression. In addition, the data suggest that HRAS mutation is a potential marker of benign behaviour, in support of which none of three HRAS mutant spitzoid cases metastasized.;First, the morphological similarity of spitzoid tumours reflects an underlying molecular similarity, namely a relative lack of dependence on BRAF/NRAS mutations.

We first analyzed a panel of 52 melanoma cell lines (n = 35, 11, 6 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization for unique alterations that associate with each mutation subgroup. Subsequently, those DNA copy number changes that correlated with a mutation subgroup were used to predict the mutation status of an independent panel of 43 tumors (n = 17, 13, 13 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively). BRAF mutant tumors were classified with a high rate of success (74.4%, P = 0.002), whereas NRAS mutants were not significantly distinguished from wild types (26/43, P = 0.12).

In order to explore the antitumor activity of prenylation inhibition we investigated the response to zoledronic acid treatment in thirteen human melanoma cell lines with known BRAF, NRAS and PTEN mutational status. Effect of zoledronic acid on proliferation, clonogenic potential, apoptosis and migration of melanoma cells as well as the activation of downstream elements of the RAS/RAF pathway were investigated in vitro with SRB, TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays and videomicroscopy and immunoblot measurements, respectively. Subcutaneous and spleen-to-liver colonization xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the influence of zoledronic acid treatment on primary and disseminated tumor growth of melanoma cells in vivo. Zoledronic acid more efficiently decreased short-term in vitro viability in NRAS mutant cells when compared to BRAF mutant and BRAF/NRAS wild-type cells. In line with this finding, following treatment decreased activation of ribosomal protein S6 was found in NRAS mutant cells. Zoledronic acid demonstrated no significant synergism in cell viability inhibition or apoptosis induction with cisplatin or DTIC treatment in vitro. Importantly, zoledronic acid could inhibit clonogenic growth in the majority of melanoma cell lines except in the three BRAF mutant but PTEN wild-type melanoma lines. A similar pattern was observed in apoptosis induction experiments. In vivo zoledronic acid did not inhibit the subcutaneous growth or spleen-to-liver colonization of melanoma cells. Altogether our data demonstrates that prenylation inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach in NRAS mutant melanoma. Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that therapeutic sensitivity might be influenced by the PTEN status of BRAF mutant melanoma cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) can be associated with neurological abnormalities and an increased risk of melanoma. Mutations in NRAS, BRAF, and Tp53 have been described in individual CMN samples; however, their role in the pathogenesis of multiple CMN within the same subject and development of associated features has not been clear. We hypothesized that a single postzygotic mutation in NRAS could be responsible for multiple CMN in the same individual, as well as for melanocytic and nonmelanocytic central nervous system (CNS) lesions. From 15 patients, 55 samples with multiple CMN were sequenced after site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic digestion of the wild-type allele. Oncogenic missense mutations in codon 61 of NRAS were found in affected neurological and cutaneous tissues of 12 out of 15 patients, but were absent from unaffected tissues and blood, consistent with NRAS mutation mosaicism. In 10 patients, the mutation was consistently c.181C>A, p.Q61K, and in 2 patients c.182A>G, p.Q61R. All 11 non-melanocytic and melanocytic CNS samples from 5 patients were mutation positive, despite NRAS rarely being reported as mutated in CNS tumors. Loss of heterozygosity was associated with the onset of melanoma in two cases, implying a multistep progression to malignancy. These results suggest that single postzygotic NRAS mutations are responsible for multiple CMN and associated neurological lesions in the majority of cases. ",

The activation of a Th1 type of immune signature has been shown to confer better prognosis and likelihood to respond to immunotherapy. However, whether such dichotomy depends on the genetic make-up of individual cancers is not known yet. BRAF and NRAS mutations are commonly acquired during melanoma progression. Here we explored the role of BRAF and NRAS mutations in influencing the immune phenotype based on a classification previously identified by our group.;One-hundred-thirteen melanoma metastases underwent microarray analysis and BRAF and NRAS genotyping. Allele-specific PCR was also performed in order to exclude low-frequency mutations.;Comparison between BRAF and NRAS mutant versus wild type samples identified mostly constituents or regulators of MAPK and related pathways. When testing gene lists discriminative of BRAF, NRAS and MAPK alterations, we found that 112 BRAF-specific transcripts were able to distinguish the two immune-related phenotypes already described in melanoma, with the poor phenotype associated mostly with BRAF mutation. Noteworthy, such association was stronger in samples displaying low BRAF mRNA expression. However, when testing NRAS mutations, we were not able to find the same association.;This study suggests that BRAF mutation-related specific transcripts associate with a poor phenotype in melanoma and provide a nest for further investigation.",

In this study, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations in primary melanomas. Tumors from 300 patients with stage I/II melanoma were sequenced for TERT promoter and BRAF/NRAS mutations. Cumulative curves were drawn for patients with and without mutations with progression-free and melanoma-specific survival as outcomes. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the effect of the mutations on survivals. Individually, presence of TERT promoter and BRAF/NRAS mutations associated with poor disease-free and melanoma-specific survival with modification of the effect by the rs2853669 polymorphism within the TERT promoter. Hazard ratio (HR) for simultaneous occurrence of TERT promoter and BRAF/NRAS mutations for disease-free survival was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.4) and for melanoma-specific survival 5.8 (95% CI 1.9-18.3). The effect of the mutations on melanoma-specific survival in noncarriers of variant allele of the polymorphism was significant (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-15.2) but could not be calculated for the carriers due to low number of events. The variant allele per se showed association with increased survival (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). The data in this study provide preliminary evidence that TERT promoter mutations in combination with BRAF/NRAS mutations can be used to identify patients at risk of aggressive disease and the possibility of refinement of the classification with inclusion of the rs2853669 polymorphism within TERT promoter.

Recently, the better results in melanoma treatment were obtained with the mutation-specific inhibitors that have been developed for clinical use and target only patients with particular tumor genotypes. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectrum of \"driver\" mutations in melanoma subtypes from 137 patients with skin melanoma and 14 patients with mucosal melanoma. In total 151 melanoma cases, the frequency of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS mutations was 55.0, 10.6, 4.0, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. BRAF mutations were found in 69% of cutaneous melanoma without UV exposure and in 43% of cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (p=0.045), rarely in acral and mucosal melanomas. Most of melanomas containing BRAF mutations, V600E (92%) and V600K (6.0%) were potentially sensitive to inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib. NRAS mutations were more common in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (26.0%), in acral and mucosal melanomas; the dominant mutations being Q61R/K/L (87.5%). KIT mutations were found in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (8.7%) and mucosal one (28.6%), but not in acral melanoma. Most of KIT mutations were identified in exon 11; these tumors being sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is the first monitoring of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS hotspot mutations in different subtypes of melanoma for Russian population. On the base of data obtained, one can suppose that at the molecular level melanomas are heterogeneous tumors that should be tested for \"driver\" mutations in the each case for evaluation of the potential sensitivity to target therapy.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic and expression alterations of CCND1 with a focus on primary cutaneous melanomas, to define BRAF and NRAS mutation status, and correlate the data with clinical-pathological parameters. CCND1 amplification was associated with ulceration and the localization of the metastasis. After correction for the mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes, CCND1 amplification in samples without such mutations was associated with ulceration and sun exposure. The cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and was correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes. Primary melanomas with BRAF(V600) or NRAS(Q61 ) mutations exhibited lower CCND1 mRNA level. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation, and shorter survival time. These observations suggest that CCND1 alterations are linked to melanoma progression and are modified by BRAF and NRAS mutations. Our data show that CCND1 amplification could have a prognostic relevance in cutaneous melanoma and highlight that altered CCND1 gene expression may influence the metastatic progression, survival, and the localization of metastases.",

This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemical analysis using an N-Ras (Q61R) antibody to detect the presence of the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma patients. A total of 98 primary cutaneous melanomas that have undergone examination of NRAS mutation were retrieved from a multicentric database. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanoma tissues were analyzed for BRAF and NRAS mutations by independent, blinded observers using both conventional DNA molecular techniques and immunohistochemistry with the novel anti-human N-Ras (Q61R) monoclonal antibody (clone SP174). The antibody showed a sensitivity of 100% (14/14) and a specificity of 100% (83/83) for detecting the presence of an NRASQ61R mutation. Of the NRAS-mutated cases, none of the non-Q61R cases stained positive with the antibody (0/7). There were three cases with discordant NRAS mutational results. Additional molecular analysis confirmed the immunohistochemically obtained NRAS result in all cases, suggesting that a multiple analytical approach can be required to reach the correct sample classification. The reported immunohistochemical method is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma patients, and represents a valuable supplement to traditional mutation testing. If validated in further studies, genetic testing would only be required for immunohistochemistry-negative patients to detect non-Q61R mutations. ",

A drug-repositioning screen identified the HIV1-protease inhibitor nelfinavir as potent suppressor of PAX3 and MITF expression. Nelfinavir profoundly sensitizes BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma cells to MAPK-pathway inhibitors. Moreover, nelfinavir is effective in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma cells isolated from patients progressed on MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy and in BRAF/NRAS/PTEN mutant tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Clear cell sarcoma is a rare and malignant soft tissue tumor that shows phenotypic and immunohistochemical overlap with cutaneous malignant melanoma; identification of biomarkers that differentiate clear cell sarcoma from malignant melanoma is therefore needed. In this study, we performed mutation analysis of BRAF and NRAS, investigated the EWSR1 gene rearrangement and evaluated the protein expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 and insulin-like growth factor 1R in 31 cases of malignant melanoma and 16 cases of clear cell sarcoma. By direct sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis, we identified BRAF and NRAS mutations in 51.6% and 12.9% of malignant melanoma cases, respectively, while none of clear cell sarcoma harbored BRAF or NRAS mutations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that 78.6% of clear cell sarcoma exhibited the t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation. The presence of type 1, 2, and 3 EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene transcripts was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, but type 4 and EWSR1/CREB1 fusion gene transcripts were not found. No fusion transcript could be detected in any of the malignant melanoma cases. Additionally, immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of clear cell sarcoma and malignant melanoma had insulin-like growth factor 2 and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 expression; however the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1R was significantly higher in clear cell sarcoma compared to melanoma (p = .006). Our results suggest that the combination of BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis with fusion gene detection contributes to diagnosis of malignant melanoma and clear cell sarcoma, and that insulin-like growth factor 1R might be a novel target for the treatment of these two malignancies.",

Dimericine has been shown to reduce the incidence of basal-cell and squamous cell carcinoma. Unexpectedly, we saw no difference in penetrance or age of onset of melanoma after neonatal UVR between Dimericine-treated and control animals, although the drug reduced DNA damage and cellular proliferation in the skin. Interestingly, epidermal melanocytes removed cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) more efficiently than surrounding keratinocytes. Our study indicates that neonatal UVR-initiated melanomas may be driven by mechanisms other than solely that of a large CPD load and/or their inefficient repair. This is further suggestive of different mechanisms by which UVR may enhance the transformation of keratinocytes and melanocytes.",

We developed a permutation-based framework to address this challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis. Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2), three of which-RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19-harbored recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy. Finally, the spectrum of driver mutations provided unequivocal genomic evidence for a direct mutagenic role of UV light in melanoma pathogenesis.",

As tumours may contain a mixture of mutant and wild type BRAF cells and this has been also put forward as a resistance mechanism, we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity/resistance of six, randomly selected, (WT)BRAF/(WT)NRAS lines to vemurafenib and found four sensitive. The sensitivity to the drug was accompanied by a potent inhibition of both phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT, and a significant induction of apoptosis while absent in lines with intrinsic or acquired resistance. Phospho-CRAF expression was low in all sensitive lines and high in resistant ones, and MEK inhibition can effectively potentiate the drug effect. A possible explanation for CRAF modulation is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a mediator of melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) signalling, since it can actually inhibit CRAF. Indeed, we measured cAMP and found that all four sensitive lines contained significantly higher constitutive cAMP levels than the resistant ones. Consequently, vemurafenib and cAMP stimulator combination resulted in a substantial synergistic effect in lines with both intrinsic and acquired resistance but only restricted to those where cAMP was effectively increased. The use of a cAMP agonist overcame such restriction. In conclusion, we report that (WT)BRAF/(WT)NRAS melanoma lines with low phospho-CRAF and high cAMP levels may be sensitive to vemurafenib and that CRAF inhibition through cAMP stimulation may overcome the resistance to the drug.

This suggests that BRAF and NRAS 'double mutants' may not provide advantage for tumour growth, or may even be selected against during tumorigenesis. However, by applying mutant-allele-specific-amplification-PCR method to short-term melanoma lines, one out of 14 tumours was found to harbour both BRAFV600E and the activating NRASQ61R mutations. On the other hand, analysis of 21 melanoma clones isolated by growth in soft agar from this tumour indicated that 16/21 clones harboured a BRAFV600E, but were wild-type for NRAS, whereas the remaining had the opposite genotype (NRASQ61R/wild-type BRAF). When compared to BRAFV600E clones, NRASQ61R clones displayed reduced growth in soft agar, but higher proliferative ability in vitro in liquid medium and even in vivo after grafting into SCID/SCID mice. These data suggest that NRAS and BRAF activating mutations can coexist in the same melanoma, but are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level.

In a population-based case series from North Carolina, 214 first primary invasive melanoma patients in the year 2000 were interviewed regarding their risk factors. Ambient solar UV exposures were estimated using residential histories and a satellite-based model. Cases were grouped on the basis of BRAF and NRAS somatic mutations, determined using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and radiolabeled DNA sequencing, and the risk profiles of these groups were compared. Mutually exclusive BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant cases occurred at frequencies of 43.0% and 13.6% with mean ages at diagnosis of 47.3 and 62.1 years, respectively. Tumors from patients with >14 back nevi were more likely to harbor either a BRAF mutation [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 3.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.4-7.0] or an NRAS mutation (age-adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.6-4.8) compared with patients with 0 to 4 back nevi. However, BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant tumors were distinctive in that BRAF-mutant tumors were characteristic of patients with high early-life ambient UV exposure (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.3). When ambient UV irradiance was analyzed by decadal age, high exposure at ages 0 to 20 years was associated with BRAF-mutant cases, whereas high exposure at ages 50 and 60 years was characteristic of NRAS-mutant cases. Our results suggest that although nevus propensity is important for the occurrence of both BRAF and NRAS-mutant melanomas, ambient UV irradiance influences risk differently based on the age of exposure. The association of BRAF mutations with early-life UV exposure provides evidence in support of childhood sun protection for melanoma prevention.",

Furthermore, low expression of miR-191 and high expression of miR-193b were associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. In conclusion, our findings show miRNA dysregulation in malignant melanoma and its relation to established molecular backgrounds of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations. The identification of an miRNA classifier for poor survival may lead to the development of miRNA detection as a complementary prognostic tool in clinical practice.",

However, little is known about the expression of various HDACs and their associations with BRAF/NRAS mutation status, clinicopathologic characteristics, and patient outcome. The present study extensively profiled HDAC class 1 and their targets/regulators utilizing immunohistochemistry in human melanoma samples from patients with stage IV melanoma, known BRAF/NRAS mutational status, and detailed clinicopatholgical data. HDAC8 was increased in BRAF-mutated melanoma (P=0.016), however, no association between expression of other HDACs and NRAS/BRAF status was identified. There was also a correlation between HDAC1, HDAC8 expression, and phosphorylated NFκb p65 immunoreactivity (P<0.001). Increased cytoplasmic HDAC8 immunoreactivity was independently associated with an improved survival from both diagnosis of primary melanoma and from first detection of stage IV disease to melanoma death on multivariate analysis (HR 0.992, 95% CI 0.987-0.996; P<0.001 and HR 0.993, 95% CI 0.988-0.998; P=0.009, respectively).

We observed that samples carrying NRAS mutations lie somewhere between those with or without BRAF mutations.

Expression of miR-146a increases the ability of human melanoma cells to proliferate in culture and form tumors in mice, whereas knockdown of miR-146a has the opposite effects. We show these oncogenic activities are due to miR-146a targeting the NUMB mRNA, a repressor of Notch signaling. Previous studies have shown that pre-miR-146a contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (C>G rs2910164). We find that the ability of pre-miR-146a/G to activate Notch signaling and promote oncogenesis is substantially higher than that of pre-miR-146a/C. Analysis of melanoma cell lines and matched patient samples indicates that during melanoma progression pre-miR-146a/G is enriched relative to pre-miR-146a/C, resulting from a C-to-G somatic mutation in pre-miR-146a/C.

This leads to increased PI3K/AKT signaling associated with reduced DNA methylation and increased cell proliferation in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Here, we provide additional data that indicates a reciprocal regulation of PREX2 by PTEN whereby loss of PTEN results in a dramatic increase in expression of PREX2 at the protein level. Pharmacologic studies revealed destabilization of PREX2 by inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling. Additionally, we provide data to show a selective decrease in a particular histone mark, H4 Lys20 trimethylation, in cells expressing PREX2 (E824*) truncating mutation globally and at the imprint control region of CDKN1C (also known as p57) and IGF2. The decrease in H4K20 trimethylation coupled with DNA hypomethylation at this particular locus is associated with genomic imprinting and regulation of expression of p57 and IGF2.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MUP and mucosal melanomas harbor different prevalences of TERT-promoter mutations. Thirty-nine patients with MUP and 53 patients with mucosal melanomas were retrieved. In total, 152 paraffin samples of 92 patients were analyzed, and in 38 patients, multiple samples were tested. Mutational analysis of the TERT-promoter, BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes was carried out. In total, 92 patients were eligible for mutational analysis. TERT-promoter mutations were found in 33 patients (35.9%): chr5, 1,295,228 C>T (18 patients); chr5, 1,295,250 C>T (11 patients); chr5, 1,295,228-229 CC>TT (three patients); chr5, 1,295,242-243 CC>TT (one patient). The mutations were significantly more prevalent in MUP [26 (66.7%)] than in mucosal melanomas [seven patients (13.2%); P<0.001]. In MUP, BRAF mutations were found in 46.2% of patients (18 patients) and NRAS mutations in 28.2% of patients (11 patients). In mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutations were found in 18.9% of patients (10), and BRAF and KIT mutations in 7.5% of patients (four patients), respectively. The prevalence of TERT-promoter mutations was associated with the patient's sex [23 (51.1%) men, 10 (21.3%) women; P=0.004]. No significant correlation was found between TERT-mutation and patient survival. The TERT-promoter genotype of MUP points toward a cutaneous and not mucosal origin.

The importance of RAS signaling as a potential target in cancer is emphasized not only by the prevalence of RAS mutations, but also by the high number of RAS activators and effectors identified in mammalian cells that places the RAS proteins at the crossroads of several, important signaling networks. Ras proteins are crucial crossroads of signaling pathways that link the activation of cell surface receptors with a wide variety of cellular processes leading to the control of proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Furthermore, oncogenic ras proteins interfere with metabolism of tumor cells, microenvironment's remodeling, evasion of the immune response, and finally contributes to the metastatic process. After 40 years of basic, translational and clinical research, much is now known about the molecular mechanisms by which these monomeric guanosine triphosphatase-binding proteins promote cellular malignancy, and it is clear that they regulate signaling pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival, and invasiveness.

Several signaling pathways have been identified as key regulators in melanoma progression, including the frequent activation of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway through the mutant BRAF or NRAS genes. Besides, alterations of CCND1 may also be of great importance. The oncogene plays a significant role in the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle, and its transcriptional activation is primarily carried out by the Ras/MAPK cascade. One of our aims was to determine the genetic and gene expression alterations of CCND1 during melanoma progression, considering the mutation status of BRAF and NRAS genes. Analysis of CCND1 copy number alterations revealed significant association with poor clinical outcome in primary melanomas, which was influenced by the mutation status of BRAF or NRAS in the term of sun exposure. Regarding gene expression, CCND1 mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and were correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation status of BRAF and NRAS. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation and shorter survival time. However, the proportion of cells expressing the protein showed a heterogeneous distribution, influencing the association with clinical-pathological parameters. Therefore melanoma cell lines with different biological behavior were also analyzed for protein expression. These experiments revealed an increasing CCND1 protein level throughout primary cancer progression, which then decreased in the metastasis. The other purpose of our study was to determine the role of 7q31 region in melanoma progression, which was found frequently altered using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). 7q31 is a gene dense locus, including the FRA7G fragile site, which serves as a mutation hot spot. In its close vicinity TES (focal adhesions) and CAV1 (lipid rafts) genes are located. Using interphase FISH, significant associations were found between 7q31 copy number alterations and poor clinical outcome. Both mRNA and protein levels of CAV1 decreased in thick lesions whereas primary melanomas forming multiple metastases were featured by decreased TES mRNA level. ;A melanoma okozta halálozások legfõbb oka a metasztázisok megjelenése, mely a túlélésen túl jelentõsen csökkenti az alkalmazott terápiák hatékonyságát is. Ezért szükséges olyan biomarkerek felkutatása, melyek hozzájárulnak a melanoma prognózisához, és sikeresen alkalmazhatók a terápiás hatékonyság növelésére. Számos jelátviteli útvonal szerepét bizonyították már a melanoma progressziójában. Ezek közül kiemelkedõ jelentõségû a Ras/MAPK útvonal aktivációja. A BRAF- és NRAS-mutációk korai megjelenése mellett fontos, hogy az útvonal egyik fõ célmolekulája a sejtciklus G1/S fázis átmenetét szabályozó CCND1. Vizsgálataink egyik részében a CCND1 genetikai és génexpressziós eltéréseit tanulmányoztuk a melanomaprogresszió során, figyelembe véve a BRAF és NRAS gének mutációs státuszát. Eredményeink a CCND1-kópiaszám eltéréseinek szignifikáns összefüggését tárták fel a kedvezõtlen klinikai kimenetellel primer melanomákban, mely összefüggést befolyásolta a BRAF és NRAS gének mutációs státusza a napsugárzásnak való kitettség függvényében. Génexpressziós vizsgálataink során a CCND1 mRNS-szintjének szignifikáns csökkenését figyeltük meg a többszörös áttétképzõ primer tumorokban, mely korrelációt mutatott mind a BRAF és NRAS mRNS-szintekkel, mind pedig ez utóbbi gének mutációs státuszával. A CCND1 protein fokozott expressziója pedig áttétképzéssel, rövidebb túléléssel és nagyobb Breslow-vastagsággal társult. A CCND1-et kifejezõ sejtek aránya azonban heterogén eloszlást mutatott, mely befolyásolta a klinikopatológiai paraméterekkel való összefüggést. Kísérleteinket ezért eltérõ biológiai karakterû sejtvonalakon végzett vizsgálatokkal egészítettük ki. Ez alapján a progresszió elõrehaladtával a CCND1-expresszió fokozódik, majd az áttétben lecsökken. További célunk volt az array komparatív genomhibridizációs (aCGH) vizsgálatok során gyakori eltérést mutató 7q31-es régió szerepének vizsgálata a melanoma progressziójában. A lókusz rendkívül géndenz, mely magában foglalja a mutációs forrópontként mûködõ FRA7G fragilis helyet. Ennek környezetében lokalizálódik a fokális adhéziók egy kulcsmolekuláját kódoló TES gén, valamint a membrán-lipidtutajok multifunkciós alapköve, a CAV1. Interfázisos FISH-vizsgálataink szignifikáns összefüggést mutattak a 7q31 kópiaszám-eltérései és a kedvezõtlen prognózis között. A CAV1 mRNS-expresszió lecsökkent vastag melanomákban, mely változás fehérjeszinten is tapasztalható volt, míg a TES mRNS-szint csökkenése a többszörös áttétképzõ primer mintákat jellemezte."},

KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative PCR. A subset of cases was evaluated for BRAF and NRAS mutations. Immunohistochemistry was done to assess KIT (CD117) expression.;KIT mutations were detected in 23% (3 of 13) of acral melanomas, 15.6% (7 of 45) of mucosal melanomas, 7.7% (1 of 13) of conjunctival melanomas, 1.7% (1 of 58) of cutaneous melanomas, and 0% (0 of 60) of choroidal melanomas. Almost all the KIT mutations were of the type predicted to be imatinib sensitive. There was no overlap with NRAS mutations (11.1% of acral and 24.3% of mucosal tumors) or with BRAF mutations (absent in mucosal tumors). Increased KIT copy number was detected in 27.3% (3 of 11) of acral and 26.3% (10 of 38) of mucosal melanomas, but was less common among cutaneous (6.7%; 3 of 45), conjunctival (7.1%; 1 of 14), and choroidal melanomas (0 of 28).

Somatic mutations of theses candidate cancer genes were then confirmed using Sanger sequencing.;As expected, BRAF(V600) mutations were seen in 51% of the melanomas, whereas NRAS mutations were seen in 19% of the melanomas. However, PI3K pathway mutations, though more heterogeneous, were present in 41% of the melanoma, with PTEN being the highest mutated PI3K gene in melanomas (22%). Interestingly, several novel PI3K pathway mutations were discovered in MTOR, IRS4, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, PIK3R5, and NFKB1. PI3K pathway mutations co-occurred with BRAF(V600) mutations in 17% of the tumors and co-occurred with 9% of NRAS mutant tumors, implying cooperativity between these pathways in terms of melanoma progression.;These novel PI3K pathway somatic mutations could provide alternative survival and proliferative pathways for metastatic melanoma cells.

We found that a subset of BRAF- and NRAS-mutant human melanomas resistant to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib displayed increased oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α. Notably, all selumetinib-resistant cells with elevated OxPhos could be resensitized by cotreatment with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD8055, whereas this combination was ineffective in resistant cell lines with low OxPhos. In both BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma cells, MEK inhibition increased MITF expression, which in turn elevated levels of PGC1α. In contrast, mTORC1/2 inhibition triggered cytoplasmic localization of MITF, decreasing PGC1α expression and inhibiting OxPhos. Analysis of tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma progressing on BRAF inhibitor ± MEK inhibitor revealed that PGC1α levels were elevated in approximately half of the resistant tumors.

These mutations are found in approximately 50 % of patients with regionally advanced or metastatic melanoma and appear to be one of the initiating steps in the development of primary melanoma. Additional oncogenic events, particularly those that affect tumor suppressor genes, are essential for development of invasive and metastatic melanoma.

Different from genetically engineered models, sporadic canine melanocytic neoplasms share several characteristics with human disease that could make dogs a more relevant preclinical model. Canine melanomas rarely arise in sun-exposed sites.

The spectrum of canine melanocytic neoplasia includes benign lesions with some analogy to nevi, as well as invasive primary melanoma, and widespread metastasis. Growing evidence of distinct subtypes in humans, differing in somatic and predisposing germ-line genetic alterations, cell of origin, epidemiology, relationship to ultraviolet radiation and progression from benign to malignant tumors, may also exist in dogs. Canine and human mucosal melanomas appear to harbor BRAF, NRAS, and c-kit mutations uncommonly, compared with human cutaneous melanomas, although both species share AKT and MAPK signaling activation.

Our data showed gross but nonrandom somatic changes specific to the tumor genome. Although the CDKN2A (78%) and PTEN (70%) loci were the major targets of mono-allelic and bi-allelic deletions, amplifications affected loci with BRAF (53%) and NRAS (12%) as well as EGFR (52%), MITF (40%), NOTCH2 (35%), CCND1 (18%), MDM2 (18%), CCNE1 (10%), and CDK4 (8%). The amplified loci carried additional genes, many of which could potentially play a role in melanoma. Distinct patterns of copy number changes showed that alterations in CDKN2A tended to be more clustered in cell lines with mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes; the PTEN locus was targeted mainly in conjunction with BRAF mutations. Amplification of CCND1, CDK4, and other loci was significantly increased in cell lines without BRAF-NRAS mutations and so was the loss of chromosome arms 13q and 16q. Our data suggest involvement of distinct genetic pathways that are driven either through oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations complemented by aberrations in the CDKN2A and PTEN genes or involve amplification of oncogenic genomic loci and loss of 13q and 16q.

Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

Nine melanoma cell lines were treated with the AMPK activators 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleoside (AICAR) and phenformin. The activation of AMPK enzymatic activity, phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase, in-vitro proliferation, cell cycle, and in-vivo growth of xenografts in nude mice were evaluated. AICAR and phenformin promoted phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of AMPK, as well as phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Drug treatment of either BRAF-mutant or NRAS-mutant melanomas, at doses not inducing cell death, was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in melanoma cell proliferation because of cell cycle arrest in either the G0/G1 or the S phase, associated with an increased expression of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor. Melanomas isolated from subcutaneously implanted mice, 25 days from treatment with AICAR, showed increased staining of the senescence-associated marker β-galactosidase, high p21 expression, and evidence of necrosis.

Checkpoint function was melanoma subtype-specific with \"epithelial-like\" melanoma lines, with wild type NRAS and BRAF displaying an effective checkpoint, while lines with mutant NRAS and BRAF displayed defective checkpoint function. Expression of oncogenic B-Raf in a checkpoint-effective melanoma attenuated G(2) checkpoint function significantly but modestly.

Quantitative trait analysis tools identified mRNA species whose expression was correlated with G(2) checkpoint function in the melanoma lines.

Moreover, GMPS levels are increased in metastatic human melanoma specimens compared with primary melanomas arguing that GMPS is an attractive candidate for anti-melanoma therapy.

Detailed studies of different groups thereafter identified miRNAs with differential expression in benign melanocytes compared with melanoma cell lines or in benign melanocytic lesions compared with melanomas. Among these were let-7a and b, miR-23a and b, miR-148, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-211, miR214, and miR-221 and 222. Some of these miRNAs target well-known melanoma-associated genes like the NRAS oncogene, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT or AP-2 transcription factors (TFAP2). Although we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in malignant melanoma, these findings further underscore the notion of a direct involvement of miRNAs in melanoma biology. Very recently, a prognostic signature of six miRNAs has been identified consisting of miRNAs miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-145, miR-155, and miR-497. High expression of these miRNAs was shown to be associated with improved long-term survival of metastatic patients.",

However, in melanoma-a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease-TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (∼65%) of stage I-IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene. Our results identify MDM4 as a key determinant of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and designate MDM4 as a promising target for antimelanoma combination therapy. ",

The growing insight into the molecular pathology and the discovery of frequent mutations made it possible to define melanoma subgroups suitable for targeted therapies. In approximately 50% of melanomas activating mutations of the BRAF gene were identified and can be treated with specific inhibitors. Further mutations which can be approached by targeted therapies are found on the c-Kit and NRAS genes. Another promising approach is immunotherapy aimed to activate cytotoxic T cells. A monoclonal antibody directed against CTLA-4 was approved after convincing results in clinical trials and antibodies against PD-1 or PD-L1 are currently under clinical investigation.

We herein summarized our experience with 14 metastatic melanomas showing complete loss of immunohistochemical melanocytic markers (with or without heterologous differentiation). Patients included 11 men and 3 women aged 24 to 78 years (median, 67 y). Thirteen patients had histologically confirmed primary skin melanoma, and 1 had metastatic melanoma of unknown primary. Undifferentiated metastasis was diagnosed synchronous to primary tumor (n=1), following skin melanoma by 3 months to 9 years (n=11) and preceding it by 1 year (n=1). Sites of undifferentiated metastases were axillary (3), inguinal (1), or submandibular (1) lymph nodes, digestive tract (2), bone/soft tissue (2), lung/pleura (2), and disseminated (n=3). Histology of metastases mimicked undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma with variable myxoid and giant cell areas (n=10) and cytokeratin-positive undifferentiated small cell sarcoma (n=1). Three cases showed heterologous dedifferentiation: pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), teratocarcinosarcoma-like with prominent rhabdomyoblasts (n=1), and adenocarcinoma-like with metaplastic bone (n=1). All cases were negative for S100, melanoma cocktail, HMB45, Melan A, and SOX10. Other markers showed following results: smooth muscle actin (1/14), p16 (1/14), TP53 (2/12), pancytokeratin (4/14), desmin (5/14), h-caldesmon (0/9), and MDM2/CDK4 (0/5). SMARCB1 was intact in 8/8 cases. Genotyping showed BRAF(V600E) mutation (5/14), NRAS mutation (5/14), and BRAF/NRAS wild-type (4/14). In conclusion, undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is likely underrecognized and frequently mistaken for undifferentiated sarcoma or other neoplasms. Diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma at sites where melanoma metastasis are frequent (eg, inguinal and axillary region) should be made with great caution and warrants exploration of the remote history. Genotyping is a helpful surrogate marker in classifying such difficult cases. In the light of available targeted therapies, recognition of undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is mandatory for appropriate treatment.",

This is in direct contrast to carcinoma cells in which the activity of the two kinases appears to be mutually exclusive; high level of p38 activity inhibits, through a negative feedback, ERK activity and prevents tumorigenesis. Melanomas are insensitive to ERK inhibition by p38 and utilize p38-signaling pathway for migration and growth in vivo. We found a positive functional loop linking the high ERK activity to surface expression of alphaVbeta3-integrin. This integrin, by interacting with vitronectin, induces p38 activity and increases IL-8 production, enhancing cell migration. Because the negative loop from p38 to ERK is lost, the two kinases can remain simultaneously activated. Inhibition of ERK and p38 activities is more effective in blocking in vivo growth than inhibition of each kinase individually. Future therapies might have to consider targeting of both pathways.",

Overall prognosis for advanced disease remains poor, and a lack of effective systemic therapies has prompted investigation into alternative strategies. The identification of novel mutations that instigate and perpetuate melanocyte transformation has offered insight into new treatment approaches, and the subsequent development of targeted treatments appears to be integral to improving melanoma survival. This article reviews the mechanisms of melanoma oncogenesis and classic molecular signalling pathways, targeted treatment approaches based on the molecular model and immunotherapy, and the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies in understanding the complexity of the melanoma pathogenome. In addition to the known somatic activating mutations BRAF and NRAS, exome sequencing has recently identified RAC1, a novel UV-signature gain-of-function mutation. Germline mutations associated with familial melanoma have added a further dimension to the molecular underpinnings of melanoma, implicating BAP1 and MITF as melanoma predisposition genes. Advances in understanding melanoma and implementing targeted treatment strategies will be of increasing importance in this era of personalised medicine. ",

Some promise has been shown in treating certain melanomas by targeting activated signaling pathways resulting from specific mutations in proteins, such as BRAF and NRAS. Recently, the identification of embryonic signaling pathways in melanoma has helped us better understand certain biological characteristics, such as cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity, and has provided novel insight pertinent to diagnosis and therapy. For instance, our studies have shown that the TGF-β family member, Nodal, is expressed in melanoma and is responsible, at least in part, for tumor cell plasticity and aggressiveness. Since the majority of normal adult tissues do not express Nodal, we reason that this embryonic morphogen could be used to identify and target aggressive melanoma cells. We have also identified that molecular cross-talk between the Notch and Nodal pathways may represent a mechanism responsible for the overexpression of Nodal in melanoma. Further exploitation of the relationship between embryonic signaling pathways and cancer pathogenesis could lead to novel approaches for diagnosis and therapy in cancers, such as melanoma.",

In 1967 the eminent American pathologist, Dr Wallace Clark, proposed a histogenetic classification for melanoma in which the disease was subdivided predominantly on the basis of histopathological features of the intra-epidermal component of the tumour adjacent to any dermal invasive component. The subtypes were superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) and nodular melanoma (NM). Whilst additional entities, including acral lentiginous melanoma, mucosal melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma and naevoid melanoma have since been recognised, SSM, LMM and NM remain in the latest (2006) version of the WHO melanoma classification. Clark's histogenetic classification has been criticised because the criteria upon which it is based include clinical features (such as the site of the melanoma) and non-tumourous histopathological features (such as the character of the associated epidermis and the degree of solar elastosis) and also because of overlap in defining features, lack of an independent association with patient outcome and minimal relevance as a determinant of clinical management. However, such criticisms fail to acknowledge its importance in highlighting the myriad of clinical and histological guises of melanoma, which if not recognized by clinicians and pathologists will inevitably lead to a delay in diagnosis and a concomitant adverse clinical outcome. Recently, mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in melanomas involving NRAS (15-20%), BRAF (50%), CKIT (2%), and GNAQ/GNA11 (50% of uveal melanomas) have been identified. This might herald the beginning of a new molecular classification of melanoma in which the biologically distinct subsets share a common oncogenic mechanism, behave clinically in a similar fashion and require similar clinical management. These discoveries are already being successfully exploited as therapeutic targets in clinical trials of metastatic melanoma patients with promising activity. Whilst there remains much to be discovered in this rapidly evolving field, there is already great optimism that more rational and effective therapies for melanoma patients will soon be widely available.",

Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor, with most patients harboring mutations in the BRAF or NRAS oncogenes, leading to the overactivation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. The current therapeutic approaches are based on therapies targeting mutated BRAF and the downstream pathway, and on monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoint blockade. However, treatment resistance and side effects are common events of these therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence supports that melanoma is a hormone-related cancer. Melanoma incidence is higher in males than in females, and females have a significant survival advantage over men. Estrogens exert their effects through estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) that affect cancer growth in an opposite way: ERα is associated with a proliferative action and ERβ with an anticancer effect. ERβ is the predominant ER in melanoma, and its expression decreases in melanoma progression, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Thus, ERβ is now considered as an effective molecular target for melanoma treatment. 17β-estradiol was reported to inhibit melanoma cells proliferation; however, clinical trials did not provide the expected survival benefits.

Historically, systemic therapies have been largely ineffective, because melanoma is usually resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, during the past few years, several targeted therapies have proved effective in this challenging disease. These recent advances have been facilitated by an improved understanding of the driving genetic aberrations of melanoma, particularly mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, demonstrated an overall survival advantage in phase III trials and is an appropriate option for first-line therapy in metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma. Dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, also have been shown to be effective in phase III trials for BRAF mutant melanoma and may be additional treatment options as monotherapy or in combination pending regulatory approval. Additionally, imatinib is a promising targeted therapy for patients whose tumors harbor a KIT mutation in exons 11 and 13. Although these targeted agents cause objective responses and clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, resistance invariably develops. New targets and strategies to overcome acquired resistance are urgently needed.

The expression of HMB45 and Melan A was diffuse and marked in the groups of nodular and superficial spreading melanomas; sarcomatoid and mixed desmoplastic melanomas showed only scattered stained cells; pure desmoplastic melanomas were negative to these markers. SMA immunoexpression was observed in only sarcomatoid and desmoplastic types. Dual S100 staining showed a separate actin-positive myofibroblast-like population disappearing in more cellular zones. EMA, claudin 1, and DOG1 were negative in all cases. BRAFV expression was detected in 14% (in 2 nodular and 1 superficial spreading melanomas) and correlated with the presence of mutation.

Here, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines possessing the RAC1 hotspot variant are resistant to RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib). Enforced expression of RAC1 P29S in sensitive BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines confers resistance manifested by increased viability, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced tumor growth in vivo upon treatment with RAF inhibitors. Conversely, RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous RAC1 P29S in a melanoma cell line with a co-occurring BRAF V600 mutation increased sensitivity to vemurafenib and dabrafenib.

Here, we investigate the role of hnRNP K in the radioresistance of MM cells.;Our results show cytoplasmic expression of hnRNP K in human MM surgical specimens, but not in benign nevi, and a quick dose- and time-dependent upregulation in response to IR accompanied by cytoplasmic redistribution of the protein in the IPC-298 cellular tumor model carrying an activating NRAS mutation (p.Q61L).

External beam radiation therapy is an option for nodal beds where the risk of local recurrence is very high. In-transit melanoma metastases may be treated locally with surgery, immunotherapy, radiation, or heated limb perfusion. For metastatic melanoma, the options include chemotherapy or immunotherapy; targeted anti-BRAF and anti-KIT therapy is under active investigation. Standard chemotherapy yields objective tumor responses in approximately 10%-20% of patients, and sustained remissions are uncommon. Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 yields objective tumor responses in a minority of patients; however, some of these responses may be durable.

To identify downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that could be used as potential additional therapeutic targets for BRAF(V600E) inhibitors, we used hTERT/CDK4R24C/p53DD-immortalized primary human melanocytes genetically modified to ectopically express BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   ) and observed induction of the AP-1 transcription factor family member c-Jun. Using a dominant negative approach, in vitro cell proliferation assays, western blots, and flow cytometry showed that MAPK signaling via BRAF(V600E) promotes melanoma cell proliferation at G1 through AP-1-mediated negative regulation of the INK4 family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (CDKN2C), and the CIP/KIP family member, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A). These effects were antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of CDKN2C and CDKN1A targets CDK2 and CDK4 in vitro. In contrast to BRAF   (   V600E   ) or NRAS   (   G12D   )-expressing melanocytes, melanoma cells have an inherent resistance to suppression of AP-1 activity by BRAF(V600E)- or MEK-inhibitors.

Results were confirmed using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR and replicated in an independent set of 330 melanomas using AQUA analysis of tissue microarray (TMA). Transcriptome profiling revealed that transcription factor HMGA2, previously unrecognized in melanoma pathogenesis, is significantly upregulated in primary melanoma and metastases (P-values=1.2 × 10(-7) and 9 × 10(-5)) compared with N. HMGA2 overexpression is associated with BRAF/NRAS mutations (P=0.0002). Cox proportional hazard regression model and log-rank test showed that HMGA2 is independently associated with disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR)=6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.8-22.3, P=0.004), overall survival (OS) (stratified log-rank P=0.008), and distant metastases-free survival (HR=6.4, 95% CI=1.4-29.7, P=0.018) after adjusting for American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and age at diagnosis. Survival analysis in an independent replication TMA of 330 melanomas confirmed the association of HMGA2 expression with OS (P=0.0211).

We analyzed 15 conventional melanomas (CMs), 3 melanomas arising in congenital nevi (CNMs), and 5 spitzoid melanomas (SMs), using various platforms, including whole genome or exome sequencing, the molecular inversion probe assay, and/or targeted sequencing. CMs demonstrated a high burden of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with each case containing a TERT promoter (TERT-p) mutation, 13/15 containing an activating BRAF V600 mutation, and >80% of the identified SNVs consistent with UV damage. In contrast, the three CNMs contained an activating NRAS Q61 mutation and no TERT-p mutations. SMs were characterized by chromosomal rearrangements resulting in activated kinase signaling in 40%, and an absence of TERT-p mutations, except for the one SM that succumbed to hematogenous metastasis. We conclude that pediatric CM has a very similar UV-induced mutational spectrum to that found in the adult counterpart, emphasizing the need to promote sun protection practices in early life and to improve access to therapeutic agents being explored in adults in young patients.

We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case.

The recent identification of causative genetic alterations has revealed mutations in signaling pathways that offer targets for therapy. Identifying morphologic surrogates that can identify patients whose tumors express such alterations (or functionally equivalent alterations) would be clinically useful for therapy stratification and for retrospective analysis of clinical trial data.;We defined and assessed a panel of histomorphologic measures and correlated them with the mutation status of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS in a cohort of 302 archival tissues of primary cutaneous melanomas from an academic comprehensive cancer center. Melanomas with BRAF mutations showed distinct morphological features such as increased upward migration and nest formation of intraepidermal melanocytes, thickening of the involved epidermis, and sharper demarcation to the surrounding skin; and they had larger, rounder, and more pigmented tumor cells (all p-values below 0.0001). By contrast, melanomas with NRAS mutations could not be distinguished based on these morphological features. Using simple combinations of features, BRAF mutation status could be predicted with up to 90.8% accuracy in the entire cohort as well as within the categories of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Among the variables routinely recorded in cancer registries, we identified age < 55 y as the single most predictive factor of BRAF mutation in our cohort. Using age < 55 y as a surrogate for BRAF mutation in an independent cohort of 4,785 patients of the Southern German Tumor Registry, we found a significant survival benefit (p < 0.0001) for patients who, based on their age, were predicted to have BRAF mutant melanomas in 69% of the cases. This group also showed a different pattern of metastasis, more frequently involving regional lymph nodes, compared to the patients predicted to have no BRAF mutation and who more frequently displayed satellite, in-transit metastasis, and visceral metastasis (p < 0.0001).;Refined morphological classification of primary melanomas can be used to improve existing melanoma classifications by forming subgroups that are genetically more homogeneous and likely to differ in important clinical variables such as outcome and pattern of metastasis. We expect this information to improve classification and facilitate stratification for therapy as well as retrospective analysis of existing trial data.",

Gene expression-based prognostic signatures offer promise, but studies have been challenged by sample scarcity, cohort heterogeneity, and doubts about the efficacy of such signatures relative to current clinical practices. Motivated by new studies that have begun to address these challenges, we reviewed prognostic signatures derived from gene expression microarray analysis of human melanoma tissue. We used REMARK-based criteria to select the most relevant studies and directly compared their signature gene lists. Through functional ontology enrichment analysis, we observed that these independent data sets converge in part upon immune response processes and the G-protein signaling NRAS-regulation pathway, both important in melanoma development and progression. The signatures correctly predicted patient outcome in independent gene expression data sets with some notably low misclassification rates, particularly among studies involving more advanced-stage tumors. This successful cross-validation indicates that gene expression analysis-based signatures are becoming translationally relevant to care of melanoma patients, as well as improving understanding of the aspects of melanoma biology that determine patient outcome.",

But in the setting of melanoma, a highly aggressive and invariably fatal malignancy in its advanced disseminated form, mutation/deletion of p53 is relatively rare, whereas its positive regulator ARF is often lost. Here, we show that genetic deficiency in Arf but not p53 facilitates rapid development of melanoma in a genetically engineered mouse model. This difference is accounted for, at least in part, by the unanticipated observation that, unlike fibroblasts, senescence control in melanocytes is strongly regulated by Arf and not p53. Moreover, oncogenic NRAS collaborates with deficiency in Arf, but not p53, to fully transform melanocytes. Our data demonstrate that ARF and p53, although linked in a common pathway, suppress tumorigenesis through distinct, lineage-dependent mechanisms and suggest that ARF helps restrict melanoma progression by executing the oncogene-induced senescence program in benign nevi. Thus, therapeutics designed to restore wild-type p53 function may be insufficient to counter melanoma and other malignancies in which ARF holds p53-independent tumor suppressor activity.",

Cells were labelled for pericentrin (a centrosomal marker), DNA and α-tubulin, and scored for centrosome morphology, supernumerary centrosomes, and mitotic symmetry. The incidence of supernumerary centrosomes correlated with that of gross centrosomal abnormalities (r = 0.90), mitotic asymmetry (r = 0.90), and, surprisingly, increased content of G/M cells (r = 0.79). Centrosomal numerical dysregulation, observed in all cell lines, was found not to be specifically related to the status of any of the characterized gene mutations that were found in 13/15 cell lines.

Cell lines and tumor models containing either mutant BRAF or NRAS, or wild-type for both, were exposed to small-molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK. Expression of EDNRB was analyzed and the therapeutic impact of combining the anti-EDNRB ADC with the BRAF and MEK inhibitors was assessed. Increased expression of EDNRB in response to inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK was observed and augmented the antitumor activity of the ADC. Enhanced target expression and ADC antitumor activity were realized irrespective of the response of the tumor model to the BRAF or MEK inhibitors alone and could be achieved in melanoma with mutant NRAS, BRAF, or neither mutation. Cells that acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition through long-term culture retained drug-induced elevated levels of EDNRB expression. Expression of EDNRB was not enhanced in normal human melanocytes by inhibition of BRAF and the combination of the ADC with MAPK inhibitors was well-tolerated in mice.

Melanomas also frequently exhibit constitutive activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway that is presumed to induce proliferation, as it does in carcinomas. We show here that, contrary to expectations, stabilized beta-catenin reduces the number of melanoblasts in vivo and immortalizes primary skin melanocytes by silencing the p16(Ink4a) promoter. Significantly, in a novel mouse model for melanoma, stabilized beta-catenin bypasses the requirement for p16(Ink4a) mutations and, together with an activated N-Ras oncogene, leads to melanoma with high penetrance and short latency.

In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival.

Five of the 10 Spitz nevi with BRAF mutations were altered by more than usual cytologic atypia and/or architectural atypia overlapping with dysplastic nevi, or irritation/inflammation; one desmoplastic Spitz nevus had a BRAF mutation. These results indicate that a small subset of Spitz nevi, some with atypical histologic features, possess BRAF mutations. Therefore, the BRAF mutational status does not separate all Spitz nevi from spitzoid melanomas and non-Spitz types of melanocytic proliferations, contrary to previous reports.",

The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic alterations in patients with acral or mucosal melanomas in southern China. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to assess the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) break points. Furthermore, a mass spectrometry-based genotyping platform was used to analyze 30 acral melanomas and 28 mucosal melanomas to profile 238 known somatic mutations in 19 oncogenes. ALK break points were identified in four acral cases (6.9%). Eight (13.8%) cases harbored BRAF mutations, six (10.3%) had NRAS mutations, four (6.9%) had KIT mutations, two (3.5%) had EGFR mutations, two (3.5%) had KRAS mutations, two (3.5%) had MET mutations, one (1.7%) had an HRAS mutation, and one (1.7%) had a PIK3CA mutation. Two cases exhibited co-occurring mutations, and one case with a BRAF mutation had a translocation in ALK. This study represents a comprehensive and concurrent analysis of the major recurrent oncogenic mutations involved in melanoma cases from southern China.

Apoptosis was caspase dependent and associated with G1 cell cycle arrest. All melanoma cells tested had increased levels of the BH3 proapoptotic protein BIM, which appeared to be regulated by the BRD2 BET protein and to some extent by BRD3. In contrast, knockdown experiments indicated that inhibition of BRD4 was associated with decreased levels of BIM. Apoptosis was dependent on BIM in some but not all cell lines, indicating that other factors were determinants of apoptosis, such as downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins revealed in gene expression arrays. G1 cell cycle arrest appeared to be mediated by p21 and resulted from inhibition of the BRD4 protein. The activity of BET protein inhibitors appears independent of the BRAF and NRAS mutational status of melanoma, and further studies to assess their therapeutic role in melanoma are warranted. ",

Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help analyze challenging tumor samples. We report our experience integrating NRASQ61R (SP174) and BRAFV600E (VE1) IHC in routine practice in a cancer molecular genetic platform. All samples screened for BRAF and NRAS mutations during the year 2014 were analyzed by IHC and pyrosequencing, with an independent analysis of the 2 methods. Cases with first-line discordant results benefited from a complementary second-round IHC and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a final interpretation taking into account the results of pyrosequencing, IHC, NGS, and quantification of the tumor cells. We analyzed 111 consecutive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 101 patients. Twenty-two and 11 samples were concordant for BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R mutations, respectively. Second-round analyses of 9 discordant and 1 molecularly inconclusive samples allowed conclusion in 4 further mutated samples (2 BRAFV600E and 2 NRASQ61R). A sample remained NRASQ61R IHC negative but NRASQ61R mutated with molecular methods. Overall, BRAFV600 and NRASQ61 mutation frequencies were 31.7% and 30.7%, respectively. When compared to molecular results, the sensitivity and specificity of IHC were 100% for BRAFV600E IHC and 92.3% and 98.9% for NRASQ61R IHC, respectively. IHC interpretation required a more stringent cutoff for BRAFV600E IHC than NRASQ61R to minimize false results.

The 32 hub genes with the most reproducible survival-related disturbances in co-expression with their protein partner genes included oncogenes and tumor suppressors, previously known correlates of prognosis, and other proteins not previously associated with melanoma outcome. Notably, this network-based gene set could classify patients according to clinical outcomes with 67-80% accuracy among cohorts.

Selective MEK inhibitors, such as selumetinib, have shown clinical benefit in uveal melanoma. However, mechanisms of drug resistance limit their efficacy in some patients. Analysis of MEK inhibitor-resistant uveal melanoma cell lines revealed the induction of RAS protein expression and activity. This effect was mediated by the RNA helicase DDX43, which was remarkably overexpressed in these cells. Depletion of DDX43 in MEK inhibitor-resistant cells decreased RAS proteins and inhibited ERK and AKT pathways. On the contrary, ectopic expression of DDX43 in parental uveal melanoma cells induced RAS protein levels and rendered cells resistant to MEK inhibition. Similar to DDX43 depletion, downregulation of KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS inhibited downstream pathways in the resistant cells, overcoming mutant GNAQ signaling. We also analyzed the expression of DDX43 in liver metastases of patients with uveal melanoma by RT-PCR, and found a significant overexpression of DDX43 in patients who did not benefit from selumetinib therapy. In conclusion, DDX43 induces RAS protein expression and signaling, mediating a novel mechanism of MEK inhibitor resistance.

SBI-756 impaired the eIF4F complex assembly independently of mTOR and attenuated growth of BRAF-resistant and BRAF-independent melanomas.

In this study, we have continued our preclinical studies of riluzole and its effect on melanoma cells alone and in combination with inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway: the AKT inhibitor, API-2, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin. We modeled these combinatorial therapies on various melanoma cell lines in 3D and 2D systems and in vivo. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is more effective at halting melanoma anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor progression than either agent alone. PI3K signaling changes associated with this combinatorial treatment shows that 3D (nanoculture) modeling of cell signaling more closely resembles in vivo signaling than monolayer models. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is effective at halting tumor cell progression independent of BRAF mutational status. This makes this combinatorial therapy a potentially viable alternative for metastatic melanoma patients who are BRAF WT and are therefore ineligible for vemurafenib therapy. ",

Yet, the current classification of melanoma is limited to 4 main subtypes on the basis of clinical and histopathologic features and has shown limited impact on clinical management including prognostication and treatment. Advances in our understanding of the driving molecular pathways in melanoma and the importance of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway have shown that specific activating mutations in oncogenes may correlate with characteristic clinical and histologic features. We evaluated 40 melanoma cases with gains in MYC at 8q24, and we show that their characteristic features include aggressive clinical course, occurrence in nonchronically sun-damaged skin, amelanotic clinical and histopathologic appearance, a nodular or primary dermal growth pattern by histology, frequent epidermal consumption, and infrequent association with a precursor nevus. The v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutation status was also determined. The presence of these mutations was comparable to frequencies previously reported from nonchronically sun-damaged skin. However, the BRAF mutant cases did not show histopathologic features considered characteristic of BRAF mutant melanoma. Considering these distinct clinical and histopathologic features and the possible role as a theragnostic tool, it may be of value to consider 8q24 status in cutaneous melanoma in addition to the mutation status of BRAF in future studies integrating molecular findings into the classification system for cutaneous melanoma.",

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib significantly improved overall survival. However, brain metastases still limit the effectiveness of this therapy. In a series of patients, we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases, but brain metastases developed. This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to treatment resistance in brain metastases. Matched brain and extracerebral metastases from melanoma patients had identical ERK, p-ERK, and AKT immunohistochemistry staining patterns, but there was hyperactivation of AKT (p-AKT) and loss of PTEN expression in the brain metastases. Mutation analysis revealed no differences in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutation status in matched brain and extracerebral metastases. In contrast, AKT, p-AKT, and PTEN expression was identical in monolayer cultures derived from melanoma brain and extracerebral metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells stimulated by astrocyte-conditioned medium showed higher AKT activation and invasiveness than melanoma cells stimulated by fibroblast-conditioned medium. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling resensitized melanoma cells isolated from a vemurafenib-resistant brain metastasis to vemurafenib. Brain-derived factors appear to induce hyperactivation of the AKT survival pathway and to promote the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells in the brain. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling shows potential for enhancing and/or prolonging the antitumor effect of BRAF inhibitors or other anticancer agents in melanoma brain metastases.",

In vitro cell proliferation assays using the sulforhodamine B assay were conducted to determine TAK-733 potency and melanoma responsiveness. In vivo murine modeling with eleven patient-derived melanoma explants evaluated daily dosing of TAK-733 at 25 or 10 mg/kg. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate on-target activity and downstream inhibition by TAK-733 in both in vitro and in vivo studies. TAK-733 demonstrated broad activity in most melanoma cell lines with relative resistance observed at IC50 > 0.1 μmol/L in vitro. TAK-733 also exhibited activity in 10 out of 11 patient-derived explants with tumor growth inhibition ranging from 0% to 100% (P < 0.001-0.03). Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) and NRAS mutational status did not correlate with responsiveness to TAK-733. Pharmacodynamically, pERK was suppressed in sensitive cell lines and tumor explants, confirming TAK-733-mediated inhibition of MEK1/2, although the demonstration of similar effects in the relatively resistant cell lines and tumor explants suggests that escape pathways are contributing to melanoma survival and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TAK-733 exhibits robust tumor growth inhibition and regression against human melanoma cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, suggesting that further clinical development in melanoma is of scientific interest.

As such, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer, including melanomas, which frequently harbour activating mutations in the NRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations, we show that ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome formation, as well as the translation of growth-related messenger RNAs containing a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth in mice. Our findings indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of tumours characterized by deregulated MAPK signalling, such as melanoma.",

Despite this, mice carrying these mutations developed melanoma with very early age of onset after neonatal UVR. Cdk4(R24C) did not affect the MC migration. Instead, independent of UVR exposure, interfollicular dermal MCs were more prevalent in Cdk4(R24C) mice. Subsequently, in adulthood, these mutants developed dermal MC proliferations reminiscent of superficial congenital naevi. Two types of melanoma were observed in this model. The location and growth pattern of the first was consistent with derivation from the naevi, while the second appeared to be of deep dermal origin.

Similarities with uveal melanoma were recently suggested as both entities harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11. Whether primary LMNs share additional genetic alterations with uveal melanoma including copy number variations is unknown. Twenty primary LMNs ranging from benign and intermediate-grade melanocytomas to melanomas were tested by direct sequencing for hotspot mutations in the genes GNA11, GNAQ, BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. Furthermore, the lesions were tested for copy number variations of chromosomes frequently present in uveal melanoma (1p, 3, 6 and 8q) by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Genome-wide analyses of copy number alterations of two leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms were performed using the OncoScan SNP-array. GNAQ(Q209) mutations were present in eleven LMNs, while two of 20 cases carried a GNA11(Q209) mutation. No BRAF, HRAS or NRAS hotspot mutations were detected. Monosomy 3 and gain of 8q were present in one leptomeningeal melanoma, and one intermediate-grade melanocytoma harbored a gain of chromosome 6. With MLPA, the melanocytomas did not show any further gross chromosomal variations. Our data shows that primary LMNs, like uveal melanoma, harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 but lack mutations in BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. This finding may help in the differential diagnosis between a primary LMN and a metastasis from a cutaneous melanoma to the central nervous system.

Tumor-associated ctDNA was detected in the plasma of 35/48 (73%) patients prior to treatment and lower ctDNA levels at this time point were significantly associated with response to treatment and prolonged PFS, irrespective of therapy type. Levels of ctDNA decreased significantly in patients treated with MAPK inhibitors (p < 0.001) in accordance with response to therapy, but this was not apparent in patients receiving immunotherapies. We show that circulating NRAS mutations, known to confer resistance to BRAF inhibitors, were detected in 3 of 7 (43%) patients progressing on kinase inhibitor therapy. Significantly, ctDNA rebound and circulating mutant NRAS preceded radiological detection of progressive disease.

Because heritable mutations in both INK4a and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway predispose individuals to melanoma development, we set out to test the hypothesis that abrogation of NER, by deletion of the xeroderma pigmentosum C (Xpc) gene, will heighten melanoma photocarcinogenesis in an Ink4a-Arf-deficient background. Experimentally, we generated a strain of mice doubly deficient in Xpc and Ink4a-Arf and subjected wild-type, Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf+/+, Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf-/-, and Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice to a single neonatal (day P3) dose of UVB without additional chemical promotion. Indeed, there was a significant increase in the development of dermal spindle/epithelioid cell melanomas in Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf-/- mice when compared with Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice (P = 0.005); wild-type and Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf+/+ mice failed to develop tumors. These neoplasms bore a striking histologic resemblance to melanomas that arise in the Tyr-vHRAS/Ink4a-Arf-/- context and often expressed melanocyte differentiation marker Tyrp1, thus supporting their melanocytic origination. All strains, except wild-type mice, developed pigmented and non-pigmented epidermal-derived keratinocytic cysts, whereas Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice exhibited the greatest propensity for squamous cell carcinoma development. We then screened for NRas, HRas, Kras, and BRaf mutations in tumor tissue and detected a higher frequency of rare Kras(Q61) alterations in tumors from Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf-/- mice compared with Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice (50% versus 7%, P = 0.033).

So far, only one case in the literature describes a combination of trichoblastoma and melanoma. We report the case of a 62-year-old man who had a slow-growing mass of the left flank present since childhood. This 8-cm mass was surgically removed when it became ulcerated and associated with axillary lymph nodes. Histologically, this tumor was strictly dermal and composed of 2 intermingled components. Large sheets of atypical, proliferating epithelioid cells predominated. Dispersed solid nests or cribriform epithelial islets encased in fibrous tissue were also seen. Some nests displayed a massive colonization by pigmented dendritic melanocytes. On immunohistochemical staining, the sheets of atypical cells expressed focally but strongly S100 protein, MelanA, HMB45, and MiTF. Epithelial structures diffusely expressed pancytokeratin AE1/AE3, KL1, and pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1. Based on these results, we diagnosed an intradermal melanoma, possibly developed from dendritic melanocytes colonizing a giant pigmented trichoblastoma. Direct sequencing of the melanoma revealed a rarely described NRAS mutation c.34G>T (G12C). Array comparative genomic hybridization displayed a complex profile somewhat divergent from standard melanoma profiles. The patient died of widespread metastatic disease 8 months after initial diagnosis.",

Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines. In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas. The numerous focal amplifications and HDs we have documented here are the first step toward identifying a comprehensive catalog of genes involved in melanoma development, some of which may be useful prognostic markers or targets for therapies to treat this disease.",

Mutually exclusive activating mutations in NRAS or BRAF have been identified in approximately 85% of melanomas, and components of this pathway have been developed as molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. We and others have shown that inhibition of this pathway with specific small molecule MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors induces a wide range of apoptotic responsiveness in human melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. To define the molecular mechanism underlying variable apoptotic sensitivity of melanoma cells to MEK inhibition, we examined the expression and subcellular localization of Bcl-2 family members in a comprehensive set of human melanoma cell lines. Whereas the proapoptotic protein Bim was activated and localized to the mitochondrial membrane in all cell lines regardless of apoptotic sensitivity, Bmf activation and cytosolic translocation was exclusive to sensitive cells. In resistant cells, Bmf remained sequestered to the cytoskeleton through dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) binding. Overexpression of Bmf in resistant cells did not enhance apoptosis, whereas expression of mutant BmfA69P, which has decreased binding to DLC2, promoted cell death. Expression of BmfA69P mutants possessing the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain mutation L138A, which impairs BH3 interactions, did not enhance apoptosis in resistant cells. RNA interference targeting Bim and Bmf provided protection from apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition. These results show a novel role for Bmf in promoting apoptosis and provide insight into the mechanism of apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibition in melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

However, successful application of such therapies is dependent on the presence or absence of mutations within the patient's tumor that can confer clinical efficacy or drug resistance. Building on these findings, we developed a high-throughput mutation panel for the identification of frequently occurring and clinically relevant mutations in melanoma. An extensive literature search and interrogation of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database identified more than 1,000 melanoma mutations. Applying a filtering strategy to focus on mutations amenable to the development of targeted drugs, we initially screened 120 known mutations in 271 samples using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. A total of 252 mutations were detected in 17 genes, the highest frequency occurred in BRAF (n = 154, 57%), NRAS (n = 55, 20%), CDK4 (n = 8, 3%), PTK2B (n = 7, 2.5%), and ERBB4 (n = 5, 2%). Based on this initial discovery screen, a total of 46 assays interrogating 39 mutations in 20 genes were designed to develop a melanoma-specific panel. These assays were distributed in multiplexes over 8 wells using strict assay design parameters optimized for sensitive mutation detection. The final melanoma-specific mutation panel is a cost effective, sensitive, high-throughput approach for identifying mutations of clinical relevance to molecular-based therapeutics for the treatment of melanoma. When used in a clinical research setting, the panel may rapidly and accurately identify potentially effective treatment strategies using novel or existing molecularly targeted drugs.",

Levels of BRAF(mutant) and NRAS(mutant) ctDNA were determined using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays.

Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the cells by hemocytometer. ERβ transcriptional activity was evaluated by gene reporter assay. Global DNA methylation was analyzed by restriction enzyme assay and ERβ isoforms were identified by qRT-PCR. We demonstrated that ERβ is expressed in a panel of human melanoma cell lines (BLM, WM115, A375, WM1552). In BLM (NRAS-mutant) cells, ERβ agonists significantly and specifically inhibited cell proliferation. ERβ activation triggered its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of ERβ agonists was associated with an altered expression of G1-S transition-related proteins. In these cells, global DNA was found to be hypomethylated when compared to normal melanocytes; this DNA hypomethylation status was reverted by ERβ activation. ERβ agonists also decreased the proliferation of WM115 (BRAF V600D-mutant) cells, while they failed to reduce the growth of A375 and WM1552 (BRAF V600E-mutant) cells. Finally, we could observe that ERβ isoforms are expressed at different levels in the various cell lines. Specific oncogenic mutations or differential expression of receptor isoforms might be responsible for the different responses of cell lines to ERβ agonists.;Our results demonstrate that ERβ is expressed in melanoma cell lines and that ERβ agonists differentially regulate the proliferation of these cells.

Analysis either by real-time PCR coupled with fluorescence melting curve analysis or by PCR followed by direct sequencing, along with studies for DNA mismatch repair status using immunohistochemistry, disclosed that 15 out of the 16 cases displayed wild-type genotypes, with a single case of vulvar primary melanoma, harboring the activating mutation BRAF(V600E). Investigations on whether this could reflect partly an efficient mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism were confirmed by normal expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2, suggesting that the lack of mutations could be explained by the operation of alternative pathogenetic mechanisms modulating downstream effectors of the signaling pathways.

Exceptions to wide local excision include cases where surgical excision may be cosmetically disfiguring or associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The role of definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy has largely been relegated to palliative measures because melanoma has been viewed as a prototypical radiotherapy-resistant cancer. However, the emerging clinical and radiobiological data summarized here suggests that many types of effective radiation therapy, such as radiosurgery for melanoma brain metastases, plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma, intensity modulated radiotherapy for melanoma of the head and neck, and adjuvant radiotherapy for selected high-risk, node-positive patients can improve outcomes. Similarly, although certain chemotherapeutic agents and biologics have shown limited responses, long-term control for unresectable tumors or disseminated metastatic disease has been rather disappointing. Recently, several powerful new biologics and treatment combinations have yielded new hope for this patient group. The recent identification of several clinically linked melanoma gene mutations involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as BRAF, NRAS, and cKIT has breathed new life into the drive to develop more effective therapies. Some of these new therapeutic approaches relate to DNA damage repair inhibitors, cellular immune system activation, and pharmacological cell cycle checkpoint manipulation. Others relate to the investigation of more effective targeting and dosing schedules for underutilized therapeutics, such as radiotherapy. This paper summarizes some of these new findings and attempts to give some context to the renaissance in melanoma therapeutics and the potential role for multimodality regimens, which include certain types of radiotherapy as aids to locoregional control in sensitive tissues.",

What is lacking is a systematic characterization of the regulatory relationships between genes whose expression is related to metastatic potential. Such a characterization would produce a molecular taxonomy for melanoma which could feasibly be used to identify epigenetic mechanisms behind changes in metastatic behaviour. To achieve this we carried out three separate DNA microarray analyses on a total of 86 cultures of melanoma. Significantly, multiple testing correction revealed that previous reports describing correlations of gene expression with activating mutations in BRAF or NRAS were incorrect and that no gene expression patterns correlate with the mutation status of these MAPK pathway components. Instead, we identified three different sample cohorts (A, B and C) and found that these cohorts represent melanoma groups of differing metastatic potential. Cohorts A and B were susceptible to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-mediated inhibition of proliferation and had low motility. Cohort C was resistant to TGFbeta and demonstrated high motility. Meta-analysis of the data against previous studies linking gene expression and phenotype confirmed that cohorts A and C represent transcription signatures of weakly and strongly metastatic melanomas, respectively. Gene expression co-regulation suggested that signalling via TGFbeta-type and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways underwent considerable change between cohorts. These results suggest a model for the transition from weakly to strongly metastatic melanomas in which TGFbeta-type signalling upregulates genes expressing vasculogenic/extracellular matrix remodelling factors and Wnt signal inhibitors, coinciding with a downregulation of genes downstream of Wnt signalling.",

The same pathway is constitutively activated in cutaneous and uveal melanoma (UM) and related to tumour growth and survival. Whereas mutant BRAF and NRAS are responsible for the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in most cutaneous melanoma, mutations in these genes are usually absent in UM.;We set out to explore the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and used mitogen-activated protein kinase profiling and tyrosine kinase arrays.;We identified Src as a kinase that is associated with ERK1/2 activation in UM. However, low Src levels and reduced ERK1/2 activation in metastatic cell lines suggest that proliferation in metastases can become independent of Src and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling. Inhibition of Src led to the growth reduction of primary UM cultures and cell lines, whereas metastatic cell line growth was only slightly reduced.;We identified Src as an important kinase and a potential target for treatment in primary UM. Metastasis cell lines seemed largely resistant to Src inhibition and indicate that in metastases treatment, a different approach may be required.",

Several aberrant events including RTK upregulation, NRAS mutation, mutant BRAF amplification or alternative splicing, and MEK mutation have been reported as acquired BRAFi resistance mechanisms. Clinially, detection of these resistance mechanisms help understand drug response patterns and help guide combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

Significant differences in BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency were found: 14/16 (87.5%) in common acquired naevi (CANs), 9/12 (75%) in CMs, 0/26 in Spitz naevi and 3/25 (12%) in blue naevi (p < 0.01). We looked at whether Spitz and blue naevi showed a compensatory increase in BRAF exon 11 and/or NRAS exons 1 and 2 mutations to account for the low BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency. NRAS mutations were found in only 1/16 (6.3%) Spitz naevi and 0/15 blue naevi. In addition, NRAS mutations were found in 2/11 (18.2%) CANs and 3/12 (25%) CMs. None of the tumors showed BRAF exon 11 mutations. Despite their low combined BRAF and NRAS mutation frequency, Spitz naevi showed strong MAPK pathway activation as measured by cytoplasmic expression of dually phosphorylated ERK1/2, while blue naevi had weak pathway activation.

Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.",

In this study, we elucidated the involvement of the up-regulation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer and melanoma by analyzing the genes and molecules in these cascades. Twelve cell lines, six melanoma and six endometrial cancer, were analyzed; 4 (67%) of the 6 melanomas had gene mutations in the RAS/MAPK cascade, and a decrease or loss of PTEN expression was also observed. These results suggested that simultaneous up-regulations in these two cascades play important roles in carcinogenesis of melanocytes. However, no activation of AKT by phosphorylation was observed. On the other hand, 4 (67%) of the 6 endometrial cancer cell lines had mutually exclusive up-regulations in these cascades. However, two cell lines with up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT cascade also had up-regulation in the RAS/MAPK cascade induced by inactivation of DUSP6.

It is commonly recognized that to overcome resistance and improve outcome, treatment should be guided by tumor biology, which includes genotype, epigenotype, and gene expression profile. We therefore took an integrative approach to better understand melanoma cell response to clinically relevant dose of decitabine and identify complementary targets for combined therapy. We employed eight different melanoma cell strains, determined their growth, apoptotic and DNA damage responses to increasing doses of decitabine, and chose a low, clinically relevant drug dose to perform whole-genome differential gene expression, bioinformatic analysis, and protein validation studies. The data ruled out the DNA damage response, demonstrated the involvement of p21(Cip1) in a p53-independent manner, identified the TGFbeta pathway genes CLU and TGFBI as markers of sensitivity to decitabine and revealed an effect on histone modification as part of decitabine-induced gene expression. Mutation analysis and knockdown by siRNA implicated activated beta-catenin/MITF, but not BRAF, NRAS or PTEN mutations as a source for resistance. The importance of protein stability predicted from the results was validated by the synergistic effect of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in enhancing the growth arrest of decitabine in otherwise resistant melanoma cells.

The second generation offspring is under strict follow up as some of them have a higher risk of developing MPM according to our model.",

Enrolled patients received a 12-week run-in of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). Patients with changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements <25% from baseline were then randomised to sorafenib or placebo for a further 12 weeks (ie to week 24). Patients with > or =25% tumour shrinkage after the run-in continued on open-label sorafenib, whereas those with > or =25% tumour growth discontinued treatment. This analysis focussed on secondary RDT end points: changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements from baseline after 12 weeks and overall tumour responses (WHO criteria) at week 24, progression-free survival (PFS), safety and biomarkers (BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutational status). Of 37 melanoma patients treated during the run-in phase, 34 were evaluable for response: one had > or =25% tumour shrinkage and remained on open-label sorafenib; six (16%) had <25% tumour growth and were randomised (placebo, n=3; sorafenib, n=3); and 27 had > or =25% tumour growth and discontinued. All three randomised sorafenib patients progressed by week 24; one remained on sorafenib for symptomatic relief. All three placebo patients progressed by week-24 and were re-started on sorafenib; one experienced disease re-stabilisation. Overall, the confirmed best responses for each of the 37 melanoma patients who received sorafenib were 19% stable disease (SD) (ie n=1 open-label; n=6 randomised), 62% (n=23) progressive disease (PD) and 19% (n=7) unevaluable. The overall median PFS was 11 weeks. The six randomised patients with SD had overall PFS values ranging from 16 to 34 weeks. The most common drug-related adverse events were dermatological (eg rash/desquamation, 51%; hand-foot skin reaction, 35%). There was no relationship between V600E BRAF status and disease stability. DNA was extracted from the biopsies of 17/22 patients. Six had V600E-positive tumours (n=4 had PD; n=1 had SD; n=1 unevaluable for response), and 11 had tumours containing wild-type BRAF (n=9 PD; n=1 SD; n=1 unevaluable for response). In conclusion, sorafenib is well tolerated but has little or no antitumour activity in advanced melanoma patients as a single agent at the dose evaluated (400 mg b.i.d.).

It is therefore likely that an additional environmental factor exists as familial and genetic factors play a role in less than 5%. A large amount of (largely forgotten) epidemiologic data indicates that heavy metal exposure is strongly associated with the development of CM. Also, epidemiologic studies of patients with joint replacement indicate a marked subsequent time-related increase in melanoma in patients with metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties. In these patients chromium and cobalt levels rise to 10x normal and stay elevated at levels two- to threefold normal for at least 10 years. Chromium is widely used in industry for its anticorrosive and steel-strengthening properties and is widespread in everyday materials. Our hypothesis is therefore that chromium, alone or in conjunction with UV, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CM. We have incubated human neonatal melanocytes for more than 10 weeks in the presence of a wide range and concentrations of metals without effect except by hexavalent chromium Cr(VI)and to a lesser degree Co²(+). After prolonged culture, chromium-incubated cells produced foci and when replated secondary colonies formed. We have just begun to study this phenomenon in more detail and studies without and with different wavelengths of UV will be explored. Of interest is that aneuploidy (a universal chromosomal change in cutaneous melanoma) in lymphocytes in patients with hip-on-hip metal prostheses has been demonstrated by others.",

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers. The findings reported here have potential implications for the use of phenothiazines in the treatment of V600E BRAF mutant melanoma.",

They cover a spectrum of malignancy grades ranging from low-grade melanocytomas to lesions of intermediate malignancy and overtly malignant melanomas. Characteristic genetic alterations in this group of neoplasms have not yet been identified. Using direct sequencing, we investigated 19 primary melanocytic lesions of the CNS (12 melanocytomas, 3 intermediate-grade melanocytomas, and 4 melanomas) for hotspot oncogenic mutations commonly found in melanocytic tumors of the skin (BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS genes) and uvea (GNAQ gene). Somatic mutations in the GNAQ gene at codon 209, resulting in constitutive activation of GNAQ, were detected in 7/19 (37%) tumors, including 6/12 melanocytomas, 0/3 intermediate-grade melanocytomas, and 1/4 melanomas. These GNAQ-mutated tumors were predominantly located around the spinal cord (6/7). One melanoma carried a BRAF point mutation that is frequently found in cutaneous melanomas (c.1799 T>A, p.V600E), raising the question whether this is a metastatic rather than a primary tumor. No HRAS or NRAS mutations were detected. We conclude that somatic mutations in the GNAQ gene at codon 209 are a frequent event in primary melanocytic neoplasms of the CNS. This finding provides new insight in the pathogenesis of these lesions and suggests that GNAQ-dependent mitogen-activated kinase signaling is a promising therapeutic target in these tumors. The prognostic and predictive value of GNAQ mutations in primary melanocytic lesions of the CNS needs to be determined in future studies.",

Gene signatures from Axl-expressing cell lines are similar to published signatures from poorly differentiated tumors displaying high metastatic potential.

Fixed samples of a further 10 CCS and 14 MM were investigated by means of sequencing for BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS mutations and FISH analyses for the gain of chromosomes 22 and 8. RTK analysis of all CCS/MM samples showed activation of short-form (sf) recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) RTK and of PDGFRB, MET, and HER3. Analysis of downstream signaling revealed consistent phosphorylation patterns of PI3K/AKT, RSK, and the mTOR targets S6 and 4EBP1. Analysis of frozen and fixed material from 21 CCS and 21 MM showed the presence of the V600E BRAF mutation in 2/12 EWSR1+ and 3/9 EWSR1- CCS and 9/21 MM and demonstrated a significant (P < 0.001) correlation between the gain of chromosomes 22 and 8 and EWSR1- CCS. Our results show that BRAF mutation can also be present in CCS and support the proposed aberration of chromosomes 22 and 8 as a possibly useful nonrandom hallmark of EWSR1- CCS. Besides, they broaden the spectrum of the similarities of RTK pathway activation between CCS and MM, thus suggesting that new drugs found to be active in melanoma and RON inhibitors could have a role in CCS treatment. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This prospective, open-label, phase II study included patients with previously untreated MM or unresectable melanoma. Patients received dacarbazine and bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy variable was the overall response rate. The secondary efficacy parameters included duration of response, duration of stable disease, time to progression/progression-free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The safety analysis included recordings of adverse events and exposure to study treatment. The intention-to-treat population included 37 patients (24 men and 13 women, mean age 54.2±13.1 years). Overall response rate was 18.9% (seven patients achieved a response) and clinical benefit was 48.6%. In patients who achieved a response, the median duration of response was 16.9 months and the median duration of stable disease was 12.5 months.

It is recommended that both NRAS and KRAS mutation testing to be performed before a CRC is considered RAS wild-type. Given that mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been shown to be sensitive and specific for the detection of NRAS mutations in melanoma, we assessed the specificity of NRAS mutation-specific IHC in CRC. IHC was performed on tissue microarrays containing 2823 consecutive CRC undergoing surgery with curative intent using a novel mutation-specific antibody to the protein produced by the NRAS mutation (clone SP174). Tissue microarrays were assessed by 2 observers and all IHC-positive or equivocal cases were repeated on whole sections to confirm the result. Positive cases then underwent molecular testing by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight polymerase chain reaction. In total, 22 of 2823 (0.8%) CRCs demonstrated confirmed positive staining with complete interobserver concordance. RAS mutations were confirmed in all IHC-positive CRCs. In total, 11 cases harbored the NRASQ61R mutation. Surprisingly, 11 cases demonstrated the KRASQ61R mutation. We conclude that mutation-specific IHC with this currently available NRASQ61R antibody is highly specific for the presence of either NRASQ61R or KRASQ61R mutations in CRC. We caution that we did not assess the sensitivity of IHC and that this antibody does not detect other RAS mutations. Therefore, negative staining does not exclude a clinically significant RAS mutation. However, positive staining confirms the presence of an NRASQ61R or KRASQ61R mutation without the need for further molecular testing.",

Many studies therefore focus on killing resistant subpopulations, such as Melanoma Initiating Cells (MICs) to prevent relapse. Here we examined whether combining a GSI (γ-Secretase Inhibitor) with ABT-737 (a small molecule BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor) can kill both the non-MICs (bulk of melanoma) and MICs. To address the limitations of melanoma therapies, we included multiple tumor samples of patients relapsed from current treatments, with a diverse genetic background (with or without the common BRAF, NRAS or NF1 mutations) in these studies. Excitingly, the combination treatment reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis of the non-MICs; disrupted primary spheres, decreased the ALDH+ cells, and inhibited the self-renewability of the MICs in multiple melanoma cell lines and relapsed patient samples. Using a low-cell-number mouse xenograft model, we demonstrated that the combination significantly reduced the tumor initiating ability of MIC-enriched cultures from relapsed patient samples. Mechanistic studies also indicate that cell death is NOXA-dependent. In summary, this combination may be a promising strategy to address treatment relapse and for triple wild-type patients who do not respond to immunotherapy.",

This inspires the effort to reverse this resistance or to uncover new vulnerabilities in such resistant cancers. IPA3 has been originally identified as a small molecule inhibitor of p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1), a candidate therapeutic target in human malignancies. We have tested a battery of melanoma and colon carcinoma cell lines that carry mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KRAS genes and have observed that those with NRAS and KRAS mutations are more sensitive to killing by IPA3. Genetic manipulations suggest that the differential response depends not just on these oncogenes, but also on additional events that were co-selected during tumor evolution. Furthermore, sublethal doses of IPA3 or ectopic expression of dominant-negative PAK1 sensitized Ras-mutated cells to GDC-0897 and AZD6244, which otherwise have reduced efficiency against cells with activated Ras. Dominant-negative PAK1 also reduced the growth of NRAS-mutated cells in confluent cultures, but, unlike IPA3, caused no significant toxicity. Although it remains to be proven that all the effects of IPA3 are exclusively due to inhibition of PAK1, our findings point to the existence of selective vulnerabilities, which are associated with Ras mutations and could be useful for better understanding and treatment of a large subset of tumors.",

New sequencing technologies, in particular next generation sequencing, have led to a better and more comprehensive understanding of malignant tumors. This approach confirmed the pathogenic role of BRAF, NRAS and MAP kinase pathways for melanoma. At the same time, a series of further interesting target molecules with oncogenic mutations such as ERBB4, GRIN2A, GRM3, PREX2, RAC1 and TP53 were identified.

C>T and CC>TT changes make up the overwhelming majority of single base substitutions (SBS) in MM DNA, as both precursor melanocytes and melanocytic lesions have incurred incidental exposures to sunlight. To study the mutagenic mechanisms by which acute sunburn accelerates MM, we sequenced the exomes of spontaneous and neonatal UVB-induced Cdk4-R24C::Tyr-NRASQ61K mouse MMs. UVR-induced MMs carried more SBSs than spontaneous MMs, but the levels of genomic instability, reflected by translocations and copy number changes, were not different. C>T/G>A was the most common SBS in spontaneous and UVR-induced MMs, only modestly increased in the latter. However, they tended to occur at the motif A/GpCpG (reflecting C>T transition due to spontaneous deamination of cytosine at CpG) in spontaneous MMs, and T/CpCpC/T (reflecting the effects of pyrimidine dimers on either side of the mutated C) in UVR-induced MMs. Unlike MMs associated with repetitive exposures, we observed no CC>TT changes. In addition, we also found UVR 'footprints' at T>A/A>Ts (at NpTpT) and T>C/A>G (at CpTpC). These footprints are also present in MMs from a chronic UVR mouse model, and in some human MMs, suggesting that they may be minor UVR signature changes. We found few significantly somatically mutated genes (~6 per spontaneous and 15 per UVR-induced melanoma) in addition to the Cdk4 and NRAS mutations already present. Trp53 was the most convincing recurrently mutated gene; however, in the UVR-induced MMs no Trp53 mutations were at C>T/G>A, suggesting that it was probably mutated during tumour progression, not directly induced by UVR photoproducts. The very low load of recurrent mutations convincingly induced by classical UVB-induced dimer photoproducts may support a role for cell extrinsic mechanisms, such as photoimmunosuppression and inflammation in driving MM after acute UVB exposure.

We analyzed tumors labeled as atypical Spitz tumor or spitzoid melanoma from 56 patients with available follow-up data for the association of TERT-p mutations, biallelic CDKN2A deletion, biallelic PTEN deletion, kinase fusions, BRAF/NRAS mutations, nodal status, and histopathological parameters with risk of hematogenous metastasis. Four patients died of disseminated disease and 52 patients were alive and disease free without extranodal metastasis (median follow-up, 32.5 months). We found TERT-p mutations in samples from the 4 patients who developed hematogenous metastasis but in none of tumors from patients who had favorable outcomes. Presence of TERT-p mutations was the most significant predictor of haematogenous dissemination (P < 0.0001) among variables analyzed. We conclude that TERT-p mutations identify a clinically high-risk subset of patients with spitzoid tumors. Application of TERT-p mutational assays for risk stratification in the clinic requires large-scale validation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This review intends to update current knowledge regarding molecular cytogenetics in melanocytic tumours with a focus on cutaneous melanocytic lesions. Advantages and limitations of diverse, already established methods, such as (fluorescence) in situ hybridization and mutation analysis, to detect these cytogenetic alterations in melanocytic tumours are described. In addition, the potential value of more novel techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is pointed out. This review demonstrates that at present cytogenetics has mainly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumours, with an important role for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in the initiation of melanocytic tumours. Mutations in BRAF (in common naevocellular naevi), NRAS (congenital naevi), HRAS (Spitz naevi) and GNAQ (blue naevi) can all cause MAPK activation. All these mutations seem early events in the development of melanocytic tumours, but by themselves are insufficient to cause progression towards melanoma. Additional molecular alterations are implicated in progression towards melanoma, with different genetic alterations in melanomas at different sites and with varying levels of sun exposure. This genetic heterogeneity in distinct types of naevi and melanomas can be used for the development of molecular tests for diagnostic purposes. However, at the moment only few molecular tests have become of diagnostic value and are performed in daily routine practice. This is caused by lack of large prospective studies on the diagnostic value of molecular tests including follow-up, and by the low prevalence of certain molecular alterations. For the future we foresee an increasing role for cytogenetics in the treatment of melanoma patients with the increasing availability of targeted therapy. Potential targets for metastatic melanoma include genes involved in the MAPK pathway, such as BRAF and RAS. More recently, KIT has emerged as a potential target in melanoma patients. These targeted treatments all need careful evaluation, but might be a promising adjunct for treatment of metastatic melanoma patients, in which other therapies have not brought important survival advantages yet.",

Herein, we review and discuss these two important clinical entities and focus on core issues and recent advances.;Melanoma risk for patients with CMN is greatest in infants with large CMN located on the trunk, CMN greater than 40 cm, and multiple satellite nevi. Recent histological and molecular findings have been described to assist in differentiating benign proliferative nodules arising in CMN from melanoma. Multiple CMN and associated neurological lesions have recently been shown to be due to a single postzygotic mutation in NRAS [neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog]. Over the last several years, numerous advancements have occurred in redefining the clinical course of infantile hemangiomas, describing clinical syndromes associated with infantile hemangiomas and treating complicated infantile hemangiomas. The nonselective β-blocker propranolol has become first-line therapy for the treatment of complicated infantile hemangiomas. Topical timolol shows promise for the treatment of certain types of infantile hemangiomas.;Although most CMN and infantile hemangiomas do not require active intervention, understanding which lesions may impact the overall health of the infant assists in early intervention.

Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer. Two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treatment of melanoma. Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Histopathological evaluation of melanocytic tumours usually allows reliable distinction of benign melanocytic naevi from melanoma. More difficult is the histopathological classification of Spitz tumours, a heterogeneous group of tumours composed of large epithelioid or spindle-shaped melanocytes. Spitz tumours are biologically distinct from conventional melanocytic naevi and melanoma, as exemplified by their distinct patterns of genetic aberrations. Whereas common acquired naevi and melanoma often harbour BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or inactivation of NF1, Spitz tumours show HRAS mutations, inactivation of BAP1 (often combined with BRAF mutations), or genomic rearrangements involving the kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, BRAF, RET, and MET. In Spitz naevi, which lack significant histological atypia, all of these mitogenic driver aberrations trigger rapid cell proliferation, but after an initial growth phase, various tumour suppressive mechanisms stably block further growth. In some tumours, additional genomic aberrations may abrogate various tumour suppressive mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, telomere shortening, or DNA damage response. The melanocytes then start to grow in a less organised fashion and may spread to regional lymph nodes, and are termed atypical Spitz tumours. Upon acquisition of even more aberrations, which often activate additional oncogenic pathways or alter cell differentiation, the neoplastic cells become entirely malignant and may colonise and take over distant organs (spitzoid melanoma). The sequential acquisition of genomic aberrations suggests that Spitz tumours represent a continuous biological spectrum, rather than a dichotomy of benign versus malignant, and that tumours with ambiguous histological features (atypical Spitz tumours) might be best classified as low-grade melanocytic tumours. The number of genetic aberrations usually correlates with the degree of histological atypia and explains why existing ancillary genetic techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), are usually capable of accurately classifying histologically benign and malignant Spitz tumours, but are not very helpful in the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Nevertheless, we expect that progress in our understanding of tumour progression will refine the classification of spitzoid melanocytic tumours in the near future. By integrating clinical, pathological, and genetic criteria, distinct tumour subsets will be defined within the heterogeneous group of Spitz tumours, which will eventually lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

However, the contribution of the ER to the early stages of normal cell transformation is largely unknown. Using primary human melanocytes and biopsies of human naevi (moles), we show that the extent of ER stress induced by cellular oncogenes may define the mechanism of activation of premature senescence. Specifically, we found that oncogenic forms of HRAS (HRAS(G12V)) but not its downstream target BRAF (BRAF(V600E)), engaged a rapid cell-cycle arrest that was associated with massive vacuolization and expansion of the ER. However, neither p53, p16(INK4a) nor classical senescence markers--such as foci of heterochromatin or DNA damage--were able to account for the specific response of melanocytes to HRAS(G12V). Instead, HRAS(G12V)-driven senescence was mediated by the ER-associated unfolded protein response (UPR). The impact of HRAS on the UPR was selective, as it was poorly induced by activated NRAS (more frequently mutated in melanoma than HRAS). These results argue against premature senescence as a converging mechanism of response to activating oncogenes and support a direct role of the ER as a gatekeeper of tumour control.",

As alteration of pigmentation mechanisms can trigger oxidative damage, increased expression of genes involved in maintenance of DNA integrity might reflect the ability of nevocytic cells to self-protect against cellular stress.

Mutations of genes of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway are very often found in the early stages of the development of melanoma. TPA is considered to be an oncogenic factor, but so far there is no evidence to show that it is responsible for damage to the genetic material of cultured melanocytes.

Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that TPA and high concentrations of other growth factors intensify the proliferation of melanocytes, without the risk of damage to the HRAS (exon 1 and 2), KRAS (exon 1 and 2), NRAS (exon 1 and 2), and BRAF (exon 11 and 15) genes. In order to assess the total safety of the transplantation of cultured melanocytes, it is necessary to carry out further studies on other signaling pathways as well as carry out biological tests on an animal model.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many cancers. Under normal physiologic conditions, the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) signalling cascade interaction is initiated by ligation of a receptor-linked tyrosine kinase by its cognate growth factor. It has been demonstrated in many systems that aberrant autocrine or paracrine stimulation of growth factor receptors is pathogenic in large part because of MAPK activation. As one of the key downstream effector pathways of mutated RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS), pharmacologic inhibition of components of the MAPK pathway has been pursued as a means to indirectly inhibit RAS, which remains a technical challenge for direct pharmacologic inhibition. RAF and MEK are the two non-membrane-bound, serine-threonine and tyrosine-threonine kinases, within the pathway that have been most extensively explored as drug targets. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in cancer clarified which cancer types and subsets of certain cancers are most dependent on activation of the MAPK pathway for growth and survival. Now, with the successful translation of selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors into validated therapies for BRAF mutant melanoma, the field seeks to resolve the role for these agents in cancers harbouring RAS mutations or those driven by aberrant growth factor receptor activation.",

Molecular alterations in these pathways are implicated in tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways are known to interact with each other at several nodes, and mounting evidence suggests that dual blockade of both pathways may be required to achieve anticancer effects in certain contexts. This may include tumor types with a high frequency of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation, or situations in which dual pathway strategies may be required to overcome resistance to current targeted therapies. Several clinical studies are currently evaluating the combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors in a variety of different cancers with certain types of molecular alterations. This review will summarize existing knowledge of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways, the cross-talk between them, and the current generation of PI3K and MEK inhibitors that target them. The preclinical rationale for dual pathway inhibition will be discussed within the context of the major tumor types currently being explored in ongoing clinical trials, namely malignant melanoma with BRAF or NRAS mutations, and colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and basal-like breast cancers. The emerging clinical profile of PI3K and MEK inhibitor combinations, as reported in Phase I trials, will also be discussed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is a key signal transduction pathway in the cells. Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor genotyping is an essential step in routine clinical practice and pathology laboratories face a major challenge in being able to provide rapid, sensitive and updated molecular tests. We developed a novel mass spectrometry multiplexed genotyping platform named PentaPanel to concurrently assess single nucleotide polymorphisms in 56 hotspots of the 5 most clinically relevant cancer genes, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and PIK3CA for a total of 221 detectable mutations. To both evaluate and validate the PentaPanel performance, we investigated 1025 tumor specimens of 6 different cancer types (carcinomas of colon, lung, breast, pancreas, and biliary tract, and melanomas), systematically addressing sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of our platform. Sanger sequencing was also performed for all the study samples. Our data showed that PentaPanel is a high throughput and robust tool, allowing genotyping for targeted therapy selection of 10 patients in the same run, with a practical turnaround time of 2 working days. Importantly, it was successfully used to interrogate different DNAs isolated from routinely processed specimens (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded, frozen, and cytological samples), covering all the requirements of clinical tests. In conclusion, the PentaPanel platform can provide an immediate, accurate and cost effective multiplex approach for clinically relevant gene mutation analysis in many solid tumors and its utility across many diseases can be particularly relevant in multiple clinical trials, including the new basket trial approach, aiming to identify appropriate targeted drug combination strategies.

        "Doc_abstract":"In April 2013 our group published a review on predictive molecular pathology in this journal. Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

        "Doc_abstract":"A quarter of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene indicating MEN2. Therefore genetic testing is recommended for all patients presenting with MTC. Approximately 40% of MTCs have somatic RET mutations. Somatic mutations in the RAS genes are the next most common driver mutations and appear to be mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation. The single most common somatic RAS mutation is HRASQ61R (c.182A>G), reported in 4.6% to 11% of all MTCs. Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) initially developed to identify the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma (clone SP174) has proven highly sensitive and specific. Because the amino acid sequences for the HRAS and NRAS proteins at codon 61 are identical, we postulated that SP174 IHC would also identify the somatic HRASQ61R mutation. IHC with SP174 was performed on a tissue microarray of 68 patients with MTC including 13 (22.8%) with molecularly confirmed MEN2. Seven (10.3%) MTCs demonstrated positive staining. Six of these patients had already undergone germline RET mutation testing as part of clinical care and were all confirmed to be wild type, excluding the diagnosis of MEN2. All SP174 immunohistochemically positive MTCs were proven to have HRASQ61R mutation (and lack KRASQ61R and NRASQ61R) by Sanger sequencing. All MEN2 patients showed negative staining. We conclude that IHC with SP174 is highly specific for the HRASQ61R mutation in MTC. Because current data suggest that this mutation is mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation, IHC may also have a role in triaging formal genetic testing for MEN2.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
