        "Doc_abstract":"Aberrant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) expression is a defining feature of many human cancers and was identified first in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), an aggressive non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma. Since that time, many studies have set out to identify the mechanisms used by aberrant ALK toward tumorigenesis. We have identified a distinct profile of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that characterize ALCL; furthermore, this profile distinguishes ALK(+) from ALK(-) subtypes, and thus points toward potential mechanisms of tumorigenesis induced by aberrant ALK. Using a nucleophosmin-ALK transgenic mouse model as well as human primary ALCL tumor tissues and human ALCL-derived cell lines, we reveal a set of overlapping deregulated miRNAs that might be implicated in the development and progression of ALCL. Importantly, ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCL could be distinguished by a distinct profile of \"oncomirs\": Five members of the miR-17-92 cluster were expressed more highly in ALK(+) ALCL, whereas miR-155 was expressed more than 10-fold higher in ALK(-) ALCL. Moreover, miR-101 was down-regulated in all ALCL model systems, but its forced expression attenuated cell proliferation only in ALK(+) and not in ALK(-) cell lines, perhaps suggesting different modes of ALK-dependent regulation of its target proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR, which is targeted by miR-101, led to reduced tumor growth in engrafted ALCL mouse models. In addition to future therapeutical and diagnostic applications, it will be of interest to study the physiological implications and prognostic value of the identified miRNA profiles.",

No particular risk factor has been clearly identified for ALCL. ALK+ ALCL shows a broad morphologic spectrum, but all cases contain a variable proportion of cells with eccentric, horseshoe- or kidney-shaped nuclei often with an eosinophilic region near the nucleus (hallmark cells). Five morphologic patterns can be recognized. ALK+ ALCL occurs in young subjects (median age ∼35 years), with male predominance, and frequently presents at an advanced stage, with systemic symptoms and extranodal involvement. Near 40% of patients are low risk according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Overall, the prognosis of ALK+ ALCL is remarkably better than other T-cell lymphomas. The IPI and the PIT scores in general predict survival in patients with ALK+ ALCL. Standard first-line treatment for ALK+ ALCL consists of doxorubicin-containing polychemotherapy, which is associated with an overall response rate of ∼90%, a 5-year relapse-free survival of ∼60%, and a 5-year overall survival of 70%. Excellent results have been reported with a variety of anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens including CHOP, CHOEP or MACOP-B. Consolidative high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) has also been evaluated in patients in first remission with favourable results, however, superiority to standard chemotherapy is unproven and this approach remains investigational. Following universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of failed aggressive lymphomas, HDC/ASCT can effectively salvage a proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL. Recently, the development of novel therapies targeting CD30 and ALK appear promising.",

This study is the first complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis using RNA extracted from tumor tissue (7 ALK+ ALCLs and 7 ALK- ALCLs) to identify genes differentially expressed or shared between the ALK+ and ALK- tumors. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the top 11 most statistically significant discriminator cDNAs correctly grouped all ALK+ and ALK- tumors. Hierarchical clustering analysis using the 44 cDNAs with the greatest differential expression between ALK+ and ALK- RNAs grouped 6 of 7 ALK+ ALCLs together and 1 ALK+ ALCL with the ALK- group. In general, ALK+ tumors overexpress genes encoding signal transduction molecules (SYK , LYN , CDC37) and underexpress transcription factor genes (including HOXC6 and HOX A3 ) compared with the ALK- group. Cyclin D3 was overexpressed in the ALK+ group and the cell cycle inhibitor p19INK4D was decreased in the ALK- group, suggesting different mechanisms of promoting G 1 /S transition.

Whether this intense proliferative activity contributes to the good response to chemotherapy and favorable outcome of ALK(+) ALCLs remains to be assessed in a larger series of patients. Our findings support the notion that ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCLs are 2 distinct disease entities.",

These 2 proteins provide unique therapeutic targets in ALCL. Remission rates in ALCL with combination chemotherapy are approximately 80%, but relapse after first-line therapy is common. Brentuximab vedotin is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved, antibody-drug conjugate that combines an anti-CD30 antibody with monomethylauristatin E, a potent antimicrotubule agent. Response rates to brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory ALK and ALK ALCL have exceeded 80% with frequent complete responses and a median duration of response greater than 1 year. Brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy is being explored as a first-line therapy in ALCL. Crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of ALK non-small cell lung cancer. Successful treatment of ALK ALCL with crizotinib has been reported in pediatric patients and small case series leading to ongoing trials in relapsed/refractory ALCL.

Here we show that NPM-ALK impedes CD30 signaling and NF-kappaB activation, dependent on both ALK kinase activity and the N-terminal NPM domain. NPM-ALK transduction into H-RS cell lines abrogates recruitment and aggregation of TRAF proteins, inducing an ALCL-like morphology and phenotype. TRAF2 associates with NPM-ALK at a consensus binding motif located in the kinase domain.

ALCL was described initially as a subtype of T-cell/null-cell lymphoma characterized by unusual tumor cell morphology and the expression of CD30. However, it was soon recognized that a subset of ALCLs contained chromosomal translocations involving anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a novel receptor tyrosine kinase gene. These rearrangements create chimeric genes encoding self-associating, constitutively active ALK fusion proteins that activate a number of downstream effectors, including phospholipase C-gamma, phosphoinositol 3'-kinase, RAS, and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins, all of which seem potentially important in cellular transformation. Not all tumors classified as ALCLs have ALK rearrangements and, conversely, ALK rearrangements occur in lymphomas of widely varying morphology. Hence, only molecular markers can reliably identify ALK+ ALCL. The importance of doing so is reflected by clinical studies suggesting that ALK+ ALCLs have a significantly better prognosis than other aggressive peripheral T-cell or B-cell lymphomas, including ALK- ALCLs. The unique molecular pathogenesis of ALK+ ALCL is likely to lead to novel therapeutic approaches directed at specific inhibition of ALK or downstream effectors.",

The crucial role of NPM-ALK in the regulation of serpin A1 expression was further demonstrated by using both ectopic expression and downregulation, by RNA interference, of the NPM-ALK oncogene. In addition, in ALK+ tumors, serpin A1 expression appeared to be correlated with the clinical status of the patients as the serpin A1 mRNA level was higher in patients presenting with extranodal dissemination.

The normal cellular counterpart of this malignancy is presumed to be the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and this presumption is partly based on the observation that these tumour cells often express cytotoxic granules containing Granzyme B (GzB) and Perforin. Chromosomal translocations involving the gene encoding for the ALK tyrosine kinase are also characteristic of ALK+ ALCL, and the resulting fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK) initiate signalling events important in ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis. These events include the elevated expression of JunB; an AP-1 family transcription factor that promotes ALK+ ALCL proliferation. In this report we demonstrate that JunB is a direct transcriptional activator of GzB and that GzB transcription is also promoted by NPM-ALK. We found that Perforin expression was not regulated by JunB, but was promoted by NPM-ALK in some cell lines and inhibited by it in others. In conclusion, our study makes the novel observation that signalling through NPM-ALK and JunB affect the expression of cytotoxic molecules in ALK+ ALCL.

Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel bromodomain inhibitor, OTX015/MK-8628 in ALK-positive ALCLs.The effects of OTX015 on a panel of ALK+ ALCL cell lines was evaluated in terms of proliferation, cell cycle and downstream signaling, including gene expression profiling analyses. Synergy was tested with combination targeted therapies.Bromodomain inhibition with OTX015 led primarily to ALCL cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner, along with downregulation of MYC and its downstream regulated genes. MYC overexpression did not compensate this OTX015-mediated phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis of OTX015-treated ALCL cells identified a gene signature common to various hematologic malignancies treated with bromodomain inhibitors, notably large cell lymphoma. OTX015-modulated genes included transcription factors (E2F2, NFKBIZ, FOS, JUNB, ID1, HOXA5 and HOXC6), members of multiple signaling pathways (ITK, PRKCH, and MKNK2), and histones (clusters 1-3). Combination of OTX015 with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib led to cell cycle arrest then cell death, and combination with suboptimal doses of the ALK inhibitor CEP28122 caused cell cycle arrest. When OTX015 was associated with GANT61, a selective GLI1/2 inhibitor, C1156Y-resistant ALK ALCL growth was impaired.These findings support OTX015 clinical trials in refractory ALCL in combination with inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible kinase or SHH/GLI1.",

NPM-ALK is a constitutively activated kinase that transforms cells through stimulating several mitogenic signaling pathways. To examine if the NPM-ALK is a potential therapeutic target in ALCL, we used siRNA to specifically downregulate the expression of the NPM-ALK in ALCL cell lines.

Further study demonstrated that the downregulation of NPM-ALK resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis. When used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin, the inhibition of the NPM-ALK augments the chemosensitivity of the tumor cells.

The transforming activity mediated by NPM-ALK fusion induces different pathways that control proliferation and survival of lymphoma cells. Grb2 is an adaptor protein thought to play an important role in ALK-mediated transformation, but its interaction with NPM-ALK, as well as its function in regulating ALCL signaling pathways and cell growth, has never been elucidated. Here we show that active NPM-ALK, but not a kinase-dead mutant, bound and induced Grb2 phosphorylation in tyrosine 160. An intact SH3 domain at the C terminus of Grb2 was required for Tyr(160) phosphorylation. Furthermore, Grb2 did not bind to a single region but rather to different regions of NPM-ALK, mainly Tyr(152-156), Tyr(567), and a proline-rich region, Pro(415-417). Finally, shRNA knockdown experiments showed that Grb2 regulates primarily the NPM-ALK-mediated phosphorylation of SHP2 and plays a key role in ALCL cell growth.",

It induces JAK3/STAT3 signaling, a biologically important cellular pathway activated in most cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-expressing anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+)ALCL). Therefore, we hypothesize that IL-21 may contribute to JAK3/STAT3 activation and cell growth in ALK(+)ALCL. By reverse transcription-PCR, we found consistent expression of IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) in all ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and frozen tumors examined. IL-21 was also consistently expressed in ALK(+)ALCL tumors, although its mRNA was detectable in only one of three cell lines tested. By immunohistochemistry, we examined 10 paraffin-embedded ALK(+)ALCL tumors; all cases were positive for both IL-21 and IL-21R in these neoplastic cells. IL-21 signaling is biologically significant in ALK(+)ALCL since the addition of recombinant IL-21 enhanced the activation of JAK3/STAT3 and significantly increased cell growth in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines. However, small interfering RNA down-regulation of IL-21R significantly decreased both STAT3 activation and cell growth. IL-21R expression is not linked to nucleophosmin-ALK since forced expression of nucleophosmin-ALK and small interfering RNA down-regulation of nucleophosmin-ALK did not significantly change the expression of either IL-21R or IL-21. Our findings thus support the enhancement of JAK3/STAT3 activation and cell growth in ALK(+)ALCL via IL-21 signaling. These results further support the concept that constitutive activation of STAT3 in these tumors is multifactorial.",

In this report, we describe the existence of an autocrine stimulatory loop involving interleukin-22 (IL-22) that contributes to STAT3 activation and tumorigenicity of ALK(+)ALCL. The IL-22 receptor, a heterodimer composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2, was expressed in all ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and tumors examined. The expression of IL-22R1 in ALK(+)ALCL is aberrant, as this protein is absent in benign lymphocytes. Although ALK(+)ALCL cells produce endogenous IL-22, addition of recombinant IL-22 to ALK(+)ALCL cell lines significantly increased STAT3 activation, cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Opposite biological effects were observed in cells treated with recombinant IL-22 binding protein (a naturally occurring IL-22 decoy) or IL-22-neutralizing antibody. Nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, the characteristic fusion gene oncoprotein expressed in ALK(+)ALCL, directly contributes to the aberrant expression of IL-22R1, as transfection of NPM-ALK in Jurkat cells-induced IL-22R1 expression and IL-22-mediated STAT3 activation.

Knockdown of JUNB and CJUN in ALK+ ALCL cell lines downregulated AKT1 mRNA and promoter activity and was associated with lower AKT1 protein expression and activation. We provide evidence that this is a transcriptional control mechanism shared by other cell types even though it may operate in a way that is cell context-specific.

In this study, we investigated whether autophagy is activated in ALCL cells submitted to ALK inactivation (using crizotinib or ALK-targeting siRNA). Classical autophagy read-outs such as autophagosome visualization/quantification by electron microscopy and LC3-B marker turn-over assays were used to demonstrate autophagy induction and flux activation upon ALK inactivation.

These findings implicate Jak3 as playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of ALK-positive ALCL; most likely via Stat3 and ALK activation. To assess this possibility, we used immunohistochemical staining to evaluate the frequency of expression of Jak3 and its activated/phosphorylated form (pJak3) in 48 systemic ALCL tumors included in a tissue microarray. pJak3 was detected in 17 (81%) of 21 ALK-positive tumors, compared with 3 (11%) of 27 ALK-negative tumors (P < .0001, Fisher exact test). pStat3 was present in 12 (86%) of 14 ALK-positive tumors and in 10 (40%) of 25 ALK-negative tumors assessed (P = .0078).

ALCL is considered to be a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that can be divided into two major groups with distinct genetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical behaviors. The first group consists of a spectrum of CD30+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders that include primary cutaneous ALCL (C-ALCL) and lymphomatoid papulosis. The second group is systemic ALCL (S-ALCL), which is further divided into two subgroups: anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) and ALK-negative. Between 30% and 60% of S-ALCL express ALK, which is usually the result of a t(2;5) translocation that correlates with onset in the first three decades of life, male predominance, and good prognosis. Although morphologically similar, ALK- ALCL shows varied clinical behaviors and immunophenotypes; is commonly seen in older age groups, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade of life with no preference as to sex; and has an overall poorer prognosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) is a T cell lymphoma defined by the presence of chromosomal translocations involving the ALK tyrosine kinase gene. These translocations generate fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK) with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, which activate numerous signalling pathways important for ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) plays a critical role in allowing NPM-ALK and other signalling proteins to function in this lymphoma. Co-chaperone proteins are important for helping Hsp90 fold proteins and for directing Hsp90 to specific clients; however the importance of co-chaperone proteins in ALK+ ALCL has not been investigated. Our preliminary findings suggested that expression of the immunophilin co-chaperone, Cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), is up-regulated in ALK+ ALCL by JunB, a transcription factor activated by NPM-ALK signalling. In this study we examined the regulation of the immunophilin family of co-chaperones by NPM-ALK and JunB, and investigated whether the immunophilin co-chaperones promote the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines.;NPM-ALK and JunB were knocked-down in ALK+ ALCL cell lines with siRNA, and the effect on the expression of the three immunophilin co-chaperones: Cyp40, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 51, and FKBP52 examined. Furthermore, the effect of knock-down of the immunophilin co-chaperones, either individually or in combination, on the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines and NPM-ALK levels and activity was also examined.;We found that NPM-ALK promoted the transcription of Cyp40 and FKBP52, but only Cyp40 transcription was promoted by JunB. We also observed reduced viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA, but not with siRNAs directed against FKBP52 or FKBP51. Finally, we demonstrate that the decrease in the viability of ALK+ ALCL cell lines treated with Cyp40 siRNA does not appear to be due to a decrease in NPM-ALK levels or the ability of this oncoprotein to signal.;This is the first study demonstrating that the expression of immunophilin family co-chaperones is promoted by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Moreover, this is the first report establishing an important role for Cyp40 in lymphoma.",

We recently reported that ALK-negative ALCLs are genetically heterogenous. The largest subset, representing 30% of cases, had rearrangements of the DUSP22 locus. These cases had favorable outcomes similar to ALK-positive ALCL, and superior to other ALK-negative ALCLs. Here, we examined the morphologic features of these cases in more detail. First, we conducted blinded review of hematoxylin and eosin slides of 108 ALCLs from our previous study, scoring cases for the presence of 3 histologic patterns and 5 cell types. Cases then were unblinded and re-reviewed to understand these features further. DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs were more likely than other ALK-negative ALCLs to have so-called doughnut cells (23% vs. 5%; P=0.039), less likely to have pleomorphic cells (23% vs. 49%; P=0.042), and nearly always (95%) had areas with sheet-like growth (common pattern). To examine the reproducibility of these findings, we conducted blinded review of hematoxylin and eosin slides of 46 additional ALK-negative ALCLs using a 0 to 3 scoring system to predict likelihood of DUSP22 rearrangement, the results of which correlated strongly with subsequent findings by fluorescence in situ hybridization (P<0.0001). Although all ALCLs share certain morphologic features, ALCLs with DUSP22 rearrangements show significant differences from other ALK-negative ALCLs, typically showing sheets of hallmark cells with doughnut cells and few large pleomorphic cells. These morphologic findings and our previous outcome data suggest that ALK-positive ALCLs and DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs represent prototypical ALCLs, whereas ALCLs lacking rearrangements of both DUSP22 and ALK require further study.

The proliferation and survival of ALCL cells are determined by the ALK activity. Here we show that the kinase activity of the nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion regulated the shape of ALCL cells and F-actin filament assembly in a pattern similar to T-cell receptor-stimulated cells. NPM-ALK formed a complex with the guanine exchange factor VAV1, enhancing its activation through phosphorylation. VAV1 increased Cdc42 activity, and in turn, Cdc42 regulated the shape and migration of ALCL cells. In vitro knockdown of VAV1 or Cdc42 by short hairpin RNA, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of Cdc42 activity by secramine, resulted in a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of ALCL cells. Importantly, the concomitant inhibition of Cdc42 and NPM-ALK kinase acted synergistically to induce apoptosis of ALCL cells. Finally, Cdc42 was necessary for the growth as well as for the maintenance of already established lymphomas in vivo. Thus, our data open perspectives for new therapeutic strategies by revealing a mechanism of regulation of ALCL cell growth through Cdc42.",

NPM-ALK triggers several signaling cascades, leading to increased cell growth, resistance to apoptosis, and changes in morphology and migration of transformed cells. To search for new NPM-ALK interacting molecules, we developed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach in HEK293 cells expressing an inducible NPM-ALK and identified the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 as a candidate substrate. We found that NPM-ALK was able to bind Shp2 in coprecipitation experiments and to induce its phosphorylation in the tyrosine residues Y542 and Y580 both in HEK293 cells and ALCL cell lines. In primary lymphomas, antibodies against the phosphorylated tyrosine Y542 of Shp2 mainly stained ALK-positive cells. In ALCL cell lines, Shp2-constitutive phosphorylation was dependent on NPM-ALK, as it significantly decreased after short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated NPM-ALK knock down. In addition, only the constitutively active NPM-ALK, but not the kinase dead NPM-ALK(K210R), formed a complex with Shp2, Gab2, and growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2), where Grb2 bound to the phosphorylated Shp2 through its SH2 domain. Shp2 knock down by specific shRNA decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and of the tyrosine residue Y416 in the activation loop of Src, resulting in impaired ALCL cell proliferation and growth disadvantage. Finally, migration of ALCL cells was reduced by Shp2 shRNA. These findings show a direct involvement of Shp2 in NPM-ALK lymphomagenesis, highlighting its critical role in lymphoma cell proliferation and migration.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of these aberrant immune-phenotypes is largely unknown. Here, we report that microRNA-135b (miR-135b) mediates nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-driven oncogenicity and empowers IL-17-producing immunophenotype in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). NPM-ALK oncogene strongly promoted the expression of miR-135b and its host gene LEMD1 through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. In turn, elevated miR-135b targeted FOXO1 in ALCL cells. miR-135b introduction also decreased chemosensitivity in Jurkat cells, suggesting its contribution to oncogenic activities of NPM-ALK. Interestingly, miR-135b suppressed T-helper (Th) 2 master regulators STAT6 and GATA3, and miR-135b blockade attenuated IL-17 production and paracrine inflammatory response by ALCL cells, indicating that miR-135b-mediated Th2 suppression may lead to the skewing to ALCL immunophenotype overlapping with Th17 cells. Furthermore, antisense-based miR-135b inhibition reduced tumor angiogenesis and growth in vivo, demonstrating significance of this \"Th17 mimic\" pathway as a therapeutic target. These results collectively illuminated unique contribution of oncogenic kinase-linked microRNA to tumorigenesis through modulation of tumor immune-phenotype and microenvironment.",

Although NPM-ALK(+) ALCL overall shows a better prognosis, there is a sub-group of patients who relapses and is resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens. NPM-ALK is a potential target for small molecule kinase inhibitors. Crizotinib (PF-2341066) is a small, orally bioavailable molecule that inhibits growth of tumors with ALK activity as shown in a subgroup of non-small lung cancer patients with EML4-ALK expression. In this study, we have investigated the in vitro effects of Crizotinib in ALCL cell line with NPM-ALK fusion. Crizotinib induced marked downregulation of STAT3 phosphorylation, which was associated with significant apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis induction was attributed to caspase-3 cleavage and marked downregulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins including MCL-1. These findings implicate that Crizotinib has excellent potential to treat patients with NPM-ALK(+) ALCL through induction of apoptotic cell death and downregulation of major oncogenic proteins in this aggressive lymphoma.

Despite considerable progress, several questions remain open regarding the pathogenesis of both ALCL subtypes. To investigate the molecular pathogenesis and to assess the relationship between the ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCL subtypes, we performed a genome-wide DNA profiling using high-density, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays on a series of 64 cases and 7 cell lines.

The latter gene, coding for BLIMP1, was inactivated by multiple mechanisms, more frequently, but not exclusively, in ALK(-)ALCL. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that that PRDM1 is a tumor suppressor gene in ALCL models, likely acting as an antiapoptotic agent.

The results showed that the ALK protein was expressed negatively in 2 cases of primary skin ALCL, but in 20 out of 28 cases of systematic ALCL the ALK protein was expressed positively and mainly located in cytoplasm and/or nucleus (71.4%). Clinically, the patients with ALK expression were younger than those without ALK expression (p < 0.05). The prognosis of patients with ALK expression was better than those without ALK expression (p < 0.05). It is concluded that there is a high incidence of ALK expression in ALCL, especially in younger group. ALK expression may be an useful and independent marker for the differential diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of ALCL.",

We present a case of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)+ skin-limited ALCL that highlights this challenge and draws attention to pitfalls in assessing ALK status. The patient was an 11-year old girl with a twice recurrent nodule on her right shoulder. Each biopsy revealed a deep infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes that expressed CD3, CD4, CD43, CD45RO and CD30. The initial biopsy was epithelial membrane antigen (EMA)+ with vague cytoplasmic ALK-1 positivity by immunohistochemistry, while the second biopsy was EMA+ and nuclear ALK-1+. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for an ALK (2p23) rearrangement of the first specimen was negative, while an ALK gene rearrangement was present in the second specimen. Therefore, this case was treated as nodal ALCL, despite negative bone marrow and radiographic imaging studies. The patient was treated with combination chemotherapy and remains disease-free. Demonstration of nuclear ALK-positivity, ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement is suggestive of systemic ALCL. Without evidence of systemic disease, this case highlights challenges of skin-limited ALCL, whose clinical behavior as either cutaneous ALCL systemic ALCL may not be immediately apparent. ",

Although C/EBPbeta has important functions in B- and T-cell differentiation, its expression has not been well studied in lymphoid tissues. We, therefore, analyzed its expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot in normal lymphoid tissues and in 248 well-characterized lymphomas and lymphoma cell lines. Nonneoplastic lymphoid tissues and most B-cell, T-cell, and Hodgkin lymphomas lacked detectable levels of C/EBPbeta. In contrast, most (40 of 45; 88%) cases of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) strongly expressed C/EBPbeta. Western blot analysis confirmed C/EBPbeta expression in the ALK-positive ALCLs and demonstrated elevated levels of the LIP isoform, which has been associated with increased proliferation and aggressiveness in carcinomas. Transfection of Ba/F3 and 32D cells with NPM-ALK and a kinase-inhibitable modified NPM-ALK resulted in the induction of C/EBPbeta and demonstrated dependence on NPM-ALK kinase activity. In conclusion, we report the constitutive expression of C/EBPbeta in ALK-positive ALCL and show its relationship to NPM-ALK.

In line with this function, Sox2 expression is largely restricted to ESCs and somatic stem cells. We report that Sox2 is expressed in cell lines and tumor samples derived from ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+)ALCL), for which the normal cellular counterpart is believed to be mature T-cells. The expression of Sox2 in ALK(+)ALCL can be attributed to nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), the oncogenic fusion protein carrying a central pathogenetic role in these tumors. By confocal microscopy, Sox2 protein was detectable in virtually all cells in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines. However, the transcriptional activity of Sox2, as assessed using a Sox2-responsive reporter construct, was detectable only in a small proportion of cells. Importantly, downregulation of Sox2 using short interfering RNA in isolated Sox2(active) cells, but not Sox2(inactive) cells, resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth, invasiveness and tumorigenicity. To conclude, ALK(+)ALCL represents the first example of a hematologic malignancy that aberrantly expresses Sox2, which represents a novel mechanism by which NPM-ALK mediates tumorigenesis. We also found that the transcriptional activity and oncogenic effects of Sox2 can be heterogeneous in cancer cells.",

Because it has been shown that STAT3 can be inhibited by STAT1 in some experimental models, we hypothesized that the STAT1 signaling pathway is defective in ALK+ ALCL, thereby leaving the STAT3 signaling unchecked. Compared with normal T cells, ALK+ ALCL tumors consistently expressed a low level of STAT1. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appreciably increased STAT1 expression in ALK+ ALCL cells. Furthermore, we found evidence that NPM-ALK binds to and phosphorylates STAT1, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation in a STAT3-dependent manner. If restored, STAT1 is functionally intact in ALK+ ALCL cells, because it effectively upregulated interferon-γ, induced apoptosis/cell-cycle arrest, potentiated the inhibitory effects of doxorubicin, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. STAT1 interfered with the STAT3 signaling by decreasing STAT3 transcriptional activity/DNA binding and its homodimerization. The importance of the STAT1/STAT3 functional interaction was further highlighted by the observation that short interfering RNA knockdown of STAT1 significantly decreased apoptosis induced by STAT3 inhibition. Thus, STAT1 is a tumor suppressor in ALK+ ALCL. Phosphorylation and downregulation of STAT1 by NPM-ALK represent other mechanisms by which this oncogenic tyrosine kinase promotes tumorigenesis. ",

In this study, we hypothesized that NPM-ALK promotes the oncogenic activity of β-catenin via its functional interactions with the Wnt canonical pathway (WCP). To test this hypothesis, we examined if NPM-ALK modulates the gene expression of various members in the WCP. Using a Wnt pathway-specific oligonucleotide array and Western blots, we found that the expression of casein kinase 2α (CK2α) was substantially downregulated in ALK(+)ALCL cells in response to siRNA knockdown of NPM-ALK. CK2α is biologically important in ALK(+)ALCL, as its inhibition using 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole or siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth and a substantial decrease in the β-catenin protein level. Furthermore, CK2α co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK and regulated its level of serine phosphorylation, a feature previously shown to correlate with the oncogenic potential of this fusion protein. To conclude, this study has revealed a novel crosstalk between NPM-ALK and CK2α, and our data supports the model that these two molecules work synergistically to promote the tumorigenicity of these lymphomas.",

Translocations involving ALK, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene, are associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Such ALK-positive ALCLs are usually responsive to a multidrug chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). However, there is no general consensus on the optimal therapy for relapsed or refractory ALCL. We report the case of a 24-year-old male suffering from ALK-positive ALCL with an uncommon manifestation of only extranodal disease in the gastric cardia region that showed primary refractoriness to standard CHOP chemotherapy. A combination therapy consisting of the anti-CD30 drug conjugate, brentuximab vedotin, and classical lymphoma salvage regimen DHAP (cisplatin, high-dose cytarabine and dexamethasone) was administered. Following two treatment cycles in 21-day intervals, the lymphoma showed considerable regression based on imaging diagnostics and no evidence of vital lymphoma in a subsequent biopsy. We did not observe any increase in toxicity; in particular, polyneuropathy and febrile neutropenia were not observed. In summary, we report that the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and a classical regimen used for aggressive lymphoma, DHAP, could be combined as salvage therapy in a case of refractory ALK-positive ALCL.

Approximately half of these lymphomas are associated with a typical chromosomal translocation, t(2;5)(p23;q35). Much confusion about the exact classification and clinicopathological features of this subgroup of NHL was clarified with the identification of NPM-ALK (nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase) as the oncogene created by the t(2;5) (Morris et al., 1994). With the discovery of NPM-ALK as the specific lymphoma gene mutation, this NHL subtype could be redefined on the molecular level. This achievement was enhanced by the availability of specific antibodies that recognize ALK fusion proteins in paraffin-embedded lymphoma tissues. Several excellent recent reviews have summarized the histopathological and molecular findings of ALCL and their use in the classification of this lymphoma entity (Anagnostopoulos and Stein, 2000; Benharroch et al., 1998; Drexler et al., 2000; Foss et al., 2000; Gogusev and Nezelof, 1998; Kadin and Morris, 1998; Ladanyi, 1997; Morris et al., 2001; Shiota and Mori, 1996; Skinnider et al., 1999; Stein et al., 2000).

SHP1, a tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates JAK/STAT, is frequently absent in ALK+ ALCL owing to gene methylation. To test the hypothesis that loss of SHP1 contributes to JAK3/STAT3 activation in ALK+ ALCL cells, we induced SHP1 expression using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, in ALK+ ALCL cell lines, and correlated with changes in the JAK3/STAT3 pathway. 5-AZA gradually restored SHP1 expression in Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells over 5 days. The initially low level of SHP1 expression did not result in significant changes to the expression or tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3. However, higher levels of SHP1 seen subsequently correlated with substantial decreases in JAK3 and pJAK3, followed by pSTAT3 (but not STAT3). Importantly, the decrease in JAK3 was abrogated by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. 5-AZA induced no significant increase in apoptosis but it sensitized ALCL cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Our findings support the concept that loss of SHP1 contributes to the constitutive activation of JAK3/STAT3 in ALK+ ALCL cells.

There were 10 males and 3 females with a median age of 49 years old. Seven presented with pure nodal disease and 5 had bony involvement. The staging results were stage I (5 patients), II (1), III (1), and IV (4). The pathologic subtypes were common variant (10), lymphohistiocytic variant (2), and small cell variant (1). Eleven tumors were of T-cell lineage; 2, null-cell. Immunohistochemically, 5 tumors (38.5%) expressed cytotoxic markers, T-cell intracellular antigen-1 and/or granzyme B. Two tumors (15.4%) expressed anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Long-term follow-up information was available in 8 patients. The 2 patients with ALK-expressing tumors (37 and 49 years old) were free of disease for 61 and 54 months, respectively.

In search for common pathways activated by oncogenic ALK across different tumors types, we found that hypoxia pathways were significantly enriched in ALK-rearranged ALCL and NSCLC, as compared with other types of T-cell lymphoma or EGFR- and K-RAS-mutated NSCLC, respectively. Consistently, in both ALCL and NSCLC, we found that under hypoxic conditions, ALK directly regulated the abundance of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which are key players of the hypoxia response in normal tissues and cancers. In ALCL, the upregulation of HIF1α and HIF2α in hypoxic conditions required ALK activity and its downstream signaling proteins STAT3 and C/EBPβ. In vivo, ALK regulated VEGFA production and tumor angiogenesis in ALCL and NSCLC, and the treatment with the anti-VEGFA antibody bevacizumab strongly impaired ALCL growth in mouse xenografts. Finally, HIF2α, but not HIF1α, was required for ALCL growth in vivo whereas the growth and metastasis potential of ALK-rearranged NSCLC required both HIF1α and HIF2α.

However, long-term therapeutic benefits of crizotinib are limited due to development of drug resistance. CH5424802--more potent and selective ALK inhibitor--comprises a good candidate for second-line treatment in crizotinib-relapsed patients. The aim of this study was to determine possible mechanisms of resistance to ALK inhibitors that can appear in ALCL patients.;ALK+ ALCL cell lines resistant to crizotinib (Karpas299CR) and to CH5424802 (Karpas299CHR) were established by long-term exposure of Karpas299 cells to these inhibitors. Next, alterations in their sensitivity to ALK, HSP90 and mTOR inhibitors were investigated by cell viability and BrdU incorporation assays and immunoblot analysis.;cDNA sequencing of ALK kinase domain revealed activating mutations-I1171T in Karpas299CR and F1174C in Karpas299CHR. The resistant cells displayed diminished sensitivity to structurally unrelated ALK inhibitors-crizotinib, CH5424802 and TAE684. Nevertheless, CH5424802 and TAE684 were still more potent against the resistant cells than crizotinib. Moreover, Karpas299CR and Karpas299CHR cells remained sensitive to HSP90 or mTOR inhibitors.;Resistance mediated by activating mutations in ALK kinase domain may emerge in ALCL patients during ALK inhibitors treatment. However, more potent second-generation ALK inhibitors, HSP90 or mTOR inhibitors may represent an effective therapy for relapsed ALK+ ALCL patients.",

To study the function of ALK, an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system was stably introduced into cultured human ALCL cells. Inducing shRNA expression in the generated cells resulted in cellular ALK gene silencing and led to inactivation of multiple signaling pathways and growth arrest. Interestingly, a combination of ALK gene silencing with U0126, a kinase inhibitor specific for the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 pathway, resulted in an augmented reduction in cellular JunB expression. Functional studies indicated that combining ALK gene silencing with U0126 treatment provided a synergistic growth inhibition, which occurred faster and was more profound than with either treatment alone. This synergistic effect was also observed when measuring cell proliferation, apoptosis, and in vitro cell colony formation. Importantly, the combination of ALK gene silencing and U0126 had a prolonged inhibitory effect, preventing recovery of ALCL cell growth even after treatments were removed. Moreover, this synergistic inhibitory effect was confirmed in vivo using a mouse model with xenografted ALCL tumors. Our findings indicate that combining cellular ALK gene silencing with a low dose of U0126 may prove to be an effective and more specific therapeutic approach to treating ALCL.",

To further analyse the transforming activity in an animal model, a cDNA encoding the protein product, NPM-ALK, was incorporated into a retrovirus construct and introduced into mouse bone marrow progenitors by infection. In a bone marrow gene transfer and transplantation protocol the hematopoietic compartments of lethally irradiated IL-9 transgenic mice were reconstituted with npm-alk infected progenitor cells. IL-9 transgenic mice were chosen, because IL-9, a pleiotropic T helper 2 cytokine, is expressed in most cases of human ALCL and was shown to have an oncogenic potential at least on T cells. Reconstituted mice developed NPM-ALK positive lymphomas including lymphoblastic lymphomas of T-cell type (T-LB), mature and immature plasmacytoma (PZ) and plasmoblastic/anaplastic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after 10-30 weeks. The combined overexpression of NPM-ALK and IL-9 exerts cooperative oncogenic activity in the transformation of murine lymphoid cells leading to accelerated and enhanced development of T-LB. Many animals developed plasmacytic/plasmoblastic neoplasms, of which the most aggressive tumours share many features with human anaplastic/plasmoblastic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",

Among several pathways triggered by ALK signaling, constitutive activation of STAT3 is strictly required for ALK-mediated transformation and survival. Here we performed genome-wide microRNA profiling and identified 48 microRNA concordantly modulated by the inducible knock-down of ALK and STAT3. To evaluate the functional role of differentially expressed miRNA, we forced their expression in ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, and monitored their influence after STAT3 depletion. We found that the expression of the microRNA-17~92 cluster partially rescues STAT3 knock-down by sustaining proliferation and survival of ALK(+) cells. Experiments in a xenograft mouse model indicated that forced expression of microRNA-17~92 interferes with STAT3 knock-down in vivo. High expression levels of the microRNA-17~92 cluster resulted in down-regulation of BIM and TGFβRII proteins, suggesting that their targeting might mediate resistance to STAT3 knock-down in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells. We speculate that the microRNA-17~92 cluster is involved in lymphomagenesis of STAT3(+) ALCL and that its inhibition might represent an alternative avenue to interfere with ALK signaling in anaplastic large cell lymphomas.

Essential defining features comprise of a proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 and a characteristic growth pattern. Using molecular and clinical criteria three entities of ALC-lymphoma have been identified: primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALC-lymphoma, primary systemic ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma and primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma. The ALK expression in the primary systemic ALC-lymphoma entity is caused by chromosomal translocations, most commonly t(2;5), and can nowadays be reliably detected by immuno-histology. ALK-positive ALC-lymphoma predominantly affects young male patients and if treated with chemotherapy has a favourable prognosis. They show a broad morphological spectrum, with the \"common type\", the small cell variant and the lymphohistiocytic variant being most commonly observed. The knowledge of the existence of these variants is essential in establishing the correct diagnosis. ALK-negative ALC-lymphomas occur in older patients, equally affecting both genders and have an unfavorable prognosis. The morphology and the immuno-phenotype of primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma shows an overlap with that of lymphomatoid papulosis. Both diseases have an excellent prognosis and secondary systemic dissemination is only rarely observed. The ALC-lymphomas described above derive from T cells and are generally accepted as biological entities. In contrast, large B-cell-lymphomas with anaplastic morphology are now believed not to represent an own entity but a morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Malignant lymphomas with morphological features of both Hodgkin- and ALC-lymphoma have formerly been classified as ALCL Hodgkin-like. Recent immuno-histological analysis of these cases however suggests that ALCL Hodgkin-like does not represent an own lymphoma entity. Most of these cases are likely to be examples of tumor cell rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while a minority of these cases appear to fall either into the category of ALK-positive or ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma.",

Moreover, Vav3 is phosphorylated in NPM-ALK positive biopsies from patients suffering from ALCL, demonstrating the pathological relevance of this observation.

A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a cervical lymph node showed a cellular aspiration comprised of medium-sized plasmacytoid cells in a discohesive and focally loosely cohesive pattern. The cytologic diagnosis confirmed the presence of malignancy and noted the prominent plasmacytoid features. An accompanying comment favored melanoma and included a broad differential. No cell block was available for immunohistochemical stains. Immunophenotyping of the subsequent excisional node biopsy showed an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALCL. This case illustrates a new variant of ALCL. Although ALCL variants, such as small cell and lymphohistiocytic, are well recognized, the plasmacytoid features are an additional potential source for misdiagnosis. This case report shows that a cytopathologist should include ALK-positive ALCL in the differential diagnosis of plasmacytoid proliferations cell because of the clinical importance of the ALK-positive ALCL.",

Here we show that ALCLs of both subtypes are addicted to IRF4 signaling, as knockdown of IRF4 by RNA interference was toxic to ALCL cell lines in vitro and in ALCL xenograft mouse models in vivo. Gene expression profiling after IRF4 knockdown demonstrated a significant downregulation of a variety of known MYC target genes. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that MYC is a primary target of IRF4, identifying a novel regulatory mechanism of MYC expression and its target gene network in ALCL. MYC, itself, is essential for ALCL survival, as both knockdown of MYC and pharmacologic inhibition of MYC signaling were toxic to ALCL cell lines.

In view of the oncogenic potential of STAT3, we further examined its biological significance in ALCL using two ALK(+) ALCL cell lines (Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1) and an adenoviral vector that carries dominant-negative STAT3 (AdSTAT3DN). Infection by AdSTAT3DN led to the expression of STAT3DN in both ALK(+) ALCL cell lines at a similar efficiency. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that a significant proportion of the expressed STAT3DN protein translocated to the nucleus, despite the fact that STAT3DN has a mutation at residue 705(tyrosine --> phenylalanine), a site that is believed to be crucial for STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation. Introduction of STAT3DN induced apoptosis and G(1) cell cycle arrest. Western blot studies showed that expression of STAT3DN resulted in caspase-3 cleavage, downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cyclin D3, survivin, Mcl-1, c-Myc and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. These results support the concept that STAT3 activation is pathogenetically important in ALCL cells by deregulating the expression of multiple target proteins that are involved in the control of apoptosis and cell cycle progression.",

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) ALCL is associated with the NPM-ALK t(2;5) translocation, which is highly correlated with the identification of the ALK protein by immunohistochemistry. ALK+ ALCL typically occurs in younger patients and has a more favorable prognosis with 5-year survival rates of 70% to 90% in comparison with 40% to 60% for ALK-negative (ALK-) ALCL. Studies support young age as a strong component of the favorable prognosis of ALK+ ALCL. Until recently, no recurrent translocations were identified in ALK- ALCL. However, emerging data now highlight that ALK- ALCL is genetically and clinically heterogeneous with a subset having either a DUSP22 translocation and a survival rate similar to ALK+ ALCL or a less common P63 translocation, the latter associated with an aggressive course. Anthracycline-based regimens such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) remain the standard first-line treatment choice for systemic ALCL, but in many patients with ALK- ALCL, it is ineffective, and thus it is often followed by consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation. However, selection of appropriate patients for intensified therapy remains challenging, particularly in light of genetic and clinical heterogeneity in addition to the emergence of new, effective therapies. The antibody drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin is associated with a high response rate (86%) and durable remissions in relapsed/refractory ALCL and is under investigation in the first-line setting. In the future, combining clinical and genetic biomarkers may aid in risk stratification and help guide initial patient management. ",

We found that Twist1 is aberrantly expressed in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ALCL), a type of T-cell lymphoid malignancy. Using RT-PCR and Western blots, Twist1 was detectable in all 3 ALK+ALCL cell lines examined but absent in normal T-cells. By immunohistochemistry, Twist1 was detectable in all 10 cases of ALK+ALCL examined; benign lymphoid tissues were consistently negative. Twist1 expression in ALK+ALCL cells can be attributed to the NPM-ALK/STAT3 signaling axis, the key oncogenic driving force in this tumor type. Twist1 is biologically important in ALK+ALCL cells, as Twist1 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in their invasiveness in an in-vitro assay. Further investigation revealed that this increase in invasiveness is linked to the activation of AKT and down-regulation of p66Shc, two signaling proteins known to be involved in NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis. Lastly, knockdown of Twist1 sensitizes ALK+ALCL cells to the growth inhibitory effect of PF-2341066 (Crizotinib®), an ALK inhibitor being used in clinical trials.

The latter is capable of activating ERK kinase, which upregulates JUNB expression through ETS1. JUNB, in turn, interacts with the TNFRSF8 (CD30) gene promoter and induces CD30 (TNFRSF8) overexpression. However, the role of CD30 overexpression in ALK+ ALCL oncogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that the JUNB gene is frequently amplified in ALK+ ALCL, suggesting gene amplification as an additional underlying mechanism for JUNB overexpression. Silencing of JUNB resulted in reduced cell growth and colony formation associated with decreased activator protein-1 activity and G1/S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. These effects were linked to decreased CD30 levels, downregulation of CCNA2 (Cyclin A), CCND2 (Cyclin D2) and CCND3 (Cyclin D3) and upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2A (p14) and CDKN1A (p21), but not CDKN1B (p27). Similar cell cycle changes were observed following the knock-down of TNFRSF8 gene or blockade of its function using anti-CD30 antibodies, which were associated with upregulation of CDKN2A and CDKN1A, but not CDKN1B. These findings indicate that JUNB may partly operate through CD30 signalling. Silencing of JUNB also sensitized NPM1-ALCL+ cells to standard chemotherapeutic agents.

Because aberrant CD30 expression was also observed in the T-cell lymphoma derived from lineage-specific NPM-ALK transgenic mice, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a functional relationship between the two neoplastic-related proteins: NPM-ALK and CD30. In this study, we used the RNA interference method to modulate NPM-ALK protein expression in ALCL-derived, t(2;5)-positive Karpas 299 cells. We observed decreased CD30 expression when NPM-ALK was repressed. Further analysis suggested that JunB functioned as the mediator of NPM-ALK-derived CD30 transcriptional regulation. The NPM-ALK-repressed cells, which had low CD30 expression, were characterized with lower cell proliferation compared with cells in the control group, suggesting that altered CD30 expression may correlate to NPM-ALK-mediated tumor cell growth inhibition. Combination of NPM-ALK repression and CD30 ligand leads to significantly increased tumor cell growth inhibition compared with one method alone, suggesting its potential application for ALCL-specific cancer treatment.",

All such cases result from a novel fusion created by the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23 and NPM on 5q35 or other variant translocation partners. A rare variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), originally described in 1997, was thought to overexpress full-length ALK in contrast to a chimeric protein characteristic of ALCL. However, full-length ALK protein lacks tyrosine kinase activity and thus the mechanism of oncogenesis has remained elusive. We describe 6 cases of ALK+ DLBCL characterized by a simple or complex t(2;17)(p23;q23) involving the clathrin gene (CLTC) at chromosome band 17q23 and the ALK gene at chromosome band 2p23. All cases were studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), complemented in one case with standard cytogenetic analysis, multicolor karyotyping (M-FISH), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. These results clearly demonstrate that most cases of ALK+ DLBCL share the same mechanism of deregulated ALK expression. Moreover, these results demonstrate the presence of CLTC-ALK fusions in these tumors and extend the list of diseases associated with this genetic abnormality to include classical T-cell or null ALCL, ALK+ DLBCL, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.",

RNA sequencing and 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends identified 2 novel ERBB4-truncated transcripts displaying intronic transcription start sites. By luciferase assays, we defined that the expression of ERBB4-aberrant transcripts is promoted by endogenous intronic long terminal repeats. ERBB4 expression was confirmed at the protein level by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lastly, we demonstrated that ERBB4-truncated forms show oncogenic potentials and that ERBB4 pharmacologic inhibition partially controls ALCL cell growth and disease progression in an ERBB4-positive patient-derived tumorgraft model.

Using a mass spectrometry (MS)-driven approach to identify changes in protein expression caused by the NPM/ALK fusion, we identified diverse NPM/ALK-induced changes affecting cell proliferation, ribosome synthesis, survival, apoptosis evasion, angiogenesis, and cytoarchitectural organization. MS-based findings were confirmed using Western blotting and/or immunostaining of NPM/ALK-transfected cells and ALK-deregulated lymphomas. A subset of the proteins distinguished NPM/ALK-positive ALCLs from NPM/ALK-negative ALCLs and Hodgkin lymphoma. The multiple NPM/ALK-deregulated pathways identified by MS analysis also predicted novel biologic effects of NPM/ALK expression. In this regard, we showed loss of cell adhesion as a consequence of NPM/ALK expression in a kinase-dependent manner, and sensitivity of NPM/ALK-positive ALCLs to inhibition of the RAS, p42/44ERK, and FRAP/mTOR signaling pathways. These findings reveal that the NPM/ALK alteration affects diverse cellular pathways, and provide novel insights into NPM/ALK-positive ALCL pathobiology.

In 22 patients, ALK expression was studied in multiple biopsies from different sites (including 13 skin, 16 lymph node, and nine other). Overall survival time was analysed using the Kaplan Meier method.;ALK expression was found in 20 of 51 systemic ALCLs with (primary) nodal involvement. No ALK expression was found in 15 primary cutaneous, 14 gastrointestinal, and five nasal ALCLs. Multiple and subsequent biopsies of patients showed ALK expression to be identical to that seen in the primary diagnostic biopsy. Kaplan Meier survival curves showed that in ALK negative ALCLs originating from different sites, primary cutaneous cases are associated with an excellent overall survival, whereas the other cases show a comparable five years survival of less than 40%.;If present, ALK expression favours systemic ALCL with (primary) nodal involvement, and can be used in differentiating between extranodal involvement of systemic (nodal) ALCL and primary extranodal ALCL.

Previous studies have reported differences in apoptotic rate and expression levels of apoptosis regulatory proteins between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL. In this study, we assessed for expression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway proteins cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 in 2 ALK+ ALCL cell lines and 42 ALCL tumors (17 ALK+, 25 ALK-). We used the Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cell lines, and the inhibitors Z-LEHD-FMK (specific for caspase 9) and Boc-D-FMK (general caspase inhibitor) to investigate the role of caspase 9 activation in chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death. Caspase 9 activity was significantly increased in Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1 cells after chemotherapy treatment, but remained as low as control levels with addition of either caspase inhibitor. Both caspase inhibitors rescued a substantial fraction of Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells from drug-induced cell death. In ALCL tumors, expression of cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 was also assessed and correlated with apoptotic rate and activated caspase 3 levels. Cytochrome c was expressed in all 13 (100%) ALK+ and 18 (95%) of 19 ALK- ALCL tumors. Apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 was detected in 14 (88%) of 16 ALK+ and 19 (79%) of 24 ALK- ALCL tumors. Procaspase 9 was expressed in 5 (30%) of 17 ALK+ and 2 (8%) of 25 ALK- ALCL tumors (P = .09). In the entire study group (ALK+ and ALK- ALCL), procaspase 9 expression levels significantly correlated with apoptotic rate (P = .02) and activated caspase 3 levels (P = .05). This correlation could not be shown in the ALK+ or ALK- ALCL subgroups, presumably because of the small sample size. In conclusion, chemotherapy-induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL cells involves the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and apoptosome function may be an important determinant of apoptosis in ALCL tumors.",

In anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK(+)) ALCL cells, B7-H1 expression was suppressed by the blocking of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and upregulated by the augmentation of ERK activity by phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate stimulation, suggesting that B7-H1 expression is regulated by ERK signaling pathway in ALCL. ERK is one of the downstream mediators of nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK signaling in ALK(+)ALCL, and pharmacological inhibition of ALK was shown to dephosphorylate ERK and down-regulate B7-H1. The involvement of NPM/ALK in B7-H1 expression was also demonstrated by introducing the construct into human non-ALCL lymphoid cell lines, which resulted in B7-H1 expression. In the case of HL, B7-H1 expression was shown to be dependent on the ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.

To fully assess the biologic significance of loss of SHP1 in ALK(+)ALCL, we transfected SHP1 plasmids into 2 SHP1(-), ALK(+)ALCL cell lines, Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1. After 24 hours of transfection, pJAK3 and pSTAT3 were decreased, and these changes correlated with down-regulation of STAT3 downstream targets including cyclin D3, mcl-1, and bcl-2. Expression of SHP1 in these 2 cell lines also resulted in marked decreases in the protein levels of JAK3 and NPM-ALK, and these effects were reversible by proteosome inhibitor MG132. Conversely, when SHP1 expression in SUP-M2 (a SHP1(+) ALK(+)ALCL cell line) was inhibited using siRNA, pSTAT3, pJAK3, JAK3, and NPM-ALK were all up-regulated. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that SHP1 was physically associated with JAK3 and NPM-ALK. SHP1 expression in Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 led to significant G(1) cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. To conclude, loss of SHP1 contributes to the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL by 2 mechanisms: (1) it leaves the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK3/STAT3 unchecked and (2) it decreases proteosome degradation of JAK3 and NPM-ALK.",

Neoplastic cells accounted for only a small proportion of the total cells in FCI, with a median of 19.3% (range, 7.9-31.8%), which was significantly higher than those in the control groups (all <1.0%). The sensitivity of FCI for diagnosing ALCL in lymph node samples was 86.7% with a specificity of 100%. The majority of neoplastic cells demonstrated high light forward and high light side scatter, similar to monocytes or granulocytes in dot plots. FCI may be used as an adjunct to histopathological examination for rapid and reliable diagnosis of pediatric ALCL. Flexible gating strategies and careful analysis are required to identify neoplastic cells with FCI.",

In this study, we assessed ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors for p53 gene alterations using PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing methods. We also immunohistochemically assessed ALCL tumors for p53 expression. Three of 36 (8%) ALCL tumors (1/14 ALK+, 2/22 ALK-) with adequate DNA showed p53 gene mutations. By contrast, p53 was overexpressed in 36 of 55 (65%) ALCL tumors (16 ALK+, 20 ALK-). p21, a target of p53, was expressed in 15 of 31 (48%) ALCL tumors including seven of 15 (47%) p53-positive tumors. p21 expression in a subset of ALCL suggests the presence of functional p53 protein. Apoptotic rate was significantly higher in p53-positive than p53-negative tumors (mean 2.78 vs 0.91%, P = 0.0003). We conclude that the p53 gene is rarely mutated in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently, a distinctive entity characterized by expression of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein [most frequently due to the t(2;5)(p23;q35)-associated NPM-ALK fusion] has emerged within the heterogenous group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) classified as anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Sporadic variant 2p23/ALK abnormalities identified in ALK-positive ALCL indicate that genes other than NPM may also be involved in the deregulation of ALK and lymphomagenesis. We report here three cases with an inv(2)(p23q35) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in young male patients with ALK-positive ALCL. In contrast to ALCL cases with the classical t(2;5)(p23;q35) that usually show both cytoplasmic and nuclear or predominantly nuclear alone localization of the NPM-ALK chimeric product, in all three cases with an inv(2)(p23q35) the ALK protein accumulated in the cytoplasm only, supporting the previous assumption that the oncogenic potential of ALK may not be dependent on its nuclear localization. As the first step to identify the ALK partner gene involved in the inv(2)(p23q35), we performed extensive FISH studies and demonstrated that the 2q35 breakpoint occurred within the 1,750-kb region contained within the 914E7 YAC. Moreover, a striking association of the inv(2)(p23q35) with a secondary chromosomal change, viz, ider(2)(q10)inv(2)(p23q35), carrying two additional copies of the putative ALK-related fusion gene, was found in all three patients, suggesting that, in contrast to the standard t(2;5)/NPM-ALK fusion, multiple copies of the putative 2q35-ALK chimeric gene may be required for efficient tumor development. In summary, we demonstrate that the inv(2)(p23q35), a variant of the t(2;5)(p23;q35), is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in ALK-positive ALCL, the further characterization of which should provide new insight into the pathogenesis of these lymphomas.",

This translocation leads to the expression of a hybrid protein consisting of the N-terminal portion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the intracellular domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). NPM-ALK possesses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity responsible for its oncogenic property through activation of downstream effectors such as phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma) and the type IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Here, we show that the Src-kinases, particularly pp60(c-src), associate with and are activated by NPM-ALK expression in various cells, and in cell lines established from patients with ALCL. The kinase activity and the tyrosine 418 of NPM-ALK are required for its association with Src-kinases. Y418F mutation of NPM-ALK impaired its association with Src-kinases and strongly reduced the proliferation rate of Ba/F3 cells. In agreement, Src-kinase inhibitors or pp60(c-src) siRNA significantly decreased the proliferation rate of NPM-ALK-positive ALCL cell lines. Moreover, using active or inactive forms of pp60(c-src) and NPM-ALK, we provide evidence that NPM-ALK is a potential substrate of pp60(c-src).

To elucidate the signaling pathways required for ALK-mediated transformation and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the transcriptomes of multiple ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, abrogating their ALK-mediated signaling by inducible ALK RNA interference (RNAi) or with potent and cell-permeable ALK inhibitors. Transcripts derived from the gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis uncovered a reproducible signature, which included a novel group of ALK-regulated genes. Functional RNAi screening on a set of these ALK transcriptional targets revealed that the transcription factor C/EBPbeta and the antiapoptotic protein BCL2A1 are absolutely necessary to induce cell transformation and/or to sustain the growth and survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells.

In 10% to 20% of ALCLs, the translocation partners of the ALK gene are genes other than NPM (variant translocations). ALK gene expression limited to the cytoplasm implies a variant translocation. In this study, we have investigated 46 cases of ALCL for expression and localization of ALK protein and its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (by hybridization to EBV-encoded nuclear RNA-1 [EBER-1] and immunostaining for LMP-1). ALCL patients with a null cell phenotype were significantly younger as compared with those of T-cell phenotype (mean age: 28 years v 42 years; P =.018). Sixteen of 46 ALCL cases (34%) were ALK positive. ALK-positive patients were significantly younger (mean age: 25 years for those with both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining; 22 years for those with exclusive cytoplasmic staining; and 41 years for those negative for the ALK gene; P =.023). EBER-1 was detected in 9 of 46 cases (20%), and LMP-1 expression was noted in 5 of them. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, all EBV-associated cases that were investigated showed type I EBV.

Further, although ALK-positive-EBER-1+ cases were LMP-1 negative, ALK-negative-EBER-1+ cases were LMP-1 positive.

        "Doc_abstract":"Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) frequently carries the t(2;5)(p23;q35) and overexpresses anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). MUC-1, a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein, is detected in normal and malignant epithelial cells and has been associated with a poorer patient survival in various human malignancies. We have shown previously that MUC-1 is expressed as a consequence of t(1;14)(q21;32) in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. ALCLs are known to express MUC-1, but its clinical significance is undefined. For this study, eligible patients with ALCL were HIV negative, received anthracycline-containing regimens, and had pretreatment archival tissue. Expression of MUC-1 and ALK was determined immunohistochemically after heat-induced antigen retrieval. A 10% cutoff for MUC-1 positivity was used. We identified 63 patients with systemic ALCL (22 ALK+, 41 ALK-) with a median age of 47 years, and 41 were male. MUC-1 was detected in 16 of 22 (73%) ALK-positive and 20 of 41 (49%) ALK-negative ALCL (P = 0.06, chi(2) test). MUC-1 expression was not associated with apoptotic rate as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay or proliferation index as evaluated by MIB-1 antibody. For 48 patients with ALCL (16 ALK+, 32 ALK-) and complete clinical follow-up, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 39.7% for patients with MUC-1-positive tumors versus 75.2% (P = 0.027 by Log-rank) for patients with MUC-1-negative tumors. For the ALK-negative ALCL group of 32 patients, the 5-year PFS was 26 versus 70.8% for patients with MUC-1-positive versus MUC-1-negative tumors (P = 0.0096 by Log-rank). For the ALK-positive ALCL group of 16 patients, the 5-year PFS was 52 versus 100% for patients with MUC-1-positive versus MUC-1-negative tumors (P, not significant). In summary, MUC-1 is frequently expressed in systemic ALCL, and its expression is associated with significantly inferior outcome in patients untreated previously with ALK-negative tumors. Future studies should explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of MUC-1 expression in these tumors and its role as a target for novel therapeutic strategies.",

Clinicopathologic studies have shown that ALK expression in ALCL is associated with improved 5-year survival rates when compared with ALCL lacking ALK expression. This study used paraffin-embedded tissue to compare interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of t(2;5) with immunohistochemical analysis for the detection of ALK protein expression in 27 patients with CD30-positive ALCLs. ALK protein expression was detected with ALK1 antibody in 14 of the 27 patients. The neoplastic cells in 13 of these 14 lymphomas reacted with the p80NPM/ALK antibody. FISH, using a two-color ALK DNA probe, correlated 100% with the immunohistochemical results: a translocation involving the ALK gene was detected in all 14 lymphomas that reacted with anti-ALK1. RT-PCR, performed on 21 lymphomas, detected NPM-ALK mRNA in five of the lymphomas, all of which reacted with anti-ALK1 and showed ALK gene rearrangement by FISH. Lymphomas showing ALK1 reactivity occurred in a younger patient population (median age, 19.5 years) and were associated with improved 5-year survival rates (84%), as compared with lymphomas lacking ALK1 reactivity (median age, 68.0 years; 5-year survival rate, 35%; p = 0.008).

Biopsy of the enlarged lymph node contained almost no lymphoid element except for a few CD8-positive T cells, plasma cells and isolated CD30-positive blasts. The patient's condition improved following lymphadenectomy but relapse occurred 3 months later with multiple nodes, high fever and an abdominal mass.

The tumour cells harbour a t(2;5) translocation, revealing a null phenotype by immunohistochemistry and no evidence for T-cell clonality by Southern blotting.

NPM-ALK induces a variety of oncogenic signaling pathways that lead to malignant transformation of T-cells via Activator Protein-1 (AP-1), STAT3 and other (transcription) factors. In addition to the commonly known AP-1 activators Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), there are other signaling pathways, such as PI3K/mTOR/AKT, which are implicated in AP-1 activation/expression in ALCL. The AP-1 factor JUNB was shown to drive ALCL proliferation and the expression of the characteristic ALCL Ki-1 antigen, CD30. cJUN and JUNB target PDGFRB, thereby leading to tumor progression and dissemination. Furthermore, aberrant gene expression in ALCL is frequently accompanied by changes in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation patterns.

The clinical features of adults with ALCL are incompletely described, and the prognostic factors that are useful for predicting survival remain unclear. This report describes the clinical and laboratory findings in 70 adults with systemic ALCL who were treated with curative intent. We attempted to identify the clinical and pathological factors of prognostic importance, including the International Prognostic Index (IPI), immunophenotype, and expression of the ALK protein. The median age of the patients was 49 years (range, 15 to 75). There were 26 women and 44 men with a median follow-up of 50 months for living patients. Advanced stage was present in 56% and B symptoms were noted in 70% of the patients. Immunostains showed that 46% of the cases had a T-cell phenotype, 36% a null phenotype, and 18% a B-cell phenotype. The expression of ALK protein was found in 51% of the cases. The IPI factors were evenly distributed between the ALK+ and ALK- groups, except that the ALK+ patients were younger (median age, 30 v 61 years; P <.002). The ALK+ cohort included cases with null (44%), T-cell (42%), and B-cell (14%) phenotypes. All 10 cases with cytogenetic or molecular evidence of a t(2;5) were ALK+. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 65%. The 5-year OS of the ALK+ and ALK- cases was 79% and 46%, respectively (P <.0003). Analysis of only the T-cell/null cases (n = 57) showed a 5-year OS of 93% for the ALK+ cases and only 37% for the ALK- cases (P <.00001). Univariate analysis of the clinical features showed that age </=60 years (P <.007), a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P <.00001), a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] <2) (P <.03), </=1 extranodal site of disease (P <.012), and an IPI score </=3 (P <.00001) were associated with improved OS. Although a younger age correlated with ALK positivity, multivariate analysis showed that only a normal serum LDH (P <. 00001), an IPI score of </=3 (P <.0005), and ALK protein expression (P <.005) predicted independently for an improved OS.

Moreover, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative ALCL clustered in a separate branch together with ALCL-like HL.

The simulations reveal the predominant role of the VAV1-CDC42 (cell division control protein 42) pathway in NPM-ALK-driven cellular proliferation and of the Ras / mitogen-activated ERK kinase (MEK) / extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in controlling cell survival. Our results also highlight the importance of a group of interleukins together with the Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) / signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling in the development of NPM-ALK derived ALCL. Depending on the activity of JAK3 and STAT3, the system may also be sensitive to activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP1), which has an inhibitory effect on cell survival and proliferation. The identification of signalling pathways active in tumourigenic processes is of fundamental importance for effective therapies. The prediction of alternative pathways that circumvent classical therapeutic targets opens the way to preventive approaches for countering the emergence of cancer resistance.",

In the present study we investigated whether oncogenic tyrosine kinase activation also occurs in other categories of lymphoma by staining 145 cases of lymphoma covering those tumours with a range of different subtypes including those with morphological similarity to ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Twelve cases of the borderline malignant disorder lymphomatoid papulosis were also studied. Twenty seven of the 28 cases of ALK-positive ALCL showed the extensive cytoplasmic labelling for phosphotyrosine in the neoplastic cells. The remaining case containing moesin-ALK exhibited membrane-associated phosphotyrosine expression. There was no nuclear phosphotyrosine labelling in any of the ALK-positive ALCL, even though ALK was present within the cell nuclei in 23 of the tumours. Variable degrees of phosphotyrosine labelling, usually membrane-restricted, were observed in 7/40 cases of ALK-negative ALCL, 9/29 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 3/6 cases of mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, 2/7 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3/6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified, 4/6 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 2/6 cases of follicular lymphomas and 2/12 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis studied. However none of these phosphotyrosine-positive cases showed the strong cytoplasmic labelling comparable to that seen in ALK-positive lymphoma. We conclude that activation of a tyrosine kinase is probably not a major oncogenic event in lymphomas other than ALK-positive ALCL.",

Approximately 20% of ALCLs that express ALK do not contain the t(2;5), suggesting that other genetic abnormalities can result in aberrant ALK expression. Here we report the molecular characterization of an alternative genetic means of ALK activation, the inv(2)(p23q35). This recurrent abnormality produces a fusion of the amino-terminus of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a bifunctional homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate and final steps of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, with the intracellular portion of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. RT-PCR analysis of 5 ALCL tumors that contained the inv(2) revealed identical ATIC-ALK fusion cDNA junctions in all of the cases. Transient expression studies show that the ATIC-ALK fusion transcript directs the synthesis of an approximately 87-kd chimeric protein that is localized to the cytoplasm, in contrast to NPM-ALK, which typically exhibits a cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular distribution. ATIC-ALK was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and could convert the IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 to cytokine-independent growth. Our studies demonstrate an alternative mechanism for ALK involvement in the genesis of NHL and suggest that ATIC-ALK activation results from ATIC-mediated homodimerization. In addition, expected decreases in ATIC enzymatic function in ATIC-ALK-containing lymphomas may render these tumors more sensitive to antifolate drugs such as methotrexate.

Risk stratification of children with ALCL was, until now, based on clinical parameters. More recently, pathological and biological risk factors have been described in trials applying BFM-type chemotherapy. Histological subtypes containing small-cell or lymphohistiocytic components indicate a high risk of failure. Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) detected by qualitative RT-PCR for NPM-ALK in bone marrow or blood is associated with a relapse risk of 50%. Quantification of MDD and persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) characterize very high risk patients. Serum ALK-autoantibody titres inversely correlate with relapse risk. The combination of MDD and ALK-antibody titre separates both low and very high risk patients from those with standard risk. In relapse, the time of relapse/progression, central nervous system and bone marrow involvement are major risk factors. In conclusion, MDD, MRD, ALK-antibody titres and histological subtype are strong biological risk factors in childhood ALCL.

The identification of immunogenic epitopes led to their use as targets to mediate the specific clearance of neoplastic cells by TAA targeting strategies such as vaccination strategies. One of the critical issues in the development of efficient vaccination protocols is the identification of the appropriate TAAs. The TAA should be effective as a \"tumor rejection antigen\" able to induce an immune response that will affect tumor growth. A distinct pathologic entity characterized by the expression of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) protein and named \"ALKoma\" has recently emerged within the heterogeneous group of CD30+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose expression is normally restricted to a few scattered cells in the nervous system. Its pathological expression in lymphoma cells is due to a chromosomal translocation that leads to the formation of an ALK-derived oncogenic fusion proteins. ALK fusion proteins ectopically over-expressed and constitutively activated in lymphoid cells play a key role in the neoplastic transformation by the aberrant phosphorylation of intracellular substrates that likely contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of ALCL. The high level of ALK expression in lymphoma cells and its direct role in lymphomagenesis, combined with the fact that normal ALK is expressed at low levels in the immune privileged nervous system, makes ALK an ideal lymphoma-specific target for immunotherapy of ALK+ALCL.",

In this study, we assessed whether the Dvls are important in the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL. By Western blotting, Dvl-2 and Dvl-3 were found to be highly expressed in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and patient samples. The higher molecular weight forms, consistent with phosphorylated/active Dvl proteins, were observed in these lysates. siRNA knock-down of Dvls did not affect the Wnt canonical pathway, as assessed by the β-catenin protein levels and nuclear localization. In contrast, the same treatment led to changes in the transcriptional activity of NFAT and the phosphorylation status of Src, both of which are known to be regulated by the Wnt non-canonical signaling pathways in other cell types. Coupled with these biochemical changes, there was a significant decrease in cell growth and soft agar colony formation. NPM-ALK, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase characteristic of ALK(+)ALCL, was found to bind to the Dvls and enhance their tyrosine phosphorylation. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Dvls contribute to the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL via signaling in the Wnt non-canonical pathways.

In a retrospective analysis of the City of Hope pathology database, we uncovered nine such patients, eight of whom had breast implants proximal to primary ALCL. The diagnosis of ALCL in the implant capsule occurred at a median of 7 years (range 5-30) following implant surgery, and median patient age was 45.5 years (range 32-62). Malignancy was effusion-associated in two cases and tissue-associated in six. Seven patients were negative for anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK) and one patient was positive. Treatment and follow-up data were available for four patients, all tissue-associated cases: two patients were lost to follow-up after failing to mobilize stem cells and two patients were in remission, 6 years and 7.5 years post-autologous transplant. These cases represent 24% of reported primary ALCL cases associated with breast implants. Our review of these cases and the literature suggest that (1) there is a strong skew in primary breast lymphomas associated with implant capsules toward T-cell, ALCL ALK-, and (2) the disease course for tissue-associated cases is not always indolent, with four patients requiring multiple treatment regimens.",

In our study, we retrospectively analyzed 92 patients with S-ALCL from the Peking University Lymphoma Center for clinical and molecular prognostic factors to make clear the role of ALK and other prognostic factors in Han Chinese S-ALCL.;The majority of Chinese S-ALCL patients were young male patients (median age 26, male/female ratio 1.7) and the median age was younger than previous reports regardless of ALK expression status. The only statistically significant different clinical characteristic in S-ALCL between ALK positive (ALK+) and ALK negative (ALK-) was age, with a younger median age of 22 for ALK+ compared with 30 for ALK-. However, when pediatric patients (≤ 18) were excluded, there was no age difference between ALK+ and ALK-. The groups did not differ in the proportion of males, those with clinical stage III/IV (49 vs 51%) or those with extranodal disease (53 vs 59%). Of 73 evaluable patients, the 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 60% and 47%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that three factors: advanced stage III/IV, lack of expression of ALK, and high Ki-67 expression, were associated with treatment failure in patients with S-ALCL. However, ALK expression correlated with improved survival only in patients younger than 14 years, while not in adult patients. In multivariate analysis, only clinical stage was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Expressions of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL-2) correlated with the expression of ALK, but they did not have prognostic significance. High Ki-67 expression was also a poor prognostic factor.;Our results show that ALK expression alone is not sufficient to determine the outcome of ALCL and other prognostic factors must be considered.

We studied the frequency of fascin expression in 30 ALCLs and 34 cases of classic HD, including 17 cases of the syncytial variant. Staining with CD30 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-1 also was performed in all cases. All ALCL and HD cases showed membranous and Golgi zone CD30 positivity.

In conclusion, fascin shows strong positivity in all cases of classic HD but also is positive in the majority of ALCLs, including ALK-1-positive and ALK-1-negative cases.

Among PTCL, ALK-negative ALCL was the most frequent and all of them were associated with breast implants.;Since 2010, all i-ALCL cases were collected from different institutions through Lymphopath. Immuno-morphologic features, molecular data and clinical outcome of 19 i-ALCLs have been retrospectively analyzed.;The median age of the patients was 61 years and the median length between breast implant and i-ALCL was 9 years. Most implants were silicone-filled and textured. Implant removal was performed in 17 out of 19 patients with additional treatment based on mostly CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy regimens (n = 10/19) or irradiation (n = 1/19). CHOP alone or ABVD following radiation without implant removal have been given in two patients. The two clinical presentations, i.e. effusion and less frequently tumor mass correlated with distinct histopathologic features: in situ i-ALCL (anaplastic cell proliferation confined to the fibrous capsule) and infiltrative i-ALCL (pleomorphic cells massively infiltrating adjacent tissue with eosinophils and sometimes Reed-Sternberg-like cells mimicking Hodgkin lymphoma). Malignant cells were CD30-positive, showed a variable staining for EMA and were ALK negative. Most cases had a cytotoxic T-cell immunophenotype with variable T-cell antigen loss and pSTAT3 nuclear expression. T-cell receptor genes were clonally rearranged in 13 out of 13 tested cases. After 18 months of median follow-up, the 2-year overall survival for in situ and infiltrative i-ALCL was 100% and 52.5%, respectively.;In situ i-ALCLs have an indolent clinical course and generally remain free of disease after implant removal. However, infiltrative i-ALCLs could have a more aggressive clinical course that might require additional therapy to implant removal.",

PF-2341066 also potently inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in Karpas299 or SU-DHL-1 ALCL cells (mean IC(50) value, 24 nmol/L). In biochemical and cellular screens, PF-2341066 was shown to be selective for c-Met and ALK at pharmacologically relevant concentrations across a panel of >120 diverse kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited cell proliferation, which was associated with G(1)-S-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in ALK-positive ALCL cells (IC(50) values, approximately 30 nmol/L) but not ALK-negative lymphoma cells. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling and Annexin V staining (IC(50) values, 25-50 nmol/L). P.o. administration of PF-2341066 to severe combined immunodeficient-Beige mice bearing Karpas299 ALCL tumor xenografts resulted in dose-dependent antitumor efficacy with complete regression of all tumors at the 100 mg/kg/d dose within 15 days of initial compound administration. A strong correlation was observed between antitumor response and inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis in tumor tissue. In addition, inhibition of key NPM-ALK signaling mediators, including phospholipase C-gamma, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and Akt by PF-2341066 were observed at concentrations or dose levels, which correlated with inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and function.

The oncogenic tyrosine kinase nucleophosmin/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM/ALK) delivers a strong survival signal in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). Although NPM/ALK activates multiple antiapoptotic pathways, the biologic relevance and therapeutic potential of more downstream apoptotic effectors are mostly unknown. In this report, the NPM/ALK-mediated induction of Bcl-XL (but not of Bcl-2) was identified in human ALCL-derived cells. NPM/ALK kinase activity was required to promote Bcl-XL expression and its protective effect on mitochondrial homeostasis. Down-regulation of Bcl-XL significantly reduced the antiapoptotic potential of NPM/ALK in both transformed murine Ba/F3 pro-B cells and human ALCL-derived KARPAS-299 cells. To elucidate the role of Bcl-XL in vivo, Ba/F3-NPM/ALK+ cells expressing a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Bcl-XL antisense transgene (pTet-ON) were injected into nude mice. Doxycycline administration prevented a fatal systemic disease in 15 of 15 intravenously injected mice and the appearance of subcutaneous tumor xenografts in 9 of 12 mice; in vivo down-regulation of Bcl-XL was also documented. Our results show a pivotal role for Bcl-XL in ALK-mediated oncogenicity; a single protein placed downstream of a known oncogene can be crucial for the survival of neoplastic cells both in vitro and in vivo.

The nanocomplexes were formulated by incorporating both ALK siRNA and a RNA-based CD30 aptamer probe onto nano-sized polyethyleneimine-citrate carriers. To minimize potential cytotoxicity, the individual components of the nanocomplexes were used at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Dynamic light scattering showed that formed nanocomplexes were ~140 nm in diameter and remained stable for more than 24 hours in culture medium. Cell binding assays revealed that CD30 aptamer probes selectively targeted nanocomplexes to ALCL cells, and confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed intracellular delivery of the nanocomplex. Cell transfection analysis showed that nanocomplexes silenced genes in an ALCL cell type-selective fashion. Moreover, exposure of ALCL cells to nanocomplexes carrying both ALK siRNAs and CD30 RNA aptamers specifically silenced ALK gene expression, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis.;Taken together, our findings indicate that this functional RNA nanocomplex is both tumor cell type-selective and cancer gene-specific for ALCL cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activation of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK)-mediated tumorigenesis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and correlated with unfavorable outcome in certain types of other cancers. However, the prognostic value of AKT/mTOR activation in ALCL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim to address this question from a clinical perspective by comparing the expressions of the AKT/mTOR signaling molecules in ALCL patients and exploring the therapeutic significance of targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway in ALCL.;A cohort of 103 patients with ALCL was enrolled in the study. Expression of ALK fusion proteins and the AKT/mTOR signaling phosphoproteins was studied by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The pathogenic role of ALK fusion proteins and the therapeutic significance of targeting the ATK/mTOR signaling pathway were further investigated in vitro study with an ALK + ALCL cell line and the NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells.;ALK expression was detected in 60% of ALCLs, of which 79% exhibited the presence of NPM-ALK, whereas the remaining 21% expressed variant-ALK fusions. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (p70S6K1) was detected in 76%, 80%, 91%, and 93% of ALCL patients, respectively. Both phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and p-mTOR were correlated to ALK expression, and p-mTOR was closely correlated to p-AKT. Both p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K1 were correlated to p-mTOR, but were not correlated to the expression of ALK and p-AKT. Clinically, ALK + ALCL occurred more commonly in younger patients, and ALK + ALCL patients had a much better prognosis than ALK-ALCL cases. However, expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, or p-p70S6K1 did not have an impact on the clinical outcome. Overexpression of NPM-ALK in a nonmalignant murine pro-B lymphoid cell line, BaF3, induced the cells to become cytokine-independent and resistant to glucocorticoids (GCs). Targeting AKT/mTOR inhibited growth and triggered the apoptotic cell death of ALK + ALCL cells and NPM-ALK transformed BaF3 cells, and also reversed GC resistance induced by overexpression of NPM-ALK.;Overexpression of ALK due to chromosomal translocations is seen in the majority of ALCL patients and endows them with a much better prognosis. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is highly activated in ALK + ALCL patients and targeting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway might confer a great therapeutic potential in ALCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was proposed as a clinicopathologic entity over 14 years ago, but has been somewhat controversial due to the variability of its defining features and variable occurrence in different age-groups. To evaluate this entity in a pediatric population, 36 cases of childhood large cell lymphoma were evaluated for abnormalities of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene that has been associated with ALCL morphology and immunophenotype. ALK abnormalities were evaluated by assay for the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation by RT-PCR and/or expression of NPM-ALK fusion protein by immunohistochemistry. Results showed 17 patients to have evidence of ALK gene expression. All of these children (mean age, 9.3 years) had tumors that were of T-cell phenotype (with the exception of a single case of null phenotype) and that expressed CD30. In contrast, 19 children with no evidence of ALK expression were older (mean, 12.7 years), and the majority (12/19) had tumors of B-cell phenotype. CD30 was also diffusely expressed in 8 of these 19 tumors. The difference in mean age between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.015). In three cases tested for both ALK and the t(2;5), ALK protein was detected in the absence of the t(2;5) translocation but no cases showed the reverse pattern, consistent with ALK fusion to genes other than NPM or activation of the ALK gene by another mechanism. These findings provide further support that ALK-positive ALCL is a distinct pathologic entity among pediatric large cell lymphomas primarily characterized by expression of T-cell markers, CD30, and EMA, and by a younger mean age.",

However, inhibition of endogenous c-FLIP expression by specific c-FLIP siRNA in Karpas 299 and SU-DHL1 cells treated with CH-11 resulted in FAS-mediated cell death associated with increased annexin V binding, apoptotic morphology, and cleavage of caspase-8. In 26 ALK+ ALCL tumors, assessed for expression of DISC-associated proteins, CD95/FAS and c-FLIP were commonly expressed, in 23 (92%) of 25 and 21 (91%) of 23 tumors, respectively.

As defined in the revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms (REAL), ALCL is a neoplasm of T-cell or null-cell lineage; 20% to 60% of cases are associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. ALCL commonly involves nodal as well as a wide variety of extranodal sites, although primary or secondary involvement of bone is rare. We describe the case of a 71-year-old man with stage IE T-cell ALCL, monomorphic variant, arising in the left anterior fifth rib and involving adjacent soft tissue without other sites of disease. The monomorphic histologic features hindered the initial recognition of this neoplasm as ALCL. However, strong uniform CD30 antigen expression and subsequent demonstration of the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) immunoreactivity led to the correct diagnosis. We identified only 5 reported cases of T-cell and null-cell ALCL arising in bone and only 2 of these cases involved a single bone site. All 5 previously reported cases were ALCL of the classic type. We report a case of ALCL that is unique to our knowledge. This case of monomorphic ALCL was localized to bone and tumor cells contained the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation.",

The ribozyme with the highest cleavage activity was used as a modified RNA/DNA chimera (RZ1*) for transient transfection and as a self-splicing ribozyme vector (pRZ1) for endogenous expression. Ribozyme performance was tested in 293 cells (cotransfected with NPM-ALK) and in the ALCL cell line Karpas 299 by transient and stable transfection and Western blotting. The half-life time of NPM-ALK was determined by pulse-chase experiments.;In vitro cleavage assays demonstrated different catalytic efficiencies depending on the targeted site of the substrate. Constant transfection of Karpas 299 cells with RZ1* for 96 hours did not lead to a significant reduction of NPM-ALK protein, presumably due to the long half-life of NPM-ALK (48 hours). In contrast, NPM-ALK protein expression was almost completely suppressed in transiently transfected 293 cells. Stable transfection of Karpas 299 cells with pRZ1 also resulted in significant reduction of NPM-ALK expression.;These results suggest that ribozymes targeted against NPM-ALK are able to inhibit expression of this oncogenic kinase efficiently and will be a useful tool to analyze its role in the pathophysiology of ALCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are characterized by the expression of a chimeric protein, NPM-ALK, which originates from fusion of the nucleophosmin (NPM) and the membrane receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes. The NPM-ALK kinase, on dimerization, shows phosphotransferase activity and, through its interaction with various ALK-adapter proteins, induces cell transformation and increases cell proliferation in vitro. The chaperones heat shock proteins 90 (Hsp90) and 70 (Hsp70) play a critical role in the folding and maturation of several oncogenic protein kinases, and perturbation of Hsp90 structure affects the stability and degradation of Hsp90- and Hsp70-bound substrates. This process is triggered by benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, Hsp90-binding small molecules. We have studied the effect of 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a benzoquinone ansamycin, on NPM-ALK steady-state level in ALCL cells. Treatment with 17-AAG decreased NPM-ALK expression and phosphorylation, thus impairing its association with phospholipase C-gamma, Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (Shc), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also observed that NPM-ALK associates with Hsp90, and incubation with 17-AAG disrupts this complex without affecting Hsp90 expression. As shown previously for other Hsp90 client proteins, destabilization of the Hsp90/NPM-ALK complex induced by 17-AAG resulted in increased binding of the chimeric protein to Hsp70, which is known to affect protein degradation. Hsp/NPM-ALK complex formation appears to be independent of NPM sequences, because we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate NPM with either Hsp90 or Hsp70. Similar to NPM-ALK, the exogenously expressed variant fusion protein TPR-ALK showed decreased expression and phosphorylation after 17-AAG treatment, suggesting that the effect of 17-AAG on ALK chimeric proteins depends on the ALK portion and not on the partner protein moiety. Our data demonstrate that NPM-ALK cell content is determined by its interaction with Hsp90 and Hsp70, and suggest that the alteration of such associations can interfere with NPM-ALK function in ALCL cells.",

The initial transbronchial lung biopsy showed discohesive pleomorphic malignant cells in a strong inflammatory milieu reminiscent of inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). Subsequent cervical lymph node biopsy revealed a spindle cell sarcoma predominantly composed of plump spindle and oval neoplastic cells in interweaving fascicles, with sparse inflammatory infiltrates, resembling pleomorphic-storiform type of MFH. However, these tumor cells in the lung and node lesions revealed essentially similar immunohistochemical features that were positive for CD30, EMA, TIA-1, granzyme B, and fascin, but negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and T- or B-lineage-specific marker. The spindled cells stains diffuse strong positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA), along with vimentin. Further studies showed that the tumor produced large quantities of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and IL-8, which we believe may contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcomatoid transformation of this tumor, and was associated with the patient's inflammatory symptoms.

Herbimycin A is a general protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor active as an antiproliferative compound against different types of mammalian cells. Herbimycin A inhibited the NPM-ALK-associated autophosphorylating activity in an in vitro cell-free kinase assay. The inhibition was specific when tested against other kinase inhibitors and extended to other cell lines derived from t(2;5)-ALCL. SUDHL-1 cells showed increasing percentage of cells in G(1) after 18 h of incubation with a dose of herbimycin A. NPM-ALK, Akt, and pAkt were down-regulated after 24 h of incubation with herbimycin A. Apoptosis was observed only if the dose of inhibitor was given every 12 h for prolonged time. Our results show that herbimycin A interferes with NPM-ALK and Akt pathways in SUDHL-1 cells.

Because in vitro studies showed that CCR4 expression is a marker for lymphocytes bearing a T-helper 2 (Th2) phenotype, it was suggested that expression of TARC is a new immune escape mechanism in HD. To find out whether this mechanism might also be operative in CD30+ malignant lymphomas other than HD, TARC and CCR4 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry on paraffin and frozen-tissue sections of 39 nodal CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), including 27 ALK-negative and 12 ALK-positive ALCL, 25 primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL, including 11 patients with lymphomatoid papulosis, and 31 cases of HD. TARC was expressed by the neoplastic cells in 12/27 (44%) nodal ALK-negative ALCL and all cases of classic HD, but not in nodal ALK-positive ALCL (0/12) and only rarely in primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL (3/25). In contrast, CCR4 was expressed by the neoplastic cells in 9/9 cutaneous CD30+ ALCL, and in 9/15 (60%) nodal ALK-negative ALCL, but only in 1/4 (25%) nodal ALK-positive ALCL and not by the H/RS cells in HD (0/8). Apart from three cases of HD showing 10 to 15% CCR4-positive lymphocytes surrounding TARC-positive H/RS cells, CCR4-positive reactive T cells were few (<5%) in all other cases studied.

Long-term outcomes of chemotherapy-treated adults are not definitively established and should be evaluated.;Patients treated in three Groupe d'Étude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte prospective clinical trials with confirmed systemic ALCL after immunohistopathologic review and defined ALK expression status were analyzed.;Among the 138 adult patients with ALCL, 64 (46%) were ALK positive, and 74 (54%) were ALK negative. Median follow-up was 8 years. At diagnosis, significantly more patients younger than 40 years old were ALK positive than ALK negative (66% v 23%, respectively; P < .001). Comparing patients with ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL, β(2)-microglobulin was ≥ 3 mg/L in 12% and 33% (P = .017); International Prognostic Index was high (score, 3 to 5) in 23% and 48% (P = .03); complete response rates to first-line treatment were 86% and 68% (P = .01); and 8-year overall survival (OS) rates were 82% (95% CI, 69% to 89%) and 49% (95% CI, 37% to 61%), respectively (P < .001). The survival difference mostly affected patients age ≥ 40 years. Multivariate analysis identified β(2)-microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L (P < .001) and age ≥ 40 years (P = .029), but not ALK status, as prognostic for OS. These two variables distinguished four survival risk groups, with 8-year OS ranging from 84% to 22%. CONCLUSION Results of this long-term study enabled refinement of the prognosis of adult systemic ALCL, with ALK prognostic value dependent on age, and could provide guidance for eventual treatment adjustment.",

We recently identified recurrent rearrangements of the DUSP22 locus on 6p25.3 in both primary cutaneous and systemic ALK-negative ALCLs. This study aimed to determine the relationship between these rearrangements and expression of the chemokine receptor gene, CCR8. CCR8 has skin-homing properties and has been suggested to play a role in limiting extracutaneous spread of primary cutaneous ALCLs. However, overexpression of CCR8 has also been reported in systemic ALK-negative ALCLs. As available antibodies for CCR8 have shown lack of specificity, we examined CCR8 expression using quantitative real-time PCR in frozen tissue and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in paraffin tissue. Both approaches showed higher CCR8 expression in ALCLs with DUSP22 rearrangements than in nonrearranged cases (PCR: 19.5-fold increase, P=0.01; ISH: 3.3-fold increase, P=0.0008). CCR8 expression was not associated with cutaneous presentation, cutaneous biopsy site, or cutaneous involvement during the disease course. These findings suggest that CCR8 expression in ALCL is more closely related to the presence of DUSP22 rearrangements than to cutaneous involvement and that the function of CCR8 may extend beyond its skin-homing properties in this disease. This study also underscores the utility of RNA-ISH as a paraffin-based method for investigating gene expression when reliable antibodies for immunohistochemical analysis are not available. ",

Previously, nucleophosmin-ALK has been shown to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase AKT. In this study, we hypothesized that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which functions downstream of AKT, mediates the oncogenic effects of activated PI3K/AKT in ALK+ ALCL. Here, we provide evidence that mTOR signaling phosphoproteins, including mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1, p70S6K, and ribosomal protein S6, are highly phosphorylated in ALK+ ALCL cell lines and tumors. We also show that AKT activation contributes to mTOR phosphorylation, at least in part, as forced expression of constitutively active AKT by myristoylated AKT adenovirus results in increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effectors. Conversely, inhibition of AKT expression or activity results in decreased mTOR phosphorylation. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K/AKT down-regulates the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. We also show that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin, as well as silencing mTOR gene product expression using mTOR-specific small interfering RNA, decreased phosphorylation of mTOR signaling proteins and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALK+ ALCL cells. Cell cycle arrest was associated with modulation of G(1)-S-phase regulators, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(waf1) and p27(kip1). Apoptosis following inhibition of mTOR expression or function was associated with down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins, including c-FLIP, MCL-1, and BCL-2. These findings suggest that the mTOR pathway contributes to nucleophosmin-ALK/PI3K/AKT-mediated tumorigenesis and that inhibition of mTOR represents a potential therapeutic strategy in ALK+ ALCL.",

Slides were examined by immunohistochemistry for phospho(p)-Akt and PTEN, the primary feedback regulator of the pathway, as well as for p27kip1 and stathmin-1. ALCL cell lines SUDHL-1 and Karpas-299 were examined for ALK, pALK, pAkt, p27/Kip1, PTEN, pPTEN, CD30, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5; ALK inhibition was performed using compound PF-2341066 and PTEN genes were sequenced.;A majority of patients expressed pAkt, PTEN, and stathmin, with p27kip1 levels less than controls. Cell lines showed expression of ALK, pALK, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, CD30, pAkt, PTEN, and pPTEN, with p27 slightly less than positive controls, and germline PTEN DNA. There was evidence of phosphorylated PTEN (pPTEN) associated with inhibited function. Pharmacologic inhibition of activated ALK diminished pSTAT3, pSTAT5, and CD30 expression but not pAkt or pPTEN in cultured cell lines.;We conclude that the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in many, though not all, pediatric ALK+ ALCL. Our data suggest that activation of this pathway involves post-translational regulation of PTEN. Pharmacologic inhibition of activated ALK does not reduce modest levels of activated Akt as it does with the more abundant levels of activated STAT3 or STAT5. Future therapy of ALCL might, in selected patients, best combine agents inhibiting PI3K/Akt with those targeting ALK.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are frequently associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35). This translocation fuses the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene at 5q35, which encodes a nucleolar protein involved in shuttling ribonucleoproteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23, encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor. In this report, we describe a typical case of ALCL whose malignant cells exhibited a novel (1;2)(q25;p23) translocation. These cells expressed ALK protein, but, in contrast to t(2;5)-positive ALCL (which show cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar staining), labeling was restricted to the malignant cell cytoplasm. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique to walk on chromosome 2 from the known ALK gene across the breakpoint, we showed that the gene involved at 1q25 is TPM3, encoding a nonmuscular tropomyosin. We subsequently identified, using reverse transcription-PCR analysis of cases showing similar ALK cytoplasm-restricted staining, fusion of the ALK and TPM3 genes in 2 other cases of ALCL. The TPM3 gene has been previously found in papillary thyroid carcinomas as a fusion partner with the TRK kinase gene. We showed that TPM3 is constitutively expressed in lymphoid cell lines, suggesting that, in these t(1;2)-bearing ALCL cases, the TPM3 gene contributes an active promoter for ALK expression. Activation of the ALK catalytic domain probably results from homodimerization of the hybrid protein TPM3-ALK, through the TPM3 protein-protein interaction domain. The present cases of ALCL associated with a novel t(1;2)(q25;p23) demonstrate that at least one fusion partner other than NPM can activate the intracytoplasmic domain of the ALK kinase.",

Here, we report on a series of 74 peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) cases composed entirely of specific PTCL subtypes, including 28 cases of ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), 35 cases of ALK- ALCL, and 11 cases that represent other specific PTCL subtypes. We performed IGH and TRG gene rearrangement studies and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to determine the frequency of IGH clonality and to investigate the relationship between EBV, clonality, and associated B-cell proliferations. Using BIOMED-2 PCR assays, we detected TRG clones in 64 of 74 (86%) cases and IGH clones in 6 of 74 (8%) cases, with all IGH-positive cases exhibiting a concurrent TRG clone. Despite the detection of occasional IGH clones, there was no correlation between IGH clonality and EBV, and B-cell proliferations were not identified in any of the cases. These findings suggest that other factors contribute to IGH clonality and demonstrate that, in the absence of an associated B-cell proliferation, IGH clonality occurs infrequently (8%) in specific PTCL subtypes.",

Information on clinical findings and treatment outcome of ALK+ lymphoma is still limited, and no data are available concerning the value of the International Prognostic Index when applied to this homogeneous disease entity. To clarify these issues, a recently developed monoclonal antibody ALKc (directed against the cytoplasmic portion of ALK) was used to detect expression of the ALK protein in paraffin-embedded biopsies from 96 primary, systemic T/null anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, and the ALK staining pattern was correlated with morphological features, clinical findings, risk factors (as defined by the International Prognostic Index), and outcome in 78 patients (53 ALK+ and 25 ALK-). Strong cytoplasmic and/or nuclear ALK positivity was detected in 58 of 96 ALCL cases (60.4%), and it was associated with a morphological spectrum (common type, 82.7%; giant cell, 3.5%; lymphohistiocytic, 8. 6%; and small cell, 5.2%) that reflected the ratio of large anaplastic elements (usually showing cytoplasmic and nuclear ALK positivity) to small neoplastic cells (usually characterized by nucleus-restricted ALK expression). Clinically, ALK+ lymphoma mostly occurred in children and young adults (mean age, 22.01 +/- 10.87 years) with a male predominance (male/female [M/F] ratio, 3.0) that was particularly striking in the second-third decades of life (M/F ratio, 6.5) and usually presented as an aggressive, stage III-IV disease, frequently associated with systemic symptoms (75%) and extranodal involvement (60%), especially skin (21%), bone (17%), and soft tissues (17%). As compared with ALK+ lymphoma, ALK- cases occurred in older individuals (mean age, 43.33 +/- 16.15 years) and showed a lower M/F ratio (0.9) as well as lower incidence of stage III-IV disease and extranodal involvement at presentation. Overall survival of ALK+ lymphoma was far better than that of ALK- anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (71% +/- 6% v 15% +/- 11%, respectively). However, within the good prognostic category of ALK+ lymphoma, survival was 94% +/- 5% for the low/low intermediate risk group (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, 0 to 1) and 41% +/- 12% for the high/high intermediate risk group (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, >/=2). Multivariate analysis identified ALK expression and the International Prognostic Index as independent variables that were able to predict survival among T/null primary, systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Thus, we suggest that such parameters should be taken into consideration for the design of future clinical trials.",

However, their clinical course is dramatically different with curability rates of >90% for classical Hodgkin lymphoma and an unfavorable prognosis for anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma and ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma can usually be distinguished by PAX5 expression in the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and expression of cytotoxic molecules in tumor cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. However, in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult owing to absence of established markers. To be able to better classify these cases, we reevaluated gene expression data of microdissected tumor cells of both lymphomas for differentially expressed genes. A classifier was established, comprising four genes strongly expressed in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (MDC/CCL22, CD83, STAT3, and TUBB2B). Applying this classifier to a test cohort, Hodgkin lymphoma was successfully distinguished from ALK(-) anaplastic large cell lymphoma with an accuracy of 97% (43/44). MDC/CCL22, CD83, and STAT3 have also been found to be expressed in antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, based on our established classifier, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells differ from tumor cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which can successfully be applied for practical purposes in histopathologic diagnostics.

We report a case of primary cutaneous CD30+ ALCL with systemic metastases in whom the clinical disease subsequently evolved into LyP.

Eighteen months later, recurrent, self-healing cutaneous small nodules appeared around the original tumour site without any systemic involvement.

The anaplastic cells in both the primary and recurrent lesions were positive for monoclonal antibodies CD30, CD25 and a monoclonal antibody directed against the chimeric protein p80(NPM-ALK).

Using a new monoclonal antibody (ALK1) that recognizes the native anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein as well as the fusion product of the t(2;5)(p23;q35), nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK, we investigated for ALK expression cases diagnosed as ALCL as well as lympho-proliferative disorders possessing overlapping features with ALCL. Thirteen cases showed cytoplasmic staining of the neoplastic cells. These cases were characterized by a fairly uniform morphology and occurred in children and young adults as a systemic disease. All other cases comprising T or null ALCL (17 cases), B ALCL (8 cases), Hodgkin's disease (HD) (15 cases), HD-like ALCL (23 cases), and lymphomatoid papulosis (9 cases), were negative for ALK expression. Translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) was found by classical cytogenetics or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in 8 of the ALK1-positive cases and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 1 other case. Two additional ALK1-positive cases with an abnormal karyotype, but without t(2;5)(p23;q35), showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis a cryptic NPM/ALK gene fusion caused by an insertion of ALK near NPM in one case and a translocation of ALK to 2q35 as a result of an indiscernible inv(2)(p23q35) in the other. The latter variant translocation points to a localization of an unknown gene at 2q35 that, like NPM, might deregulate ALK and be involved in the pathogenesis of ALCL. In summary, immunohistochemistry with ALK1 antibody allows the identification of a distinct subgroup within the ALCL of T or null phenotype that is associated with 2p23 abnormalities and lacks the marked histological pleomorphism described in ALCL in general. Whereas immunostaining is the most sensitive method to identify this group, it does not help to additionally clarify the relationship among ALCL, HD, and HD-like ALCL.",

ALK protein expression leads to activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is more commonly expressed in ALK-positive than in ALK-negative tumours. Activated STAT3 leads to the induction of several genes such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1. In this study, we analysed TIMP-1 expression in five ALCL cell lines and 11 tumours by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We identified high-level TIMP-1 expression by RT-PCR in three ALK-positive ALCL-derived cell lines and in all ALK-positive ALCLs, whereas ALK-negative ALCLs generally demonstrated a lower level of TIMP-1 expression. Concordant with these results, we observed TIMP-1 immunostaining in all ALK-positive ALCLs and in only two of six ALK-negative ALCLs. No relationship was observed between the levels of ALK and TIMP-1 expression in the ALK-positive tumours. STAT3 expression levels were similar in all ALCL samples. Double staining with either CD30 or CD68 demonstrated that TIMP-1 expression was restricted to macrophages in the majority of TIMP-1-positive tumours. Expression of the TIMP-1 substrate MMP-2 was more prominent in ALK-negative tumours, while MMP-9 levels were low in all cases. Expression levels of IL-6 and TGF-beta1, which are cytokines known to induce TIMP-1, were higher in ALK-negative ALCLs and moderate in ALK-positive tumours. No clear relationship was observed between IL-10 expression and ALK positivity. Overall, no correlation was seen in ALCLs between the expression of TIMP-1 and that of cytokines that induce TIMP-1. Lack of TIMP-1 expression in the tumour cells of ALK-positive ALCLs argues against a direct role for ALK-induced activation of STAT3 in the regulation of TIMP-1 expression in ALCL.",

Both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms account for the constitutive expression of the protein, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for this process. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CDC25 dramatically inhibits the proliferation of NPM/ALK-expressing cells, while moderately affecting the proliferation of control Ba/F3 cells. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of CDC25A confirmed that NPM/ALK-expressing cells are highly dependent on this protein for their proliferation. Moreover, similar PI3K/AKt-mediated constitutive expression of CDC25A takes place down-stream of other hematological oncogenes, including BCR/ABL in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and FLT3-ITD in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Altogether, our data point to the functional link between hematopoietic oncogenic tyrosine kinases and the G(1) cell cycle regulator CDC25A, and we propose that this protein may be a potential therapeutic target in ALCL and other hematological malignancies.",

ALCL can be subdivided into different groups according to histologic features (pleomorphic, monomorphic, small cell predominant, Hodgkin's disease-related, and other less common variants), immunophenotype (T, null, B, and rarely B and T), and clinical features (systemic, primary cutaneous type, ALCL arising in HIV-positive patients, and ALCL occurring after another lymphoproliferative process, such as lymphomatoid papulosis, mycosis fungoides, and Hodgkin's disease. Cytogenetic studies and subsequent cloning of the translocation t(2;5) have shown a high degree of association with Ki-1-positive lymphoma but have revealed that this genetic abnormality is not specific for anaplastic morphologic features, is more common in the monomorphic and small cell variants, and is rare in primary cutaneous ALCL. It is likely that this t(2;5)-positive group is pathogenetically related. The purpose of this article is to review the pathologic and clinical spectrum of ALCL, including the borderline with Hodgkin's disease and lymphomatoid papulosis and to discuss the use of the t(2;5) in better defining a more specific molecular pathologic entity within this group of diseases with CD30 expression.",

Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been considered as a therapeutic target for cancer where PI3K/Akt activation is a causative factor. Genistein, a natural isoflavonoid found in soy products, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cell lines. Here, we demonstrated that treatment of two t(2;5) ALCL cell lines, SUDHL-1 and Karpas299, with genistein induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, these cells exhibited a decrease in Akt protein levels and subsequent downregulation of Akt activity (Akt phosphorylation). Furthermore, genistein treatment induced mitochondrial membrane potential change, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. From these results, we conclude that inhibition of the Akt signaling pathway and induction of apoptosis by genistein could be used as a new treatment modality for the prevention and/or treatment of t(2;5) ALCL and other hematopoietic malignancies.",

Expression of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene product has also been described as an important prognostic indicator in ALCL. ALK positive systemic nodal ALCL are associated with a good prognosis. However, primary cutaneous ALCL that are ALK negative have a better overall survival. The current study was done to see if mutated p(53) gene or ALK reactivity were poor prognostic indicators in those patients with CD 30(+) cutaneous LPD who showed progression of the disease.;Mutations of the p(53) gene and expression of the ALK gene product were analysed in 36 patients (23 of LyP and 13 of CD30(+) cutaneous ALCL).

Mutations of the p(53) gene were found in two biopsy specimens of LyP. ALK gene products were not detected in any of the biopsy specimens of LyP and primary cutaneous ALCL.;Although 9 of 36 patients with cutaneous CD30(+) LPDs had progression of their disease, neither mutations of the p(53) gene nor ALK immunoreactivity were found in any of these biopsies. The two cases of LyP that had mutated p(53) gene in their biopsy specimens showed no progression of their disease in the 5 yr follow up period.

In ALCLs, dimerization of NPM-ALK leads to constitutive autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase, necessary for NPM-ALK oncogenicity. To investigate whether NPM-ALK, like other oncogenic tyrosine kinases, can inhibit drug-induced apoptosis, we permanently transfected NPM-ALK into Jurkat T-cells. As in ALCLs, NPM-ALK was expressed as a constitutively kinase-active 80 kDa protein, and could be detected by immunocytochemistry in nucleoli, nuclei and cytoplasm. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (assessed by cell morphology and annexin V-FITC binding) was significantly inhibited in two independent NPM-ALK-expressing clones (5.2+/-1.8 and 7.5+/-0.8% apoptosis), compared to control vector-transduced cells (36+/-6.7%). Similar results were observed with etoposide. In contrast, Fas-induced apoptosis was not inhibited. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol was delayed in doxorubicin-, but not anti-Fas-treated transfectant cells, indicating that apoptosis inhibition occurred upstream of mitochondrial events. Using NPM-ALK mutants, we demonstrated that inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis: (1) requires functional kinase activity, (2) does not involve phospholipase C-gamma, essential for NPM-ALK-mediated mitogenicity and (3) appears to be phosphoinositide 3-kinase independent, despite a strong Akt/PKB activation observed in wild type NPM-ALK-expressing cells. These results suggest that the NPM-ALK antiapoptotic and mitogenic pathways are distinct.",

However, recent studies suggest that crizotinib-resistance mutations may emerge in ALCL patients. In the present study, we analyzed ALK kinase domain mutational status of 36 paediatric ALCL patients at diagnosis to identify point mutations and gene aberrations that could impact on NPM-ALK gene expression, activity and sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors. Amplicon ultra-deep sequencing of ALK kinase domain detected 2 single point mutations, R335Q and R291Q, in 2 cases, 2 common deletions of exon 23 and 25 in all the patients, and 7 splicing-related INDELs in a variable number of them. The functional impact of missense mutations and INDELs was evaluated. Point mutations were shown to affect protein kinase activity, signalling output and drug sensitivity. INDELs, instead, generated kinase-dead variants with dominant negative effect on NPM-ALK kinase, in virtue of their capacity of forming non-functional heterocomplexes. Consistently, when co-expressed, INDELs increased crizotinib inhibitory activity on NPM-ALK signal processing, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation. Functional changes in ALK kinase activity induced by both point mutations and structural rearrangements were resolved by molecular modelling and dynamic simulation analysis, providing novel insights into ALK kinase domain folding and regulation. Therefore, these data suggest that NPM-ALK pre-therapeutic mutations may be found at low frequency in ALCL patients. These mutations occur randomly within the ALK kinase domain and affect protein activity, while preserving responsiveness to crizotinib. ",

Here, we focused our attention on the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), where the oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK, responsible for 70% to 80% of cases, represents an ideal crizotinib target. We selected and characterized 2 human NPM-ALK+ ALCL cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, able to survive and proliferate at different crizotinib concentrations. Sequencing of ALK kinase domain revealed that a single mutation became predominant at high crizotinib doses in each cell line, namely L1196Q and I1171N in Karpas-299 and SUP-M2 cells, respectively. These mutations also conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing human NPM-ALK. The resistant cell populations, as well as mutated Ba/F3 cells, were characterized for sensitivity to two additional ALK inhibitors: the dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 and NVP-TAE684.

In-situ hybridization for small mRNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBER) was also performed. The chromosomal abnormalities were studied by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). The differences between ALK-positive and ALK-negative cases were statistically analyzed.;There were 48 cases of ALK-positive ALCL and 18 cases of ALK-negative ALCL. The patients with ALK-positive ALCL were younger than those with ALK-negative ALCL (P < 0.05), with the median age being 18 years and 36 years, respectively. Fever, especially hyperpyrexia, was more commonly observed in ALK-positive ALCL patients than in ALK-negative ALCL patients (33 cases versus 4 cases, P < 0.05). The overall survival rate and median duration of survival in patients with ALK-positive ALCL were higher and longer than those in patients with ALK-negative ALCL (80% versus 71%; 21 months versus 12.5 months, P > 0.05). There were however no significant differences in histology between ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL. Histologically, most cases showed diffuse growth pattern. Nodular pattern was demonstrated in a minority of cases. \"Hallmark\" cells were seen in most of the ALCL cases. Focal necrosis and myxomatous stroma were identified in a few cases. Most ALK-positive cases belonged to the common variant (35 cases). A small number represented lymphohistiocytic variant (8 cases). Small cell variant and sarcomatoid subtype were found only in few cases (3 cases and 2 cases, respectively).On the other hand, common variant (17 cases) constituted the majority of ALK-negative ALCL. Lymphohistiocytic variant was seen in only 1 case. Immunohistochemical study showed that ALK-positive ALCL always expressed CD30 and epithelial membrane antigen. ALK-positive ALCL more often expressed epithelial membrane antigen (100% versus 72%; P < 0.05) but less so for T-cell markers (including CD2, CD3, CD43 and CD45RO). Cytotoxic molecules were more commonly expressed in ALK-positive ALCL (P > 0.05). EBER was negative in all cases studied. FISH showed that in ALK-positive ALCL, 1 case had normal ALK gene, 1 had deletion and multicopy and 2 had deletion. On the other hand, 1 case of ALK-negative ALCL had normal ALK gene.;While there are no significant morphologic differences between ALK-positive ALCL and ALK-negative ALCL, the clinical features, immunophenotypes and genetic features of both groups vary.

To identify new locations of ALCL-related oncogenes, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was applied to three ALCL cell lines (SU-DHL-1, Karpas 299, and DEL) exhibiting the 5q35 bp and expressing the NPM/ALK transcript. The CGH profiles were compared with those obtained with DNA from U937, HL-60 cells, and altered lymph nodes from two children with ALCL. Significant DNA copy number gains and/or losses were observed on several chromosomes in all ALCL cell lines. Distinct amplicons were detected on 1q21 approximately q44 (DEL), 7q12 (SU-DHL-1), and 1q12 approximately q22 (Karpas 299) regions. The NPM/ALK fusion gene was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in more than 80% of interphase nuclei and metaphase spreads. Enhanced expression of TGF-beta2 and c-MET candidate genes located at the amplified regions was revealed in DEL and SU-DHL1 cell lines by Northern blot analysis. These findings delineate chromosomal imbalances in ALCL-derived cell lines in parallel with high level of amplification covering target DNA sequences, which could play a role in ALCL pathogenesis.",

ALK fusion proteins result in the constitutive activation of ALK tyrosine kinase, thereby enhancing proliferation and increasing cell survival. A direct role for NPM-ALK in cellular transformation has been shown in vitro with immortalized cell lines and in vivo using retroviral transfer experiments. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence of its oncogenic potential in T lymphocytes, which represent the most common target of ALK chimeras. Here, we describe a new mouse model of lymphomagenesis in which human NPM-ALK transcription was targeted to T cells. NPM-ALK transgenic (Tg) mice were born with the expected mendelian distribution, normal lymphoid organs, and a normal number and proportion of helper and suppressor T cells. However, after a short period of latency, all NPM-ALK Tg mice developed malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (mean survival, 18 weeks). NPM-ALK Tg thymic lymphomas displayed a T-cell phenotype characteristic of immature thymocytes and frequently coexpressed surface CD30. A subset of the NPM-ALK Tg mice also developed clonal B-cell plasma cell neoplasms. These tumors arose in peripheral lymphoid organs (plasmacytomas) or within the bone marrow and often led to peripheral neuropathies and limb paralysis. Our NPM-ALK Tg mice are a suitable model to dissect the molecular mechanisms of ALK-mediated transformation and to investigate the efficacy of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of human ALCL in vivo.",

A comprehensive review of the 71 reported cases of breast implant associated ALCL (iALCL) is presented indicating the apparent risk factors and main characteristics of this rare cancer. The average patient is 50 years of age and most cases present in the capsule surrounding the implant as part of the periprosthetic fluid or the capsule itself on average at 10 years post-surgery suggesting that iALCL is a late complication. The absolute risk is low ranging from 1:500,000 to 1:3,000,000 patients with breast implants per year. The majority of cases are ALK-negative, yet are associated with silicone-coated implants suggestive of the mechanism of tumorigenesis which is discussed in relation to chronic inflammation, immunogenicity of the implants and sub-clinical infection. In particular, capsulotomy alone seems to be sufficient for the treatment of many cases suggesting the implants provide the biological stimulus whereas others require further treatment including chemo- and radiotherapy although reported cases remain too low to recommend a therapeutic approach.

With variable frequency ALCL bear the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5q35 to a novel protein kinase gene, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), on chromosome 2p23. We determined the frequency of this translocation with a novel DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using 0.5 microgram of genomic DNA, 5'-primers derived from the NPM gene and 3'-primers derived from the ALK gene and hybridization with internal probes. The presence of amplifiable DNA in the samples was tested with the inclusion in the PCR reaction of oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify a 3016-bp fragment from the beta-globin locus. NMP-ALK fusion amplicons were detected using DNA isolated either from all three ALCL cell lines tested, or from all four primary ALCL tumors known to contain the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. Nested amplicons were detected by hybridization in 100% of specimens diluted 10(4)-fold and in 20% of those diluted 10(5)-fold. We subsequently examined archival genomic DNA from 20 patients with ALCL, 39 with diffuse large cell, 2 with mantle cell, 20 with peripheral T cell, 13 with low-grade NHL, 31 with Hodgkin's disease (HD), and 6 with lymphomatoid papulosis. Fusion of the NPM and ALK genes was detected in three of 18 patients with ALCL who had amplifiable DNA (17%, 95% confidence intervals 4% to 41%), but not in any patients with other NHL, HD, or lymphomatoid papulosis. The amplicon sizes were different in all cell lines and patients reflecting unique genomic DNA breakpoints. We conclude that with genomic DNA-PCR the rearrangement of the NPM and ALK loci is restricted to patients with ALCL. Further studies are needed to determine the prognostic significance of the NPM-ALK rearrangement, to determine whether its detection can aid in the differential diagnosis between ALCL.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is the most common type of pediatric peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In 70-80% of cases, the chromosomal aberration t(2;5)(p23;q35) results in the juxtaposition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with nucleophosmin (NPM) and the subsequent expression of the NPM-ALK fusion protein. NPM-ALK is a chimeric tyrosine kinase, which induces numerous signaling pathways that drive proliferation and abrogate apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that lead to activation of downstream growth regulatory molecules have not been completely elucidated. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen, we identified GSK3β as a signaling mediator of NPM-ALK. Using a selective inhibitor of ALK, we demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase activity of ALK regulates the serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK3β. Expression of NPM-ALK in 293T cells led to an increase of pS(9)-GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) compared with kinase-defective K210R mutant NPM-ALK, but did not affect total GSK3β levels. Phosphorylation of pS(9)-GSK3β by NPM-ALK was mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. ALK inhibition resulted in degradation of GSK3β substrates Mcl-1 and CDC25A, which was recovered upon chemical inhibition of the proteasome (MG132). Furthermore, the degradation of Mcl-1 was recoverable with inhibition of GSK3β. ALK inhibition also resulted in decreased cell viability, which was rescued by GSK3β inhibition. Furthermore, stable knockdown of GSK3β conferred resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of ALK inhibition using viability and colony formation assays. pS(9)-GSK3β and CDC25A were selectively expressed in neoplastic cells of ALK+ALCL tissue biopsies, and showed a significant correlation (P<0.001). Conversely, ALK-ALCL tissue biopsies did not show significant correlation of pS(9)-GSK3β and CDC25A expression (P<0.2). Our results demonstrate that NPM-ALK regulates the phosphorylation of S(9)-GSK3β by PI3K/AKT. The subsequent inhibition of GSK3β activity results in accumulation of CDC25A and Mcl-1, which confers the advantage of growth and protection from apoptosis. These findings provide support for the role of GSK3β as a mediator of NPM-ALK oncogenesis.",

These two cases were shown by an in vitro kinase assay to express ALK kinases (104 kD and 97 kD, respectively), which differed in size from the classical NPM-ALK fusion product (80 kD).

Subsequent cDNA cloning revealed p80 to be a fusion protein of two genes, the novel tyrosine kinase gene and the nucleophosmin gene, in accordance with the sequence of the NPM/ALK gene (Morris et al.). Meanwhile, the clinicopathologic features of p80-carrying ALCLs have remained unclear. Paraffin sections of 105 cases of ALCL were immunostained using anti-p80 antibody, and 30 of them were shown to express p80. Clinicopathological comparison between p80-positive and -negative ALCLs revealed that p80-positive cases occurred in a far younger patient age group and the patients showed a far better 5-year survival rate. These data showed that p80-positive ALCL is a distinct entity both clinically and pathogenetically, and should be differentiated from p80-negative ALCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In vitro studies suggest that resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis might explain poor response to therapy in fatal cases. Actual execution of apoptosis depends on proper functioning of effector caspases, particularly caspase 3, and on the expression levels of apoptosis-regulating proteins, including Bcl-2 and the recently identified granzyme B- specific protease inhibitor 9 (PI9). Thus, high levels of caspase 3 activation should reflect proper functioning of the apoptosis pathways, resulting in chemotherapy-sensitive neoplastic cells and a favorable prognosis. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying numbers of tumor cells positive for active caspase 3, Bcl-2, and PI9, respectively, in pretreatment biopsies of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) patients and by comparing these numbers with clinical outcome. Activation of caspase 3 in more than 5% of the tumor cells was strongly correlated with a highly favorable outcome. High numbers of Bcl-2- and PI9-positive tumor cells were found to predict unfavorable prognosis. This prognostic effect was strongly related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status: ALK-positive ALCL had significantly higher levels of active caspase 3, while high expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and PI9 was almost completely restricted to ALK-negative cases. In conclusion, high numbers of active caspase 3-positive tumor cells predict a highly favorable prognosis in systemic ALCL patients. Poor prognosis is strongly related to high numbers of Bcl-2- and PI9-positive neoplastic cells. These data support the notion that a favorable response to chemotherapy depends on an intact apoptosis cascade. Moreover, these data indicate that differences in prognosis between ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL might be explained by differences in expression of apoptosis-inhibiting proteins.",

To further study survival signaling by NPMALK, we generated Ba/F3 cell lines with either inducible or constitutive expression of NPM-ALK and examined the regulation of the AKT target FOXO3a. We hypothesized that NPM-ALK signaling through phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and AKT would regulate FOXO3a, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, thereby stimulating proliferation and blocking programmed cell death in NPM-ALK-transformed cells. In Ba/F3 cells with induced or constitutive expression of NPM-ALK, concomitant AKT activation and phosphorylation of its substrate, FOXO3a, was observed. In addition, transient expression of NPM-ALK in U-20S cells inhibited FOXO3a-mediated transactivation of reporter gene expression. Furthermore, NPM-ALK-induced FOXO3a phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells resulted in nuclear exclusion of this transcriptional regulator, up-regulation of cyclin D2 expression, and down-regulation of p27(kip1) and Bim-1 expression. NPMALK reversal of proliferation arrest and of p27(kip1) induction was dependent on the phosphorylation of FOXO3a. Thus, FOXO3a is a barrier to hematopoietic transformation that is overcome by phosphorylation and cytoplasmic relocalization induced by the expression of NPM-ALK.",

A characteristic chromosomal translocation has been identified in ALCL of T-or null-cell lineage which juxtaposes a novel tyrosine kinase (anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK) located at 2p23 with the nucleophosmin gene (NPM) at 5q35. A chimeric mRNA transcript is produced, and the translocation results in constitutive expression of a truncated form of the ALK protein, p80. There is controversy concerning whether or not the translocation occurs in Hodgkin's disease. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect the t(2;5)(p23;q35), and to compare the results with conventional cytogenetics, reverse-transcriptase PCR and immunostaining for the p80 protein.;Twenty-five cases of malignant lymphoma (11 ALCL and 14 HD) were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the diagnosis and for analysis of p80 expression. Conventional cytogenetics were analyzed on G-banded metaphase spreads. FISH was performed using whole chromosome paints for chromosomes 2 and 5 on metaphase spreads and YAC probes for interphase nuclei. Reverse-transcriptase PCR using primers for ALK and NPM was used to amplify the translocation breakpoint in extracted mRNA.;Among 11 cases of ALCL examined by FISH, the translocation was detected in 4. Two of these cases also had RT-PCR and p80 staining performed, with positive results. Among 7 cases where the t(2;5) was not detected by FISH, 3 cases were examined by RT-PCR with negative results and 4 cases by p80 staining, also negative. The RT-PCR was negative in all 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 4 of which were also examined by FISH and found to be negative.;Fluorescent in situ hybridization is a useful method for detection of the t(2;5)(p23;q35) in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. The results concur with those of RT-PCR for the chimeric transcript and immunostaining for the p80 protein. The frequency with which the translocation was found was 36% in this small series, and no evidence of the translocation was found in cases of Hodgkin's disease.",

Pathologic examination confirmed the presence of malignant ALCL T cells that were CD30+, CD8+, CD15+, HLA-DR+, CD25+ ALK- and p53. A diagnosis of indolent BIA-ALCL was made since tumor cells were not found outside of the capsule. Interestingly, an extensive mixed lymphocytic infiltrate and ectopic lymphoid tissue (lymphoid neogenesis) adjacent to the fibrous implant capsule were present. The patient was treated with capsulectomy and implantation of new breast prostheses. Six months later, the patient was found to have BIA-ALCL involvement of an axillary lymph node with cytogenetic evolution of the tumor. To our knowledge, this is the sixth reported case of aggressive BIA-ALCL.

Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is regarded as an ALK-negative variant confined to the skin and is part of the spectrum of primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Thirty-three of 487 pediatric patients registered within the Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma-99 trial (1999 to 2006) presented with a skin limited CD30-positive lympho-proliferative disorder. In 23 of the 33 patients, material for international histopathological review was available, and the cases were studied for histopathological, immunophenotypical and clinical features as well as for breaks within the ALK gene. Five of 23 cases and one additional case (identified after closure of the trial) expressed ALK-protein. Complete staging excluded any other organ involvement in all children. Expression of ALK proteins was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in all cases and the presence of breaks of the ALK gene was genetically confirmed in 5 evaluable cases. The histopathological and clinical picture of these skin-restricted ALK-positive lymphomas was indistinguishable from that of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Five children presented with a single skin lesion that was completely resected in 4 and incompletely resected in one. Three of these patients received no further therapy, 2 additional local radiotherapy, and one chemotherapy. All children remain in complete remission with a median follow up of seven years (range 1-8 years). We present 6 pediatric cases of ALK-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas.

Histologically, a population of large pleomorphic cells extensively infiltrated the lamina propria of the bladder. These cells were diffusely and strongly immunoreactive for CD30, ALK, EMA, and vimentin, but were negative for AE1/AE3, CK20, CK7, CK5/6, P63, SMA, HMB-45, pan-Melan, S-100, Myo D1, synaptophysin, CD56, desmin, CD15, CD20, Pax-5, and CD3. Few cells exhibited positive immunohistochemical staining of CD45. The patient underwent cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regime of chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission after four cycles. This case is the tenth documented case of systemic ALCL involving urinary bladder. Due to its rarity, it is important to be aware of the features of ALCL in bladder, and make prompt and accurate diagnosis. ",

Cytogenetic studies of ALCL have demonstrated the presence of a (2;5)(p23;q35) translocation in a substantial number of these cases. Recently, the t(2;5) has been cloned and described to represent fusion of the NPM gene with the ALK gene on chromosome 5. To better define the spectrum of lymphomas containing this abnormality we have analyzed 50 continuous human cell lines established from various types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ALCL and HD. In a first step, the expression of the NPM-ALK fusion gene was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In a second step, the t(2;5)-carrying cells were tested for the translation of functional chimeric mRNA into a fusion protein by immuno-staining of single cells with a polyclonal antibody. The NPM-ALK fusion transcript and the p80 protein were detected in eight of nine ALCL cell lines. We were unable to find PCR evidence for the t(2;5) in any of the non-ALCL cell lines including other CD30+ cell lines. As all seven bona fide HD cell lines were NPM-ALK-negative, these results do not support the notion that the t(2;5) represents a chromosomal aberration common to both ALCL and HD.",

Using the SSH technique, we compared the transcriptome of 2 cases of ALK+ and ALK- anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and of 2 cases of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) with opposite behavior. Regarding ALCL, we showed that ALK-positive tumors overexpressed genes involved in different signaling pathways such as activation or signaling of T-cells, regulation of apoptosis, phospholipase Cgamma and phosphatidyl inositol-3 Kinase. In addition, the characterization of a specific molecular signature may be of clinical relevance since ALK+ tumors generally have a better prognosis than ALK- ones. Similar problems of differential prognosis is observed in cases of cHL, which in addition, may be morphologically and immunologically indistinguishable. Therefore, we applied the same SSH technique to 2 cHL samples from patients with favorable and poor outcome, respectively. Forty-four cDNAs were significantly overexpressed in the poor outcome case. In addition to the defender against death cell 1 (DAD1) gene, overexpressed clones corresponded mostly to expressed sequence tags (ESTs).

The present study aimed to investigate hTERT mRNA variants in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n = 38) with in situ hybridization (ISH), along with the immunodetection of hTERT protein. Probes for the identification of mRNAs containing (Bplus) and lacking (Bdel) exons 7 and 8 of the hTERT mRNA were used. Normal lymphocyte populations equally expressed both Bplus and Bdel mRNAs. Although all ALCL examined were found positive for hTERT expression with RT-PCR, hTERT mRNAs were identified in 68% of these tumors with ISH, with a higher incidence in the group bearing ALK translocations (10 out of 11; 90.9%) compared to the ALK negative group (17 out of 27; 59.3%) (PPearson's = 0.002). The same results were obtained with immunohistochemistry for hTERT. In approximately 50% of cases, only Bplus positive cells were identified, again with a higher incidence in the ALK positive compared to the ALK negative group (PPearson's = 0.016). In conclusion, ISH for hTERT mRNAs appears to be a valuable tool for the investigation of hTERT expression in lymphomas.

Among 70% to 80% of ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are caused by the aberrant oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK. Crizotinib was the first clinically relevant ALK inhibitor, now approved for the treatment of late-stage and metastatic cases of lung cancer. However, patients frequently develop drug resistance to Crizotinib, mainly due to the appearance of point mutations located in the ALK kinase domain. Fortunately, other inhibitors are available and in clinical trial, suggesting the potential for second-line therapies to overcome Crizotinib resistance. This study focuses on the ongoing phase I/II trial small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AP26113, by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which targets both ALK and EGFR. Two NPM-ALK(+) human cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of AP26113, and eight lines were selected that demonstrated resistance. All lines show IC50 values higher (130 to 1,000-fold) than the parental line. Mechanistically, KARPAS-299 populations resistant to AP26113 show NPM-ALK overexpression, whereas SUP-M2-resistant cells harbor several point mutations spanning the entire ALK kinase domain. In particular, amino acid substitutions: L1196M, S1206C, the double F1174V+L1198F and L1122V+L1196M mutations were identified. The knowledge of the possible appearance of new clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance is a useful tool for the management of new TKI-resistant cases.;This work defines reliable ALCL model systems of AP26113 resistance and provides a valuable tool in the management of all cases of relapse upon NPM-ALK-targeted therapy.",

ALCLs are characterized by the presence of ALK translocations. Aberrant Cyclin D1 expression seems to promote proliferation in other types of lymphoma, while a growth promoting CCND1/TACSD1(TROP2) fusion product has also been described in tumors. Herein, we investigated 44 ALCL cases for chromosome 11 and CCND1 status (by FISH), cyclin D1 mRNA expression (by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR) and Cyclin D1 protein (by immunohistochemistry with two different monoclonal antibodies), as well as for the expression of Trop-2/GA733-1 (by immunohistochemistry). Polysomy of CCND1 (11q13) and chromosome 11 was found in 15/38 evaluated cases (39.5%). This change was specific for CD30+ neoplastic cells, as shown by double fluorescent staining. Neoplastic cells in the majority of ALCL expressed cyclin D1 mRNA (29/41 [70.7%]), in association with the presence of ALK translocations (p=0.024) and systemic, rather than cutaneous disease (p=0.021). Remarkably, however, Cyclin D1 protein was not detected in neoplastic cells (0/44 cases), neither were these found positive for Trop-2. In conclusion, aberrant copies of CCND1 / chromosome 11 may be observed in ALCL, probably as a consequence of the reported ploidy changes in these tumors. ALCL may often express cyclin D1 mRNA, which, however, does not result in the production of functional Cyclin D1 protein or Trop-2, suggesting that these proteins do not play a role in the pathogenesis of ALCL.",

The translocation was detected by using cytogenetic analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry with P80 antibody directed against the kinase domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) of the chimeric NPM/ALK protein. In all but three cases of ALCL, we found an agreement between cytogenetic analysis, RT-PCR, and P80 staining. However, in one case, the t(2;5) translocation was detected with cytogenetic analysis, but RT-PCR and P80 staining were found to be negative. Conversely, in another case the karyotype was normal, but the hybrid mRNA and P80 staining were found to be positive. In one case, malignant cells showed a translocation involving chromosomes 1q25 and 2p23 and were strongly positive for P80 staining. Such a result could be expected because P80 antibody detects the kinase domaine of the ALK protein encoded by chromosome 2p23. Overall 73.2% (41 of 56) of cases were found to be positive. However, the highest percentage (23 of 26 cases; 88.5%) of P80 positive cases was found in children compared with 60% (18 of 30 cases) in adult ALCL (P < .05). In Hodgkin's disease, Reed-Sternberg cells were found to be clearly negative by RT-PCR and with P80 antibody. The latter results suggest that Hodgkin's disease and t(2;5)-positive ALCL are distinct biological entities and that the demonstration of the t(2;5) translocation is of diagnostic importance in differentiating these two entities.

Recent studies have shown that Id2 is overexpressed in some types of B-cell lymphoma, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The authors of the current study hypothesized that Id2 also is overexpressed in T-cell lymphomas.;By using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses, high Id2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, respectively, were detected in all 4 T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines that were tested.;Immunohistochemistry results indicated that Id2 was expressed strongly in 21 of 27 (78%) ALCL tumors (79% anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]-negative and 75% ALK-positive), in 5 of 10 (50%) extranodal natural killer/T (NK/T)-cell lymphomas of the nasal type, in 2 of 8 (25%) cutaneous ALCLs, in 2 of 9 (22%) enteropathy type T-cell lymphomas, in 1 of 5 (20%) peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified, and in 1 of 8 (13%) T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias. Other types of T-cell lymphoma were negative for Id2. Because it is known that myc is expressed in ALCL, myc was inhibited selectively in 2 ALCL cell lines, resulting in a concentration-dependent decrease in Id2 mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, forced expression of myc in HEK 293T cells using an myc/green fluorescent protein adenoviral vector resulted in Id2 up-regulation.;Taken together, the current data suggest that Id2 commonly is overexpressed in highly proliferative T-cell lymphomas, and its expression may result from transcriptional activation of myc in these tumors.",

Recent studies with small molecule kinase inhibitors have provided solid proof-of-concept validation that inhibition of ALK is sufficient to attenuate the growth and proliferation of ALK (+) ALCL cells. In this study, several missense mutants of ALK in the phosphate anchor and gatekeeper regions were generated and their kinase activity was measured. NPM-ALK L182M, L182V, and L256M mutants displayed kinase activity in cells comparable to or higher than that of NPM-ALK wild type (WT) and rendered BaF3 cells into IL-3-independent growth, while NPM-ALK L182R, L256R, L256V, L256P, and L256Q displayed much weaker or little kinase activity in cells. Similar kinase activities were obtained with corresponding GST-ALK mutants with in vitro kinase assays. With regard to inhibitor response, NPM-ALK L182M and L182V exhibited sensitivity to a fused pyrrolocarbazole (FP)-derived ALK inhibitor comparable to that of NPM-ALK WT but were dramatically less sensitive to a diaminopyrimidine (DAP)-derived ALK inhibitor. On the other hand, NPM-ALK L256M exhibited >30-fold lower sensitivity to both FP-derived and DAP-derived ALK inhibitors. The growth inhibition and cytotoxicity of BaF3/NPM-ALK mutant cells induced by ALK inhibitors were consistent with inhibition of cellular NPM-ALK autophosphorylation. In a mouse survival model, treatment with the orally bioavailable DAP-ALK inhibitor substantially extended the survival of the mice inoculated with BaF3/NPM-ALK WT cells but not those inoculated with BaF3/NPM-ALK L256M cells. Binding of ALK inhibitors to ALK WT and mutants was analyzed using ALK homology models. In summary, several potential active ALK mutants were identified, and our data indicate that some of these mutants are resistant to select small molecule ALK inhibitors. Further characterization of these mutants may help to identify and develop potent ALK inhibitors active against both WT and resistant mutants of ALK.",

The cases were comprised of 11 men and three women, with a median age of 56.5 years. Most patients underwent surgery either with or without chemotherapy, exhibiting a 5 year survival rate of 57.5%. Morphologically, the neoplastic cells showed various histological features, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n = 3), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified, large (n = 4), medium-sized (n = 2) and mixed cell (n = 5). Two cases displayed a non-B, non-T cell phenotype, whereas the remaining cases displayed a T-cell phenotype. Six cases were CD4+, while two were CD8+. The neoplastic cells were CD30+ in 10 cases. TIA-1 was positive in six cases. In one case, anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK) was identified with immunostaining and chromosomal rearrangement of ALK was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In conclusion, although the mechanism of CD30 expression is unknown, primary gastric non-B, non-Hodgkin lymphomas tend to express CD30.

However, the clinicopathologic significance of identification of p80 among ALCL cases has not been completely resolved. Difficulties also exist in the histologic and immunophenotypic identification of ALCL and Hodgkin's disease (HD) as separate processes, often complicating the clinicopathologic evaluation of and therapeutic approach to these entities. In order to clarify these issues, 67 specimens of ALCL and 63 specimens of HD (31 of the nodular-sclerosing type [NS-HD] and 32 of the mixed-cellularity type [MC-HD]) were immunostained using anti-p80 antibody and other relevant markers on paraffin sections. The clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features were reviewed on the basis of p80 reactivity. The expression of p80 was detected in 43 of 67 cases of ALCL (64%), but none of HD. The p80+ ALCL cases constituted a very homogeneous group of tumors, characterized by the occurrence in a much younger group and relatively more favorable clinical course than the p80- ALCL, which were in keeping with the data previously reported. They showed virtually the identical immunophenotypic findings of p80+, CD30+, EMA+, CD15-, bcl-2-, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with T- and null-cell phenotype, and showed the distinct morphologic features, including three cases of lymphohistiocytic/small-cell variant, as follows: the indented nuclei, often termed as reniform, embryolike, and horseshoelike; multiple, irregular, but indistinct nucleoli; and few reactive cells of eosinophils and epithelioid cells. Conversely, the 24 p80- ALCL cases, in which epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and bcl-2 positivities were 33% and 55%, respectively, were heterogeneous and could be subdivided into five different categories, namely (a) 11 cases of HD-like ALCLs, (b) six cases of p80 common ALCL, (c) three cases of secondary ALCL, (d) two cases of primary cutaneous ALCL, and (e) two cases of primary classical ALCL that lacked p80 expression.

These studies led to the concept that NPM-ALK acts at the transcriptional level through the activation of several transcription factors downstream of many different signaling pathways including JAK3/STAT3, PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK. Nevertheless, the discovery of several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) within ALK interactome suggested an additional and complementary role of this oncogenic kinase at the post-transcriptional level. This review gives emerging views in ALK-mediated post-transcriptional regulation with a focus on RBPs that are associated with ALK. We will summarize the capacity of NPM-ALK in modulating the biological properties of RBPs and then discuss the role of cytoplasmic aggregates, called AGs for \"ALK granules\", which are observed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) expressing the ALK kinase. AGs contain polyadenylated mRNAs and numerous RBPs but are distinct from processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs), two well-known discrete cytoplasmic sites involved in mRNA fate. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"In spite of recent great advances in our understanding of both Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), occasionally there are CD30-positive large cell hematopoietic neoplasms, in which the morphologic and phenotypic features overlap to such an extent that they cannot easily be classified. We report a histologically unusual case of HL that mimicked ALCL, but had phenotypical characteristics of HL. The neoplastic cells resembling Reed-Sternberg cells or Hodgkin cells were mainly situated within sinusoidal spaces, which are characteristically seen in ALCL. However, they showed unequivocal expression of both CD30 and CD15, and no aberrant antigen expression to suggest ALCL (BSAP+, EMA-, LCA-, CD43-, CD2-, CD3-, CD4-, CD45RO-, ALK-, granzymeB-), with negative TCR gene rearrangement and no expression of EBV. HL with intrasinusoidal pattern has rarely been described, but we suggest that, although cases of HL with such a striking sinusoidal pattern are rare, nevertheless do exist. Since the identification of sinusoidal infiltration by CD30-positive neoplastic cells may lead to a mistaken view of ALCL, wide panel of antibodies should be used to confirm the diagnosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is composed of large, frequently bizarre, cells of T- or null-cell phenotype that show a preferential sinusoidal growth pattern and consistent CD30 positivity. Whether these tumors represent a single entity or several, and what the exact cell origin, is controversial. Recently, granzyme B, a cytotoxic granule component, was reported in a small percentage of ALCL, suggesting that some cases may originate from cytotoxic lymphocytes. To further investigate this possibility, we performed an immunohistochemical study of 33 ALCLs of T- and null-cell type, using monoclonal antibodies to cytotoxic cell-associated antigens, including CD8, CD56, CD57, and the cytotoxic granular proteins perforin and TIA-1. In addition, CD4 expression was also evaluated. ALCL cases included 27 classical systemic forms and variants, 3 primary cutaneous (PC) forms, and 3 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated forms. Cytotoxic antigen expression was also studied in 51 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 17 large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) with anaplastic cytomorphology and/ or CD30 positivity. We found that 76% of ALCLs, representing all subtypes except the PC forms, expressed either TIA-1, perforin, or both proteins. Expression of TIA-1 and perforin were highly correlated (P < .001). On the basis of their immunophenotypic profiles, several subtypes of cytotoxic antigen positive and negative ALCL could be recognized. Fifty-five percent of ALCLs (18 of 33) displayed an immunophenotypic profile consistent with cytotoxic T cells. Six cases expressed cytotoxic granular proteins in the absence of lineage specific markers, and one case expressed both T-cell- and natural killer cell-like markers. These 7 cases (21%) were placed into a phenotypic category of cytotoxic lymphocytes of unspecified subtype. Twenty-four percent (8 cases) of ALCLs were cytotoxic granule protein negative. All but one of these displayed a T-cell phenotype. Cytotoxic granule protein expression did not correlate with the presence of the NPM-ALK fusion transcript. Only 10% of the 51 HD cases were found to be TIA-1+, and none expressed perforin. Cytotoxic antigen expression was absent in LBCL. The expression of cytotoxic granule proteins in the majority of ALCL implies a cytotoxic lymphocyte phenotype and suggests that most cases originate from lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, the demonstration of cytotoxic cell related proteins may be a useful addition to the current panel of antibodies used to distinguish ALCL, HD, and anaplastic LBCL.",

Although important novel insights into the pathobiology of nodal PTCL have been gained recently from molecular profiling studies and clinico-pathological analyses, the pathogenetic molecular lesions remain to be deciphered for most entities. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) comprises CD4+ CXCL13+ neoplastic cells displaying overlapping immunophenotypical and molecular features with normal follicular helper T cells. This derivation might account for the presence of a prominent non-neoplastic component in AITL tissues and the clinical manifestations of the disease reflective of an immunological dysfunction. ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), defined by ALK gene translocation with various gene partners, is composed of CD30+ ALK+ cells with a cytotoxic phenotype and usually carries a good prognosis. ALK- ALCL, now considered as a distinct disease entity, is morphologically and immunophenotypically similar to ALK+ ALCL, except for ALK expression, but has distinctive molecular features. PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), the largest PTCL category, which is derived from activated CD4+ (or CD8+) T cells, is markedly heterogeneous, including at the molecular level.

Targeting hsp90 by the ansamycins geldanamycin and 17-allyl-amino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) promotes degradation of several proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, including oncogenic Raf, v-Src, erbB2, and BCR-ABL. We have previously shown that 17-AAG prevents hsp90/NPM-ALK complex formation and fosters NPM-ALK turnover, perhaps through its association with the hsp70 chaperone. Here, we show that inhibition of the proteasome activity by the potent and specific compound pyrazylcarbonyl-Phe-Leu-boronate (PS-341) blocks 17-AAG-induced down-regulation of NPM-ALK, which becomes detergent-insoluble and relocates into ubiquitin-rich perinuclear vesicles that represent aggregated polyubiquitinated forms of the protein. Kinase activity was not mandatory for proteasomal degradation of NPM-ALK, because kinase-defective NPM-ALK was even more rapidly degraded upon 17-AAG treatment. Prolonged exposure to the proteasome inhibitor was shown to trigger caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in proliferating ALCL cells at nanomolar concentrations. However, we verified that the accumulation of detergent-insoluble NPM-ALK in ALCL cells was not a spurious consequence of PS341-committed apoptosis, because caspase inhibitors prevented poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage whereas they did not affect partitioning of aggregated NPM-ALK. In line with these observations, the carboxyl hsp70-interacting ubiquitin ligase (CHIP), was shown to increase basal ubiquitination and turnover of NPM-ALK kinase, supporting a mechanism whereby NPM-ALK proceeds rapidly toward hsp70-assisted ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, when chaperoning activity of hsp90 is prohibited by 17-AAG.",

This report describes the design and synthesis of a series of 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine-based potent and selective ALK inhibitors culminating in identification of the investigational clinical candidate brigatinib.

Brigatinib displayed low nanomolar IC50s against native ALK and all tested clinically relevant ALK mutants in both enzyme-based biochemical and cell-based viability assays and demonstrated efficacy in multiple ALK+ xenografts in mice, including Karpas-299 (anaplastic large-cell lymphomas [ALCL]) and H3122 (NSCLC).

Clinically, the diseased mice showed rapidly progressive wasting, lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. Mice displaying the second phenotype developed monoclonal B-lymphoid tumors with a longer latency of approximately 12-16 weeks, primarily involving the spleen and the bone marrow, with less extensive lymph node but also histologically evident extranodal organ infiltration by large immature plasmoblastic cells.

Immunohistological staining of routine biopsy sections for increased levels of phosphotyrosine may therefore provide a simple means of screening for tumours containing activated tyrosine kinases. In this study, monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine were used to immunostain a cell line and tumour biopsies from lymphomas known to contain the activated anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase. A range of normal and other neoplastic tissues were also immunostained for comparison. An anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell line carrying the (2;5) translocation, which creates the activated nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) tyrosine kinase, was strongly labelled. Routine tissue biopsies from five cases of ALK-positive ALCL were also strongly positive for phosphotyrosine. The characteristic granular cytoplasmic labelling pattern for phosphotyrosine observed in a B-cell lymphoma (expressing full length ALK kinase) was identical to that obtained using an ALK-specific antibody, thus confirming that labelling for phosphotyrosine in lymphoma cells reflects the presence of an activated kinase. When normal lymphoid tissues were stained, there was little or no labelling for phosphotyrosine, but stronger labelling was seen in other cells and tissues; for example, endothelial cells and some carcinoma samples. Whilst the strong labelling for phosphotyrosine observed in the lymphoma cells is due to the presence of activated ALK, the strong staining of some normal cells presumably represents physiologically active kinases and this should be taken into account when interpreting the immunostaining of non-lymphoid tumours. The simplicity of this method, however, means that it offers a new rapid approach to the screening of large numbers of tumours for the presence of aberrant tyrosine kinase activation, particularly if they arise from tissues which normally contain only background levels of phosphotyrosine.",

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using NPM and ALK primers detects a consistent fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases with the translocation, resulting from genomic breakpoints within the same respective introns of NPM and ALK. To examine the feasibility of long-range DNA PCR with the same exonic NPM and ALK primers for the detection of the genomic NPM-ALK rearrangement, we examined 20 cases of Ki-1 ALCL previously characterized by NPM-ALK RT-PCR. Ten cases were positive for the NPM-ALK fusion RNA and 10 were negative. We first confirmed that both the NPM and ALK normal introns are relatively short, approximately 1 and 2 kb, respectively, suggesting that the largest possible size for the chimeric NPM-ALK intron would be about 3 kb. All 10 cases positive by RT-PCR were also positive by long-range DNA PCR. The DNA PCR products ranged, as expected, from the sizes of the normal introns, between 0.5 and 2.5 kb. All 10 RT-PCR-negative cases were also negative by long-range DNA PCR, and control templates for RT-PCR and long-range DNA PCR were successfully amplified. Thus, we have shown that the introns involved by the NPM-ALK rearrangement seen in some Ki-1 lymphomas are relatively short, making the genomic rearrangement amenable to reliable detection by long-range DNA PCR. Furthermore, the variability observed in the sizes of chimeric introns in evidence against clustering of the genomic breakpoints within these introns.",

Recently, the association between IgG4-related sclerosing disease and the risk of malignancies has been suggested. IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis with pancreatic cancer has been reported. Further, a few cases of extraocular malignant lymphoma in patients with IgG4-related sclerosing disease have also been documented. Herein, we describe the first documented case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) following IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis and cholecystitis and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A 61-year-old Japanese male, with a past history of DLBCL, was detected with swelling of the pancreas and tumorous lesions in the gallbladder. Histopathological study of the resected gallbladder specimen revealed diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with fibrosclerosis in the entire gallbladder wall. Eosinophilic infiltration and obliterative phlebitis were also noted. Immunohistochemically, many IgG4-positive plasma cells had infiltrated into the lesion, and the ratio of IgG4/IgG-positive plasma cells was 71.6%. Accordingly, a diagnosis of IgG4-related cholecystitis was made. Seven months later, he presented with a painful tumor in his left parotid gland. Histopathological study demonstrated diffuse or cohesive sheet-like proliferation of large-sized lymphoid cells with rich slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregular-shaped large nuclei. These lymphoid cells were positive for CD30, CD4, and cytotoxic markers, but negative for CD3 and ALK. Therefore, a diagnosis of ALK-negative ALCL was made. It has been suggested that the incidence of malignant lymphoma may be high in patients with IgG4-related sclerosing disease, therefore, intense medical follow-up is important in patients with this disorder.

        "Doc_abstract":"Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a barrier for tumor development. Oncogene-dependent DNA damage and activation of the ARF/p53 pathway play a central role in OIS and, accordingly, ARF and p53 are frequently mutated in human cancer. A number of leukemia/lymphoma-initiating oncogenes, however, inhibit ARF/p53 and only infrequently select for ARF or p53 mutations, suggesting the involvement of other tumor-suppressive pathways. We report that NPM-ALK, the initiating oncogene of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs), induces DNA damage and irreversibly arrests the cell cycle of primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. This effect is associated with inhibition of p53 and is caused by activation of the p16INK4a/pRb tumor-suppressive pathway. Analysis of NPM-ALK lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice showed p16INK4a-dependent accumulation of senescent cells in premalignant lesions and decreased tumor latency in the absence of p16INK4a. Accordingly, human ALCLs showed no expression of either p16INK4a or pRb. Up-regulation of the histone-demethylase Jmjd3 and de-methylation at the p16INK4a promoter contributed to the effect of NPM-ALK on p16INK4a, which was transcriptionally regulated. These data demonstrate that p16INK4a/pRb may function as an alternative pathway of oncogene-induced senescence, and suggest that the reactivation of p16INK4a expression might be a novel strategy to restore the senescence program in some tumors.",

The ALK gene products were identified in paraffm sections by using a new anti-ALK (cytoplasmic portion) monoclonal antibody (ALKc) that tends to react more strongly than a previously described ALK1 antibody with the nuclei of ALK-expressing tumor cells after microwave heating in 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer, pH 8.0. The ALKc monoclonal antibody reacted selectively with 60% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases (60 of 100), which occurred mainly in the first three decades of life and consistently displayed a T/null phenotype. This group of ALK-positive tumors showed a wide morphological spectrum including cases with features of anaplastic large cell lymphoma \"common\" type (75%), \"lymphohistiocytic\" (10%), \"small cell\" (8.3%), \"giant cell\" (3.3%), and \"Hodgkin's like\" (3.3%). CD30-positive large anaplastic cells expressing the ALK protein both in the cytoplasm and nucleus represented the dominant tumor population in the common, Hodgkin's-like and giant cell types, but they were present at a smaller percentage (often with a perivascular distribution) also in cases with lymphohistiocytic and small cell features. In this study, the ALKc antibody also allowed us to identify small neoplastic cells (usually CD30 negative) with nucleus-restricted ALK positivity that were, by definition, more evident in the small cell variant but were also found in cases with lymphohistiocytic, common, and \"Hodgkin's-like\" features. These findings, which have not been previously emphasized, strongly suggest that the neoplastic lesion (the NPM-ALK gene) must be present both in the large anaplastic and small tumor cells, and that ALK-positive lymphomas lie on a spectrum, their position being defined by the ratio of small to large neoplastic cells. Notably, about 15% of all ALK-positive lymphomas (usually of the common or giant cell variant) showed a cytoplasm-restricted ALK positivity, which suggests that the ALK gene may have fused with a partner(s) other than NPM. From a diagnostic point of view, detection of the ALK protein was useful in distinguishing anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases of lymphohistiocytic and small cell variants from reactive conditions and other peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes, as well as for detecting a small number of tumor cells in lymphohemopoietic tissues. In conclusion, ALK positivity appears to define a clinicopathological entity with a T/null phenotype (\"ALK lymphomas\"), but one that shows a wider spectrum of morphological patterns than has been appreciated in the past.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), CD30+, is a subtype of T-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its most common form is a classical systemic type that involves multiple nodal and extranodal sites. In this study, morphologic, immunohistologic, and genetic studies were performed on ALCL cases in Pakistani patients. The median age of the patients in this study was 45 years (age range: 5-70 years), with a male to female ratio of 3.4:1. Thirty-seven (37) patients were diagnosed to have Ki-1 (CD30+) ALCL, which constituted 2% of all NHLs and 12.6% of all T-NHLs, over a period of 11 years (January 01, 1992-December 31, 2002). The tumors were of either T- or null-cell type with constant (100%) expression of CD30 (Ki-1). The majority of the cases (89.2%) expressed EMA, whereas 40.5% of the cases expressed either CD45 (LCA), CD45RO (UCHL1), or ALK. The mean age of ALCL patients with null-cell phenotype was 33.8 years as compared to those with T-cell phenotype having a mean age of 36.3 years. Out of the 37 cases diagnosed as ALCL, amplifiable DNA was isolated from 28 cases, which were further assessed for T-cell clonality for T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta, gamma, and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) for the FR2 and FR3 regions. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the TCR beta, gamma, and IgH regions in 15 (53.6%), 11 (39.3%), and 2 (7.1%) ALCL cases, respectively, out of 28 cases. Association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was noted in seven out of 28 cases (25%) of ALCL by PCR, whereas ISH for EBV-encoded nuclear RNA-1 (EBER-1) detected the presence of EBV in two (16.7%) out of 12 cases, where one was T-cell ALCL and the other null-cell ALCL. Immunostaining for LMP-1 could not be performed, because tissue material was not available. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the prevalence of ALCL in Pakistan is comparable to that reported for some of the Asian communities and by the International Lymphoma Study Group and that EBV could be partly responsible for the pathogenesis of ALCL.",

The breakpoints of the t(2;5) (p23;q35) [corrected] translocation, which is reported in about 40% of Ki-1 ALCL, have recently been cloned. They involve a novel tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, at 2p23 and the nucleophosmin gene, NPM, at 5q35. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using NPM and ALK primers consistently detects a fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases with the translocation. To determine if this tumor-specific genetic alteration also occurs in HD, we performed NPM-ALK RT-PCR on RNA samples extracted from 40 lymph node biopsies of HD (25 nodular sclerosis, 11 mixed cellularity, 2 lymphocyte depleted, 2 lymphocyte predominant). Using control samples, the sensitivity of the NPM-ALK RT-PCR assay was shown to be at least 1:10(4). Amplifiable template was confirmed in all samples by RT-PCR using beta-actin primers. None of the 40 cases showed the expected 177-bp RT-PCR product indicative of the translocation. We conclude that the most common primary genetic alteration in Ki-1 ALCL, the t(2;5), is absent or very infrequent in typical cases of HD. These results further support the concept that HD and Ki-1 ALCL are pathogenetically distinct entities.",

The border between these diseases is sometimes difficult to establish and there are many grey zones in their classification.;We reviewed the clinical and research literature and guided by our experiences attempted to discern molecular and phenotypic criteria to improve the classification and identify molecular targets for therapy of CD30-positive cutaneous lymphomas.;Functional studies of ALCL cell lines clonally derived from LyP have revealed loss of growth inhibition by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), due to TGF-beta receptor mutations. Studies of genetic variants of the CD30 promoter showed distinct microsatellite alleles associated with development of LyP and lymphoma progression. Studies of LyP and cutaneous ALCL tissues and cell lines suggest a dual role for CD30/CD30 ligand interactions in regression of LyP and progression to lymphoma. CD30 signaling activates NF-kappaB in cell lines derived from cutaneous ALCL but not anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive systemic ALCL in which growth arrest occurs through cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1. Other likely biomarkers of disease progression include differential expression of Bcl-2, fascin, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, and T-cell receptor clonality. These may lead to improved classification, diagnoses, and therapeutic targets.;The current clinicopathologic classification of CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders is insufficient.

Most patients are not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in this setting and treatment, therefore, becomes palliative. A few studies have shown that trofosfamide, an oral alkylating agent, may be effective as palliative treatment in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Trofosfamide therapy is considered rather non-toxic with an overall response rate from 50 to 80%. Most responses are, however, partial and their duration is short. We report a patient with a very aggressive ALK + anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), relapsing shortly after high dose chemotherapy. Unrelated allogeneic transplantation was hot possible. After several radio/chemotherapy regimens trofosfamide was started as palliative treatment. This therapy resulted in a complete remission, still ongoing, 27 months after termination of intravenous cytotoxic therapy and 16 months after withdrawal of trofosfamide. Thus, in this particular case, trofosfamide turned out to be an unexpectedly effective salvage therapy for an otherwise very aggressive relapsing ALCL.",

The tumor produced transcripts for interleukin-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma which could explain the patient's B-symptoms. Treatment of mice with monoclonal antibody (HeFi-1) which activates CD30 antigen administered on day 1 after tumor transplantation prevented tumor growth. Treatment with HeFi-1 after tumors had reached a 0.2 cm(3) volume caused tumor growth arrest and prevention of tumor dissemination.

ALK gene products, which are absent from normal lymphohaematopoietic cells, are a phenotypic marker of lymphomas carrying the t(2;5). We used in situ hybridization and immunohistology to screen 14 cutaneous ALC lymphomas, 21 cases of LyP, and one nodal ALC lymphoma associated with LyP for ALK gene products. ALK gene products were not detectable in these cases. In contrast, ALK gene products were found in a lymphonodal ALC lymphoma with subsequent extension to the skin and in t(2;5)-positive cell lines. Detection of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small nuclear transcripts (EBER), and of immunoglobulin light chain transcripts served to check for the presence of cellular RNA in the tissue sections. EBER transcripts were found in scattered reactive lymphoid cells, but not in atypical or tumour cells. ALK gene expression and EBV infection seem to be a rare finding in cutaneous ALC lymphomas and LyP. This points to a molecular aetiology of primary cutaneous ALC lymphomas and LyP distinct from that of extracutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disease.

Second, we found that the overall accuracy of the MC was remarkable: 98% to 77% for AITL and 98% to 93% for ALK-negative ALCL in test and validation sets of patient cases, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the MC significantly improved the prognostic stratification of patients with PTCL.

Consistent with flavopiridol activity, phosphorylation at cdk2, cdk4, cdk9 sites on RB and RNA polymerase II was inhibited. This correlated with induction of cell death through rapid mitochondrial damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and transcripts. Notably, flavopiridol was less active in ALK-positive cells, as apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations and later time points, and resistance to treatment was observed in cells maintaining NPM-ALK signaling. NPM-ALK inhibition affected proliferation but not survival of anaplastic large cell lym-phoma cells, whereas it resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis when combined with flavopiridol.;This work provides the first demonstration that targeting cdk is effective against anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, and proves the critical role of NPM-ALK in the regulation of responsiveness of tumor cells with cdk dysregulation.",

These disorders comprise a spectrum of clinically benign lymphomatoidpapulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). The peak incidence of LyP is in the 5th decade of life, and the incidence of primary cutaneous ALCL peaks in the 6th decade, but children are also affected. Both LyP and primary cutaneous ALCL have an excellent prognosis. However, LyP is associated with development of malignant lymphoma (mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin lymphoma, or ALCL) in 20% of cases, and also with an increased risk of non-lymphoid cancers. The diagnosis of LyP is difficult and often delayed. Primary cutaneous ALCL must be distinguished from secondary skin lesions in systemic ALCL, which confer a poor prognosis. Correlation of clinical findings with histopathology and immunopathology (stains for ALK kinase, epithelial membrane antigen, and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen) are important to achieve a correct diagnosis. When a diagnosis of CD30+ PCLPD is established, minimal clinical staging is required. Low-dose methotrexate (10-25 mg weekly) is the most effective therapy for PCLPD but is usually reserved for aggressive cases of LyP and multifocal lesions of cutaneous ALCL Many patients with LyP can be followed expectantly, with special attention to changes in character of the skin lesions or development of lymphadenopathy. Patients with localized cutaneous ALCL can be treated with irradiation. Extracutaneous spread of disease is an indication for multiagent chemotherapy. Other treatment alternatives are discussed.",

Clinical features combined fever (8/9), nodal and extra-nodal disease (9/9), including hepato-splenic (9/9) and lung involvement (7/9). The level of hyperleucocytosis ranged from 30 to 120 × 10(9) /l, with 12-90% of tumour cells. Diagnosis relied on a lymph node biopsy, with a positive ALK+ antibody immunostain in all nine cases, a T-cell immunophenotype in 7/9 cases and CD3 positivity in 5/9 cases. A small cell component was present in 6/9 cases. Only four patients achieved a complete remission with first-line therapy and 3/4 relapsed. Four patients are alive with a median follow-up of 31 months, two of them after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and five patients died, two of them of disease. In conclusion, ALCL with leukaemic presentation is very unusual and should be considered as high-risk lymphoma requiring new therapeutic strategies. The respective role of new agents and allogeneic HSCT in first complete remission still has to be assessed. ",

We recently identified that MSH2, a key DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein integral to the suppression of tumorigenesis, is an NPM-ALK-interacting protein. In this study, we found in vitro evidence that enforced expression of NPM-ALK in HEK293 cells suppressed MMR function. Correlating with these findings, six of nine ALK(+)ALCL tumors displayed evidence of microsatellite instability, as opposed to none of the eight normal DNA control samples (P = 0.007, Student's t-test). Using co-immunoprecipitation, we found that increasing levels of NPM-ALK expression in HEK293 cells resulted in decreased levels of MSH6 bound to MSH2, whereas MSH2·NPM-ALK binding was increased. The NPM-ALK·MSH2 interaction was dependent on the activation/autophosphorylation of NPM-ALK, and the Y191 residue of NPM-ALK was a crucial site for this interaction and NPM-ALK-mediated MMR suppression. MSH2 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of NPM-ALK. Finally, NPM-ALK impeded the expected DNA damage-induced translocation of MSH2 out of the cytoplasm. To conclude, our data support a model in which the suppression of MMR by NPM-ALK is attributed to its ability to interfere with normal MSH2 biochemistry and function.",

They involve a novel tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, at 2p23 and the nucleophosmin gene, NPM, at 5q35. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with NPM and ALK primers detects a consistent fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases that have the translocation. In the course of a survey of 15 cases of Ki-1 ALCL, we identified a single case with a slightly smaller NPM-ALK RT-PCR product, among 12 cases positive for this fusion RNA. Sequencing of this novel NPM-ALK RT-PCR product showed an in-frame junction of NPM to ALK, 30 bases distal to the usual ALK junction site, but at the usual NPM Junction site. The predicted chimeric protein in this case is thus shorter by 10 amino acids, but the putative ALK catalytic domain remains intact. PCR with ALK primers bracketing the novel fusion point, performed on either cDNA or genomic DNA, yielded the same product, confirming that this novel ALK fusion point was located within an exon. Hybridization analysis of the genomic junction fragment isolated by long-range DNA PCR suggested that the ALK genomic breakpoint was also exonic. Cloning and sequencing of the genomic breakpoint confirmed that the break occurred within the 5' portion of the ALK exon participating in the fusion junction, 28 bases 3' to the normal ALK exon boundary, resulting in the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site two bases distal to the breakpoint. This case demonstrates that, in translocations resulting in chimeric transcripts, genomic breakpoints may rarely lie within an exon, provided that the reading frame is maintained and no domains presumed critical to tumorigenesis are deleted.",

The catalytic domain of ALK was originally identified in the t(2;5) translocation that produces the unglycosylated oncogenic protein NPM-ALK, which occurs in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). Recently, both germline and somatic activating missense mutations of ALK have been identified in neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric cancer arising from neural crest cells. Moreover, we previously reported that ALK expression is significantly upregulated in advanced/metastatic NB. We hypothesized that ALK function may depend on N-linked glycosylation and that disruption of this post-translational modification would impair ALK activation, regardless the presence of either gene mutations or overexpression.;We employed tunicamycin to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. The following ALK-positive NB cell lines were used: SH-SY5Y and KELLY (ALK mutation F1174L), UKF-NB3 (ALK mutation R1275Q) and NB1 (ALK amplification). As a control, we used the NB cell lines LA1-5S and NB5 (no ALK expression), and the ALCL cell line SU-DHL1 (NPM-ALK).;Tunicamycin treatment of ALK-positive NB cells resulted in a hypoglycosylated ALK band and in decreased amounts of mature full size receptor. Concomitantly, we observed a marked reduction of mature ALK phosphorylation. On the contrary, tunicamycin had no effects on NPM-ALK phosphorylation in SU-DHL1 cells. Moreover, phosphorylation levels of ALK downstream effectors (AKT, ERK1/2, STAT3) were clearly impaired only in ALK mutated/amplified NB cell lines, whereas no significant reduction was observed in both ALK-negative and NPM-ALK-positive cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation considerably impaired cell viability only of ALK mutated/amplified NB cells. Finally, the cleavage of the Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) suggested that apoptotic pathways may be involved in cell death.;In this study we showed that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation affects ALK phosphorylation and disrupts downstream pro-survival signaling, indicating that inhibition of this post-translational modification may be a promising therapeutic approach. However, as tunicamycin is not a likely candidate for clinical use other approaches to alter N-linked glycosylation need to be explored. Future studies will assess whether the efficacy in inhibiting ALK activity might be enhanced by the combination of ALK specific small molecule and N-linked glycosylation inhibitors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive large B-cell lymphoma is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although a few cases of ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma harbor nucleophosmin-ALK chromosomal translocation similar to ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, most reported cases are characterized by t(2;17)(p23;q23) involving the clathrin gene. Here, we report 2 cases of ALK-positive DLBCL. The 2 cases presented similar morphologic features and immunohistochemical characteristics, that is, positivity for ALK, IgA, CD138, and MUM1; weak positivity for CD30 and CD79a; and negativity for CD20. The clathrin-ALK transcript was identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the sequence was determined by direct sequencing. Recently, the essential role of STAT3 activation as well as STAT 5 activation in nucleophosmin-ALK fusion protein-mediated lymphomagenesis was reported. However, differential effects of ALK-fusion variant proteins on proliferation, transformation, and invasion properties were reported. Thus, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of STAT 3 and STAT 5, and found highly hyperphosphorylated STAT 3 on tyrosine 705 but not STAT 5 in our 2 cases of ALK-positive DLBCL with clathrin-ALK fusion. Furthermore, STAT 5A expression was not detected in either of the ALK-positive DLBCL cases, although 11 of the 36 ALK-negative DLBCL cases revealed STAT 5A expression. Expression of the antiapoptotic proteins survivin and BCL-X(L), which were believed to be the targets of STAT 3, was investigated. However, there were no significant associations between expression of survivin or BCL-X(L) and ALK positivity among the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In summary, similar signaling transduction mechanism involving STAT proteins seems to underlie DLBCL harboring the clathrin-ALK or nucleophosmin-ALK fusion gene.",

The role of an insect bite as a triggering event has been postulated but not well documented.;We retrospectively investigated five cases of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma who presented with skin lesions occurring after an insect bite. Biopsies were immunostained with antibodies against CD30, ALK, T- and B-cell antigens.;Persistent skin lesions developed after solitary insect bites in three patients and after multiple bites in two. Regional lymphadenopathy developed within weeks after the bite in three cases. In four cases the correct diagnosis was delayed due to misinterpretation of the findings as a reactive infiltrate in the skin (n=2) or lymph nodes (n=2); all cases subsequently showed small numbers of cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for ALK. The final diagnoses were lymphohistiocytic variant (n=3) and composite common/small cell type (n=2) anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The patients were treated and three were alive at the last follow-up. Two patients died, one of pneumonia and the other of disseminated disease.;In these cases the sequence of events between the insect bites and the occurrence of both skin lesions and satellite lymphadenopathy suggest a direct relationship between the bite and the presentation with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. We postulate that insect bite-associated antigens could result in an influx of T lymphocytes, some bearing the t(2;5). The subsequent release of cytokines at the site of the bite could act as a 'second hit', eliciting activation of the latter cells, which would then express the oncogenic NPM-ALK protein and undergo uncontrolled proliferation.",

A definite diagnosis was not possible on histopathological examination. Immunostaining clearly showed a predominant population of small irregular lymphocytes, admixed with large cells strongly positive for CD30, epithelial membrane antigen, and the ALK protein. Neoplastic cells were of the T/cytotoxic phenotype. In situ hybridisation with EBV encoded early RNA probes showed only a few scattered positive non-neoplastic small lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor rearrangements was negative. The NPM-ALK fusion transcript associated with the t(2;5) translocation was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A review of the literature revealed 76 cases of T cell PTLD, showing a broad spectrum of morphological features and clinical behaviour. Most of these cases were EBV negative (61 of 76) and occurred after renal transplantation (48 of 76).

Thus, detection of ALK protein is presumptive evidence of these 2p23 abnormalities. The t(2;5) and ALK immunoreactivity are common in anaplastic large cell lymphoma of T/null-cell lineage. However, a small subset of cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) have been reported to either carry the t(2;5) or express ALK. In this study, we have immunohistochemically evaluated 327 cases of HD with the ALK-11 antibody. ALK-11 is a well characterized polyclonal antibody raised against an intracellular portion of the ALK protein. We detected ALK-11 immunoreactivity in 8 (2.4%) cases of HD. We further studied these positive cases with ALK-1 monoclonal antibody, which reacts with an intracellular portion of ALK, similar to ALK-11. All 8 ALK-11 positive cases were negative for ALK-1. These results indicate that rare cases of HD may react with ALK-11 antibody, similar to previous reports by others using different polyclonal anti-ALK antibodies. However, the absence of ALK-1 expression in these HD cases suggests that ALK protein is not truly present and that polyclonal anti-ALK antibodies may rarely yield non-specific cross reactivity. These results further support the use of anti-ALK antibodies in the differential diagnosis of HD from ALCL.",

The common phenotypic hallmark is the expression of CD30-antigen by the tumor cells which morphologically resemble Reed-Sternberg cells. Although LyP is a non-fatal recurring disorder, it is associated with systemic lymphomas including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), mycosis fungoides (MF) and ALCL in 5-20% of the cases. Currently there is no marker to predict the development of systemic lymphomas in patients with LyP. Fascin, an actin bundling protein, has recently been shown to be a unique marker found in almost 100% of classical HL.;Because of the association of LyP with HL, fascin expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in LyP (n = 45), cutaneous CD30+ ALCL (n = 17) and pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma (n = 9) (PTL) and LyP associated with systemic lymphomas (7 HL, 2 ALCL, 1 MF), with the intent to determine if fascin expression can predict disease progression.;Fascin was expressed by tumor cells in 11/45 (24%) cases of LyP, 11/17 (64%) cases of ALCL, 7/9 (77%) cases of PTL and 6/10 (60%) cases of LyP associated with systemic lymphomas. Fascin expression in LyP was significantly less frequent than in ALCL (p < 0.001) and also than in LyP associated with lymphomas (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference of fascin expression within the histological subtypes of LyP. We found no evidence of ALK expression nor of Epstein-Barr virus expression in any case either by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry in the LyP cases associated with HL.;This is the first study to demonstrate that fascin is expressed in cutaneous CD30+ LPD and that it is a candidate marker of disease progression in LyP.",

In each case, ALK staining was restricted to the cytoplasm and the N-terminus of NPM to the nucleus (contrasting with lymphomas expressing NPM-ALK in which cytoplasmic as well as nuclear labeling is seen).

In January 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a possible association between breast implants and ALCL, which was likened to systemic ALCL and treated accordingly. We analyzed existing data to see if implant-associated ALCL (iALCL) may represent a distinct entity, different from aggressive ALCL. We conducted a systematic review of publications regarding ALCL and breast implantation for 1990-2012 and contacted corresponding authors to obtain long-term follow-up where available. We identified 44 unique cases of iALCL, the majority of which were associated with seroma, had an ALK(-) phenotype (97%), and had a good prognosis, different from the expected 40% 5-year survival rate of patients with ALK(-) nodal ALCL (one case remitted spontaneously following implant removal; only two deaths have been reported to the FDA or in the scientific literature since 1990). The majority of these patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone with or without radiation, but radiation alone also resulted in complete clinical responses. It appears that iALCL demonstrates a strong association with breast implants, a waxing and waning course, and an overall good prognosis, with morphology, cytokine profile, and biological behavior similar to those of primary cutaneous ALCL. Taken together, these data are suggestive that iALCL may start as a reactive process with the potential to progress and acquire an aggressive phenotype typical of its systemic counterpart. A larger analysis and prospective evaluation and follow-up of iALCL patients are necessary to definitively resolve the issue of the natural course of the disease and best therapeutic approaches for these patients.",

In one case of follicular lymphoma, microscopic foci of tumor were found in the intestinal mucosa which spread far from the primary nodule and probably beyond the resection border. It is difficult to ascertain whether this phenomenon represents colonization of pre-existing non-neoplastic follicles by lymphoma or spreading of the tumor within the same tissue. In this case, surgical removal of the lymphoma is problematic.",

Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is extremely rare in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. In children, only isolated cases have been reported, mainly as secondary CNS involvement. We report on a 13-year-old boy presenting with headaches and diplopia. Cerebrospinal fluid was infiltrated with atypical large granular lymphocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed leptomeningeal enhancement. A frontal lobe biopsy showed a pleomorphic neoplasm diffusely infiltrating the meninges composed of large cells with bizarre nuclei similar to those evidenced in cerebrospinal fluid. Immunohistochemical stains showed diffuse strong positivity for CD8, CD30, anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein: p80 and negative monocyte-macrophage and B cell markers. TCR gamma was clonally rearranged. This finding was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the NPM/ALK fusion protein. Epstein-Barr virus was not detected. No evidence of extra-CNS disease was found by imaging study, cytologic examination, or molecular studies. The patient underwent complete remission with polychemotherapy followed by a CNS irradiation. At +10 months from onset, he suffered a full relapse. After a short-term remission with vinblastine, he underwent nonmyeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but unfortunately died from multiple organ failure.

The number of T-cell lymphoma subtypes increased from 21 in the WHO classification 2008 to 29 in the WHO classification 2016. This means that T-cell lymphomas are heterogeneous. T-cell lymphomas can be divided to ALK-positive anaplastic lymphoma (ALCL) with a good prognosis and others with poorer prognoses. ALK-positive ALCL can be successfully treated with CHOP, but the others cannot. P-glycoprotein resistant anthracyclines, etoposide, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are increasingly applied to improve outcomes, but no standard treatment approach has yet been established.

The tumour cells showed immunoblastic/plasmablastic histology and were positive for ALK and Oct2, but negative for CD3, CD20, CD79a, CD30 and PAX5. The staining pattern of ALK protein was cytoplasmic in two patients and associated with the nuclear membrane in one patient. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the ALK break-apart probe revealed ALK gene rearrangements in all three patients, with a 5'-ALK gene deletion in one patient.

        "Doc_abstract":"The 2;5 chromosomal translocation is frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). The translocation creates a fusion gene consisting of the alk (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene and the nucelophosmin (npm) gene: the 3' half of alk derived from chromosome 2 is fused to the 5' portion of npm from chromosome 5. A recent study shows that the product of the npm-alk fusion gene is oncogenic. To help understand how the npm-alk oncogene transform cells, it is important to investigate the normal biological function of the alk gene product, ALK. Here, we show molecular cloning of cDNAs for both the human and mouse ALK proteins. The deduced amino acid sequences reveal that ALK is a novel receptor protein-tyrosine kinase having a putative transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain. These sequences are absent in the product of the transforming npm-alk gene. ALK shows the greatest sequence similarity to LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase) whose biological function is presently unknown. RNA blot hybridization analysis of various tissues reveals that the alk mRNA is dominantly detected in the brain and spinal cord. Immunoblotting with anti-ALK antibody shows that ALK is highly expressed in the neonatal brain. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization analysis shows that the alk mRNA is dominantly expressed in neurons in specific regions of the nervous system such as the thalamus, mid-brain, olfactory bulb, and ganglia of embryonic and neonatal mice. These data suggest that ALK plays an important role(s) in the development of the brain and exerts its effects on specific neurons in the nervous system.",

Here we show using an integrated phosphoproteomic and metabolomic strategy that NPM-ALK induces a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis, increased lactate production, and biomass production. The metabolic shift is mediated through the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) phosphorylation of the tumor-specific isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) at Y105, resulting in decreased enzymatic activity. Small molecule activation of PKM2 or expression of Y105F PKM2 mutant leads to reversal of the metabolic switch with increased oxidative phosphorylation and reduced lactate production coincident with increased cell death, decreased colony formation, and reduced tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. This study provides comprehensive profiling of the phosphoproteomic and metabolomic consequences of NPM-ALK expression and reveals a novel role of ALK in the regulation of multiple components of cellular metabolism. Our studies show that PKM2 is a novel substrate of ALK and plays a critical role in mediating the metabolic shift toward biomass production and tumorigenesis. ",

However, the regulator(s) of RU/RR dichotomy are not identified. In this study, we aim to delineate the key regulator(s) of RU/RR dichotomy.;JASPER motif match analysis was used to identify the putative factors binding to SRR2 sequence. SRR2 probe pull-down assay and quantitate real-time PCR were performed to analyze the regulation of Sox2 transcriptional activity by MYC. Methylcellulose colony formation assay, chemoresistance to doxorubicin and mouse xenograft study were performed to investigate the biological functions of MYC. PCR array and western blotting were executed to study related signaling pathways that regulate MYC expression. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assay were initiated to evaluate the expression of MYC and its correlation with its regulator by chi-square test analysis in human primary tumor cells.;We identified MYC as a potential regulator of RU/RR dichotomy. In support of its role, MYC was highly expressed in RR cells compared to RU cells, and inhibition of MYC substantially decreased the Sox2/SRR2 binding, Sox2 transcriptional activity, chemoresistance, and methylcellulose colony formation. In contrast, enforced expression of MYC in RU cells conferred the RR phenotype. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a positive regulator of MYC, was highly active in RR but not RU cells. While inhibition of this pathway in RR cells substantially decreased MYC expression and SRR2 reporter activity, experimental activation of this pathway led to the opposite effects in RU cells. Collectively, our results support a model in which a positive feedback loop involving Wnt/β-catenin/MYC and Sox2 contributes to the RR phenotype. In a mouse xenograft model, RU cells stably transfected with MYC showed upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin/MYC/Sox2 axis and increased tumorigenecity. Correlating with these findings, there was a significant correlation between the expression of active β-catenin and MYC in ALK + ALCL primary tumor cells.;A positive feedback loop involving the Wnt/β-catenin/MYC/Sox2 axis defines a highly tumorigenic cell subset in ALK + ALCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Selective kinase inhibitors have had a substantial impact on the field of medical oncology. Whereas these agents can elicit dramatic clinical responses in some settings, their activity is generally limited to a subset of treated patients whose tumor cells harbor a specific genetic lesion. We have established an automated platform for examining the sensitivity to various molecularly targeted inhibitors across a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines to identify additional genotype-correlated responses that may be clinically relevant. Among the inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a variety of human cancers, we found that a selective inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) potently suppressed growth of a small subset of tumor cells. This subset included lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas, non-small-cell lung cancers, and neuroblastomas. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that was first identified as part of a protein fusion derived from a chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients, and has recently been implicated as an oncogene in a small fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas. Significantly, sensitivity in these cell lines was well correlated with specific ALK genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations and gene amplification. Moreover, in such cell lines, ALK kinase inhibition can lead to potent suppression of downstream survival signaling and an apoptotic response. These findings suggest that a subset of lung cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastomas that harbor genomic ALK alterations may be clinically responsive to pharmacologic ALK inhibition.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently, the fusion gene EML4-ALK was identified in non-small cell lung carcinoma, which could be a potential therapeutic target. We investigated the prevalence of anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein expression in these tumors by immunohistochemistry and correlated the results with data from ALK molecular studies. Gene expression profiling was performed on 35 adenocarcinomas to identify cases with ALK gene up-regulation, which was correlated with protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was also performed on an independent cohort consisting of 150 adenocarcinomas and 150 squamous cell carcinomas to evaluate the utility of anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunostaining as a screening tool. Florescence in situ hybridization for the ALK locus and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for EML4-ALK were performed on tumors positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional up-regulation of ALK was identified in 2 (6%) of 35 adenocarcinomas by gene expression profiling. These 2 cases were positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase by immunohistochemistry, whereas the remaining 33 cases were completely negative. In the independent cohort, anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunostaining was positive in 1 of 150 squamous cell carcinomas and in 3 of 150 adenocarcinomas. The 6 cases positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase by immunohistochemistry showed evidence of ALK locus rearrangement by florescence in situ hybridization but were negative for EGFR and KRAS mutation. The presence of EML4-ALK fusion transcript was confirmed in 2 cases by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunoreactivity in non-small cell lung carcinomas was associated with transcriptional up-regulation, ALK locus rearrangement, and the presence of EML4-ALK fusion transcript. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunohistochemistry may have utility as a screening tool or as a surrogate marker for the molecular techniques to detect the EML4-ALK fusion gene in these tumors.",

Micro-FDG- and FLT-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in immunodeficient mice bearing ALCL xenotransplants were carried out with the cell lines SUDHL-1 and Karpas299 to assess early treatment response to NVP-AUY922 or everolimus in vivo. SUDHL-1 cells showed sensitivity to both inhibitors in vitro. Importantly, we detected a significant reduction of FLT-uptake in SUDHL-1 bearing animals using both inhibitors compared with baseline as early as 5 days after initiation of targeted therapy. Immunostaining showed a decrease in Ki-67 and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 staining. In contrast, FDG-uptake did not significantly decrease at early time points. Karpas299 xenotransplants, which are resistant to NVP-AUY922 and sensitive to everolimus treatment, showed an increase of mean FLT-uptake on day 2 after administration of NVP-AUY299, but a significant reduction in FLT-uptake upon everolimus treatment.

The latter differs by expression of CD15 and lack of CD45, pan-T antigens and ALK expression. We report nine cases of large cell hematopoietic neoplasms in which the neoplastic cells co-expressed CD30 and CD15, and had immunophenotypic and morphologic features of T-cell lymphoproliferative process. The average age of the CD15-positive group was 61.9 years; 6 cases occurred in men and 3 in women. The tumors were located in lymph nodes in 8 cases, and in liver in 1 case. Two cases expressed ALK protein. There were no statistically significant differences in phenotypic parameters between the CD15-positive and CD15-negative neoplasms (p>0.05). However, the CD15-positive group appeared to show a minor trend toward less positivity for EMA (44% versus 72%), ALK protein (22% versus 51%), and CD45RO (33.3% versus 83.3%, p=0.07), when compared to the typical CD15-negative neoplasms. In summary, although the co-expression of CD30 and CD15 is typical for classical HL, it may be also present in a subset of peripheral T-cell neoplasms including ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Combined and sensible use of morphology and a broad immunophenotypic panel in cases with limited material and/or those with overlapping histologic patterns will best discriminate between HL and ALCL. It is incumbent upon the pathologist to distinguish between these two clinicopathologic entities, since treatment options and clinical outcomes differ.",

In recent years, hitherto unrecognized chromosomal translocations have been reported in small subsets of PTCLs, and genome-wide array-based profiling investigations have provided novel insights into their molecular characteristics.

ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase, with a single transmembrane domain, that plays an important role in development. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain, the receptor undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain. In recent years, ALK inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment. These inhibitors target ALK activity and show effectiveness in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, acquired treatment resistance makes the future of this therapy unclear; new strategies are underway to overcome the limitations of current ALK inhibitors. ",

We report four such cases with a remarkably hypocellular granulation tissue-like appearance, mimicking an inflammatory or reparative process. All patients were young and presented with lymphadenopathy in multiple sites. The lymph node biopsies showed a hypocellular appearance, with wide separation of the small to medium-sized lymphoid cells by edematous or fibromyxoid stroma. There were interspersed spindly neoplastic cells resembling myofibroblasts, sometimes forming short, sweeping fascicles, as well as histiocytes. Occasional large cells with atypical nuclei were identified. The larger lymphoid cells tended to form cuffs around the venules. In two cases, the capsule and fibrous trabeculae were markedly broadened with increased spindly cells, mimicking inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph node. Immunostaining showed dispersed and clustered CD30+ ALK+ cells, confirming a diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In conclusion, a diagnosis of hypocellular anaplastic large cell lymphoma requires a high index of suspicion. The young age of the patients and the presence of perivascular cuffs of larger lymphoid cells should provide the strongest clues to the correct diagnosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) are mesenchymal solid tumors that occur preferentially in children and young adults. They present as myofibroblastic cell proliferations accompanied by plasmocytes and lymphocytes. Recent cytogenetic and molecular observations showed non-random abnormalities of chromosomal band 2p23 resulting in a rearrangement of the ALK gene. This finding of a specific gene alteration suggests a neoplastic rather than a reactive inflammatory process for IMT tumorigenesis. ALK is a tyrosine kinase oncogene initially found to be rearranged in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCL). Of note, the breakpoints within ALK, and also within some of the ALK fusion gene partners, such as TPM3 or CLTC, are similar in IMT and ALCL. The consistent involvement of ALK, together with the diversity of partner genes, underlines the central role of ALK constitutive activation in IMT development, as well as the importance of homodimerization mechanisms of the chimeric fusion proteins in this activation. Immunohistochemical analyses performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections have shown positive ALK expression with cytoplasmic localization in half of the IMT cases containing the molecular ALK rearrangement. In conclusion, these novel molecular data have defined a group of IMT of neoplastic origin characterized by the presence of ALK alterations. The description of ALK gene rearrangements in IMT and ALCL is the second example, after the observation of ETV6-NTRK3 in congenital fibrosarcoma and in a case of chronic myeloid leukemia, of identical gene fusions occurring in two different cell lines: hematopoietic and mesenchymal. The search for rearrangement of ALK by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a useful complementary tool for IMT diagnosis.",

Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (IALCL) is extremely rare. Retrospective analysis of a case of cutaneous IALCL was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections and immunohistochemical staining results were analyzed. The patient was a 47-year-old woman who had developed multiple erythematous patches and plaques on her back. The lesions responded well to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, oncovin, prednisone) chemotherapy, but relapsed shortly after therapy. The patient was surviving with the disease for eight years but was ultimately lost to follow up. Histopathologically, the neoplasm evolved from IL to extravascular lymphoma. This was showed in biopsies obtained at different stages of the disease. The lymphoma cells stained positively for CD30, CD45, CD3, CD4, CD5 and Ki67, and lacked expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), CD8, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD20, CD79, CD56, perforin and granzyme B.

It has similarity to the insulin receptor subfamily of kinases and is emerging as having increased pathologic and potential therapeutic importance in malignant disease. This gene was originally established as being implicated in the pathogenesis of rare diseases including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) and ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which is a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently the number of diseases in which ALK is implicated in their pathogenesis has increased. In 2007, an inversion of chromosome 2 involving ALK and a fusion partner gene in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer was discovered. In 2008, publications emerged implicating ALK in familial and sporadic cases of neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer of the sympatho-adrenal system. Chromosomal abnormalities involving ALK are translocations, amplifications or mutations. Chromosomal translocations are the longest recognised ALK genetic abnormality. When translocations occur a fusion gene is created between ALK and a gene partner. This has been described in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma in which ALK is fused to NPM (nucleolar protein gene) and in non-small cell lung cancer where ALK is fused to EML4 (Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein 4). The most frequently described partner genes in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour are tropomyosin 3/4 (TMP3/4), however in IMTs a diversity of ALK fusion partners have been found, with the ability to homodimerise a common characteristic. Point mutations and amplification of the ALK gene occur in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Therapeutic targeting of ALK fusion genes using tyrosine kinase inhibition, vaccination using an ALK specific antigen and treatment using viral vectors for RNAi are emerging potential therapeutic possibilities.",

Clinical follow-up was recorded.

The secreted IL-10 suppresses proliferation of normal immune, CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and enhances viability of the ALK+TCL cells. The Treg phenotype of the affected cells is strictly dependent on NPM/ALK expression and function as demonstrated by transfection of the kinase into BaF3 cells and inhibition of its enzymatic activity and expression in ALK+TCL cells. NPM/ALK, in turn, induces the phenotype through activation of its key signal transmitter, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).

More recently, however, a small number of B-lineage lymphomas have been reported to express ALK fusion genes. These tumors often exhibit a plasmablastic morphology, a finding which prompted our interest in looking for ALK fusions in plasma cell neoplasms. We studied 46 cases of extramedullary plasmacytoma by immunostaining with anti-ALK antibody and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using an ALK break-apart probe and found one case to be ALK protein-positive and demonstrated the disruption of the ALK gene in this case. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for CD138, VS38c, and epithelial membrane antigen, but lacked expression of CD20, CD79a, CD45, and CD30. Both RT-PCR and genomic DNA-PCR confirmed the CLTC-ALK fusion. This finding expands the lists of the ALK-positive tumors, and ALK-positive extramedullary plasmacytoma may benefit from the treatment of ALK inhibitor in the future.",

Thirty patients achieved complete response (CR, 65%) and the overall response rate was 76% (35/46).

In most of these tumors, the t(2;5)(p23;q35) generates the NPM-ALK fusion gene. However, several studies have now demonstrated that genes other than NPM may be fused to the ALK gene. We have recently described two different ALK rearrangements involving the TRK-fused gene (TFG) in which the same portion of ALK was fused to different length fragments of the 5' TFG region. These two rearrangements encoded chimeric proteins of 85 kd (TFG-ALK(S)) and 97 kd (TFG-ALK(L)), respectively. In this study, we have identified a new ALK rearrangement in which the catalytic domain of ALK was fused to a larger fragment of the TFG gene (TFG-ALK(XL)), encoding for a fusion protein of 113 kd. Genomic analysis of these three TFG-ALK rearrangements revealed that the TFG breakpoints occur at introns 3, 4, and 5, respectively, whereas the ALK breakpoints always occur in the same intron. No homologous regions or known recombination sequences were found in these regions. Transfection experiments using NIH-3T3 fibroblasts showed a similar transforming efficiency of TFG-ALK variants compared with NPM-ALK. In addition, in common with NPM-ALK, the TFG-ALK proteins formed stable complexes with the signaling proteins Grb2, Shc, and PLC-gamma. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the TFG may use a variety of intronic breakpoints in ALK rearrangements generating fusion proteins of different molecular weights, but with similar transforming potential than NPM-ALK.",

The constitutive activation of ALK fusion proteins leads to cellular transformation through a complex signaling network. To elucidate the ALK pathways sustaining lymphomagenesis and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the tyrosine-kinase protein profiles of ALK-positive cell lines using 2 complementary proteomic-based approaches, taking advantage of a specific ALK RNA interference (RNAi) or cell-permeable inhibitors. A well-defined set of ALK-associated tyrosine phosphopeptides, including metabolic enzymes, kinases, ribosomal and cytoskeletal proteins, was identified. Validation studies confirmed that vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC) associated with nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, and their phosphorylation required ALK activity. ATIC phosphorylation was documented in cell lines and primary tumors carrying ALK proteins and other tyrosine kinases, including TPR-Met and wild type c-Met. Functional analyses revealed that ALK-mediated ATIC phosphorylation enhanced its enzymatic activity, dampening the methotrexate-mediated transformylase activity inhibition. These findings demonstrate that proteomic approaches in well-controlled experimental settings allow the definition of informative proteomic profiles and the discovery of novel ALK downstream players that contribute to the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype. Prediction of tumor responses to methotrexate may justify specific molecular-based chemotherapy.",

With the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+) ALCL), the cure rate for PTCLs with CHOP is low, and limited evidence suggests that anthracyclines do not improve the prognosis. However, there is no compelling evidence that any other regimen or approach is superior. It remains challenging to compare alternative therapies or treatment strategies with CHOP because the majority of data are retrospective and include diverse patient populations. Recently, prospective studies have been initiated exclusively for PTCL, and in some, select histologic subtypes are evaluated in an effort to remove heterogeneity.

A 69-year-old Japanese male with a past history of malignant lymphoma of the cecum presented with progressive dyspnea and pleural effusion. Removal of the pleural effusion and aspiration of bone marrow were performed. May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain of the pleural fluid revealed abundant single or small aggregates of large-sized round cells. These cells had centrally-located large round to oval nuclei. The peculiar finding was the presence of pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections, and some neoplastic cells had eosinophilic pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections, which resembled \"flaming plasma cells\". Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the bone marrow demonstrated CD138(+), ALK1(+), CD20(-), CD79a(-), CD30(-), and IgA(+) large-sized neoplastic cells. Therefore, a diagnosis of ALK-positive LBCL was made. The peculiar finding of the present case was that most of the neoplastic cells had pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections, and some of them had eosinophilic pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections that resembled \"flaming plasma cells\", which has been recognized as the characteristic finding of IgA myeloma. Therefore, tumor cells that resembled \"flaming plasma cells\" in the pleural effusion may have had IgA in the cytoplasm.

The discovery of activating kinase domain mutations of the full-length ALK receptor as the major cause of hereditary neuroblastoma, and that somatically acquired mutations and amplification events often drive the malignant process in a subset of sporadic tumors, has established ALK as a tractable molecular target across histologically diverse tumors in which ALK is a critical mediator of oncogenesis. We are now uncovering the reexpression of this developmentally regulated protein in a broader subset of pediatric cancers, providing therapeutic targeting opportunities for diseases with shared molecular etiology.

Despite constitutive activation of the kinase through gene alterations, such as chromosomal translocation, gene amplification or mutation, treatments with kinase inhibitors invariably lead to the development of resistance. Aiming to develop new tools for ALK targeting, we took advantage of our previous demonstration identifying ALK as a dependence receptor, implying that in the absence of ligand the kinase-inactive ALK triggers or enhances apoptosis. Here, we synthesized peptides mimicking the proapoptotic domain of ALK and investigated their biological effects on tumor cells. We found that an ALK-derived peptide of 36 amino acids (P36) was cytotoxic for ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. In contrast, ALK-negative tumor cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were insensitive to P36. The cytotoxic effect was due to caspase-dependent apoptosis and required N-myristoylation of the peptide. Two P36-derived shorter peptides as well as a cyclic peptide also induced apoptosis. Surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry analysis of P36-interacting proteins from two responsive cell lines, Cost lymphoma and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, uncovered partners that could involve p53-dependent signaling and pre-mRNA splicing. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 rescued these cells from P36-induced apoptosis. Finally, we observed that a treatment combining P36 with the ALK-specific inhibitor crizotinib resulted in additive cytotoxicity. Therefore, ALK-derived peptides could represent a novel targeted therapy for ALK-positive tumors. ",

All patients were males aged 52, 59, and 78 years old; they had a solitary cutaneous tumor nodule. Their sites included the axilla, thigh, and shoulder. There was no extracutaneous involvement. Microscopically, the tumors were composed of small cells with irregular nuclei that were immunohistochemically positive for CD3, CD5, CD7, and CD30 and negative for B-cell markers; there was focal ALK-1 positivity in 1 case. Two cases had CD4+/CD8-phenotype, while the remaining one exhibited a CD4-/CD8+ immunoprofile. Fhedium to large CD30+ cells were rarely found scattered in the infiltrate. Monoclonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement was detected in 2 cases and rearrangement of IgH (lineage infidelity) was in one case. The tumors were surgically removed in all the patients. Two patients were alive and well 4 and 6 years after surgery, without evidence of cutaneous and extractaneous involvement (including the ALK+ patient). The third patient experienced several relapses of the skin tumor and developed axillary and inguinal lymph node involvement. Chemotherapy was performed and finally the patient underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation; he died 3 years after the original diagnosis due to acute graft-versus-host disease and sepsis.",

Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of phosphatase and tensin homology (PTEN) and phosphorylated S6 kinase (pS6K) as a response.;The objective response rate was 90% with CR (n = 17) and PR (n = 10). The CR rate was different among subtypes; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL, n = 3) had a CR whereas PTCL-not-otherwise specified and ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) patients showed 63% (12/19) and 29% (2/7) of CR rate, respectively. This difference in CR rate among subtypes was associated with PTEN loss because PTEN loss was not seen in AITL but 33% of ALCL patients. The most common toxicity was hematological, with 80% of patients experiencing at least one event of grade 3/4 neutropenia, and 60% of patients had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.;The everolimus plus CHOP was effective for PTCL patients, and its efficacy might be related with the preservation of PTEN.",

Since peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified retain the full expression program required for functioning T-cell receptor signaling, the differential expression of a subset of these markers might be of diagnostic utility in distinguishing peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified from the entire group of CD30(+) lymphoproliferations.",

Hodgkin's disease (HD) is a malignant lymphoma characterized by large multinucleated tumour cells, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H&RS) cells, surrounded by a dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Our group recently demonstrated NPM/ALK fusion cDNAs by single-cell RT-PCR in < 3% of CD30+ tumour cells in 2/9 cases of HD. To further delineate the relevance of this finding for HD, we studied the occurrence of NPM/ALK fusion genes in peripheral blood cells of healthy donors by RT-PCR. NPM/ALK fusion cDNAs were found by RT-PCR in 14/29 healthy individuals and confirmed by hybridization with a breakpoint-specific oligonucleotide. Due to the low rate of NPM/ALK-positive cells in the peripheral blood of positive individuals, an assignment to a defined cellular subpopulation was not possible. We conclude that NPM/ALK fusion genes are present in peripheral blood cells of healthy donors. After t(14;18) and t(9;22), t(2;5) represents the third example of tumour-associated translocation products in blood cells of apparently healthy donors.

NPM/ALK activates several signal transduction pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, mTORC1, STAT3, and STAT5b. In turn, the pathways modulate expression and function of many genes and proteins involved in the key cellular functions such as proliferation, growth, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis. Recent data indicate that NPM/ALK also promotes immune evasion of the ALK(+)TCL by inducing through STAT3 activation the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFss) and cell surface protein CD274 (PD-L1, B7-H1). In addition, NPM/ALK protects its own expression by mediating via STAT3 and at least one member of the DNA methyltransferase family DNMT1 epigenetic silencing of the SHP-1 and STAT5a genes. In ALK+TCL cells, SHP-1 and STAT5a proteins act as potent tumor suppressors by promoting degradation of the NPM/ALK protein and inhibiting expression of the NPM/ALK gene, respectively. These findings provide further rationale to therapeutically target ALK and its effector proteins, foremost STAT3. They also suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches to ALK(+)TCL and, possibly, other ALK-driven malignancies may require inhibition of ALK and STAT3 to achieve the optimal clinical efficacy.",

It will be published in two parts : the first is focused on the three more frequent entities, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The second (which will appear in the november issue) will describe other subtypes less frequent and of poor prognosis : extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. T or NK cell lymphoproliferative disorders with leukemic presentation, primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and very rare subtypes of PTCL whose prevalence is less than 5% (hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma) will not be discussed herein.

These translocations lead to the synthesis of novel chimeric proteins that retain the C-terminal portion of ALK, where the tyrosine kinase domain is located. In most of these tumors, the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation causes fusion of the ALK gene to the 5' region of the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene, but other different ALK partners have been identified, including nonmuscle tropomyosin (TPM3), TRK-fused gene (TFG), 5' aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltranferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTC), and moesin (MSN). The characterization of these ALK partners has been performed using different molecular methods, including the 5' Rapid Amplification of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) Ends (5'RACE) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. This approach allows the potential amplification and identification of either 5' or 3' mRNA ends from an internal known sequence. In ALK translocations, identification of the 5' gene involved has been performed using primers designed within the known 3' catalytic domain of the ALK. Initial reaction consists in a first-strand cDNA synthesis primed using a gene-specific antisense primer (ALK1), performing the cDNA conversion of specific messenger ribonucleic acids, and maximizing the potential for complete extension to the 5'-end of the message. After cDNA synthesis, the first-strand product is purified from unincorporated dNTPs and ALK1. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is used to add homopolymeric tails to the 3' ends of the cDNA. Tailed cDNA is then amplified by PCR using a nested gene-specific primer (ALK2), which anneals 3' to ALK1, and a complementary homopolymer containing an anchor primer (i.e., AAP), which permits amplification from the homopolymeric tail. This allows amplification of unknown sequences between the ALK2 and the 5' end of the mRNA. Further, nested PCRs usually are required to confer an adequate level of specificity to the process to permit the characterization of RACE products. The reamplification is achieved by using a nested gene-specific primer (ALK3), which anneals 3' to ALK2, and a universal amplification primer, which anneals to the 5' sequence previously introduced by the AAP primer.",

NPM/ALK encodes a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that belongs to the family of tyrosine kinases activated by chromosomal translocation. Our studies show that NPM/ALK, similar to other members of this family, activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and that this activation is essential for lymphomagenesis. NPM/ALK-mediated activation of STAT5 was demonstrated by detection of: (a) constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced DNA binding ability of STAT5 in NPM/ALK-transformed cells; and (b) NPM/ALK-dependent stimulation of STAT5-mediated transactivation of the beta-casein promoter. Retroviral infection of NPM/ALK+ cells with a dominant-negative STAT5B mutant (STAT5-DNM) inhibited the antiapoptotic activity of NPM/ALK in growth factor and serum-free medium. In addition, STAT5-DNM inhibited proliferation and diminished the clonogenic properties of NPM/ALK-positive cells. Finally, SCID mice injected with NPM/ALK+ cells infected with a virus carrying STAT5-DNM survived significantly longer than mice inoculated with NPM/ALK+ cells infected with the empty virus. Necropsy identified a widespread ALK+ lymphoma in lymph nodes and liver of the affected animals.

However, this is a rare occurrence with no more than a hundred cases reported in the literature. The purpose of this multicenter study is to describe the characteristics and to identify prognostic factors in patients with HIV-associated PTCL. Data from HIV-positive patients with a pathological diagnosis of non-primary cutaneous, non-leukemic PTCL were gathered retrospectively and are reported using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were also performed. Fifty one patients were included in our analysis. Median age was 38 years with a 5:1 male-to-female ratio. Patients presented with a median CD4(+) count of 173 cells mm⁻³, and a median HIV viral load of 334,787 copies ml⁻¹. The median time from HIV diagnosis to PTCL diagnosis was 4.5 years. About 75% of patients presented with advanced clinical stage and 66% with B symptoms. The most common subtypes were PTCLU (61%) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 22%). None of the ALCL patients tested expressed ALK. The median overall survival (OS) for the group was 12 months. In the multivariate survival analysis, the use of HAART and patients' performance status were independently associated with OS. HIV-associated PTCL presents predominantly in young men with low CD4(+) counts and high HIV viral loads. Both HIV-related and lymphoma-related factors were associated with OS.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the physiology of development is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Our observations could have important implications in the therapy of ALK-positive tumors harboring the chimeric or wild type ALK protein.",

This distinct disease entity is typically associated with an aggressive clinical course and appears in light microscopic preparations as a monomorphic population of large, immunoblast-like cells. In this report, we describe a case of ALK+ LBCL diagnosed by transgastric endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA) of splenic hilar lymph nodes. Modified Giemsa stained direct smears from the FNA sample demonstrated large lesional cells with foamy cytoplasm and macronucleoli admixed with small lymphocytes in tigroid backgrounds, mimicking the cytologic appearance of seminoma. Ancillary immunohistochemical studies subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of ALK+ LBCL with the lesional cells being immunoreactive for CD138, VS38c, MUM1, ALK1, and lambda light chain. The cohesiveness of the cells, the cellular morphology, and the tigroid backgrounds were all pitfalls for accurate diagnosis of this rare specific type of lymphoid malignancy by cytology. To our knowledge this is the first case report detailing the diagnosis of ALK+ LBCL by EUS FNA and the first report describing a glycogen-rich tigroid background in direct FNA smears. Establishing a refined diagnosis in cases of this rare form of LBCL is necessary, as therapies targeting ALK may be of value in clinical management. Diagn.

        "Doc_abstract":"Nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase-expressing (NPM-ALK+) T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive form of cancer that commonly affects children and adolescents. The expression of NPM-ALK chimeric oncogene results from the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) that causes the fusion of the ALK and NPM genes. This translocation generates the NPM-ALK protein tyrosine kinase that forms the constitutively activated NPM-ALK/NPM-ALK homodimers. In addition, NPM-ALK is structurally associated with wild-type NPM to form NPM/NPM-ALK heterodimers, which can translocate to the nucleus. The mechanisms that sustain the stability of NPM-ALK are not fully understood. SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification that is characterized by the reversible conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) with target proteins. SUMO competes with ubiquitin for substrate binding and therefore, SUMOylation is believed to protect target proteins from proteasomal degradation. Moreover, SUMOylation contributes to the subcellular distribution of target proteins. Herein, we found that the SUMOylation pathway is deregulated in NPM-ALK+ T-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary lymphoma tumors from patients. We also identified Lys24 and Lys32 within the NPM domain as the sites where NPM-ALK conjugates with SUMO-1 and SUMO-3. Importantly, antagonizing SUMOylation by the SENP1 protease decreased the accumulation of NPM-ALK and suppressed lymphoma cell viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent colony formation. One possible mechanism for the SENP1-mediated decrease in NPM-ALK levels was the increase in NPM-ALK association with ubiquitin, which facilitates its degradation. Our findings propose a model in which aberrancies in SUMOylation contribute to the pathogenesis of NPM-ALK+ T-cell lymphoma. Unraveling such pathogenic mechanisms may lead to devising novel strategies to eliminate this aggressive neoplasm.",

These ALK gene rearrangements are present in 3-5 % of NSCLC patients, typically younger, never or light smokers with adenocarcinomas. Crizotinib is a first-in-class ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity in ALK-positive NSCLC that received accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC in 2011, just 4 years after identification of ALK rearrangements in this setting. Subsequently, two phase III trials have shown crizotinib to have a tolerable toxicity profile and to be superior to standard chemotherapy for the first- or second-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive lung cancer and numerous countries have approved its use. Despite initial responses, acquired resistance to crizotinib invariably leads to disease progression. Mechanisms of resistance have been described to include ALK tyrosine kinase mutations, activation of bypass signalling pathways and pharmacokinetic failure of crizotinib. Several next-generation ALK inhibitors, including ceritinib and alectinib, are in clinical development and show efficacy in both the crizotinib naïve and crizotinib refractory settings.

Aberrant ALK fusion proteins were also generated in inflammatory fibrosarcoma and a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers, and these proteins are implicated in their pathogenesis. Recently, ALK has been demonstrated to be constitutively activated by gene mutations and/or amplifications in sporadic as well as familial cases of neuroblastoma. Here we describe another mechanism of aberrant ALK activation observed in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line (NB-1), in which a short-form ALK protein (ALK(del2-3)) having a truncated extracellular domain is overexpressed because of amplification of an abnormal ALK gene that lacks exons 2 and 3. ALK(del2-3) was autophosphorylated in NB-1 cells as well as in ALK(del2-3)-transduced cells and exhibited enhanced in vitro kinase activity compared with the wild-type kinase. ALK(del2-3)-transduced NIH3T3 cells exhibited increased colony-forming capacity in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. RNAi-mediated ALK knockdown resulted in the growth suppression of ALK(del2-3)-expressing cells, arguing for the oncogenic role of this mutant. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of deregulation of the ALK kinase and its roles in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Numerous molecular abnormalities have been described in lymphomas. They are of diagnostic and prognostic value and are taken into account for the WHO classification of these tumors. They also shed some light on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in lymphomas. Overall, four types of molecular abnormalities are involved: mutations, translocations, amplifications and deletions of tumor suppressor genes. Several techniques are available to detect these molecular anomalies: conventional cytogenetic analysis, multicolor FISH, CGH array or gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays. In some lymphomas, genetic abnormalities are responsible for the expression of an abnormal protein (e.g. tyrosine-kinase, transcription factor) detectable by immunohistochemistry. In the present review, molecular abnormalities observed in the most frequent B, T or NK cell lymphomas are discussed. In the broad spectrum of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas microarray analysis shows mostly two subgroups of tumors, one with gene expression signature corresponding to germinal center B-cell-like (GCB: CD10+, BCL6 [B-Cell Lymphoma 6]+, centerine+, MUM1-) and a subgroup expressing an activated B-cell-like signature (ABC: CD10-, BCL6-, centerine-, MUM1+). Among other B-cell lymphomas with well characterized molecular abnormalies are follicular lymphoma (BCL2 deregulation), MALT lymphoma (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) [API2-MALT1 (mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-lymphoma-translocation-gene1) fusion protein or deregulation BCL10, MALT1, FOXP1. MALT1 transcription factors], mantle cell lymphoma (cycline D1 [CCND1] overexpression) and Burkitt lymphoma (c-Myc expression). Except for ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, well characterized molecular anomalies are rare in lymphomas developed from T or NK cells. Peripheral T cell lymphomas not otherwise specified are a heterogeneous group of tumors with frequent but not recurrent molecular abnormalities. Gene profiling analysis shows that the expression of several genes is deregulated including PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) gene, encoding a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. In angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphomas molecular abnormalities are found in follicular helper T-cell (TFH) that express some distinctive markers such as CD10, PD-1, CXCR5 and the CXCL13 chemokine. ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a paradigme of T-cell lymphoma since it is associated with an X-ALK oncogenic fusion protein due to a translocation involving ALK gene at 2p23. ALK tyrosine kinase activates downstream pathways (Stat3/5b, Src kinases, PLCγ, PI3 kinase) implicated in lymphomagenesis, proliferation and protection against apoptosis. Specific ALK inhibitors are currently in clinical evaluation. Lastly several lymphomas are associated with infectious agents that play a direct (EB virus, HTLV1) or indirect role (e.g. Helicobacter pylori in MALT lymphoma) in lymphomagenesis.",

Consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been reported to improve progression-free survival. However, these studies have not compared consolidative ASCT with active observation in patients with PTCL achieving first complete remission (CR1) following induction chemotherapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of PTCL patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2014. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, concurrent B cell lymphomas, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-positive ALCL) were excluded from the study. We compared progression-free survival for patients who underwent ASCT in CR1 following CHOP-like induction regimens and patients who underwent active observation during CR1. 48 patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and underwent either active observation (28 patients) or consolidative ASCT (20 patients) in CR1. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the observation and ASCT groups was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30-67%) and 46% (95% CI: 23-67%), respectively (P = 0.55). Median progression-free survival in the observation and ASCT groups was 15.8 and 12.8 months, respectively (log rank, P = 0.79). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival in the observation and ASCT groups was 37 and 41%, respectively. In conclusion, for PTCL patients achieving CR1 following CHOP-like induction chemotherapy, ASCT does not appear to improve progression-free survival compared to active observation.

Using a functional proteomic approach, we determined the identity of proteins that interact with the ALK tyrosine kinase by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ALK antibody, followed by electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A total of 46 proteins were identified as unique to the ALK immunocomplex using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, while 11 proteins were identified in the NPM immunocomplex. Previously reported proteins in the ALK signal pathway were identified including PI3-K, Jak2, Jak3, Stat3, Grb2, IRS, and PLCgamma1. More importantly, many proteins previously not recognized to be associated with NPM-ALK, but with potential NPM-ALK interacting protein domains, were identified. These include adaptor molecules (SOCS, Rho-GTPase activating protein, RAB35), kinases (MEK kinase 1 and 4, PKC, MLCK, cyclin G-associated kinase, EphA1, JNK kinase, MAP kinase 1), phosphatases (meprin, PTPK, protein phosphatase 2 subunit), and heat shock proteins (Hsp60 precursor).

In general, the ALK catalytic domain is rearranged and fused to a dimerization domain encoded by an unrelated gene. Less frequently, full-length ALK is activated by point mutations. The common theme is unregulated firing of ALK downstream signalling, leading to uncontrolled cell division and increased cell survival. ALK-driven tumors can be treated with Crizotinib, an orally available dual ALK/MET inhibitor, currently approved for advanced ALK-positive NSCLCs. Crizotinib-treated patients achieve high response rates, with an excellent toxicity profile. However, drug-resistant disease often develops, particularly in NSCLC patients. The processes leading to drug resistance include both ALK-dependent (point mutations or gene amplification), as well as ALK-independent mechanisms, which are here briefly discussed. Recently, Ceritinib has been approved for Crizotinib-refractory NSCLC, further extending patients' survival, but resistance again emerged. Novel ALK kinase inhibitors are currently under clinical development, showing great promise for improved efficacy in drug-resistance disease. It is opinion of the author that drug-resistance is likely to arise under any treatment, due to intrinsic heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer. To prevent or delay this phenomenon, we need to treat less advanced disease, with drugs that are rapidly effective in order not to allow enough time for tumor evolution, and we want to have more and more drugs with non-overlapping resistance profiles, for subsequent lines of targeted therapy. Finally, the use of drug combinations may exponentially decrease the chances of resistance. ",

Similarly to other B human lymphomas, ALK+ lymphomas express the Cbp/PAG adaptor protein and the non-receptor Lyn kinase in the plasma membrane. In the majority of human lymphomas, the Cbp/PAG adaptor and the Lyn kinase constitute an oncogenic signalosome that serves as a membrane anchor for other signaling enzymes and transcription factors. We show that ALK+ lymphoma membranes harbor sphingolipid-rich microdomains (rafts) in which Lyn is poorly active. However, Lyn activity and consequently Cbp/PAG tyrosine phosphorylation can be restored by extracting sphingolipids from ALK+ lymphoma plasma membranes. In the membrane environment of ALK+ lymphoma rafts, where the glycosphingolipid to signaling protein ratio is higher than in B-NHL rafts, the Lyn activity is suboptimal and does not allow the formation of an efficient Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome.",

Consistent with increased G0/G1 to S-phase transition, there is also marked up-regulation of cyclin A and cyclin D1 expression. In addition, p80 transformed cells showed elevated expression of several immediate early genes involved in cellular proliferation, including fos, jun, and c-myc. DNA binding analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from p80 transformed cells reveal marked up-regulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity. Functional AP-1-specific transfection assays also show up-regulation of AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation. These finding demonstrate that p80 transformed rat 1a fibroblast can be a highly useful model system for the molecular and biochemical characterization of the mechanisms of action of this interesting new oncogene.",

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of its expression among inflammatory pseudotumors, and to characterize the clinicopathologic features of the positive cases. Sixty-one cases of inflammatory pseudotumors were retrieved from the surgical pathology archives and consultation files. Paraffin sections were immunostained with the antibody ALK1. The patients ranged in age from 0.5 to 79 years (median age, 50 years), with 10 patients (16.4%) younger than 20 years. Five cases (8.2%) were ALK+, including two of six urogenital inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, none of eight pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors, three (one adrenal, one small bowel, one liver) of 31 extrapulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors, none of nine hepatic/splenic inflammatory pseudotumors expressing follicular dendritic cell markers and harboring Epstein-Barr virus, and none of seven inflammatory pseudotumors of the lymph node. When only those patients 40 years or younger were considered, the ALK positivity rate became 21.7% (five of 23). All five ALK+ cases occurred in young patients aged 0.5 to 37 years, who were alive and well at 3.5 to 17 years. The tumors exhibited a spectrum of histologic features typical of inflammatory pseudotumors/myofibroblastic tumors, but there was at least focal nuclear atypia. Immunostaining for ALK produced fibrillary or granular cytoplasmic staining in the neoplastic cells, sometimes with cell membrane accentuation. This study confirms that ALK is implicated in a proportion of inflammatory pseudotumors, and is generally associated with a favorable outcome. The results also support the heterogeneity of inflammatory pseudotumors, with the follicular dendritic cell/Epstein-Barr virus-positive cases and those occurring in lymph nodes representing different biologic entities.",

Tandem affinity purification is a recently developed method that carries a lower background and higher sensitivity compared with the conventional immunoprecipitation-based protein purification protocols.

Historically, PTCL was treated like aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and to date cyclophosphamide, prednisone, vincristine, and doxorubicin (CHOP) remains the most commonly used regimen, despite disappointing results. Given the poor outcomes of PTCL patients, a number of studies have investigated the role of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in the upfront setting, with different results. However, there are no prospective randomized trials, and the clinical benefit appears to be restricted to patients who achieve an objective response after induction chemotherapy. Nevertheless, with the exception of low-risk ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in light of the available data, HDT/ASCT for consolidation should be recommended for patients deemed eligible. The results of phase II trials showed that allogeneic stem cell transplantation can cure some relapsed/refractory patients, and few studies have evaluated this strategy in the frontline setting.

In this study, we focused on the rat developing dorsal root ganglion (DRG). This ganglion is composed of heterogeneous sensory neurons characterized by the expression of RTK for neurotrophic factors, such as the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA or the glial-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor Ret, which are specifically detected in nociceptive neurons. In DRG, ALK expression reached a maximum around birth. We showed that ALK is specifically present in a subtype of neurons during DRG development, and that the majority of these neurons co-expressed TrkA and Ret. Interestingly, we identified only one form (220 kDa) of ALK in DRG neurons both in vivo and in vitro. On the opposite, in transfected cells as well as in brain extracts, ALK was identified as two forms (220 and 140 kDa). The DRG is composed of neurons and glial cells, principally satellite Schwann cells. Thus, we hypothesized that the presence of satellite Schwann cells was involved in the absence of truncated ALK. Using two different cell types, HEK293 cells stably expressing ALK, and MSC80 cells, a previously described Schwann cell line, we showed that a factor secreted by the Schwann cells is likely involved in the absence of ALK cleavage. All these data hence open new perspectives concerning the role of ALK in the specification of nociceptive DRG neurons and in the neurons-Schwann cells interaction.",

Furthermore, MK stimulates ALK phosphorylation in WI-38 human fibroblasts and activates PI3-kinase and MAP kinase signal transduction in WI-38, HUVEC, neuroblastoma (SH SY-5Y) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells that express the ALK protein. We conclude that MK can act as a growth, survival, and angiogenic factor during tumorigenesis and signals through the ALK receptor.",

In B-cell lymphomas, HSP90 was moderately to strongly expressed in all cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (5/5, 100%), and in subsets of follicular lymphoma (17/28, 61%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (27/46, 59%), nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (6/16, 38%), plasma cell neoplasms (14/39, 36%), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3/9, 33%), mantle cell lymphoma (12/38, 32%) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (3/10, 30%). HSP90 was weakly expressed in six of 14 (43%) cases of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.

Recently, some investigators including us asserted that these p80NPM/ALK or ALK1-positive(p80/ALK+) ALCLs represent a distinct genetic entity with occurrence in young patients and a favorable prognosis, and should be differentiated from the p80/ALK- tumors with the relatively aggressive clinical course. The p80/ALK+ lymphomas also revealed the characteristic morphology such as horseshoe-like, kidney-like or doughnut-like nuclei and frequent expression of EMA and cytotoxic molecules. However, these features are shared, though to a lesser degree, by other p80/ALK-negative lymphoid neoplasms. Indeed, it is indicated that cytotoxic ALCL cases may be either p80/ALK positive or negative, suggesting that the cytotoxicity and expression of p80/ALK are independent phenomena among the cases of ALCL of T- and null-cell type.

In this study, the interactions of the three binding sites in NPM-ALK with the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of SNT-2 were analyzed. First, by isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that the phosphorylation-independent binding site in NPM-ALK interacts with the SNT-2 PTB domain more tightly than the phosphorylation-dependent binding sites. Second, the solution structure of the SNT-2 PTB domain in complex with the nonphosphorylated NPM-ALK peptide was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The NPM-ALK peptide interacts with the hydrophobic surface of the PTB domain and intermolecularly extends the PTB beta-sheet. This interaction mode is much broader and more extensive than those of the phosphorylation-dependent binding sites. Our results indicate that the higher binding activity of the phosphorylation-independent binding site is caused by additional hydrophobic interactions.",

Such rearrangements juxtapose the intracellular domain of ALK to 5'-end sequences belonging to different genes and create transforming fusion proteins. To understand how the oncogenic versions of ALK contribute to lymphomagenesis, it is important to analyze the biological effects and the biochemical properties of this receptor under controlled conditions of activation. To this aim, we constructed chimeric receptor molecules in which the extracellular domain of the ALK kinase is replaced by the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Upon transfection in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the EGFR/ALK chimera was correctly synthesized and transported to the cell surface, where it was fully functional in forming high versus low affinity EGF-binding sites and transducing an EGF-dependent signal intracellularly. Overexpression of the EGFR/ALK chimera in NIH 3T3 was sufficient to induce the malignant phenotype; the appearance of the transformed phenotype was, however, conditionally dependent on the administration of EGF. Moreover, the EGFR/ALK chimera was significantly more active in inducing transformation and DNA synthesis than the wild type EGFR when either was expressed at similar levels in NIH 3T3 cells. Comparative analysis of the biochemical pathways implicated in the transduction of mitogenic signals did not show any increased ability of the EGFR/ALK to phosphorylate PLC-gamma and MAPK compared with the EGFR. On the contrary, EGFR/ALK showed to have a consistently greater effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity compared with the EGFR, indicating that this enzyme plays a major role in mediating the mitogenic effects of ALK in NIH 3T3 cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired resistance to ceritinib is not well defined. This study set out to clarify the mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end, ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib. H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway activation. Further, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the sensitivity to ceritinib.;This study proposes a preclinical rationale to use ALK-TKIs and afatinib combination therapy for ALK- translocated lung cancers that have acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs through EGFR pathway activation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"NPM/ALK is an oncogenic fusion protein expressed in approximately 50% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases. It derives from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation that fuses the catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), with the dimerization domain of the ubiquitously expressed nucleophosmin (NPM) protein. Dimerization of the ALK kinase domain leads to its autophosphorylation and constitutive activation. Activated NPM/ALK stimulates downstream survival and proliferation signaling pathways leading to malignant transformation. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of autoactivation of the catalytic domain of ALK. Because kinases are typically regulated by autophosphorylation of their activation loops, we systematically mutated (Tyr --> Phe) three potential autophosphorylation sites contained in the \"YXXXYY\" motif of the ALK activation loop, and determined the effect of these mutations on the catalytic activity and biological function of NPM/ALK. We observed that mutation of both the second and third tyrosine residues (YFF mutant) did not affect the kinase activity or transforming ability of NPM/ALK. In contrast, mutation of the first and second (FFY), first and third (FYF), or all three (FFF) tyrosine residues impaired both kinase activity and transforming ability of NPM/ALK. Furthermore, a DFF mutant, in which the aspartic residue introduces a negative charge similar to a phosphorylated tyrosine, possessed catalytic activity similar to the YFF mutant. Together, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of the first tyrosine of the YXXXYY motif is necessary for the autoactivation of the ALK kinase domain and the transforming activity of NPM/ALK.",

Our goal was to evaluate the significance of overall ALK activation in neuroblastoma. Expression of phosphorylated ALK, ALK, and its putative ligands, pleiotrophin and midkine, was screened in 289 neuroblastomas and 56 paired normal tissues. ALK was expressed in 99% of tumors and phosphorylated in 48% of cases. Pleiotrophin and midkine were expressed in 58% and 79% of tumors, respectively. ALK activation was significantly higher in tumors than in paired normal tissues, together with ALK and midkine expression. ALK activation was largely independent of mutations and correlated with midkine expression in tumors. ALK activation in tumors was associated with favorable features, including a younger age at diagnosis, hyperdiploidy, and detection by mass screening. Antitumor activity of the ALK inhibitor TAE684 was evaluated in wild-type or mutated ALK neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts. TAE684 was cytotoxic in vitro in all cell lines, especially those harboring an ALK mutation. TAE684 efficiently inhibited ALK phosphorylation in vivo in both F1174I and R1275Q xenografts but demonstrated antitumor activity only against the R1275Q xenograft. In conclusion, ALK activation occurs frequently during neuroblastoma oncogenesis, mainly through mutation-independent mechanisms. However, ALK activation is not associated with a poor outcome and is not always a driver of cell proliferation and/or survival in neuroblastoma. ",

It usually occurs sporadically but familial cases are observed, with a subset of cases occurring in association with congenital malformations of the neural crest being linked to germline mutations of the PHOX2B gene. Here we conducted genome-wide comparative genomic hybridization analysis on a large series of neuroblastomas. Copy number increase at the locus encoding the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase receptor was observed recurrently. One particularly informative case presented a high-level gene amplification that was strictly limited to ALK, indicating that this gene may contribute on its own to neuroblastoma development. Through subsequent direct sequencing of cell lines and primary tumour DNAs we identified somatic mutations of the ALK kinase domain that mainly clustered in two hotspots. Germline mutations were observed in two neuroblastoma families, indicating that ALK is a neuroblastoma predisposition gene. Mutated ALK proteins were overexpressed, hyperphosphorylated and showed constitutive kinase activity. The knockdown of ALK expression in ALK-mutated cells, but also in cell lines overexpressing a wild-type ALK, led to a marked decrease of cell proliferation. Altogether, these data identify ALK as a critical player in neuroblastoma development that may hence represent a very attractive therapeutic target in this disease that is still frequently fatal with current treatments.",

Here we show that germline mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene explain most hereditary neuroblastomas, and that activating mutations can also be somatically acquired. We first identified a significant linkage signal at chromosome bands 2p23-24 using a whole-genome scan in neuroblastoma pedigrees. Resequencing of regional candidate genes identified three separate germline missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK that segregated with the disease in eight separate families. Resequencing in 194 high-risk neuroblastoma samples showed somatically acquired mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in 12.4% of samples. Nine of the ten mutations map to critical regions of the kinase domain and were predicted, with high probability, to be oncogenic drivers. Mutations resulted in constitutive phosphorylation, and targeted knockdown of ALK messenger RNA resulted in profound inhibition of growth in all cell lines harbouring mutant or amplified ALK, as well as in two out of six wild-type cell lines for ALK.

We evaluated ALK status in NSCLC with a novel ALK mRNA test based on the break-apart FISH concept, which we called break-apart transcript (BAT) test. ALK5' and ALK3' transcript patterns were established with qPCR for ALK-expressing controls including fusion-negative neuroblastomas, as well as fusion-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas and NSCLC. The BAT test was evaluated on 271 RNA samples from routinely processed paraffin NSCLC tissues. Test results were compared with ALK FISH (n=121), immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (n=86), and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA, n=83). On the basis of the nonoverlapping ALK BAT patterns in ALK-expressing controls (P<0.0001), 8/174 adenocarcinomas (4.6%) among 259 informative NSCLC were predicted as fusion positive. Overall concordance for paired method results was high (94.1% to 98.8%) but mainly concerned negative prediction because of the limited availability of positive-matched cases. Tumors with 100% cytoplasmic IHC staining of any intensity (n=3) were positive for AQUA, FISH, and BAT test; tumors with lower IHC positivity and different staining patterns were AQUA-negative. Upon multiple reevaluations, ALK gene status was considered as originally misinterpreted by FISH in 3/121 cases (2.5%). Tumors with >4 ALK gene copies were associated with longer overall survival upon first-line chemotherapy. In conclusion, application of the ALK BAT test on routinely processed NSCLC tissues yields the same fusion partner independent information as ALK break-apart FISH but is more robust and cost-effective. The BAT concept may be considered for the development of further drug-predictive translocation tests. ",

Recently, activating mutations of the ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) RTK (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase) gene have been described in neuroblastoma. A meta-analysis of neuroblastoma cases revealed that ALK mutations (49 of 709 cases) in relation to genomic subtype were most frequently observed in MYCN amplified tumours (8.9%), correlating with a poor clinical outcome. MYCN proteins target proliferation and apoptotic pathways, and have an important role in the progression of neuroblastoma. Here, we show that both wild-type and gain-of-function mutants in ALK are able to stimulate transcription at the MYCN promoter and initiate mRNA transcription of the MYCN gene in both neuronal and neuroblastoma cell lines. Further, this stimulation of MYCN gene transcription and de novo MYCN protein expression is abrogated by specific ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib (PF-2341066), NVP-TAE684, and by small interfering RNA to ALK resulting in a decrease in proliferation rate. Finally, co-transfection of ALK gain-of-function mutations together with MYCN leads to an increase in transformation potential.

        "Doc_abstract":"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a neoplasm composed of myofibroblastic spindle cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Cytogenetic analyses have revealed that a subgroup of IMT, in particular among children and young adults, harbors clonal chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome band 2p23. Further, molecular genetic studies have shown that these rearrangements target the ALK gene, serving as the 3'-partner in fusion genes with various translocation partners. In the present study, we describe the finding of a novel SEC31L1/ALK fusion gene in an intraabdominal IMT of a young man. G-band analysis revealed a translocation t(2;4)(p23;q21) and subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization with locus-specific probes strongly indicated disruption of the ALK locus on chromosome 2. Immunostaining with monoclonal mouse anti-human CD246 ALK Protein showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity. Using reverse primers for the ALK-gene, we could, by 5'-RACE methodology, amplify a single 1.2 kb fragment. Sequence analysis showed that the fragment was a hybrid cDNA product in which nt 3012 of SEC31L1 (NM_016211), located in band 4q21, was fused in-frame to nt 4080 of ALK (NM_004304). RT-PCR with two sets of primer pairs specific for SEC31L1 and ALK amplified two transcripts, which at sequencing corresponded to two types of chimeric SEC31L1/ALK transcripts. In the long, type I, transcript nt 3012 of SEC31L1 (NM_016211) was fused in-frame to nt 4080 of ALK. In the short, type II, transcript nt 2670 of SEC31L1 was fused in-frame to nt 4080 of ALK. Genomic PCR and subsequent sequencing showed that the breakpoints were located in intron 23 of SEC31L1 and intron 20 of ALK.",

Here, we demonstrate proof-of-principle for a novel and inexpensive assay for ALK inhibitor activity and identification in zebrafish. We demonstrate that the human oncogenic ALK fusion, NPM-ALK, drives overproduction of iridophores, a highly visible, shiny pigment cell-type in zebrafish. Treatment with the potent ALK inhibitor, TAE684, fully inhibits production of ALK-dependent iridophores. Using our assay, we test multiple properties of TAE684 in vivo, including efficacy, specificity, and toxicity. We note that TAE684 also inhibits the closely related leukocyte tyrosine kinase (Ltk) that is required for endogenous iridophore development. Similar effects are observed with an independent inhibitor, Crizotinib. Our assay can thus be utilized to identify ALK or LTK inhibitors. Importantly, the natural reflectivity of iridophores lends itself to automation for high throughput assessment of ALK and LTK inhibitor compounds in vivo.",

The crizotinib-resistant DFCI076 cell line harbored a unique L1152R ALK secondary mutation and was also resistant to the structurally unrelated ALK TKI TAE684. Although the DFCI076 cell line was still partially dependent on ALK for survival, it also contained concurrent coactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. In contrast, the TAE684-resistant (TR3) H3122 cell line did not contain an ALK secondary mutation but instead harbored coactivation of EGFR signaling. Dual inhibition of both ALK and EGFR was the most effective therapeutic strategy for the DFCI076 and H3122 TR3 cell lines. We further identified a subset (3/50; 6%) of treatment naive NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements that also had concurrent EGFR activating mutations. Our studies identify resistance mechanisms to ALK TKIs mediated by both ALK and by a bypass signaling pathway mediated by EGFR.

Currently 50% of PTCL cases are not classifiable: PTCL-not otherwise specified (NOS). Gene-expression profiles on 372 PTCL cases were analyzed and robust molecular classifiers and oncogenic pathways that reflect the pathobiology of tumor cells and their microenvironment were identified for major PTCL-entities, including 114 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 31 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive and 48 ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 14 adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and 44 extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma that were further separated into NK-cell and gdT-cell lymphomas. Thirty-seven percent of morphologically diagnosed PTCL-NOS cases were reclassified into other specific subtypes by molecular signatures. Reexamination, immunohistochemistry, and IDH2 mutation analysis in reclassified cases supported the validity of the reclassification. Two major molecular subgroups can be identified in the remaining PTCL-NOS cases characterized by high expression of either GATA3 (33%; 40/121) or TBX21 (49%; 59/121). The GATA3 subgroup was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P = .01). High expression of cytotoxic gene-signature within the TBX21 subgroup also showed poor clinical outcome (P = .05). In AITL, high expression of several signatures associated with the tumor microenvironment was significantly associated with outcome. A combined prognostic score was predictive of survival in an independent cohort (P = .004). ",

Although genetic studies have identified copy number alteration and nonsynonymous mutations of ALK, the regulatory mechanism of ALK signalling at protein levels is largely elusive. Neuronal leucine-rich repeat 1 (NLRR1) is a type 1 transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in unfavourable NB and potentially influences receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. Here, we showed that NLRR1 and ALK exhibited a mutually exclusive expression pattern in primary NB tissues by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, dorsal root ganglia of Nlrr1+/+ and Nlrr1-/- mice displayed the opposite expression patterns of Nlrr1 and Alk. Of interest, NLRR1 physically interacted with ALK in vitro through its extracellular region. Notably, the NLRR1 ectodomain impaired ALK phosphorylation and proliferation of ALK-mutated NB cells. A newly identified cleavage of the NLRR1 ectodomain also supported NLRR1-mediated ALK signal regulation in trans. Thus, we conclude that NLRR1 appears to be an extracellular negative regulator of ALK signalling in NB and neuronal development. Our findings may be beneficial to comprehend NB heterogeneity and to develop a novel therapy against unfavourable NB. ",

The pattern of chemokine receptor expression in T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma has not been previously studied. Using a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of the Th1-associated chemokine receptor CXCR3 in 141 patients with T-cell lymphoma, and we studied the receptors CCR4 and CCR5 and some of their ligands in a subset of these tumors. Expression of CXCR3 was typical of the smaller T cells in angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (15 of 18 patients), angiocentric lymphoma (3 of 3 patients), histiocyte-rich tumors (4 of 5 patients), and unspecified T-cell lymphomas (17 of 39 patients). CXCR3 expression was seen in only 1 of 15 patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. In contrast, all ALK-positive tumors showed diffuse reactivity for the Th2-associated receptor CCR4 (5 of 5 patients). CCR4 expression was also a consistent feature of the large-cell transformation of mycosis fungoides. CCR5 expression showed no consistent association with any T-cell tumor type. The chemokines Mig (CXCR3 ligand), TARC (CCR4 ligand), and MCP-2 (CCR5 ligand) were detected in intratumoral blood vessels and histiocytes. Mig was also coexpressed by a subset of CXCR3-positive tumor cells in 6 of 20 lymphomas. MCP-2 was highly expressed in stromal cells in 3 patients with nodal involvement by cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. As with normal T-cell subsets, we demonstrated that there is frequent differential expression of chemokine receptors in T-cell tumors, which may explain, in part, the distinctive patterns of spread in different tumor subtypes.

The diseases are classified based on information about morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features, and clinical features. B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with 7 recurrent genetic abnormalities is individually classified as a provisional entity. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is divided into two entities, ALK positive and ALK-negative. The pathogenesis of the former is involved with ALK gene rearrangement with several partner genes. Two borderline categories between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma, and between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma are newly recognized as a distinct disease entity based on the overlapping morphological and genetic features. In the diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms, understanding the morphological features is fundamental. On the other hand, the importance of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to clarify the immunophenotype, and chromosomal analysis and genetic examination to clarify the genetic features has been raised.",

Here, we report that cell lines and native tissues derived from the NPM/ALK-expressing T-cell lymphoma display persistent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as determined by phosphorylation of mTOR targets S6rp and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). The mTOR activation is serum growth factor-independent but nutrient-dependent. It is also dependent on the expression and enzymatic activity of NPM/ALK as demonstrated by cell transfection with wild-type and functionally deficient NPM/ALK, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated NPM/ALK depletion and kinase activity suppression using the inhibitor WHI-P154. The NPM/ALK-induced mTOR activation is transduced through the mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and, to a much lesser degree, through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Accordingly, whereas the low-dose PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and Akt inhibitor III profoundly inhibited Akt phosphorylation, they had a very modest effect on S6rp and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. In turn, MEK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 and siRNA-mediated depletion of either ERK1 or ERK2 inhibited S6rp phosphorylation much more effectively. Finally, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin markedly decreased proliferation and increased the apoptotic rate of ALK+TCL cells. These findings identify mTOR as a novel key target of NPM/ALK and suggest that mTOR inhibitors may prove effective in therapy of ALK-induced malignancies.",

We assessed paired tumor and CTC samples from patients with ALK rearranged lung cancer (n = 14), ALK-negative lung cancer (n = 12), and healthy controls (n = 5) to derive discriminant CTC counts, and to compare ALK rearrangement patterns. Blood samples were enriched for CTCs to be used for ALK FISH testing. ALK-positive CTCs counts were higher in ALK-positive NSCLC patients (3-15 cells/1.88 mL of blood) compared with ALK-negative NSCLC patients and healthy donors (0-2 cells/1.88 mL of blood). The latter range was validated as the 'false positive' cutoff for ALK FISH testing of CTCs. ALK FISH signal patterns observed on tumor biopsies were recapitulated in CTCs in all cases. Sequential CTC counts in an index case of lung cancer with no evaluable tumor tissue treated with crizotinib showed six, three and eleven ALK-positive CTCs per 1.88 mL blood at baseline, partial response and post-progression time points, respectively. Furthermore, ALK FISH rearrangement suggestive of gene copy number increase was observed in CTCs following progression. Recapitulation of ALK rearrangement patterns in the tumor on CTCs, suggested that CTCs might be used to complement tissue-based ALK testing in NSCLC to guide ALK-targeted therapy when suitable tissue biopsy samples are unavailable for testing.

Immunohistochemical study for anti-ALK-11 was performed using LSAB technique. The ALK-positive cases were further confirmed by immunohistochemical study using EnVision technique. Only ALK-positive cases by EnVision technique were further analyzed by immunostaining for antigens including CD20, CD3, CD30, EMA, granzyme-B, TIA-1 and PC. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement study was also performed and follow-up data collected.;There were altogether 5 (4 males and 1 female) cases of DLBCL showing expression of ALK protein. The age of the patients ranged from 34 to 72 years. All were primary nodal DLBCL. One case belonged to clinical stage I, 2 in stage II and 2 in stage III. The duration of follow up ranged from 4 to 32 months. Three patients subsequently died and the longest survival was 32 months. Morphologic subtypes included centroblastic 2, anaplastic 1, immunoblastic with plasmacytoid differentiation 1 and plasmablastic 1. Immunohistochemically, 4 cases were CD20 positive (including 2 centroblastic, 1 anaplastic and 1 immunoblastic cases). The plasmablastic case expressed kappa light chain and was negative for CD20. Rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was demonstrated in all 5 cases studied. As for ALK protein staining, a mixed membranous and cytoplasmic (1 immunoblastic case), granular cytoplasmic (2 centroblastic and 1 anaplastic cases) and mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic (1 plasmablastic case) patterns were observed.;Expression of ALK protein is a rare phenomenon in DLBCL and can be seen in centroblastic, anaplastic, immunoblastic and plasmablastic subtypes. It is often associated with aggressive clinical behavior and worse prognosis. A new pattern of ALK protein expression, mixed membranous and cytoplasmic, is reported.",

Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), one of the most common PTCL entities, comprises neoplastic cells with a molecular signature similar to normal follicular helper T cells, and this cellular derivation might account for several of the peculiar aspects of this disease.

ALK-rearranged NSCLC are typically adenocarcinoma characterized by a solid signet-ring cell pattern that is frequently associated with a metastatic phenotype. Recent reports linked the presence of ALK rearrangement to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in NSCLC, but the extent and the mechanisms of an ALK-mediated EMT in ALK-rearranged NSCLC are largely unknown. We found that the ALK-rearranged H2228 and DFCI032, but not the H3122, cell lines displayed a mesenchymal phenotype. In these cell lines, oncogenic ALK activity dictated an EMT phenotype by directly suppressing E-cadherin and up-regulating vimentin expression, as well as expression of other genes involved in EMT. We found that the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1), a key regulator of the splicing switch during EMT, was repressed by EML4-ALK activity. The treatment of NSCLC cells with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) led to up-regulation of ESRP1 and E-cadherin, thus reverting the phenotype from mesenchymal to epithelial (MET). Consistently, ESRP1 knock-down impaired E-cadherin up-regulation upon ALK inhibition, whereas enforced expression of ESRP1 was sufficient to increase E-cadherin expression. These findings demonstrate an ALK oncogenic activity in the regulation of an EMT phenotype in a subset of NSCLC with potential implications for the biology of ALK-rearranged NSCLC in terms of metastatic propensity and resistance to therapy.

Genetic analyses have recently demonstrated rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), located at 2p23, in a subset of IMTs. Molecular characterizations have identified ALK fusions involving tropomyosin-3 and -4 (TPM-3 and -4), the clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), and the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) genes as fusion partners. Here we describe two IMTs with a novel ALK fusion that involves the Ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2) gene at 2q13, which normally encodes a large (358-kDa) nucleopore protein localized at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. The N-terminal 867 residues of RANBP2 are fused to the cytoplasmic segment of ALK in the 1,430-amino acid RANBP2-ALK chimeric protein. Myofibroblasts that express RANBP2-ALK exhibit nuclear membrane-associated ALK staining that is unique compared to the subcellular localization observed with other ALK fusions in IMT, presumably attributable to heteroassociation of the fusion with normal RANBP2 at the nuclear pore. These findings expand the spectrum of ALK abnormalities observed in IMT and further confirm the clonal, neoplastic nature of these lesions.",

The MET signal, which is inhibited by crizotinib but not by alectinib, is dysregulated in many human cancers. However, the role of the MET signal in ALK-positive NSCLC remains unclear. In this study, we found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), ligand of MET, mediated the resistance to alectinib, but not to crizotinib, via the MET signal in ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines (H3122 and H2228 cell lines). In addition, alectinib activated the MET signal even in the absence of HGF and the inhibition of the MET signal enhanced the efficacy of alectinib.

In this study, we report that activity of nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK chimeric protein, the dominant form of ALK expressed in T cell lymphomas (TCLs), closely resembles cell activation induced by IL-2, the key cytokine supporting growth and survival of normal CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Direct comparison of gene expression by ALK(+) TCL cells treated with an ALK inhibitor and IL-2-dependent ALK(-) TCL cells stimulated with the cytokine revealed a very similar, albeit inverse, gene-regulation pattern. Depending on the analysis method, up to 67% of the affected genes were modulated in common by NPM/ALK and IL-2. Based on the gene expression patterns, Jak/STAT- and IL-2-signaling pathways topped the list of pathways identified as affected by both IL-2 and NPM/ALK. The expression dependence on NPM/ALK and IL-2 of the five selected genes-CD25 (IL-2Rα), Egr-1, Fosl-1, SOCS3, and Irf-4-was confirmed at the protein level. In both ALK(+) TCL and IL-2-stimulated ALK(-) TCL cells, CD25, SOCS3, and Irf-4 genes were activated predominantly by the STAT5 and STAT3 transcription factors, whereas transcription of Egr-1 and Fosl-1 was induced by the MEK-ERK pathway. Finally, we found that Egr-1, a protein not associated previously with either IL-2 or ALK, contributes to the cell proliferation. These findings indicate that NPM/ALK transforms the target CD4(+) T lymphocytes, at least in part, by using the pre-existing, IL-2-dependent signaling pathways. ",

Herein, we identified 44 cases of ALK-rearranged samples by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a large number of surgically resected lung cancers. All 44 ALK-rearranged lung cancers were adenocarcinomas, with 2 cases having additional focal squamous components. The goal was to analyse the clinicopathological features of ALK-rearranged lung adenocarcinomas. Our data showed that a cribriform structure, prominent extracellular mucus and any type of mucous cell pattern may be either sensitive or specific to predict an ALK rearrangement. We used FISH as the standard detection method. We compared the ALK rearrangement accuracy of FISH, RT-PCR and IHC. RT-PCR could define both the ALK fusion partner and the fusion variant, but seemed unable to detect all translocations involving the ALK gene. It is noteworthy that IHC using the D5F3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) showed higher sensitivity and specificity than the ALK1 antibody (Dako). Therefore, we conclude that IHC remains a cost-effective and efficient technique for diagnosing ALK rearrangements and that D5F3 can be the optimal screening antibody in clinical practice. ",

These tumors usually arise in the nasal region; in rare cases they can involve extranasal sites, most often skin, with involvement of the breast being rare. Lymphomas arising adjacent to breast implants are rare, and most cases reported to date have been anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Here we report a 41-year-old white woman with bilateral saline breast implants placed for cosmetic reasons who almost 9 years later developed painful swelling at the right-breast implant site. Excisional biopsy revealed lymphoma composed of monomorphic large cells associated with necrosis and angioinvasion. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an aberrant, NK/T-cell immunophenotype with the lymphoma cells being CD2+, CD3+, CD56+, partial CD30+, granzyme B, TIA-1+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7+, and CD8+. In situ hybridization analysis showed Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA within the neoplastic cells. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed monoclonal T-cell receptor-γ chain gene rearrangement. These findings support the diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. On the basis of our review of the literature, this case is unique. In addition, we believe this case is important to report, because it expands the spectrum of T-cell lymphomas that can be associated with breast implants and may be a forerunner of additional cases to follow.",

The most common PTCLs, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-negative), despite their unique presentations and histologies, are currently treated similarly. Here we discuss our general approach to the treatment of the most common PTCLs. Based on the best data currently available, which include retrospective analyses and phase 2 prospective studies, our approach has involved cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone-based therapy followed by consolidation in first remission with autologous stem cell transplant. This treatment strategy likely improves the outcome for patients compared with historical series; however, progression-free survival rates remain disappointing, ranging from 40% to 50%. This is currently an exciting time in the treatment of PTCL due to the advent of recently approved drugs as well as new targeted agents currently under investigation. In addition, gene expression profiling is allowing for a better understanding of underlying disease biology, improved diagnostic accuracy, and prognostication in PTCL. As a result, over the next few years, we expect a significant shift in our management of these diseases with a move toward more individualized therapy leading to improved outcomes.",

One potential defining feature of these lymphomas, the t(2;5)(p23;q35), occurs in 25% to 30% of anaplastic LCLs and is also found in cases with diffuse large cell or immunoblastic morphology. We recently identified nucleophosmin (NPM) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as the genes on chromosomes 5 and 2, respectively, that are juxtaposed by this translocation. To provide a complementary approach to the use of classical cytogenetics or polymerase chain reaction-based methods for the detection of this abnormality, we have developed a two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the t(2;5) that may be used for the analysis of both interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes. Three overlapping chromosome 5 cosmid clones located immediately centromeric to the NPM gene locus and an ALK P1 clone located telomeric to the chromosome 2 breakpoint were labeled with digoxigenin or biotin, respectively, and used to visualize the derivative chromosome 5 produced by the t(2;5), evident as juxtaposed or overlapping red and green fluorescent signals. This NPM-ALK FISH assay was initially validated by analysis of a series of cytogenetically characterized cell lines, with the presence of the der(5) chromosome showed specifically only in those lines known to contain the t(2;5). The assay was then applied in a blinded fashion to a series of eight cytogenetically t(2;5)-positive clinical specimens and seven known t(2;5)-negative cases, including three NHL and four Hodgkin's disease biopsy samples. Whereas the t(2;5)-negative cases were negative by FISH, all eight t(2;5)-positive cases were positive. One additional case, initially thought to be positive for the translocation by cytogenetics, was proven to not be a classic t(2;5) by interphase and metaphase FISH. These data indicate that the FISH assay described is a highly specific and rapid test that should prove to be a useful adjunct to the currently available methods for detection of the t(2;5).",

ALK protein expression was evaluated immunohistochemically with 2 specific antibodies (ALK1 and 5A4) in 249 benign and malignant soft tissue tumors, and the expression of ALK transcripts and 8 types of ALK fusion transcripts was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 165 and 100 tumors, respectively.

In ALK-negative tumors, abundant, focal amplification of native ALK was rare (0.8%). Other atypical patterns occurred in approximately 6% of tumors. The mean native ALK copy number ranged from 2.1 to 6.9 copies in cell lines and was not correlated with crizotinib sensitivity (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.34-2.8 μM; r = 0.279; P = .1764). Neither native or rearranged ALK copy number nor the percentage of positive cells correlated with extra-central nervous system progression-free survival in ALK-positive patients who were receiving crizotinib.;Overall, 8.5% of tumors fell below the established positivity threshold by ≤5%. Further investigation of ALK by other diagnostic techniques in such cases may be warranted. Native ALK copy number increases alone were not associated with sensitivity to ALK inhibition in vitro. However, rare, complex patterns of increased native ALK in patients should be studied further; because, otherwise, atypical rearrangements contained within these may be missed.",

Crizotinib and ceritinib, a next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) active against crizotinib-refractory patients, are clinically available for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs are currently under clinical evaluation. These ALK-TKIs exhibit robust clinical activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients; however, the emergence of ALK-TKI resistance restricts the therapeutic effect. To date, various secondary mutations or bypass pathway activation-mediated resistance have been identified, but large parts of the resistance mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the discovery of p-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) overexpression as a ceritinib resistance mechanism in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. P-gp exported ceritinib and its overexpression conferred ceritinib and crizotinib resistance, but not to PF-06463922 or alectinib, which are next-generation ALK inhibitors. Knockdown of ABCB1 or P-gp inhibitors sensitizes the patient-derived cancer cells to ceritinib, in vitro and in vivo. P-gp overexpression was identified in three out of 11 cases with in ALK-rearranged crizotinib or ceritinib resistant NSCLC patients.

However, some patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements respond poorly to crizotinib. Hypoxia is involved in the resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments in several cancers, and we investigated the association between the responses to ALK inhibitors and hypoxia. Sensitivity of the H3122 NSCLC cell line (EML4-ALK rearrangement) to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib or alectinib) was investigated during a normoxic or hypoxic state using an MTT assay. We found that the cell line was resistant to the inhibitors during hypoxia. Hypoxia mediated morphologic changes, including cell scattering and the elongation of the cell shape, that are characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A migration assay demonstrated that the number of migrating cells increased significantly during hypoxia, compared with during normoxia. Regarding EMT-related molecules, the expressions of slug, vimentin, and fibronectin were increased while that of E-cadherin was decreased by hypoxia. In addition, hypoxia inducible factor 1A-knockdown cancelled the hypoxia-induced EMT and resistance. Our findings indicate that hypoxia induces resistance to ALK inhibitors in NSCLC with an EML4-ALK rearrangement via the EMT. ",

Two hot spots of ALK mutations have been observed at positions F1174 and R1275. Here, we studied stably transfected cell lines expressing wild-type or F1174L- or R1275Q-mutated ALK in parallel with a neuroblastoma cell line (CLB-GE) in which the allele mutated at position F1174 is amplified. We observed that the mutated ALK variants were essentially intracellular and were largely retained in the reticulum/Golgi compartments. This localization was corroborated by a defect of N-linked glycosylation. Although the mutated receptors exhibited a constitutive activation, the minor pool of receptor addressed to the plasma membrane was much more tyrosine phosphorylated than the intracellular pool. The use of antagonist monoclonal antibodies suggested that the constitutive activity of the mutated receptors did not require the dimerization of the receptor, whereas adequate dimerization triggered by agonist monoclonal antibodies increased this activity. Finally, kinase inactivation of the mutated receptors restored maturation and cell-surface localization. Our results show that constitutive activation of ALK results in its impaired maturation and intracellular retention.

These findings strengthen the importance of molecular classification of carcinomas across different organ sites, especially considering the evolving targeted anticancer therapies with ALK inhibitors. In the current study of six pediatric renal cell carcinomas, two cases exhibited structural karyotypic abnormalities involving the ALK locus on chromosomal band 2p23. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were positive for an ALK rearrangement in one case, and subsequent 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of this tumor revealed that the 3' portion of the ALK transcript encoding for the kinase domain was fused in frame to the 5' portion of vinculin (VCL, NM_003373). The new fusion gene is predicted to have an open reading frame of 4122 bp encoding for a 1374-aa oncoprotein; its expression was shown by immunoblotting with anti-VCL and anti-ALK antibodies in tumor tissue lysates. Immunohistochemistry with the same antibodies demonstrated cytoplasmic and subplasmalemmal localization of the oncoprotein determined by its N-terminal VCL portion. FISH with a custom-designed VCL-ALK dual-fusion probe set confirmed the presence of the fusion in neoplastic cells and demonstrated the potential clinical utility of this approach for detecting VCL-ALK in routinely processed tissue. The five remaining pediatric renal cell carcinomas did not show ALK rearrangement by FISH or ALK expression by immunohistochemistry. The data identify the kidney as a new organ site for ALK-associated carcinomas and VCL as a novel ALK fusion partner.

In this report, we describe cases of lung cancer with concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement and identify their clinical characteristics. Non-small cell lung cancer patients with multiple molecular alterations were retrospectively analyzed from an academic referral center from 2011-2013. An additional review was conducted of reported cases with dual alterations. Four cases of NSCLC with alterations in both EGFR and ALK were identified and evaluated with 16 published cases for a total of 20 cases. The age of patients ranged from 37 to 77 years. Nine patients were never smokers. The disease control rates in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors and ALK inhibitors were 46% (6/13) and 71% (5/7), respectively. This series highlights the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling of newly diagnosed lung cancer, as NSCLC may be driven by concurrent molecular alterations. EGFR- and ALK-targeted therapies appear to have modest activity in patients with tumors possessing both alterations. Dual-altered NSCLC patients may have distinct clinical characteristics warranting further study.

This selection process led to the identification of 29 novel cell migration regulators. One of these candidates, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), was further investigated. Subsequent studies revealed that ALK promoted cell migration through the PI3K-AKT pathway via the p55γ regulatory subunit of PI3K, rather than more commonly used p85 subunit. Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies using mouse brain tissues revealed similar temporal expression patterns of ALK, phospho-p55γ, and phospho-AKT during different stages of development.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent advances in the understanding of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biology have revealed a number of 'targetable' genetic alterations that underlie cancer growth and survival in specific patients subgroups. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement identifies a population of NSCLCs in whom dysregulation of ALK-tyrosine kinase (-TK) leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, thus providing the basis for the therapeutic use of ALK-TK inhibitors (-TKIs) in ALK-rearranged (-positive) disease. Crizotinib was the first ALK-TKI to undergo clinical development in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, in which it has been shown to greatly outperform the best available chemotherapy regimen in either second- or first-line setting. More recently, the novel second-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib has been shown to be highly active in either crizotinib-pretreated or -naïve population. Nevertheless, as mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib and ALK-TKIs in general are being progressively elucidated, the treatment landscape of ALK-positive NSCLC is expected to evolve rapidly. In the present review we will briefly discuss the current knowledge of ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Also, we will touch upon new developments on drugs/combination regimens aimed at inhibiting the ALK-TK, in an attempt to delineate how treatment of ALK-positive disease may change in the next future.

We also performed mutation analysis of ALK gene by directly sequencing the exons 20-28 which cover the region that encodes juxtamembrane and kinase domains. A total of 39 (43.3%) NB cases revealed copy numbers alterations of ALK gene. There was highly significant association of ALK copy number gains with gains of one or more of the genes at 2p24.1 (DDX1, MYCN or NAG) in MYCN unamplified tumors (P<0.000). In addition, 15 of 17 MYCN amplified cases (88.2%) had aberrant ALK status. Solitary gain of ALK with normal copy number status of all other genes was observed only in one case. DNA sequencing of exons 20-28 of ALK revealed two different nucleotide changes in three cases leading to amino acid substitutions of F1245V and R1275Q in tyrosine kinase domain.

The ALK inhibitors are highly effective in NSCLC patients harboring ALK rearrangements; however, most patients acquire resistance to the therapy following an initial response. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are complex. We used LC-MS/MS-based phosphotyrosine-peptide profiling in the EML4-ALK rearranged H3122 and H2228 cells treated with ALK inhibitors, to identify downstream effectors of ALK. We then used Western blot, siRNA experiments, cell proliferation, viability and migration assays to validate our findings. We identified CRKL as a novel downstream effector of ALK signaling. We demonstrated that CRKL tyrosine phosphorylation was repressed by pharmacological inhibition or small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ALK in the ALK-rearranged cells. More importantly, CRKL knockdown attenuated their cell proliferation, viability, and migration, but it had no effect on ALK phosphorylation and expression in these cells. Furthermore, CRKL tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by dasatinib (an inhibitor of ABL and SRC kinases), which in combination with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib displayed a synergistic inhibitory effect in vitro. In conclusion, our study suggests that CRKL is a key downstream effector of ALK, and combined inhibition of ALK and CRKL may represent an effective strategy for treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients.

Moreover, X-396 could potently inhibit ALK kinases engineered with two point mutations associated with acquired resistance to PF-1066, L1196M, and C1156Y, when engineered into an E13;A20 fusion variant.

Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.",

The latter tumors have high mortality and lack effective therapies. Using a paired-end RNA-sequencing approach, we report the discovery of rearrangements involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in thyroid cancer. The most common of these involves a fusion between ALK and the striatin (STRN) gene, which is the result of a complex rearrangement involving the short arm of chromosome 2. STRN-ALK leads to constitutive activation of ALK kinase via dimerization mediated by the coiled-coil domain of STRN and to a kinase-dependent, thyroid-stimulating hormone-independent proliferation of thyroid cells. Moreover, expression of STRN-ALK transforms cells in vitro and induces tumor formation in nude mice. The kinase activity of STRN-ALK and the ALK-induced cell growth can be blocked by the ALK inhibitors crizotinib and TAE684. In addition to well-differentiated papillary cancer, STRN-ALK was found with a higher prevalence in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers, and it did not overlap with other known driver mutations in these tumors. Our data demonstrate that STRN-ALK fusion occurs in a subset of patients with highly aggressive types of thyroid cancer and provide initial evidence suggesting that it may represent a therapeutic target for these patients.

We reasoned that other ALK mutants which have been identified by the Cancer Genome Project may likewise possess transformation potential.

Whilst the F1174L mutant reproducibly drives foci formation in vitro, the other ALK mutants fail in this task. Furthermore, apart from the F1174L ALK mutant, the ALK protein is not phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 1604 suggesting that they are kinase-inactive in this cellular context.

Neuroblastoma harbours a variety of genetic changes, including a high frequency of MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity at 1p36 and 11q, and gain of genetic material from 17q, all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. However, the scarcity of reliable molecular targets has hampered the development of effective therapeutic agents targeting neuroblastoma. Here we show that the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), originally identified as a fusion kinase in a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NPM-ALK) and more recently in adenocarcinoma of lung (EML4-ALK), is also a frequent target of genetic alteration in advanced neuroblastoma. According to our genome-wide scans of genetic lesions in 215 primary neuroblastoma samples using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping microarrays, the ALK locus, centromeric to the MYCN locus, was identified as a recurrent target of copy number gain and gene amplification. Furthermore, DNA sequencing of ALK revealed eight novel missense mutations in 13 out of 215 (6.1%) fresh tumours and 8 out of 24 (33%) neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. All but one mutation in the primary samples (12 out of 13) were found in stages 3-4 of the disease and were harboured in the kinase domain. The mutated kinases were autophosphorylated and displayed increased kinase activity compared with the wild-type kinase. They were able to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts as shown by their colony formation ability in soft agar and their capacity to form tumours in nude mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that downregulation of ALK through RNA interference suppresses proliferation of neuroblastoma cells harbouring mutated ALK.

Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) in the developing visceral muscle of Drosophila melanogaster initiates a signal transduction pathway required for muscle fusion. In this paper, we have investigated downstream components which are regulated by this novel signalling pathway. Here we show that Alk-mediated signal transduction drives the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand in vivo. Loss of Alk function results in a complete lack of Hand expression in this tissue, whereas Alk gain of function results in an expansion of Hand expression. Finally, we have investigated the process of muscle fusion in the gut of Hand mutant animals and can find no obvious defects in this process, suggesting that Hand is not critical for visceral muscle fusion per se.",

And, among 10 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), there were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 6),B-cell lymphoma, non-classifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1), small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 1), anaplastic large cell lymphoma with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive (n = 1) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 1). The median age was 26(22-35) years.Superficial lymphadenopathy was more common in HL than in NHL (10/11 vs 3/10, P = 0.008). At diagnosis, bulky disease and extranodal involvement were more prevalent in NHL than in HL (8/10 vs 2/11, P = 0.009; 7/10 vs 2/11, P = 0.030). All patients received chemotherapy and those with early stages also had combined radiotherapy. Ten patients with HL and 6 patients with NHL achieved complete remission. During a median follow-up of 90 months for HL, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 87.5% and 100% respectively. And during a median follow-up of 31 months for NHL, the 2-year PFS and OS rates were 66.7% and 77.8% respectively. The values of PFS and OS of NHL were inferior to those of HL (P = 0.073 and P = 0.066 respectively).One case of HL and 1 case of NHL received chemotherapy in the second trimester.

The orphan receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of very few RTKs that remain without a firmly established protein ligand. Here we present a novel cytokine, FAM150B, which we propose naming augmentor-α (AUG-α), as a ligand for ALK. AUG-α binds ALK with high affinity and activates ALK in cells with subnanomolar potency. Detailed binding experiments using cells expressing ALK or the related receptor leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) demonstrate that AUG-α binds and robustly activates both ALK and LTK. We show that the previously established LTK ligand FAM150A (AUG-β) is specific for LTK and only weakly binds to ALK. Furthermore, expression of AUG-α stimulates transformation of NIH/3T3 cells expressing ALK, induces IL-3 independent growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing ALK, and is expressed in neuroblastoma, a cancer partly driven by ALK. These experiments reveal the hierarchy and specificity of two cytokines as ligands for ALK and LTK and set the stage for elucidating their roles in development and disease states. ",

Thus, the development of ALK specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a current therapeutic challenge. Animal models are essential to assess, in vivo, the efficiency of ALK-oncogene inhibitors and to identify new and/or additional therapeutic targets in the ALK tumorigenesis pathway. Using the tetracycline system to allow conditional and concomitant TPM3-ALK and luciferase expression, we have developed a unique transplant model for bioluminescent TPM3-ALK-induced fibroblastic tumors in athymic nude mice. The reversible TPM3-ALK expression allowed us to demonstrate that this oncogene is essential for the tumor growth and its maintenance. In addition, we showed that this model could be used to precisely assess tumor growth inhibition upon ALK chemical inactivation. As proof of principle, we used the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A to inhibit ALK oncoprotein activity. As expected, herbimycin A treatment reduced tumor growth as assessed both by tumor volume measurement and bioluminescent imaging.

Here we report on the contribution of pleiotrophin-ALK signaling to glioblastoma growth.

We reduced the endogenous ALK in glioblastoma cells by ribozyme targeting and demonstrated that this prevents pleiotrophin-stimulated phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Akt. Furthermore, this depletion of ALK reduced tumor growth of xenografts in athymic nude mice and prolonged survival of the animals because of increased apoptosis in the tumors.

Eight out of 10 samples showed such reactivity (and in six cases gave specific staining of BCL-2-transfected cells). As these findings suggest a new biochemical approach to the identification of oncogenic proteins in lymphoma, we investigated whether antibodies present in patients with ALK-positive lymphoma can precipitate NPM-ALK in quantities which should be sufficient for further analysis. We found that plasma samples from all10 patients studied immunoprecipitated NPM-ALK asaprotein visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gels.

Many of them had been reported even before its approval leading to the rapid development of second-generation ALK inhibitors for crizotinib-resistant NSCLC.

Recent genetic and molecular studies have shown that a subset of IMT is characterized by the expression of altered anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein mostly resulting from rearrangements of the ALK gene such as TPM3-ALK, TPM4-ALK and CLTC-ALK fusion genes. We analyzed the ALK status in nine cases of IMT arising in various anatomical locations. Six cases showed immunohistochemical expression of the ALK protein, and two ALK-positive lesions examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and a subsequent sequencing analysis harbored the TPM4-ALK fusion gene. Of note, the majority of ALK-positive tumor cells in four of the six lesions lacked the coexpression of myogenic markers including alpha-smooth muscle actin, a cytoskeletal protein indicating myofibroblastic differentiation, whereas a substantial number of tumor cells in the remaining two cases coexpressed ALK and alpha-smooth muscle actin and/or desmin. In an ultrastructural study of the lesion with predominant ALK-positive/actin-negative cells, spindle cells failed to demonstrate features of myofibroblasts such as intracytoplasmic bundles of thin filaments and dense bodies. The current findings suggest that ALK-positive cells in IMT are not always myofibroblastic but might be immature primitive mesenchymal cells.",

We also assessed activation of ALK by ethanol in cells and found that ALK and ALK-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation increased rapidly with ethanol exposure. Similarly, treatment of cells with recombinant MDK protein increased ALK, ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation, suggesting that ethanol may utilize MDK to activate ALK signaling. In support of this, transfection of cells with MDK siRNAs attenuated ALK signaling in response to ethanol. Ethanol also activates ERK signaling in the brain. We found that inhibition of ALK or knockout of MDK attenuated ethanol-induced ERK phosphorylation in mouse amygdala.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic relevance of ALK positivity by IHC and ALK mutation status by PCR sequencing in 71 NBL, 12 ganglioneuroblastoma (GNBL), and 20 ganglioneuroma samples in a multivariate model.

In most ganglioneuroma samples, a low percentage of tumor cells stained positive for ALK, which mainly involved ganglion cells. Higher percentages of ALK-positive cells in NBL and GNBL patient samples correlated with inferior survival in univariate and multivariate analyses with established prognostic factors, such as stage, age, and MYCN status.

        "Doc_abstract":"The hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is a highly regulated signaling pathway that is important not only for embryonic development, tissue patterning, and organogenesis but also for tissue repair and the maintenance of stem cells in adult tissues. In the adult hematopoietic system, HH signaling regulates intrathymic T-cell development, and it is one of the survival signals provided by follicular dendritic cells to prevent apoptosis in germinal center B cells. HH signaling is required for primitive hematopoiesis; however, conflicting data have been reported regarding the role of the HH pathway in adult hematopoiesis. Inappropriate activation of the HH signaling pathway occurs in several human cancers, including hematological neoplasms. Emerging data demonstrate abnormal HH pathway activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute leukemias. In these neoplasms, HH signaling promotes proliferation and survival, contributes to the maintenance of cancer stem cells, and enhances tolerance or resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we review current understanding of HH signaling, its role in the pathobiology of hematological malignancies, and its potential as a therapeutic target to treat malignant hematological neoplasms.",

This article aims to evaluate ALK, EBV, and HHV-8 expression in children with IMT and to correlate our findings with clinical features.;Sixteen children (range, 1-15 years) who had surgery for IMT between 1978 and 2003 were evaluated retrospectively. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were stained for HHV-8 and ALK with immunohistochemistry. Epstein-Barr virus was detected by in situ hybridization (EBER probes).;Tumors were located in the pulmonary lobe (n = 4), urinary tract (n = 4), mesentery or bowel (n = 4), hepatic lobe (n = 1), vena cava (n = 1), spinal cord (n = 1), and soft tissue (n = 1). Five children were treated with steroids and/or antibiotics before surgery, with no substantial result. IMT was excised totally in all but 2 cases. Four patients presented aggressive IMT with recurrence or metastasis requiring new surgery. ALK was positive in 3 (18.8%) cases and EBV in 1 pulmonary and 1 bladder tumor, all of them without recurrence or metastasis. None of the cases were positive for HHV-8.

Using a model of anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)-translocated NSCLC with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib, but lacking amplifications or mutations in the kinase domain of ALK, we herein present evidence that STAT3 activation is a novel mechanism of crizotinib resistance that involves the upregulation of immune escape and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways. Taking advantage of the flavonolignan silibinin as a naturally occurring STAT3-targeted pharmacological inhibitor, we confirmed that STAT3 activation protects ALK-translocated NSCLC from crizotinib. Accordingly, silibinin-induced inhibition of STAT3 worked synergistically with crizotinib to reverse acquired resistance and restore sensitivity in crizotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, silibinin treatment significantly inhibited the upregulation of the immune checkpoint regulator PD-L1 and also EMT regulators (e.g., SLUG, VIM, CD44) in crizotinib-refractory cells. These findings provide a valuable strategy to potentially improve the efficacy of ALK inhibition by cotreatment with silibinin-based therapeutics, which merit clinical investigation for ALK TKI-resistant NSCLC patients.",

A screen of 24 CT image traits was performed in a training set of 59 patients, followed by random forest variable selection incorporating 24 CT traits plus six clinical-pathologic covariates to identify a radiogenomic predictor of ALK+ status. This predictor was then validated in an independent cohort (n = 113). Test-for-accuracy and subset analyses were performed. A similar analysis was performed to identify a biomarker associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) after therapy with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib.;ALK+ status was associated with central tumor location, absence of pleural tail, and large pleural effusion. An ALK+ radiogenomic CT status biomarker consisting of these three imaging traits with patient age of younger than 60 years showed strong discriminatory power for ALK+ status, with a sensitivity of 83.3% (15 of 18), a specificity of 77.9% (74 of 95), and an accuracy of 78.8% (89 of 113) in independent testing. The discriminatory power was particularly strong in patients with operable disease (stage IIIA or lower), with a sensitivity of 100.0% (five of five), a specificity of 88.1% (37 of 42), and an accuracy of 89.4% (42 of 47). Tumors with a disorganized vessel pattern had a shorter PFS with crizotinib therapy than tumors without this trait (11.4 vs 20.2 months, P = .041).;ALK+ NSCLC has distinct characteristics at CT imaging that, when combined with clinical covariates, discriminate ALK+ from non-ALK tumors and can potentially identify patients with a shorter durable response to crizotinib.",

In experimental animals also, retroviral-mediated gene transfer technique resulted in the development of leukemia.

In this study, we aimed to further understand how SHP1 interacts and regulates NPM-ALK. We employed an in vitro model in which GP293 cells were transfected with various combinations of NPM-ALK (or mutants) and SHP1 (or mutants) expression vectors. We found that SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK, but not the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALK(K210R) mutant, or the mutant in which all three functionally important tyrosine residues (namely, Tyr(338), Tyr(342), and Tyr(343)) in the kinase activation loop (KAL) of ALK were mutated. Interestingly, whereas mutation of Tyr(338) or Tyr(342) did not result in any substantial change in the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding (assessed by co-immunoprecipitation), mutation of Tyr(343) abrogated this interaction. Furthermore, the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding was readily detectable when each of the remaining 8 tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated were mutated. Although the expression of SHP1 effectively reduced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK, it did not affect that of the NPM-ALK(Y343F) mutant. In soft agar clonogenic assay, SHP1 expression significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of NPM-ALK but not that of NPM-ALK(Y343F). In conclusion, we identified Tyr(343) of NPM-ALK as the crucial site for mediating the NPM-ALK/SHP1 interaction. Our results also support the notion that the tumor suppressor effects of SHP1 on NPM-ALK are dependent on its ability to bind to this oncogenic protein.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Genetic insight into the pathogenesis of lung cancer has paved the way for a new era in its treatment. Recently, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been identified as exerting a potent transforming effect through genetic rearrangement in patients with lung cancer. Preclinical and single-arm phase I studies have shown that patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be successfully treated with crizotinib. Furthermore, a phase III randomized study indicated that crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with NSCLC harboring the ALK rearrangement who had received 1 previous platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite the excellent efficacy of crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive (ALK(+)) lung cancer, resistance mechanisms--such as secondary mutations in the ALK gene, the activation of other oncogenes, and so on--have been identified as conferring resistance to crizotinib. Second-generation ALK inhibitors, such as alectinib and ceritinib, have been shown to be effective not only in crizotinib-naive patients but also in those resistant to crizotinib. Therefore, although some agents specifically targeting ALK have been developed and their efficacy has been documented, how ALK inhibitors should be administered in the setting of ALK-rearranged NSCLC remains to be fully elucidated. Can second-generation ALK inhibitors replace crizotinib? Is crizotinib just a first-generation ALK inhibitor? Is the sequential use of crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors the best method? In this article, we review the preclinical and clinical results regarding crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors, as well as the resistance mechanisms, and discuss the best methods for treating patients with ALK(+) NSCLC.",

Characterization of ALK fusion patterns and their resulting clinicopathological profiles could be of great benefit in better understanding the biology of lung cancer.;RACE-coupled PCR sequencing was used to assess ALK fusions in a cohort of 103 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. Within this cohort, the EML4-ALK fusion gene was identified in 12 tumors (11.6%). Further analysis revealed that EML4-ALK was present at a frequency of 16.13% (10/62) in patients with adenocarcinomas, 19.23% (10/52) in never-smokers, and 42.80% (9/21) in patients with adenocarcinomas lacking EGFR and KRAS mutations. The EML4-ALK fusion was associated with non-smokers (P = 0.03), younger age of onset (P = 0.03), and adenocarcinomas without EGFR/KRAS mutations (P = 0.04). A trend towards improved survival was observed for patients with the EML4-ALK fusion, although it was not statistically significant (P = 0.20). Concurrent deletion in EGFR exon 19 and fusion of EML4-ALK was identified for the first time in a Chinese female patient with an adenocarcinoma. Analysis of ALK expression revealed that ALK mRNA levels were higher in tumors positive for the EML-ALK fusion than in negative tumors (normalized intensity of 21.99 vs. 0.45, respectively; P = 0.0018). However, expression of EML4 did not differ between the groups.;The EML4-ALK fusion gene was present at a high frequency in Chinese NSCLC patients, particularly in those with adenocarcinomas lacking EGFR/KRAS mutations.

This is particularly applicable to the diagnosis of angiommunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unclassified (PTCLU), because of their histologic and immunophenotypic overlap with reactive lymphoid proliferations. Recently, immunohistochemistry for programmed death-1 (PD-1), a marker of follicular helper T cells, was shown to be sensitive in the detection of AITL and PTCLU. The sensitivity of this marker in reactive entities, however, has not been adequately evaluated. We confirm that PD-1 staining is a highly sensitive marker in the diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphomas: increased extrafollicular PD-1-positive cells were seen in 93% (76/82) of AITL, 62% (16/26) of PTCLU, and 11% (2/18) of anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas. The majority of reactive lymphadenopathies including Cat-scratch disease, Kikuchi lymphadenitis, Castleman disease, and reactive follicular hyperplasia showed no PD-1 staining outside follicles. Some reactive lymph nodes, showed increased extrafollicular PD-1-positive cells in a pattern similar to AITL and PTCLU, and include progressive transformation of germinal centers, viral lymphadenitis (Epstein-Barr virusand human immunodeficiency virus) and Rosai-Dorfman disease. This study shows that PD-1-positive cells may be increased in a number of settings other than T-cell lymphomas. We conclude that staining for PD-1 in reactive and atypical lymphadenopathies should be interpreted with caution and in the context of other ancillary immunophenotypic and molecular studies before a diagnosis of AITL or PTCLU is entertained.",

Surface plasmon resonance showed high-affinity binding of the selected scFv. The anti-ALK scFv competed for binding of PTN to ALK in intact cells and inhibited PTN-dependent signal transduction through endogenous ALK. Invasion of an intact endothelial cell monolayer by U87MG human glioblastoma cells was inhibited by the anti-ALK scFv. In addition, the growth of established tumor xenografts in mice was reversed after the induction of the conditional expression of the anti-ALK scFv.

A positive feedback loop appears to exist between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR through which these two kinases interact to potentiate their effects. We have also found that a single mutation of the Tyr(644) or Tyr(664) residue of the C terminus of NPM-ALK to phenylalanine decreases significantly, but does not completely abolish, the association between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the dual mutation of Tyr(644) and Tyr(664) abrogates the association and interactions between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR. We also examined the impact of this dual mutation on the oncogenic potential of NPM-ALK. Our results show that NPM-ALK(Y644,664F) completely lacks association with IGF-IR. Importantly, we found that the dual mutation of Tyr(644) and Tyr(664) diminishes the oncogenic effects of NPM-ALK, including its ability to induce anchorage-independent colony formation and to sustain cellular transformation, proliferation, and migration. Furthermore, the association between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR through Tyr(644) and Tyr(664) appears to contribute to maintaining the stability of NPM-ALK protein. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which NPM-ALK induces its oncogenic effects through interactions with IGF-IR in this aggressive lymphoma.",

Wild-type EGFR, EGFR/ALK and an EGFR/ALK kinase negative mutant were independently expressed in mouse NR6 fibroblasts. The capacity of EGFR/ALK to mediate [125I]-EGF internalization, receptor degradation and downregulation, which has never been previously described, was assayed. The rate of [125I]-EGF-induced internalization mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of ALK was reduced several fold compared with the wild-type EGFR. The low rate of EGF internalization promoted by EGFR/ALK correlated with an impaired degradation and downregulation of the receptor and indicate that ALK is not subject to traditional mechanisms used to regulate receptor tyrosine kinase function. Accordingly, ALK-activated intracellular domain does not associate in vivo with c-cbl and does not undergo ligand-mediated ubiquitination. The current study provides new insight into the function and regulation of ALK suggesting that the relative long membrane residence of activated ALK might confers a more potent and prolonged signaling activity. Indeed NR6-EGFR/ALK cells exhibited a approximately 3-fold increase in a maximal mitogenic response than NR6-EGFR.",

In peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified, gene profiling suggests the normal counterpart of tumour cells are activated CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, delineates prognostic groups depending on the proliferative signature, and suggests therapeutic options aimed at regulating nuclear factor-kappaB and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha phosphorylation. Gene expression profiling of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas highlighted the importance of abnormal methylation patterns, suggested a pivotal role for JUNB/AP-1, and defined a predictive model for response to interferon-alpha.

Because of their usually indolent course, primary cutaneous T/NK-cell lymphomas should be distinguished from the other PTCL. Staging of PTCL is done according to the Ann Arbor staging system. The International Prognostic Index, established for aggressive B-cell lymphomas, has also proved relevant for PTCL. Standard therapy for PTCL has not been defined, yet. First line anthracycline-based chemotherapy brings about long-term remissions in 15 to 42% of patients. Apart from (ALK-positive) anaplastic large cell lymphoma it thus gives poorer results than those obtained in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Data for high-dosage therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) for relapsing and refractory PTCL are similar to those reported for aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Thus this treatment seems to constitute a sensible salvage strategy. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation following reduced conditioning regimens has also given promising results in patients with relapse.

Further, activating point mutations in the ALK domain have been recently reported in neuroblastoma. To characterize signaling in the context of the full-length receptor, we have examined whether ALK is able to activate Rap1 and contribute to differentiation/proliferation processes. We show that ALK activates Rap1 via the Rap1-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor C3G, which binds in a constitutive complex with CrkL to activated ALK. The activation of the C3G/Rap1 pathway results in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, which is inhibited by either overexpression of Rap1GAP or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rap1 itself or the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G. Significantly, this pathway also appears to function in the regulation of proliferation of neuroblastoma cells such as SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y, because abrogation of Rap1 activity by Rap1-specific siRNA or overexpression of Rap1GAP reduces cellular growth. These results suggest that ALK activation of Rap1 may contribute to cell proliferation and oncogenesis of neuroblastoma driven by gain-of-function mutant ALK receptors.",

Here we examine the ability of PTN to produce anti-apoptotic signals. We demonstrate that PTN is a survival factor for SW-13 epithelial cells and show that ribozyme-mediated depletion of ALK from SW-13 cells abolishes this effect of PTN. Furthermore, in serum-starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts PTN prevents apoptosis (measured by annexin V staining) with an EC(50) of 0.2 ng/ml and induces cell growth at higher concentrations of PTN. A polyclonal antibody against the PTN ligand-binding domain of the ALK receptor (alpha-LBD) was a partial agonist for ALK in NIH3T3 cells. This alpha-LBD antibody showed high agonist activity for anti-apoptosis (56 +/- 9% relative to PTN), low agonist activity for cell growth (21 +/- 1% relative to PTN), and was an antagonist of PTN-induced cell growth (61 +/- 2% inhibition). Both MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase cascades in NIH3T3 cells were activated by PTN, and this effect persisted for up to 3 h. Surprisingly, the anti-apoptotic effect of PTN was completely blocked by the MAP kinase inhibitor UO126, but was not affected by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. In contrast, PTN-dependent cell growth required both MAPK and PI 3-kinase activity. We conclude that anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN through ALK in NIH3T3 fibroblasts is via the MAP kinase pathway.",

As a group, the activating point mutations in full-length ALK, found in approximately 8% of all neuroblastoma tumors, are distributed evenly across different clinical stages. However, the most frequent somatic mutation, F1174L, is associated with amplification of the MYCN oncogene. This combination of features appears to confer a worse prognosis than MYCN amplification alone, suggesting a cooperative effect on neuroblastoma formation by these two proteins. Indeed, F1174L has shown more potent transforming activity in vivo than the second most common activating mutation, R1275Q, and is responsible for innate and acquired resistance to crizotinib, a clinically relevant ALK inhibitor that will soon be commercially available. These advances cast ALK as a bona fide oncoprotein in neuroblastoma and emphasize the need to understand ALK-mediated signaling in this tumor.

Although the detection of ALK by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been proposed for the screening of patients, large-scale studies are warranted to validate such a hierarchical approach.;In this article, we report the largest series thus far of parallel FISH and IHC ALK testing in 3244 consecutive NSCLC cases analyzed at two independent French centers.;FISH-positive and/or IHC-positive results were demonstrated in 150 of 3244 cases (4.6%). An imbalanced sex ratio was detected, with women exhibiting a 2.2-fold relative risk for an alteration. Strikingly, only 80 of 150 specimens were classified as ALK positive by both techniques. The specimens with discordant FISH/IHC analyses were FISH-positive/IHC-negative (36), FISH-negative/IHC-positive (19), or FISH-noncontributive/IHC-positive (15). Thus, a single FISH or IHC analysis performed alone would have failed to detect approximately one-fourth of the ALK-positive cases with similar findings in our two centers.;This study highlights the feasibility of systematic NSCLC testing by both FISH and IHC in routine practice. Many preanalytical factors may account for the apparent discrepancies between both methods, suggesting that hierarchical screening may underscore ALK-positive cases.

Several ALK variants have been identified, but few studies have focused on the effects of different ALK variants on the efficacy of crizotinib.;Among 55 patients treated with crizotinib as the initial ALK-TKI between January 2007 and December 2014, we identified 35 patients with tumor specimens that could be evaluated for ALK variants by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of crizotinib on the basis of the objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) according to the ALK variants.;The most frequent ALK variant was variant 1 in 19 patients (54%), followed by variant 2 in five patients (14%), variant 3a/3b in four patients (12%), and other variants in seven patients (20%). Objective response rate was 69% in all patients, whereas it was 74% and 63% in the variant 1 and non-variant 1 groups, respectively. The median PFS time was significantly longer in patients with variant 1 than in those with non-variant 1 (median PFS, 11.0 months [95% CI, 6.5 to 43.0 months] v 4.2 months [95% CI, 1.6 to 10.2 months], respectively; P < .05). Multivariable analysis identified two significant factors associated with PFS duration, ALK variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.350; 95% CI, 0.128 to 0.929; P < .05) and advanced stage (hazard ratio, 4.646; 95% CI, 1.381 to 21.750; P < .05).;Our results indicate the better efficacy of crizotinib in patients with ALK variant 1 versus non-variant 1.

        "Doc_abstract":"Acquired chromosomal anomalies (most commonly translocations) in lymphoma and leukemia usually result in either activation of a quiescent gene (by means of immunoglobulin or T-cell-receptor promotors) and expression of an intact protein product, or creation of a fusion gene encoding a chimeric protein. This review summarizes current immunocytochemical studies of these 2 categories of oncogenic protein, with emphasis on the clinical relevance of their detection in diagnostic samples. Among the quiescent genes activated by rearrangement, expression of cyclin D1 (due to rearrangement of the CCND1 [BCL-1] gene) is a near-specific marker of t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma; BCL-2 expression distinguishes follicular lymphoma cells from their nonneoplastic counterparts in reactive germinal centers and appears to be an independent prognostic marker in diffuse large cell lymphoma; and TAL-1 (SCL) expression identifies T-cell acute lymphoblastic neoplasms in which this gene is activated. The protein products of other genes activated by chromosomal rearrangement have a role as markers of either lineage (eg, PAX-5 [B-cell-specific activator protein] for B cells, including B-lymphoblastic neoplasms), or maturation stage (eg, BCL-6 for germinal-center and activated B cells and MUM-1/IRF4 for plasma cells). Currently, no hybrid protein encoded by fusion genes is reliably detectable by antibodies recognizing unique junctional epitopes (ie, epitopes absent from the wild-type constituent proteins). Nevertheless, staining for promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein will detect acute PML with t(15;17) because the microspeckled nuclear labeling pattern for PML-RARalpha is highly distinctive. Similarly, antibodies to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase are valuable (because wild-type ALK is not found in normal lymphoid tissue) in detecting neoplasms (CD30-positive large T-cell lymphomas) with t(2;5) or its variants. Thus, immunocytochemical detection of the products of many rearranged genes in lymphoma and leukemia can be clinically informative and provide information on cellular and subcellular protein expression that cannot be inferred from studies based on messenger RNA.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase is essential in early development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell survival; nevertheless, the mechanism to activate ALK has remained elusive. ALK has remained an \"Orphan Receptor.\" The studies cited below describe a unique mechanism termed \"Ligand Independent Activation.\" It is shown that activation of ALK results when the cytokine pleiotrophin (PTN) interacts with its receptor, the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ (RPTPβ/ζ). Pleiotrophin inactivates the catalytic activity of RPTPβ/ζ, which, when not inactivated, dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine sites in the activation domain of ALK; as a consequence of the inactivation of RPTPβ/ζ by PTN, autophosphorylation and autoactivation of ALK rapidly follow. The PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway thus regulates the catalytic activity of ALK and tyrosine phosphorylation levels of ALK downstream target proteins. Furthermore, since ALK is only one of the key ALK phosphoproteins targeted by the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway, the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway has the potential to coordinately regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of other different key proteins in multiple cellular compartments.

We aimed to comprehensively study the prevalence of ALK expression, and changes in copy number and translocation in a large cohort of breast cancer cases in a Middle Eastern population.;ALK protein expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry and numerical and structural variations of the ALK gene were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a tissue microarray format in a cohort of more than 1000 Middle Eastern breast cancers. The data were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters and other important molecular biomarkers.;Immunohistochemical analysis showed ALK overexpression in 36.0 % of the breast cancer patients and gene amplification was present in 13.3 % of cases, seen by FISH analyses. ALK overexpression was significantly associated with ALK gene amplification (p = 0.0031).

Alectinib and ceritinib are second-generation ALK inhibitors which show remarkable clinical responses in both crizotinib-naive and crizotinib-resistant NSCLC patients harboring an ALK fusion gene. Despite their impressive activity, clinical resistance to alectinib and ceritinib has also emerged. In the current study, we elucidated the resistance mechanisms to these second-generation ALK inhibitors in the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the EML4-ALK variant 1 fusion in vitro. Prolonged treatment of the parental H3122 cells with alectinib and ceritinib led to two cell lines which are 10 times less sensitive to alectinib and ceritinib than the parental H3122 cell line. Although mutations of ALK in its kinase domain are a common resistance mechanism for crizotinib, we did not detect any ALK mutation in these resistant cell lines. Rather, overexpression of phospho-ALK and alternative receptor tyrosine kinases such as phospho-EGFR, phospho-HER3, and phospho-IGFR-1R was observed in both resistant cell lines. Additionally, NRG1, a ligand for HER3, is upregulated and responsible for resistance by activating the EGFR family pathways through the NRG1-HER3-EGFR axis. Combination treatment with EGFR inhibitors, in particular afatinib, was shown to be effective at overcoming resistance. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into adaptive resistance to second-generation ALK inhibitors and suggests a potential clinical strategy to combat resistance to these second-generation ALK inhibitors in NSCLC.

In this study, we revealed a persistently activated PI3K/AKT signaling that mediates the drug ineffectiveness. We found that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ALK markedly abrogated phosphorylated STAT3 and ERK, but it failed to suppress AKT activity or induce apoptosis, in EML4-ALK-positive H2228 cells. Furthermore, targeted RNA interference of PI3K pathway components restored sensitivity to TAE684 treatment at least partially due to increased apoptosis. Combined TAE684 with PI3K inhibitor synergistically inhibited the proliferation of EML4-ALK-positive cells in vitro and significantly suppressed the growth of H2228 xenografts in vivo, suggesting the potential clinical application of such combinatorial therapy regimens in patients with EML4-ALK positive lung cancer.",

Newer-generation inhibitors may help overcome resistance mutations, and inhibitor combinations can target parallel pathways, but durable benefit to patients remains elusive in most clinical scenarios. Now, recent studies suggest a third approach may be available in some cases-exploitation of oncogene overexpression that may arise to promote resistance. Here, we discuss the importance of maintaining oncogenic signaling at \"just-right\" levels in cells, with too much signaling, or oncogene overdose, being potentially as detrimental as too little. This is highlighted in particular by recent studies of mutant-BRAF in melanoma and the fusion kinase nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Oncogene overdose may be exploitable to prolong tumor control through intermittent dosing in some cases, and studies of acute lymphoid leukemias suggest that it may be specifically pharmacologically inducible.

Different assays have been developed to detect ALK rearrangements, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, ALK detection has not been applied widely in all hospitals. Moreover, IHC has been proposed to be a pre-screening tool because of its wide application in clinics. Since the low expression of ALK protein, the sensitivity and specificity of ALK antibody are the keys to the success of IHC screening. Therefore, we compared different antibodies to find the best one for IHC detection.;We evaluated ALK expression by four different ALK antibodies: clone D5F3 (Ventana), clone D5F3 (CST), clone 1A4/1H7 (OriGene Tech.), and clone 5A4 (Abcam) based on manual IHC in a cohort of 60 NSCLCs. The results were compared with those from automated IHC (clone D5F3, Ventana). All cases were evaluated independently by ALK FISH.;32 ALK-positive and 28 ALK-negative NSCLCs were identified by automated IHC (D5F3, Ventana) and FISH analysis. Based on conventional manual IHC, the sensitivity of four antibodies-D5F3 (Ventana), D5F3 (CST), 1A4/1H7 (OriGene Tech.), and 5A4 (Abcam)-was 93.8%, 84.4%, 93.8%, and 56.3%, respectively. Their specificities and positive predictive values were 100%. The percentage of strong-moderate staining was 65.6%, 62.5%, 68.8%, and 21.9%, respectively. Compared with automated IHC (D5F3, Ventana), each staining concordance was 96.7%, 91.7%, 96.7%, and 76.7%, respectively, and each presented staining heterogeneity (weak-moderate-strong intensity).;These data indicated that manual IHC with a more reliable ALK antibody might provide an effective strategy for screening ALK gene rearrangements in all NSCLC patients, followed by confirmatory FISH analysis in IHC-positive cases.",

Allele-specific ALK expression was determined by cDNA cloning and sequencing. Associations of genomic ALK alterations and ALK expression levels with clinical phenotypes and transcriptomic profiles were compared.;Nonsynonymous point mutations of ALK were detected in 21 of 263 neuroblastomas (8%).

Unexpectedly, the WT allele was preferentially expressed in 12 of 21 mutated tumors. Whereas survival of patients with ALK mutated tumors was significantly worse as compared with the entire cohort of WT ALK patients, it was similarly poor in patients with WT ALK tumors in which ALK expression was as high as in ALK mutated neuroblastomas. Global gene expression patterns of tumors with ALK mutations or with high-level WT ALK expression were highly similar, and suggested that ALK may be involved in cellular proliferation in primary neuroblastoma.;Primary neuroblastomas with mutated ALK exhibit high ALK expression levels and strongly resemble neuroblastomas with elevated WT ALK expression levels in both their clinical and molecular phenotypes.

An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.;The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib.

To decipher ALK function in neuroblastoma predisposition and oncogenesis, we have characterized knock-in (KI) mice bearing the two most frequent mutations observed in neuroblastoma patients. A dramatic enlargement of sympathetic ganglia is observed in AlkF1178L mice from embryonic to adult stages associated with an increased proliferation of sympathetic neuroblasts from E14.5 to birth. In a MYCN transgenic context, the F1178L mutation displays a higher oncogenic potential than the R1279Q mutation as evident from a shorter latency of tumor onset. We show that tumors expressing the R1279Q mutation are sensitive to ALK inhibition upon crizotinib treatment. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that activated ALK triggers RET upregulation in mouse sympathetic ganglia at birth as well as in murine and human neuroblastoma. Using vandetanib, we show that RET inhibition strongly impairs tumor growth in vivo in both MYCN/KI AlkR1279Q and MYCN/KI AlkF1178L mice.

The full-length ALK transmembrane receptor of ~220 kDa was identified based on this initial work. This tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligands, the growth factors pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK) are highly expressed during development of the nervous system and other organs. Each of these genes has been implicated in malignant progression of different tumor types and shown to alter phenotypes as well as signal transduction in cultured normal and tumor cells. Beyond its role in cancer, the ALK receptor pathway is thought to contribute to nervous system development, function, and repair, as well as metabolic homeostasis and the maintenance of tissue regeneration. ALK receptor activity in cancer can be up-regulated by amplification, overexpression, ligand binding, mutations in the intracellular domain of the receptor and by activity of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRz. Here we discuss the evidence for ligand control of ALK activity as well as the potential prognostic and therapeutic implications from gene expression and functional studies. An analysis of 18 published gene expression data sets from different cancers shows that overexpression of ALK, its smaller homolog LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase) and the ligands PTN and MK in cancer tissues from patients correlate significantly with worse course and outcome of the disease. This observation together with preclinical functional studies suggests that this pathway could be a valid therapeutic target for which complementary targeting strategies with small molecule kinase inhibitors as well as antibodies to ligands or the receptors may be used.",

This study aimed to define molecular mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib in patients with ALK(+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;We analyzed tissue obtained from 14 patients with ALK(+) NSCLC showing evidence of radiologic progression while on crizotinib to define mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib.;Eleven patients had material evaluable for molecular analysis. Four patients (36%) developed secondary mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK. A novel mutation in the ALK domain, encoding a G1269A amino acid substitution that confers resistance to crizotinib in vitro, was identified in two of these cases. Two patients, one with a resistance mutation, exhibited new onset ALK copy number gain (CNG). One patient showed outgrowth of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC without evidence of a persistent ALK gene rearrangement. Two patients exhibited a KRAS mutation, one of which occurred without evidence of a persisting ALK gene rearrangement. One patient showed the emergence of an ALK gene fusion-negative tumor compared with the baseline sample but with no identifiable alternate driver. Two patients retained ALK positivity with no identifiable resistance mechanism.;Crizotinib resistance in ALK(+) NSCLC occurs through somatic kinase domain mutations, ALK gene fusion CNG, and emergence of separate oncogenic drivers.",

We expressed, in PC12 cells, a chimeric protein in which the extracellular domain of the receptor was replaced by the mouse IgG 2b Fc domain. The Fc domain induced the dimerization and oligomerization of the chimeric protein leading to receptor phosphorylation and activation, thus mimicking the effect of ligand binding, whereas the wild type ALK remained as a monomeric nonphosphorylated protein. Expression of the chimera, but not that of the wild type ALK or of a kinase inactive form of the chimera, induced the differentiation of PC12 cells.

While in clinical trials, PF02341066 has shown a significant therapeutic benefit as a single agent; the effectiveness of combining it with other therapeutic modalities including ionizing radiation remains unknown. To further elucidate the role of PF02341066 in tumor inhibition, we examined its effects alone and in combination with radiation on downstream signaling, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity in two NSCLC cell lines in vitro: H3122, which harbors the EML4-ALK fusion, and H460, which does not. We also examined the in vivo effects of PF02341066 in H3122 mouse xenografts. In the H3122 cell line, PF02341066 inhibited phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream effectors: AKT, ERK, and STAT3. H3122 cells treated with a combination of PF02341066 and radiation showed an increase in cellular apoptosis and were sensitized to radiation therapy (dose enhancement ratio, 1.43; P < 0.0001). Moreover, in an H3122 xenograft model, the combined treatment resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition than either treatment alone (P < 0.05). None of these effects was observed in the EML4-ALK-negative H460 cells.

We present the first study to date describing the cytomorphology of NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangements. A retrospective database search was conducted to identify cytologic specimens of NSCLC demonstrating ALK rearrangement. Cytogenetic analysis was performed with fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ALK rearrangements were identified in cells with unique cytologic characteristics. All cases demonstrated moderate to poor differentiation with a predominance of single cells showing anisonucleosis and frequent intracytoplasmic neutrophils. The control cases showed cells with smaller, less pleomorphic nuclei, and smaller nucleoli with more clusters/tissue fragments. Several unique cytomorphologic features were consistently identified in the study population relative to the control population and include a prominence of single, markedly enlarged tumor cells with plasmacytoid features and anisonucleosis, as well as intracytoplasmic neutrophils.

Hence, in the present study computational approaches have been employed alongside KINOMEscan profiling technique to reveal the mechanism behind crizotinib resistance in ALK at a molecular level. The results of our analysis indicate that C1156Y mutation alters the conformation of the ALK binding pocket residues which results in a marked decrease in hydrogen bond interactions between crizotinib and ALK. This indicates that hydrogen bonding was a crucial effector of decreased binding affinity. Interestingly, the docking study also indicates that C1156Y mutation increases the affinity for ATP. Finally, our analysis theoretically suggests that M-1199 is a key residue responsible for the ALK drug selectivity. We certainly believe that these results may be immense importance for the molecular level understanding of crizotinib resistance pattern and also for designing a potential drug molecule for the treatment of lung cancer in the near future.

Recently, zinc has been shown to activate the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, independently of neurotrophins. This activation occurs via increasing the Src family kinase activity. In the present study, we investigated whether the ALK activity could be modulated by extracellular zinc. We first showed that zinc alone rapidly activates ALK. This activation is dependent of ALK tyrosine kinase activity and dimerization of the receptor but is independent of Src family kinase activity. In contrast, addition of sodium pyrithione, a zinc ionophore, led to a further activation of ALK. This stronger activation is dependent of Src family kinase but independent of ALK activity and dimerization. In conclusion, zinc could constitute an endogenous ligand of ALK in vertebrates.",

Since the first description of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) rearrangement in 4% of cases of non-small-cell lung cancer in 2007, a highly potent and selective ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, was developed and approved in record time. However, it soon became apparent that although the responses can be dramatic and durable and primary intrinsic resistance to crizotinib is uncommon, the emergence of secondary resistance is inevitable. Efforts to elucidate the specific mechanisms that confer acquired resistance to crizotinib are underway. These have led to the recognition of the role of secondary resistance mutations, of ALK amplification, and of activation of bypass signaling, all of which contribute to resistance to crizotinib. Moreover, the rapid preclinical and clinical development of multiple second-generation ALK inhibitors that exhibit significant clinical activity against crizotinib-resistant disease has provided multiple options to treating physicians, with the ultimate goal the delivery of tailored medicine.",

All cases were reviewed both histologically and immunohistochemically with a wide panel of antibodies using the standard protocols in order to diagnose them according to the latest WHO classification systems. A positive cut-off value was determined, both by comparison with diagnostic categories with and without ALK translocations, as well as with negative controls.;The ALK FISH probe suffered a 33% non-informative rate, but in informative cases it showed 94% concordance with the ALK-1 immunostain. A minimum cut-off value of 5 in 200 informative cells was adopted to make a positive call in each case. Of the ALK-1 immunoreactive lesions, nine lymphomas were concordantly ALK translocation-positive but one vesical inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor was discordantly FISH-negative. Among the ALK-1-immunonegative lesions, one case each of anaplastic lymphoma and pulmonary mycobacterial spindle cell pseudotumor were discordantly ALK FISH-positive, while a case each of intestinal myeloblastic tumor and ganglioglioma showed initial--but not reproducible--positive FISH readings. The remaining cases were concordantly negative.;The discrepancies between ALK FISH results and well-established immunomorphological parameters indicate that interpretation is not always straightforward. Notably, the derivation of threshold cut-off values for positive calls on FISH assays has seldom been addressed in the literature, and has raised issues in interpreting cases with borderline positivity in this study. The factors that may influence such cut-off values are extensively reviewed.;We propose the term 'conditional threshold positivity' to encourage the adoption of different cut-off values for making positive calls in lesions of different origin.",

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a clinically applicable cost-effective test that is sensitive and specific for ALK protein expression. The purpose of this study was to assemble an international team of expert pathologists to evaluate a new automated standardized ALK IHC assay.;Archival NSCLC tumor specimens (n =103) previously tested for ALK rearrangement by FISH were provided by the international collaborators. These specimens were stained by IHC with the anti-ALK (D5F3) primary antibody combined with OptiView DAB IHC detection and OptiView amplification (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Specimens were scored binarily as positive if strong granular cytoplasmic brown staining was present in tumor cells. IHC results were compared with the FISH results and interevaluator comparisons made.;Overall for the 100 evaluable cases the ALK IHC assay was highly sensitive (90%), specific (95%), and accurate relative (93%) to the ALK FISH results. Similar results were observed using a majority score. IHC negativity was scored by seven of seven and six of seven evaluators on three and two FISH-positive cases, respectively. IHC positivity was scored on two FISH-negative cases by seven of seven readers. There was agreement among seven of seven and six of seven readers on 88% and 96% of the cases before review, respectively, and after review there was agreement among seven of seven and six of seven on 95% and 97% of the cases, respectively.;On the basis of expert evaluation the ALK IHC test is sensitive, specific, and accurate, and a majority score of multiple readers does not improve these results over an individual reader's score.

Despite its outstanding safety and efficacy, several resistant mutations against crizotinib have been detected in the treatment of NSCLC. However, in contrast to the widely accepted mechanism of steric hindrance by mutations at the active site, the mechanism by which the C1156Y non-active site mutation confers resistance against crizotinib remains unclear. In the present study, the resistance mechanism of C1156Y in ALK was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest that despite the non-active site mutation, C1156Y causes the dislocation of crizotinib as well as the indirect conformational changes in the binding cavity, which results in a marked decrease in the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between crizotinib and ALK. The obtained results provide a detailed explanation of the resistance caused by C1156Y and may give a vital clue for the design of drugs to combat crizotinib resistance.",

Over the last several decades, there have been many advances in both surgical approaches and systemic therapies for the treatment of NSCLC, but the prognosis for advanced disease remains poor. New research, however, is exploring the use of targeted therapies for the treatment of NSCLC. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is involved in normal mammalian central nervous system development. A novel fusion gene involving ALK and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene has been associated with approximately 5% of NSCLCs and is mutually exclusive of other oncogenic driver mutations. Targeted therapies against this ALK rearrangement are a relatively new treatment modality that aims to improve the prognosis of patients with late-stage disease. Two such drugs have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval currently: Crizotinib and Ceritinib. Many other ALK inhibitors are currently being studied in clinical trials as well. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive review of ALK inhibitors for use in NSCLC as well as the future directions and challenges to developing these targeted therapies. ",

The efficacy and safety of ALK-TKIs, including crizotinib and alectinib, as the first-line treatment in critically ill patients is unclear. We report one ALK-positive NSCLC patient with poor performance status (PS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation because of respiratory failure and multiple metastases, and experienced the rapid and dramatic response to alectinib without adverse events that can lead to discontinuation and dose reduction of the drug. After a couple of months of treatment with alectinib, radiological review indicated a complete response. The present case is the first reported case of rapid and marked response to alectinib in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had poor PS and severe organ dysfunction, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Further investigation of the safety and efficacy of ALK-TKI for ALK-positive NSCLC patients who are critically ill is warranted. ",

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), the gene encoding a tyrosine receptor kinase whose inadvertent activation is the cause of many cancers, is implicated in synapse formation and cognitive functions. In particular, Alk genetically interacts with Neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) to regulate growth and associative learning in flies. We show that Alk mutants have increased sleep. Using a targeted RNAi screen we localized the negative effects of Alk on sleep to the mushroom body, a structure important for both sleep and memory. We also report that mutations in Nf1 produce a sexually dimorphic short sleep phenotype, and suppress the long sleep phenotype of Alk. Thus Alk and Nf1 interact in both learning and sleep regulation, highlighting a common pathway in these two processes. ",

The present report describes a detailed immunocytochemical study of the distribution and localization of human LSP1 in both normal and neoplastic cells and tissues. The specificity of the monoclonal anti-LSP1 reagent was confirmed by expression cloning and transfection studies. The intracellular 60 000 MW LSP1 protein was found to be present in peripheral blood B cells, monocytes and granulocytes but absent in a subpopulation of circulating T cells (10-15% of CD3-positive T cells). The presence of LSP1 protein in medullary thymocytes, but only in scattered cortical thymocytes, provided additional evidence for heterogeneity of expression in T cells. Novel observations also included the presence of LSP1 in plasma cells, dendritic cells and Langerhans' cells. The leucocyte-restricted distribution of LSP1 protein means that it may play an important role in haematopathology. LSP1 protein was detected in a wide range of leukaemias and lymphomas, particularly of B-cell origin, and in tumour cells in classical Hodgkin's disease. Of interest was the indication of a reciprocal relationship in the expression of LSP1 and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) proteins in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

In contrast, the frequency of PTC cases with point mutations (mainly BRAF(V600E)) was significantly lower in patients with relatively higher radiation exposure than those with lower radiation exposure. We also found that among ABS, the frequency of PTC cases with no detectable gene alterations in RET, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1), BRAF, or RAS was significantly higher in patients with relatively higher radiation exposure than those with lower radiation exposure. However, in ABS with PTC, the relationship between the presence of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fused with other gene partners and radiation exposure has received little study. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the relative frequency of rearranged ALK in ABS with PTC, and with no detectable gene alterations in RET, NTRK1, BRAF, or RAS, would be greater in those having relatively higher radiation exposures.;The 105 subjects in the study were drawn from the Life Span Study cohort of ABS of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were diagnosed with PTC between 1956 and 1993. Seventy-nine were exposed (>0 mGy), and 26 were not exposed to A-bomb radiation. In the 25 ABS with PTC, and with no detectable gene alterations in RET, NTRK1, BRAF, or RAS, we examined archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTC specimens for rearrangement of ALK using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE).;We found rearranged ALK in 10 of 19 radiation-exposed PTC cases, but none among 6 patients with PTC with no radiation exposure. In addition, solid/trabecular-like architecture in PTC was closely associated with ALK rearrangements, being observed in 6 of 10 PTC cases with ALK rearrangements versus 2 of 15 cases with no ALK rearrangements. The six radiation-exposed cases of PTC harboring both ALK rearrangements and solid/trabecular-like architecture were associated with higher radiation doses and younger ages at the time of the A-bombing and at diagnosis compared to the other 19 PTC with no detectable gene alterations.;Our findings suggest that ALK rearrangements are involved in the development of radiation-induced adult-onset PTC.",

Here, we characterize a full-length normal human ALK cDNA and its product, and determine the pattern of expression of its murine homologue in embryonic and adult tissues as a first step toward the functional assessment of the receptor. Analysis of the 6226 bp ALK cDNA identified an open reading frame encoding a 1620-amino acid (aa) protein of predicted mass approximately 177 kDa that is most closely related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), the two exhibiting 57% aa identity and 71% similarity over their region of overlap. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the approximately 177 kDa ALK polypeptide core undergoes co-translational N-linked glycosylation, emerging in its mature form as a 200 kDa single chain receptor. Surface labeling studies indicated that the 200 kDa glycoprotein is exposed at the cell membrane, consistent with the prediction that ALK serves as the receptor for an unidentified ligand(s). In situ hybridization studies revealed Alk expression beginning on embryonic day 11 and persisting into the neonatal and adult periods of development. Alk transcripts were confined to the nervous system and included several thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei; the trigeminal, facial, and acoustic cranial ganglia; the anterior horns of the spinal cord in the region of the developing motor neurons; the sympathetic chain; and the ganglion cells of the gut. Thus, ALK is a novel orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that appears to play an important role in the normal development and function of the nervous system.",

Biochemical and functional analysis showed that both full-length ALK and FN1-ALK are oncogenic, and tumors expressing ALK or FN1-ALK are sensitive to ALK kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian tumor tissue microarray detected aberrant ALK expression in 2% to 4% serous carcinoma patients.

Besides rare mycosis fungoides (n = 3), which shared typical clinicopathologic lesions, nonepidermotropic large-cell lymphomas (n = 18) were predominant. They frequently presented as a solitary nodule or tumor. Seven of the eight large T-cell lymphomas had a CD30-positive (CD30+) phenotype but did not express ALK protein. Overexpression of p53 protein was observed in six cases. Although EBV-EBER transcripts were detected in two of them, LMP1 protein was absent. Except for their original prevalence, the features of these T-cell CD30+ cutaneous lymphomas were the same as in immunocompetent patients. The 10 B-cell cutaneous lymphoma were immunoblastic or centroblastic lymphomas, with a differential expression of BCL-6 and Syndecan. Four of them expressed CD30, EBER-EBV transcripts, and LMP1 and p53 proteins. This B-cell CD30+ EBV+ phenotype contrasts with cutaneous lymphoma in immunocompetent patients. Human herpesvirus 8 was not involved in lymphomagenesis since its sequences were detected in a single patient with Kaposi's sarcoma and Castleman's disease. These lymphomas occurred in severely immunocompromised patients with a low CD4 count. Death was due to immunodepression rather than to lymphoma spread, suggesting avoiding aggressive immunosuppressive treatment in such patients.",

The small molecule ceritinib can overcome drug-resistance mutations that are observed in crizotinib-resistant patients, although the detailed mechanism for this ability of ceritinib remains elusive. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of six systems (including the apo ALK, the wild-type ALK-ceritinib complex, as well as four complexes of ceritinib with the I1171T, L1196M, S1206Y, and G1269A mutants of ALK, respectively) together with the subsequent molecular mechanics-generalized Born/surface area binding free energy calculations were performed to answer this question. Principal component analysis and domain cross-correlation analysis of MD trajectories revealed that ceritinib binding stabilized the conformational dynamics of both the wild-type and the four mutated ALKs as compared to the apo ALK. Moreover, the mutations had subtle effects on the conformation of ALK compared to that of the wild-type ALK. Importantly, binding free energy calculations demonstrated that, compared its effect on the wild-type ALK, ceritinib showed slightly increased potency towards the I1171T, L1196M, S1206Y, and G1269A mutants. Therefore, the binding of ceritinib to the four mutants can overcome crizotinib-resistant mutations.

Many findings have revealed a complex scenario of NPM functions and interactions, pointing to proliferative and growth-suppressive roles of this molecule. The gene NPM1 that encodes for nucleophosmin (NPM1) is translocated or mutated in various lymphomas and leukemias, forming fusion proteins (NPM-ALK, NPM-RARalpha, NPM-MLF1) or NPM mutant products. Here, we review the structure and functions of NPM, as well as the biological, clinical and pathological features of human hematologic malignancies with NPM1 gene alterations. NPM-ALK indentifies a new category of T/Null lymphomas with distinctive molecular and clinico-pathological features, that is going to be included as a novel disease entity (ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma) in the new WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. NPM1 mutations occur specifically in about 30% of adult de novo AML and cause aberrant cytoplasmic expression of NPM (hence the term NPMc+ AML). NPMc+ AML associates with normal karyotpe, and shows wide morphological spectrum, multilineage involvement, a unique gene expression signature, a high frequency of FLT3-internal tandem duplications, and distinctive clinical and prognostic features. The availability of specific antibodies and molecular techniques for the detection of NPM1 gene alterations has an enormous impact in the biological study diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and monitoring of minimal residual disease of various lymphomas and leukemias. The discovery of NPM1 gene alterations also represents the rationale basis for development of molecular targeted drugs.",

Mutation of the gatekeeper residue, a key structural determinant influencing inhibitor binding, rendered the fusion protein, NPM/ALK, sensitive to inhibition by SKI-606 in the nanomolar range, while PD173955 inhibited the NPM/ALK mutant at micromolar concentrations. In contrast, both wild type and mutant NPM/ALK were insensitive to imatinib.

Seventy-seven surgically resected cases, including 53 primary and 24 metastatic tumors from different sites, were evaluated for napsin-A, TTF-1, and ALK by immunohistochemistry and for EGFR mutations by direct sequencing. Overall, napsin-A expression in primary lung mucin-producing adenocarcinomas was 36% (8% mucinous, 17% colloid, 87.5% solid, and 100% signet ring cell) and TTF-1 expression reached an overall figure of 42% (12.5% mucinous, 33% colloid, 87.5% solid, and 100% signet ring cell). Metastatic mucinous adenocarcinomas did not react with napsin-A or with TTF-1. All primary and metastatic tumors lacked EGFR mutations, while a single case of signet ring cell lung adenocarcinoma showed ALK expression and rearrangement at fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Napsin-A has a lower sensitivity compared with TTF-1 in primary mucin-producing adenocarcinomas of the lung. However, both antibodies have an absolute specificity, being always negative in metastatic mucinous adenocarcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase essentially and transiently expressed in specific areas of the developing central and peripheral nervous systems. We previously demonstrated that a membrane-bound and constitutively active form of the ALK protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain induced the neuron-like differentiation of PC12 cells through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway. Its PTK domain had been originally identified in a nucleo-cytosolic and constitutively active transforming protein, NPM-ALK. Downstream targets involved in oncogenic proliferation and survival processes have been proposed to include phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/AKT, STAT 3/5 and Src. We therefore postulated that activation of specific signaling pathways leading to differentiation or proliferation can be differently controlled depending on the subcellular localization of ALK PTK domain. To increase knowledge of its physiological role in the nervous system, we focused in the present study on the influence of its subcellular localization on neuronal differentiation. To achieve this goal, we characterized biological responses and transduction pathways in PC12 cells elicited by various constructs encoding membrane-bound (through transmembrane or myristyl sequences) or cytosolic ALK-derived proteins. In order to control the activation of their PTK domain, we used an inducible dimerization system. Here, we demonstrate that membrane attachment of the ALK PTK domain, in PC12 cells, is crucial for initiation of neurite outgrowth and proliferation arrest through a decrease of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, we show that this differentiation process relies on specific and sustained activation of ERK 1/2 proteins. By contrast, activation of the cytosolic form of this domain fails to induce MAP kinase activation and cell differentiation but promotes a PI 3-kinase/AKT-dependent PC12 cell proliferation. These data indicate that subcellular localization of the ALK PTK domain was a determinant for the control and specificity of downstream transduction cascades and was crucial for deciding the fate to which the neuronal cell will be committed.",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histological type of lung cancer. Recently, the advances in the molecular biology have transformed our view of NSCLC from histopathological descriptions to precise molecular and genetic identities that can be resolved to single-cell level. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the most crucial tumor driver genes in NSCLC. Their tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can significantly improve survival of these patients, who have these driver genes' mutation. Unfortunately, drug resistance would inevitably occur after almost all of initial targeted therapy. The resistance mechanism and corresponding methods on EGFR-TKIs have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be discussed. We will focus on the mechanism of first generation ALK TKI (crizotinib) resistance in patients with ALK positive NSCLC. Likewise, we will also discuss the current therapies for ALK positive NSCLC patients after crizotinib resistance. ;肺癌是全球发病率和致死率最高的疾病之一。非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）是肺癌最为常见的组织学类型。近些年，分子生物学的发展让我们对NSCLC的认识从组织水平深入到分子水平。表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）基因突变和间变性淋巴瘤激酶（anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK）融合基因是NSCLC患者最为重要的两个肿瘤驱动基因。针对它们的酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs）显著改善了带有这类分子特征的NSCLC患者的生存。不幸的是，目前几乎所有针对这两种突变的初始靶向治疗都会不可避免地出现耐药问题。有关EGFR-TKIs的耐药机制及其应对策略已经有很多文章进行阐述，而对于ALK TKIs治疗后出现耐药问题的机制和相应的治疗策略还未曾有过详细的综述。因此，本文针对一代ALK TKI（克唑替尼）治疗ALK融合基因阳性的NSCLC患者（ALK+ NSCLC）后引起耐药问题的机制和有关后续治疗策略做一综述。",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pharmacologic agents that target protein products of oncogenes in tumors are playing an increasing clinical role in the treatment of cancer. Currently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent the standard of care for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations. Subsequently other genetic abnormalities with \"driver\" characteristics - implying transforming and tumor maintenance capabilities have been extensively reported in several small distinct subsets of NSCLC. Among these rare genetic changes, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements, most often consisting in a chromosome 2 inversion leading to a fusion with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) gene, results in the abnormal expression and activation of this tyrosine kinase in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. This rearrangement occurs in 2-5% of NSCLC, predominantly in young (50 years or younger), never- or former-smokers with adenocarcinoma. This aberration most commonly occurs a independently of EGFR and KRAS gene mutations. A fluorescent in situ hybridization assay was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the standard method for the detection of ALK gene rearrangement in clinical practice and is considered the gold standard. Crizotinib, a first-in-class dual ALK and c-MET inhibitor, has been shown to be particularly effective against ALK positive NSCLC, showing dramatic and prolonged responses with low toxicity, predominantly restricted to the gastro-intestinal and visual systems, and generally self-limiting or easily managed. However, resistance to crizotinib inevitably emerges. The molecular mechanisms of resistance are currently under investigation, as are therapeutic approaches including crizotinib-based combination therapy and novel agents such as Hsp90 inhibitors. This review aims to present the current knowledge on this fusion gene, the clinic-pathological profile of ALK rearranged NSCLC, and to review the existing literature on ALK inhibitors, focusing on their role in the treatment of NSCLC.",

To evaluate potential treatment strategies for lung cancers driven by an activated EML4-ALK chimeric oncogene, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model that phenocopies the human disease where this rearranged gene arises. In this model, the ALK kinase inhibitor TAE684 produced greater tumor regression and improved overall survival compared with carboplatin and paclitaxel, representing clinical standard of care. 18F-FDG-PET-CT scans revealed almost complete inhibition of tumor metabolic activity within 24 hours of TAE684 exposure. In contrast, combined inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways did not result in significant tumor regression. We identified EML4-ALK in complex with multiple cellular chaperones including HSP90. In support of a functional reliance, treatment with geldanamycin-based HSP90 inhibitors resulted in rapid degradation of EML4-ALK in vitro and substantial, albeit transient, tumor regression in vivo. Taken together, our findings define a murine model that offers a reliable platform for the preclinical comparison of combinatorial treatment approaches for lung cancer characterized by ALK rearrangement.",

However, specific histomorphological features that differentiate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged tumors from ALK-negative tumors have not been fully evaluated. Eighty ALK-rearranged and 213 ALK-negative (91 epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated; 29 K-ras-mutated; 93 triple-negative) resected lung adenocarcinomas were analyzed for several histomorphological parameters and histological subtype. ALK-rearranged tumors were associated with younger age at presentation, frequent nodal metastasis, and higher stage of disease at diagnosis. ALK-rearranged tumors were more likely to show a solid predominant pattern than ALK-negative tumors (43.8%; 35/80; p<0.001). Unlike ALK-negative tumors, a lepidic predominant pattern was not observed in ALK-rearranged tumors (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, the most significant morphological features that distinguished ALK-rearranged tumors from ALK-negative tumors were cribriform formation (odds ratio [OR], 3.253; p = 0.028), presence of mucin-containing cells (OR, 4.899; p = 0.008), close relationship to adjacent bronchioles (OR, 5.361; p = 0.001), presence of psammoma bodies (OR, 4.026; p = 0.002), and a solid predominant pattern (OR, 13.685; p = 0.023). ALK-rearranged tumors exhibited invasive histomorphological features, aggressive behavior and frequent expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (loss of E-cadherin and expression of vimentin) compared with other genotype (p = 0.015). Spatial proximity between bronchus and ALK-rearranged tumors and frequent solid histologic subtype with p63 expression may cause diagnostic difficulties to differentiate squamous cell carcinoma in the small biopsy, whereas p40 was rarely expressed in ALK-rearranged adenocarcinoma.

The cytogenetic results were reviewed in correlation with the final pathologic diagnosis. A diagnosis of lymphoma was established in 94 cases, with 16 Hodgkin lymphomas and 78 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Cytogenetic results were obtained in 63 NHLs (81%); 61 of those showed abnormal karyotypes (97%). The t(14;18) or IGH-BCL2 fusion was detected in 83% (20/24) of follicular lymphomas and in 57% (12/21) of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). The application of interphase FISH and SKY has contributed to a high detection rate of t(14;18) in DLBCLs. This study showed that genes at 1q25, 3p21, 3q21, 5q31, 6p23, 7q22, 8q11 approximately q12, 9q34, 11q23, 12q13, and 19q13.1 may have been involved as the less common changes in follicular lymphoma and DLBCL. Comparison of the recurrent secondary aberrations in the groups of follicular lymphoma and DLBCL revealed a pattern of clonal evolution from the changes rea(1)(p36), del(6q), +7, +12 or dup or trp(12)(q13q22), +der(18)t(14;18), and +21 in follicular lymphoma to the changes rea(1)(p36), del(6q), +6, +7, +9, rea(11)(q23), +12, -13 or del(13(q12q14), +18, +21, and +X in DLBCL. The clonal evolution of the secondary aberrations is thought to contribute to the progression of the disease. About 90% (16/18) of other types of NHL had abnormal karyotypes showing specific translocations or gene rearrangements consistent with the pathologic diagnosis. A comprehensive cytogenetics approach including SKY and interphase FISH using probes for specific genes, such as IGH, BCL2, CCND1, and ALK, is a very useful ancillary diagnostic tool for lymphomas. The combined approach also led to the identification of t(2;19)(p23;q13.1) as a new variant of t(2;5)(p23;q35) in a case of Ki-1-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with a null cell phenotype.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The evolution of personalised medicine in lung cancer has dramatically impacted diagnostic pathology. Current challenges centre on the growing demands placed on small tissue samples by molecular diagnostic techniques. In this review, expert recommendations are provided regarding successful identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Steps to correctly process and conserve tumour tissue during diagnostic testing are essential to ensure tissue availability. For example, storing extra tissue sections ready for molecular diagnostic steps allows faster testing and preserves tissue. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) is commonly used to detect ALK rearrangements, with most laboratories favouring screening by immunohistochemistry followed by a confirmatory FISH assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction can also identify ALK fusion gene mRNA transcripts but can be limited by the quality of RNA and the risk that rare fusion variants may not be captured. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has recently provided an alternative method for detecting ALK rearrangements. While current experience is limited, NGS is set to become the most efficient approach as an increasing number of genetic abnormalities is required to be tested. Upfront, reflex testing for ALK gene rearrangement should become routine as ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy moves into the first-line setting. Guidelines recommend that EGFR and ALK tests are carried out in parallel on all confirmed and potential adenocarcinomas, and this is more efficient in terms of tissue usage and testing turnaround time for both of these actionable gene alterations. The practice of sequential testing is not recommended. Identification of ALK rearrangements is now essential for the diagnosis of NSCLC, underpinned by the benefits of ALK inhibitors. As scientific understanding and diagnostic technology develops, ALK testing will continue to be an evolving and challenging paradigm. ",

We retrospectively retrieved 30 cases of poorly differentiated NB and constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs). ALK copy number changes were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, and ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing was performed using three different antibodies (ALK1, D5F3, and 5A4 clones). ALK amplification and copy number gain were observed in 10% (3/30) and 53.3% (16/30) of the cohort, respectively. There were positive correlations between ALK copy number and IHC positive rate in ALK1 and 5A4 antibodies (p= < 0.001 and 0.019, respectively). ALK1, D5F3, and 5A4 antibodies equally showed 100% sensitivity in detecting ALK amplification. However, the sensitivity for detecting copy number gain differed among the three antibodies, with 75% sensitivity in D5F3 and 0% sensitivity in ALK1. ALK-amplified NBs were correlated with synchronous MYCN amplification and chromosome 1p deletion. ALK IHC positivity was frequently observed in INSS stage IV and high-risk group patients. In conclusion, this study identified that an increase in the ALK copy number is a frequent genetic alteration in poorly differentiated NB. ALK-amplified NBs showed consistent ALK IHC positivity with all kinds of antibodies. In contrast, the detection performance of ALK copy number gain was antibody dependent, with the D5F3 antibody showing the best sensitivity.",

Recently chromosomal rearrangements involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have been implicated in this tumor. We have studied a case of ALK-positive soft tissue IMT showing clinical and morphologic features of malignancy. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated ALK rearrangements in both primary and metastatic lesions. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'RACE) identified cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) gene fused to ALK, which predicts an in-frame chimeric protein with the preserved functional catalytic domain of ALK at the C terminus. Amplification and sequencing of tumor DNA confirmed the breakpoint at the genomic level. Restriction analysis of DNA from primary soft tissue and recurrent lung tumors showed identical patterns, indicating the same clonal origin of both lesions. Western blot analysis with C-terminus ALK antibody showed expression of an aberrantly sized chimeric protein of approximately 130 kd in tumor tissue. This is the second case of IMT demonstrating CARS as the ALK fusion partner, which confirms the recurring involvement of ALK in IMT by a common genetic mechanism. Moreover, identical clonality of separate lesions involving different sites supports metastasis in IMT.",

We have determined that Alk is associated with altered behavioral responses to ethanol in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, in mice, and in humans. Mutant flies containing transposon insertions in dAlk demonstrate increased resistance to the sedating effect of ethanol. Database analyses revealed that Alk expression levels in the brains of recombinant inbred mice are negatively correlated with ethanol-induced ataxia and ethanol consumption. We therefore tested Alk gene knockout mice and found that they sedate longer in response to high doses of ethanol and consume more ethanol than wild-type mice. Finally, sequencing of human ALK led to the discovery of four polymorphisms associated with a low level of response to ethanol, an intermediate phenotype that is predictive of future alcohol use disorders (AUDs). These results suggest that Alk plays an evolutionary conserved role in ethanol-related behaviors. Moreover, ALK may be a novel candidate gene conferring risk for AUDs as well as a potential target for pharmacological intervention.",

Here we report that cell lines and native tissues derived from the NPM/ALK-expressing T-cell lymphoma (ALK+ TCL) display phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 complex. Transfection of BaF3 cells with NPM/ALK induces phosphorylation of EKR1/2 and of its direct activator mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK) 1/2. Depletion of NPM/ALK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or its inhibition by WHI-154 abrogates the MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The NPM/ALK-induced MEK/ERK activation is independent of c-Raf as evidenced by the lack of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon c-Raf inactivation by two different inhibitors, RI and ZM336372, and by its siRNA-mediated depletion. In contrast, ERK1/2 activation is strictly MEK1/2 dependent as shown by suppression of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. The U0126-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 activation impaired proliferation and viability of the ALK+ TCL cells and expression of antiapoptotic factor Bcl-xL and cell cycle-promoting CDK4 and phospho-RB. Finally, siRNA-mediated depletion of both ERK1 and ERK2 inhibited cell proliferation, whereas depletion of ERK 1 (but not ERK2) markedly increased cell apoptosis. These findings identify MEK/ERK as a new signaling pathway activated by NPM/ALK and indicate that the pathway represents a novel therapeutic target in the ALK-induced malignancies.",

Currently, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is considered to be the standard method for assessing formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue for ALK inversions and translocations. However, FISH requires a specialized equipment, the signals fade rapidly and it is difficult to detect overall morphology and tumor heterogeneity. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) has been successfully introduced as an alternative test for the detection of several genetic aberrations. This study validates a newly developed ALK CISH assay by comparing FISH and CISH signal patterns in lung cancer samples with and without ALK rearrangements. One hundred adenocarcinomas of the lung were included in this study, among them 17 with known ALK rearrangement. FISH and CISH were carried out and evaluated according to the manufacturers' recommendations. For both assays, tumors were considered positive if ≥15% of tumor cells showed either isolated 3' signals or break-apart patterns or a combination of both. A subset of tumors was exemplarily examined by using a novel EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) CISH probe. Red, green and fusion CISH signals were clearcut and different signal patterns were easily recognized. The percentage of aberrant tumor cells was statistically highly correlated (P<0.001) between FISH and CISH. On the basis of 86 samples that were evaluable by ALK CISH, we found a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity of this assay. Furthermore, EML4 rearrangements could be recognized by CISH. CISH is a highly reliable, sensitive and specific method for the detection of ALK gene rearrangements in pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Our results suggest that CISH might serve as a suitable alternative to FISH, which is the current gold standard. ",

The inhibition of NPM/ALK activity resulted in malignant T cells in suppression of their growth, induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, the key effector of the NPM/ALK-induced oncogenesis. We also show that the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated in the malignant T cells by NPM/ALK independently of Jak3 kinase as evidenced by the presence of STAT3 phosphorylation in the NPM/ALK-transfected BaF3 cells that do not express detectable Jak3 and in the NPM/ALK-positive malignant T cells with either Jak3 activity impaired by a pan-Jak or Jak3-selective inhibitor or Jak3 expression abrogated by Jak3 siRNA.

Although heterozygous KI mice did not reproduce the severe breathing and feeding difficulties observed in human patients, behavioral tests documented a reduced activity during dark phases and an increased anxiety of mutated mice. Matings of heterozygotes yielded the expected proportions of wild-type, heterozygotes and homozygotes at birth but a high neonatal lethality was noticed for homozygotes. We documented Alk expression in several motor nuclei of the brainstem involved in the control of sucking and swallowing. Evaluation of basic physiological functions 12 hours after birth revealed slightly more apneas but a dramatic reduced milk intake for homozygotes compared to control littermates.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of ALK and c-Met in the neural retinas of human, non-human primate, dog, rat, and mouse was used to aid in the animal model selection. ALK IHC staining was identified predominantly in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers of most species evaluated, in the inner plexiform layer in human and rodent, and in the nerve fiber layer in human and rat only. There was no apparent staining of any layer of the neural retina for c-Met in any of the species evaluated. ERG measurements identified a significant reduction in b-wave amplitude during the initial phase of dark adaptation in the crizotinib-treated rats.

ERG effects were not observed in PF-06463922-treated animals when comparable exposures in the vitreous humor were achieved.

Despite the impressive efficacy of crizotinib in the treatment of ALK‑positive lung cancer, acquired resistance eventually develops in the majority of patients. The microRNA (miR)‑200c reverses the resistance of lung cancer cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs and molecular targeted drugs, however, whether it can reverse the resistance of crizotinib remains unknown. The present study established a crizotinib resistant cell line (NCI‑2228/CRI), which was derived from the parental NCI‑2228 cell line by long‑term exposure to increasing concentrations of crizotinib. Through overexpression and suppression of miR‑200c expression, the characteristics associated with epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), including morphology, EMT marker proteins and cellular mobility, were investigated. Cell viability and invasion assays demonstrated that high expression of miR‑200c significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of NCI‑2228 cells compared with the negative control. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR‑200c directly targeted the 3'‑untranslated region of zinc finger E‑box binding homeobox 1. Additionally, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the mRNA levels of N‑cadherin and Vimentin were decreased in NCI‑2228 cells transfected with miR‑200c mimic compared with negative control cells, whereas the mRNA level of E‑cadherin was increased. In addition, EMT was reversed by miR‑200c, which suggests that miR‑200c may serve a role in mediating the sensitivity of NCI‑2228/CRI cells to crizotinib. The present study may therefore contribute to improving the sensitivity of ALK positive lung cancer cells to crizotinib.",

Pseudoprogression (PsP) due to radiation necrosis during alecitnib treatment of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from ALK-rearranged NSCLC as been reported. Hence, distinguishing radiation-related PsP from alectinib-induced radiographic changes is important to avoid erroneous early trial discontinuation and abandonment of an effective treatment. However, it remains difficult to assess casuality of radiation necrosis is related to recent direct radiation or induced by alectinib treatment or both. It is also unknown how long from previous radiation can alectinib still induce radiation necrosis. Here we reported a crizotinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC patient who develop radiation necrosis in one of his metastatic CNS lesions after approximately 12 months of alectinib treatment who otherwise had on-going CNS response on alectinib. His most recent radiation to his CNS metastases was 7 years prior to the start of alectinib. This case illustrates that in the setting of pror CNS radiation, given the significant clinical activity of alectinib in CNS metastases in ALK-positive NSCLC patients the risk of CNS radiation necrosis remains long after previous radiation to the CNS metastases has been completed and can occur after durable response of treatment.

The oncogenic role of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is well characterized in many hematopoietic and solid tumors. ALK expression in ovarian carcinoma has been reported but the exact status of ALK protein and its association with clinicopathologic features requires further investigation. ALK expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 110 primary ovarian carcinomas, including 85 cases of serous carcinoma and 25 cases of mucinous carcinoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used for evaluating ALK translocation in ALK-positive ovarian carcinomas. Among 110 ovarian carcinomas, 23 (20.9%) cases were ALK positive by immunohistochemistry. All ALK-positive cases were ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. ALK expression was detected in 23/85 (27.1%) ovarian serous carcinoma and 0/25 (0%) in ovarian mucinous carcinoma. None of the 23 ALK IHC-positive cases harbored ALK gene translocations by FISH or RT-PCR. ALK protein expression was associated with patient age, tumor stage, and histologic type. Specifically, the probability of ALK protein expression was significantly higher in high-grade serous carcinomas in older patients (above 50 y) with advanced disease (FIGO stage III and IV) compared with the low-grade serous and mucinous carcinomas in younger patients with relatively early disease. In conclusion, aberrant ALK expression is observed in ovarian serous carcinoma but not in mucinous carcinoma, is independent of gene translocation, and might be associated with progression and prognosis.

Evaluation of adult ALK homozygotes (HOs) revealed an age-dependent increase in basal hippocampal progenitor proliferation and alterations in behavioral tests consistent with a role for this receptor in the adult brain. ALK HO animals displayed an increased struggle time in the tail suspension test and the Porsolt swim test and enhanced performance in a novel object-recognition test. Neurochemical analysis demonstrates an increase in basal dopaminergic signalling selectively within the frontal cortex. Altogether, these results suggest that ALK functions in the adult brain to regulate the function of the frontal cortex and hippocampus and identifies ALK as a new target for psychiatric indications, such as schizophrenia and depression, with an underlying deregulated monoaminergic signalling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is involved in a variety of malignant human cancers, the emergence of constitutively active mutants with drug resistance has rendered it difficult to identify the new medicines for ALK-dependent cancers. To find the common inhibitors of the wild type ALK and the most abundant drug-resistant mutant (L1196M), we performed molecular docking-based virtual screening of a large chemical library in parallel for the two target proteins. As a consequence of augmenting the accuracy of the docking simulation by implementing a sophisticated hydration free energy term in the scoring function, 12 common inhibitors are discovered with the inhibitory activities ranging from submicromolar to low micromolar levels. The results of the binding free energy decomposition indicate that the biochemical potency of ALK inhibitors can be optimized by reducing the dehydration cost for binding to the receptor protein as well as by strengthening the interactions with amino acid residues in the ATP-binding site. The newly identified ALK inhibitors are found to have a little higher inhibitory activity for the L1196M mutant than for the wild type due to the strengthening of the hydrogen bond interactions in the ATP-binding site. Of the 12 common inhibitors, 2-(5-methyl-benzooxazol-2-ylamino)-quinazolin-4-ol (3) is anticipated to serve as a new molecular scaffold to optimize the biochemical potency because it exhibits low micromolar inhibitory activity with respect to both the wild type and L1196M mutant in spite of the low molecular weight (292.3 amu).

Fifty-three patients were enrolled. Treatment was planned for up to 8 cycles but only 9% of patients received more than 6 cycles due primarily to disease progression (n = 13) or prolonged thrombocytopenia (n = 12). The overall response rate was 66% with a complete response rate of 57%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7·5 months. With a median follow-up of 7·6 years, 5-year PFS and overall survival (OS) were 21% and 48%, respectively.

If considering FISH as the standard, the sensitivity and specificity of ALK IHC 3+/2+ as ALK positive were 100% and 97.9%, respectively. Three IHC 3+ cases reported as FISH \"negative\" were actually ALK positive confirmed by ALK RT-PCR or re-detected. Based on the final classify, ALK IHC 3+/2+ was 100% sensitive and 98.8% specific. However, FISH was 90.3% sensitive and 100% specific. IHC 2+ was regarded as equivocal and need to be confirmed by FISH or RT-PCR. In the 368 cases, 8.4% cases had ALK positive, 52.2% cases had EGFR mutation, and only one case had a coexisting. Manually semiquantitative ALK IHC (primary antibody D5F3 coupled with secondary DAKO Envision system) used as the initial screening combined with auxiliary FISH confirmation is a reliable, economical approach to identify ALK positive lung adenocarcinoma. The IHC can find some ALK positive cases which would be missed by FISH only.",

Vismodegib, a smoothened inhibitor that targets this pathway, is now in clinical use for advanced BCC patients, but its efficacy is limited. Therefore, new therapeutic options for this cancer are required. We studied gene expression profiling of BCC tumour tissues coupled with laser capture microdissection to identify tumour specific receptor tyrosine kinase expression that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. We found a >250 fold increase (FDR<10-4) of the oncogene, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as well as its ligands, pleiotrophin and midkine in BCC compared to microdissected normal epidermis. qRT-PCR confirmed increased expression of ALK (p<0.05). Stronger expression of phosphorylated ALK in BCC tumour nests than normal skin was observed by immunohistochemistry. Crizotinib, an FDA-approved ALK inhibitor, reduced keratinocyte proliferation in culture, whereas a c-Met inhibitor did not. Crizotinib significantly reduced the expression of GLI1 and CCND2 (members of SHH-pathway) mRNA by approximately 60% and 20%, respectively (p<0.01). Our data suggest that ALK may increase GLI1 expression in parallel with the conventional SHH-pathway and promote keratinocyte proliferation. Hence, an ALK inhibitor alone or in combination with targeting SHH-pathway molecules may be a potential treatment for BCC patients. ",

In 2004, the identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) somatic mutations provided the first glimpse of a clinically relevant NSCLC oncogene. Approximately 70% of NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR wildtype (WT) cases. Three randomized trials of gefitinib versus chemotherapy (IPASS, WJTOG3405, NEJ002) in stage IV NSCLC have consistently demonstrated better RR and PFS (hazard ratios of 0.48 [IPASS], 0.49 [WJTOG3405] and 0.30 [NEJ002]) for EGFR-mutated NSCLCs treated with gefitinib. Novel irreversible EGFR TKIs (afatinib, XL647, PF00299804) show similar activity in EGFR-mutated patients. A translocation involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene with EML4, identified in 2007, is the most recent oncogene found in NSCLC. Crizotinib (PF02341066), an ALK TKI, has shown impressive activity against ALK translocated NSCLC in an expanded cohort of a phase I trial (NCT00585195). Over 80 patients have been treated and the RR is ∼60% with the 6-month PFS rate exceeding 70%. A registration phase III trial of crizotinib versus second-line chemotherapy (pemetrexed/docetaxel) is underway (PROFILE 1007, NCT00932893). KRAS, EGFR mutations and ALK translocations are mutually exclusive and few EGFR WT NSCLCs respond to EGFR TKIs. The promising results of EGFR and ALK TKIs in molecular subgroups of NSCLCs herald a new age of drug and clinical trial development for patients with NSCLC.",

The NPM1 gene on 5q35 is translocated with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in anaplastic large cell lymphoma with t(2;5). The MLF1 and RARA genes are fused with NPM1 in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(3;5) and acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(5;17), respectively. In each fused protein, the N-terminal NPM portion is associated with oligomerization of a partner protein leading to altered signal transduction or transcription. Recently, mutations of exon 12 have been found in a significant proportion of de novo AML, especially in those with a normal karyotype. Mutant NPM is localized aberrantly in the cytoplasm, but the molecular mechanisms for leukemia remain to be studied.

Although FISH is currently the gold standard technique, there are no perfect methods for detecting these genetic alterations. In this article, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the possible criteria for selecting patients who are more likely to have the ALK fusion.

To characterize the ability of ALK to control ethanol consumption, we treated mice with the ALK inhibitors TAE684 or alectinib before testing them for binge-like drinking using the drinking in the dark protocol. Mice treated with ALK inhibitors drank less ethanol than controls. In addition, TAE684 treatment abolished ethanol conditioned place preference, indicating that ALK regulates the rewarding properties of ethanol. Because the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key brain region involved in the rewarding effects of ethanol, we determined if Alk expression in the VTA is important for binge-like ethanol consumption. Mice expressing a short hairpin ribonucleic acid targeting Alk in the VTA drank less ethanol compared with controls. ALK is expressed on dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA, suggesting that ALK might regulate their firing properties. Extracellular recordings of putative DA neurons in VTA slices demonstrated that ALK inhibition did not affect the ability of ethanol to stimulate, or DA to inhibit, the firing of DA neurons. However, inhibiting ALK attenuated the time-dependent reversal of inhibition produced by moderate concentrations of DA, suggesting that ALK affects DA D2 autoreceptor (D2R) desensitization. Altered desensitization of the D2R changes the firing of DA neurons and is predicted to affect DA levels and alcohol drinking. These data support the possibility that ALK might be a novel target of pharmacotherapy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption.",

The objectives of the present study were to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) relationships of PF06463922 and PF06471402 for target modulation in tumor and antitumor efficacy in athymic mice implanted with H3122 NSCLC cells expressing a crizotinib-resistant echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK mutation, EML4-ALK(L1196M). Furthermore, the PKPD relationships for these ALK inhibitors were evaluated and compared between oral administration and subcutaneous constant infusion (i.e., between different pharmacokinetic [PK] profiles). Oral and subcutaneous PK profiles of these ALK inhibitors were adequately described by a one-compartment PK model. An indirect response model extended with a modulator fit the time courses of PF06463922- and PF06471402-mediated target modulation (i.e., ALK phosphorylation) with an estimated unbound EC50,in vivo of 36 and 20 nM, respectively, for oral administration, and 100 and 69 nM, respectively, for subcutaneous infusion. A drug-disease model based on the turnover concept fit tumor growth curves inhibited by PF06463922 and PF06471402 with estimated unbound tumor stasis concentrations of 51 and 27 nM, respectively, for oral administration, and 116 and 70 nM, respectively, for subcutaneous infusion. Thus, the EC50,in vivo to EC60,in vivo estimates for ALK inhibition corresponded to the concentrations required tumor stasis in all cases, suggesting that the pharmacodynamic relationships of target modulation to antitumor efficacy were consistent among the ALK inhibitors, even when the PK profiles with different administration routes were considerably different.

Aberrant expression of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and MET gene has been implicated in the malignant progression of RMS, especially in the alveolar subtype. This observation suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a kinase inhibitor against ALK and MET, may have a therapeutic role in RMS, although its antitumour activity in this malignancy has not yet been studied.;RH4 and RH30 alveolar RMS (ARMS) cell lines were treated with crizotinib and then assessed by using proliferation, viability, migration and colony formation assays. Multiple approaches, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, western blotting and siRNA-based knock-down, were used in order to investigate possible molecular mechanisms linked to crizotinib activity.;In vitro treatment with crizotinib inhibited ALK and MET proteins, as well as Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R), with a concomitant robust dephosphorylation of AKT and ERK, two downstream kinases involved in RMS cell proliferation and survival. Exposure to crizotinib impaired cell growth, and accumulation at G2/M phase was attributed to an altered expression and activation of checkpoint regulators, such as Cyclin B1 and Cdc2. Crizotinib was able to induce apoptosis and autophagy in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by caspase-3 activation/PARP proteolytic cleavage down-regulation and by LC3 activation/p62 down-regulation, respectively. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) seemed to contribute to crizotinib effects in RH4 and RH30 cells. Moreover, crizotinib-treated RH4 and RH30 cells exhibited a decreased migratory/invasive capacity and clonogenic potential.;These results provide a further insight into the molecular mechanisms affected by crizotinib in ARMS cells inferring that it could be a useful therapeutic tool in ARMS cancer treatment.",

In both cell lines and clinical cases, immunohistochemistry was used to detect ALK protein expression; PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to detect ALK point mutation; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect ALK abnormality and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was used to detect methylation of CpG island in the promoter area of ALK.;The cell lines SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH were positive for ALK expression (cytoplasm), while the SK-N-AS was negative; among the 43 cases of NB, 26 (60.5%, 26/43) were positive for ALK protein (membrane and cytoplasm), and the rest were negative. Survival analysis showed ALK protein expression was related to survival time, with ALK positive cases having shorter survival time than ALK negative cases (P = 0.020). But ALK protein expression had no association with tumor differentiation (P = 0.503), tumor sites (P = 1.000) and age of patients (P = 0.063). FISH showed ALK amplification in two cases (4.6%, 2/43), ALK gain was found in 30 cases (69.7%, 30/43), and the remaining cases had normal ALK copy (25.6%, 11/43).

No point mutation was found in all three cell lines. Of the 43 NB cases, only one case (2.3%, 1/43) showed point mutation in exon 23, and was a synonymous mutation [A1200A (G4552C)]. The case was ALK negative, but the patient died two months after diagnosis. BSP analysis showed that CpG island in ALK promoter region were all unmethylated in three cell lines and 6 NB cases (including 3 ALK positive, 3 ALK negative).;ALK protein is expressed in most NB, and the expression indicates poor outcome. ALK expression is associated with extra copies of ALK, but there is no association with the methylation status of CpG island of ALK; the presence of extra copies of ALK is the most common genetic aberration in NB.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has gained increased attention as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of various cancers, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, piperidine carboxamides were reported as Type I1/2 inhibitors of ALK, which occupy both the ATP binding site and the back ATP hydrophobic cavity in DFG-in conformation. Due to the dynamic behavior of ALK in the binding of Type I1/2 inhibitors, the accurate predictions of the binding structures and relative binding potencies of these inhibitors are quite challenging. In this study, different modeling techniques, including molecular docking, ensemble docking based on multiple receptor conformations, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, were utilized to explore the binding mechanisms of piperidine carboxamides. Our predictions show that the conventional docking protocols are not sufficient to predict the relative binding potencies of the studied inhibitors with high accuracy, but incorporating protein flexibility before or after docking is quite effective to improve the prediction accuracy. Notably, the binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA or MM/PBSA based on the MD simulations for the docked poses give the highest correlation with the experimental data, highlighting the importance of the inclusion of receptor flexibility for the accurate predictions of the binding potencies for Type I1/2 inhibitors of ALK. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of several pairs of representative inhibitors demonstrates the importance of hydrophobic interactions in improving the binding affinities of the inhibitors with the hot-spot residues surrounding the binding pocket. This work is expected to provide valuable clues for further rational design of novel and potent Type I1/2 ALK inhibitors. ",

Clinical and pathological variables and outcomes of treatment were retrospectively reviewed. IHC and FISH were used to evaluate ALK rearrangement. Sensitivity and specificity of IHC were analyzed. Multivariable analysis was used to identify clinico-pathological correlations with positive results of IHC and clinical outcomes.;Twenty-two (8.2%) of 267 specimens were IHC-positive for ALK with intense cytoplasmic staining, whereas only 10 (3.8%) were FISH-positive. Sensitivity, specificity and the positive likelihood ratio with IHC were 80.0%, 94.9%, and 15.8 respectively.

There were no statistically significant differences in other clinical and pathological variables. ALK rearrangement was not a prognostic factor for tumor recurrence or overall survival.;The incidences of ALK positivity in completely resected NSCLCs in northern Thailand were 8.2% by IHC and 3.8% by FISH.

We identify members of known resistance pathways and additional putative resistance drivers. Among the latter were members of the P2Y purinergic receptor family of G-protein-coupled receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6). P2Y receptors mediated resistance in part through a protein-kinase-C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. Moreover, PKC activation alone was sufficient to confer resistance to ALK inhibitors, whereas combined ALK and PKC inhibition restored sensitivity. We observed enrichment of gene signatures associated with several resistance drivers (including P2Y receptors) in crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung tumors compared to treatment-naive controls, supporting a role for these identified mechanisms in clinical ALK inhibitor resistance.

The laboratories were requested to perform the FISH test, using their usual protocols, and to complete the analysis within 3 weeks. By using a predefined scoring system, two points were assigned in case of correct genotype and zero points to false-negative or false-positive results. The threshold value to pass the EQA scheme was set at 18 points. Two rounds were planned.;Thirty-four centers submitted the results within the established deadline. Several errors in the evaluation of genotype (n = 18) were reported, with both false-positive (n = 7) and false-negative (n = 11) results. Test failure occurred in seven cases. Two samples were found to be critical by two referral laboratories and seven participating centers. Twenty-six (70%) laboratories passed the first round and six the second round. Overall, 32 (86%) laboratories passed the ALK EQA scheme.;The results of this first EQA scheme for ALK testing in NSCLC cancer patients indicate that ALK analysis is performed with adequate quality in most Italian laboratories and highlight the importance of EQA in revealing methodological problems that need to be addressed to further increase the reproducibility of molecular tests.",

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced. We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 14), serine/threonine kinase 11 (N = 11), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 6), mutL homolog 1 (N = 4), Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 3) and MET proto-oncogene (N = 3). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5' fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional PCR analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing, confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion, indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In conclusion, we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC. Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. ",

Crizotinib, a dual MET/ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated promising clinical activity in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harboring ALK translocations. Inhibitors of driver kinases often elicit kinase domain mutations that confer resistance, and such mutations have been successfully predicted using in vitro mutagenesis screens. Here, this approach was used to discover an extensive set of ALK mutations that can confer resistance to crizotinib. Mutations at 16 residues were identified, structurally clustered into five regions around the kinase active site, which conferred varying degrees of resistance. The screen successfully predicted the L1196M, C1156Y, and F1174L mutations, recently identified in crizotinib-resistant patients. In separate studies, we demonstrated that crizotinib has relatively modest potency in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines. A more potent ALK inhibitor, TAE684, maintained substantial activity against mutations that conferred resistance to crizotinib. Our study identifies multiple novel mutations in ALK that may confer clinical resistance to crizotinib, suggests that crizotinib's narrow selectivity window may underlie its susceptibility to such resistance and demonstrates that a more potent ALK inhibitor may be effective at overcoming resistance.",

The resultant ALK protein overexpression in the myofibroblastic component of these tumors is detectable by immunohistochemistry. We examined 73 IMTs, 20 cases of nodular fasciitis, 15 desmoid fibromatoses, and 15 gastrointestinal stromal tumors by immunohistochemistry using ALK-11, a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the C-terminus of the protein. ALK positivity was detected in 44 of 73 (60%) IMTs. All cases of nodular fasciitis, desmoid fibromatosis, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors were ALK negative (p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that ALK positivity is common in IMTs, and immunohistochemistry using anti-ALK antibodies can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of these neoplasms.

Receptor tyrosine kinases mediate many of these events, with several playing critical roles in neuronal survival and axonal guidance. It is evident that not all the receptor tyrosine kinases that play key roles in regulating neuronal development have been identified. In this study, we have characterized the spatial-temporal expression profile of a recently identified receptor tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), in embryonic chick by means of whole-mount in situ hybridization in conjunction with immunohistochemistry. Our findings reveal that Alk is expressed in sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia as early as stage 19. In addition, mRNA is expressed from stage 23/24 (E4) to stage 39 (E13) in discrete motor neuron subsets of chick spinal cord along with a select group of muscles that are innervated by one of these particular motor neuron clusters. Expression within the spinal cord is coincident with the onset and duration of motor neuron programmed cell death and during the period of musculature innervation and synapse formation. Hence, the data presented here identify ALK as a novel candidate receptor for regulating critical events in the development of neurons in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems.",

In this study, we analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of crizotinib in the treatment of 72 Chinese patients with ALK-positive, advanced NSCLC. All patients received oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles during the period June 1, 2013, to October 15, 2014. The tumor response was assessed after the first cycle of crizotinib and then after every two cycles using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0. Tolerability was assessed at least twice per cycle until crizotinib was discontinued. The patients tended to be young (mean age 55 years, range 31-83 years), never or light smokers (smoking index <400), and to have an adenocarcinoma histology. Most (49/72; 68.1 %) had received previous anticancer treatment before crizotinib therapy. Sixty-seven patients (93 %) were able to be assessed for efficacy. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 52.2 % (95 % CI 40.5-63.9 %) and 64.2 % (95 % CI 52.75-75.7 %), respectively. The estimated median progression-free survival for all 67 patients was 10.3 months (95 % CI 8.6-12.0 months). Mild visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation were the most commonly reported adverse effects. Thus, crizotinib was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in Chinese patients with ALK-positive, advanced NSCLC. Further prospective, multicenter studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.",

Comparators were chosen based on reported utilization from a retrospective Canadian chart study; comparators were pemetrexed, best supportive care (BSC), and historical control (HC). HC comprised of all treatment alternatives reported. Progression-free survival and overall survival for ceritinib were estimated using data reported from single-arm clinical trials (ASCEND-1 [NCT01283516] and ASCEND-2 [NCT01685060]). Survival data for comparators were obtained from published clinical trials in a NSCLC population and from a Canadian retrospective chart study. Parametric models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the trial period. Drug acquisition, administration, resource use, and adverse event (AE) costs were obtained from databases. Utilities for health states and disutilities for AEs based on EQ-5D were derived from literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were estimated. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.;Over 4 years, ceritinib was associated with 0.86 QALYs and total direct costs of $89,740 for the post-ALK population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $149,117 comparing ceritinib vs BSC, $80,100 vs pemetrexed, and $104,436 vs HC. Additional scenarios included comparison to docetaxel with an ICER of $149,780 and using utility scores reported from PROFILE 1007, with a reported ICER ranging from $67,311 vs pemetrexed to $119,926 vs BSC. Due to limitations in clinical efficacy input, extensive sensitivity analyses were carried out whereby results remained consistent with the base-case findings.;Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold for end-of-life cancer drugs, ceritinib may be considered as a cost-effective option compared with other alternatives in patients who have progressed or are intolerant to crizotinib in Canada.",

They have drawn much attention after the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RTK gene alterations include point mutations and gene fusions that result from chromosomal rearrangements. In both cases, they activate the kinase domain in the absence of ligand, producing a permanent signal for cell proliferation. Recently, this simple model has been refined. First, by contrast to wild-type RTK, many mutated RTK do not seem to signal from the plasma membrane, but from various locations inside the cell. Second, their signal transduction properties are altered: the pathways that are crucial for cell transformation, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors, do not necessarily contribute to the physiologic functions of these receptors. Finally, different mechanisms prevent the termination of the signal, which normally occurs through receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Several mutations inactivating CBL, a key RTK E3 ubiquitin ligase, have been recently described. In this review, we discuss the possible links among RTK trafficking, signaling, and degradation in leukemic cells.",

Extensive methylation of the p16 promoter was seen in six out of 10 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patient samples and corresponded with lack of p16 protein expression in the cases examined. Treatment of cultured T-cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxy-cytidine, resulted in reversal of the p16 gene silencing. However, expression of p16 protein was delayed in relationship to p16 promoter demethylation and required up to 3 weeks to occur, seemingly reflecting late activation of the p16 gene. These findings indicate that epigenetic silencing affects in T-cell malignancies, often simultaneously, several tumor suppressor genes that impact on key cell functions. The observed differential silencing of p16 and p14, and to a lesser degree p15 gene, indicates that the silencing is governed by precise, promoter region-specific mechanisms. The study provides also further rationale for treatment of at least some types of T-cell lymphomas with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to target the epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes.",

We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE.;We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib.;We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs.

Among the new results emanating from these efforts are amplifications of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene and mutations of the discoidin domain receptor 2 gene as potential novel targets for the treatment of squamous-cell lung cancer patients. Here, we provide a review on these discoveries and their implications for clinical trials in squamous-cell lung cancer assessing the value of novel therapeutics addressing these targets.",

ALK gene rearrangement is observed in 3-5% of NSCLC patients. Crizotinib is an oral inhibitor of ALK kinase activity, approved for the treatment of NSCLC patients with ALK gene rearrangement. Crizotinib treatment has resulted in a progression-free survival of 7-10 months with 50-60% objective response rate. The present paper gives an overview of literature reports on the role of crizotinib in the treatment of NSCLC patients harbouring a molecular defect in the ALK gene. Molecular diagnosis of ALK-associated aberrations, results of clinical trials of different phases assessing the efficacy and safety profile of crizotinib are also discussed.

This fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation with potent transforming activity. In a pivotal phase 1 clinical trial, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib (PF-02341066) demonstrated impressive antitumor activity in the majority of patients with NSCLC harboring ALK fusions. However, despite these remarkable initial responses, cancers eventually develop resistance to crizotinib, usually within 1 y, thereby limiting the potential clinical benefit. To determine how cancers acquire resistance to ALK inhibitors, we established a model of acquired resistance to crizotinib by exposing a highly sensitive EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cell line to increasing doses of crizotinib until resistance emerged. We found that cells resistant to intermediate doses of crizotinib developed amplification of the EML4-ALK gene. Cells resistant to higher doses (1 μM) also developed a gatekeeper mutation, L1196M, within the kinase domain, rendering EML4-ALK insensitive to crizotinib. This gatekeeper mutation was readily detected using a unique and highly sensitive allele-specific PCR assay. Although crizotinib was ineffectual against EML4-ALK harboring the gatekeeper mutation, we observed that two structurally different ALK inhibitors, NVP-TAE684 and AP26113, were highly active against the resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these resistant cells remained highly sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG. Thus, we have developed a model of acquired resistance to ALK inhibitors and have shown that second-generation ALK TKIs or Hsp90 inhibitors are effective in treating crizotinib-resistant tumors harboring secondary gatekeeper mutations.",

The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib's dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1(G2032R) mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure-function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.

In addition, NSCLC patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene had a dramatic response and longer progression free survival after ALK inhibitor treatment than those without this fusion gene. However, the incidence and clinical and molecular characteristics of the EML4-ALK fusion gene in NSCLC patients of Taiwan are still unclear.;Sixty-four fresh frozen tumor specimens were obtained from the tissue bank of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for RNA extraction and EML4-ALK fusion gene detection. Paraffin sections of lung tumors from all of these patients were available and were analyzed for ALK protein expression by immunohistochemical (IHC) study. The results were correlated with clinical and molecular biomarkers.;Three of the 64 tumors (4.7%) had the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Two were adenocarcinomas, and one was adenosquamous carcinoma. Twenty patients with non-squamous cell carcinomas had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, so the EML4-ALK fusion gene was found in 14.3% of EGFR wild type non-squamous cell carcinomas. Two tumors were variant 3 (3a+3b with 3b predominant) and had strong staining (3+) for ALK by IHC stains. One tumor was variant 1 and had moderate staining (2+) for ALK. None of the ALK wild type tumors had strong staining for ALK. When compared with other clinical and molecular features, only the IHC stain for ALK was significantly correlated with the EML4-ALK fusion gene (p = 0.0002).;ALK overexpression detected by IHC study could be a promising detection method for the EML4-ALK fusion gene and is worth further confirmation with more samples.",

Although high response ratio was detected from the patients treated with crizotinib, the cancer has eventually conferred resistance to crizotinib. Several drug resistance mutations have been found in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase domain as the target for crizotinib, but the drug resistance mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method and two-end-state free energy calculation approaches were employed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of crizotinib induced by the mutations L1152R, G1202R, and S1206Y. The ABF simulation results suggest that the reaction coordinates for the unbinding processes of crizotinib from the binding pockets of the mutated ALKs is different from that of the wild type ALK. The potentials of mean force for the crizotinib unbinding and the binding free energies predicted by the two-end-state free energy calculations are consistent with the experimental data. Our results indicate that the three mutations weaken the binding affinity of crizotinib obviously and lead to drug resistance. The free energy decomposition analysis illustrates the importance of the loss of two important H-bonds in the L1152R and S1206Y mutants on drug resistance. The entropy analysis shows that the entropy term plays a critical role in the substantial change of the conformational entropies of G1202R and L1152R. Our results reveal the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide vital clues for the development of new inhibitors to combat drug resistance. ",

However, other lymphomas may exhibit similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features. To determine the significance of plasmablastic differentiation in DLBCL and examine the heterogeneity of lymphomas with these characteristics, we examined 50 DLBCLs with low/absent CD20/CD79a and an immunophenotype indicative of terminal B-cell differentiation (MUM1/CD38/CD138/EMA-positive). We were able to define several distinct subgroups. Twenty-three tumors were classified as plasmablastic lymphoma of the oral mucosa type and showed a monomorphic population of immunoblasts with no or minimal plasmacytic differentiation. Most patients were HIV+ and EBV was positive in 74%. Eleven (48%) cases presented in the oral mucosa, but the remaining presented in other extranodal (39%) or nodal (13%) sites. Sixteen cases were classified as plasmablastic lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation. These were composed predominantly of immunoblasts and plasmablasts, but in addition exhibited more differentiation to mature plasma cells. Only 33% were HIV+, EBV was detected in 62%, and 44% had nodal presentation. Nine cases, morphologically indistinguishable from the previous group, were secondary extramedullary plasmablastic tumors occurring in patients with prior or synchronous plasma cell neoplasms, classified as multiple myeloma in 7 of the 9. Two additional neoplasms were an HHV-8+ extracavitary variant of primary effusion lymphoma and an ALK+ DLBCL. HHV-8 was examined in 39 additional cases, and was negative in all. In conclusion, DLBCLs with plasmablastic differentiation are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with different clinicopathological characteristics that may correspond to different entities.",

Subsequent studies have also characterized morphologic features corresponding to ALK and NTRK1 translocations. In this study, we sought to further compare morphologic features across a range of 49 genetically defined spitzoid neoplasms with ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, or RET fusions to determine discriminating features. We also compared them with a group of 22 spitzoid neoplasms, which were confirmed to be negative for fusions in ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, and RET. Features with the highest discriminatory value included diameter of the lesion, dermal architecture, and certain cytomorphologic features. Specifically, cases with a large diameter (≥9 mm) and wedge-shaped, plexiform dermal architecture of nests of large, spindle-shaped cells were most likely to have an ALK fusion. NTRK1-fused cases were most likely of the fusions to have Kamino bodies and were typically arranged in smaller nests with smaller predominantly spindle-shaped cells, occasionally forming rosettes. BRAF fusion cases were the only fusion subtype to have a predominance of epithelioid cells, were less organized in nests, and commonly had a sheet-like growth pattern or dysplastic Spitz architecture. BRAF fusion cases were most likely to have high-grade nuclear atypia, to be diagnosed as spitzoid melanoma, to have a positive result by melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, and to develop copy number gains in the kinase domain of the fusion protein. On the basis of experience from this cohort, BRAF-fused cases appear most likely to progress to melanoma.",

Herein, we report the case of a woman with ALK gene translocation-squamous cell lung cancer who experienced a remarkable tumor response to crizotinib after two courses of failed chemotherapy.;A 55-year-old Chinese woman was diagnosed with cervical lymph node metastatic squamous carcinoma. Chest computed tomography scan showed the primary tumor in the lower lobe of the right lung. The patient had received two successive courses of first-line chemotherapy without tumor response. Tumor cells were negative for wild-type of epidermal growth factor receptor/K-RAS variants; thus, she was not eligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unfortunately, increased levels of interleukin-6 and carcinoembryonic antigen, and computed tomography scan results indicated cancer progression. Once crizotinib was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration and the ALK gene translocation was identified in tumor cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization, the patient commenced treatment with crizotinib. Remarkably, the tumor response to crizotinib was classified as partial response after only 26 days of treatment commencement. The partial response status has been maintained to date (23 weeks).;Considering this remarkable response to crizotinib, we can safely conclude that patients with squamous cell lung cancer should have the option of undergoing ALK testing to determine if there is indication for crizotinib treatment even after they have failed chemotherapy.",

Some interlacing spindle cells and epithelioid cells were also present. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells expressed diffuse positivity for LCA, CD20, CD79a, CD23, Bcl2, MUM-1 and heterogenous positivity for CD30 and EMA, and were negative for CD10, CD15 and ALK.

An elderly woman with AML with an inv(2)(p23q13)/RANBP2-ALK and monosomy 7 was treated with crizotinib. After a short-term hematological response and the restoration of normal hematopoiesis, she experienced a relapse of AML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the ALK break-apart probe confirmed the inv(2)(p23q13), while G-banded karyotyping revealed the deletion of a segment of the short arm of chromosome 1 [del(1)(p13p22)] after crizotinib therapy. The ALK gene carried a heterozygous mutation at the nucleotide position g.716751G>C within exon 25, causing the p.G1269A amino acid substitution within the ALK-KD. Reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that the mutated ALK allele was selectively transcribed and the mutation occurred in the ALK allele rearranged with RANBP2. As both the del(1)(p13p22) at the cytogenetic level and p.G1269A at the nucleotide level newly appeared after crizotinib treatment, it is likely that they were secondarily acquired alterations involved in crizotinib resistance.

In May 2013, the Italian Association of Thoracic Oncology (AIOT) organized an International Experts Panel Meeting to review strengths and limitations of the available evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced NSCLC with EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) alterations and to discuss implications for clinical practice and future clinical research. All patients with advanced NSCLC, with the exclusion of pure squamous cell carcinoma in former or current smokers, should be tested for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements before decisions are made on first-line treatment. First-line treatment of EGFR-mutated cases should be with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Any available agent (gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib) can be used, until further data from comparative studies may better guide TKI selection. As general rule, and when clinically feasible, results of EGFR mutational status should be awaited before starting first-line treatment. Panelists agreed that the use of crizotinib is justified in any line of treatment. Although solid evidence supporting the continuation of EGFR TKIs or crizotinib beyond progression is lacking, in some cases (minimal, asymptomatic progression, or oligoprogression manageable by local therapy), treatment continuation beyond progression could be justified. Experimental strategies to target tumor heterogeneity and to treat patients after failure of EGFR TKIs or crizotinib are considered high-priority areas of research. A number of relevant research priorities were identified to optimize available treatment options. ",

For several years, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has been considered as the only validated diagnostic assay. Currently, alternative methods are commercially available as diagnostic tests.;A series of 217 ADC comprising 196 consecutive resected tumors and 21 ALK FISH-positive cases from an independent series of 702 ADC were investigated. All specimens were screened by IHC (ALK-D5F3-CDx-Ventana), FISH (Vysis ALK Break-Apart-Abbott) and RT-PCR (ALK RGQ RT-PCR-Qiagen). Results were compared and discordant cases subjected to Next Generation Sequencing.;Thirty-nine of 217 samples were positive by the ALK RGQ RT-PCR assay, using a threshold cycle (Ct) cut-off ≤35.9, as recommended. Of these positive samples, 14 were negative by IHC and 12 by FISH. ALK RGQ RT-PCR/FISH discordant cases were analyzed by the NGS assay with results concordant with FISH data. In order to obtain the maximum level of agreement between FISH and ALK RGQ RT-PCR data, we introduced a new scoring algorithm based on the ΔCt value. A ΔCt cut-off level ≤3.5 was used in a pilot series. Then the algorithm was tested on a completely independent validation series. By using the new scoring algorithm and FISH as reference standard, the sensitivity and the specificity of the ALK RGQ RT-PCR(ΔCt) assay were 100% and 100%, respectively.;Our results suggest that the ALK RGQ RT-PCR test could be useful in clinical practice as a complementary assay in multi-test diagnostic algorithms or even, if our data will be confirmed in independent studies, as a standalone or screening test for the selection of patients to be treated with ALK inhibitors.",

The prognosis of relapsed T-cell NHL is poor, especially for those relapsing after an autologous (auto-) or allogeneic (allo-) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Disease relapse post auto-HCT is best managed on a clinical trial. In the absence of an investigational protocol, the choice of salvage therapies should take into account patient performance status, eligibility for an allo-HCT, and surface CD30 expression. CD30-directed therapies or aggressive salvage regimens can be used as a bridge to allo-HCT in medically fit patients. In the elderly or more infirm patients, single-agent therapies could be offered, aiming at palliation. Similarly, relapse after an allo-HCT is not uncommon and is a real challenge. Reduction in ongoing immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusion are often considered in this setting to augment graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects and can occasionally provide durable disease control. Clinical trials designed to investigate novel therapeutic agents with immunomodulatory properties to augment GVL effects (eg, histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor, lenalidomide) or targeted therapies (eg, aurora A kinase inhibitors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] inhibitors) are sorely needed to improve the dismal outcomes of T-cell NHL relapsing after an allo-HCT.",

Recently, small studies of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) have suggested an incidence of EML4-ALK translocations of 0.4% to 2.4% and FIG-ROS1 translocations of 0.8%. In lung cancer, screening immunohistochemical staining for ALK and ROS1 has been validated as highly sensitive for these translocations, but this has not been investigated in CRC. We therefore sought to investigate the incidence of ALK and ROS1 overexpression as detected by immunohistochemical staining in a large cohort of CRCs. Of the 1889 CRCs, only 1 case (0.05%) demonstrated diffuse strong positive staining for ALK, whereas 14 (0.7%) showed weak nonspecific staining; the remainder were negative. The 1 positive case was confirmed to harbor an ALK rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), whereas the 14 tumors with weak staining were FISH-negative. The ALK positive case demonstrated positive expression in all dysplastic and malignant cells indicating that the translocation was an early clonal event. No cases were positive for ROS1 by immunohistochemical staining, although 2 cases did show some nonspecific staining and were shown to be negative for ROS1 translocation by FISH. We conclude that although diffuse strong positive staining for ALK is likely to be highly specific for ALK rearrangement in CRC, both ALK and ROS1 immunohistochemical staining are very low-yield tests and difficult to justify in the routine clinical setting.

While fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is the current gold standard for detection of EML4-ALK rearrangements, several limitations exist including high costs, time-consuming evaluation and somewhat equivocal interpretation of results. In contrast, targeted massive parallel sequencing has been introduced as a powerful method for simultaneous and sensitive detection of multiple somatic mutations even in limited biopsies, and is currently evolving as the method of choice for molecular diagnostic work-up of NSCLCs.;We developed a novel approach for indirect detection of EML4-ALK rearrangements based on 454 massive parallel sequencing after reverse transcription and subsequent multiplex amplification (multiplex ALK RNA-seq) which takes advantage of unbalanced expression of the 5' and 3' ALK mRNA regions. Two lung cancer cell lines and a selected series of 32 NSCLC samples including 11 cases with EML4-ALK rearrangement were analyzed with this novel approach in comparison to ALK FISH, ALK qRT-PCR and EML4-ALK RT-PCR.;The H2228 cell line with known EML4-ALK rearrangement showed 171 and 729 reads for 5' and 3' ALK regions, respectively, demonstrating a clearly unbalanced expression pattern.

Here, we describe a deep quantitative phosphoproteomic approach in which Crizotinib-treated neuroblastoma cell lines bearing aberrant ALK are used to investigate downstream regulated phosphoproteins. We identified more than 19,500-and quantitatively analyzed approximately 10,000-phosphorylation sites from each cell line, ultimately detecting 450-790 significantly-regulated phosphorylation sites. Multiple layers of bioinformatic analysis of the significantly-regulated phosphoproteins identified RAS/JNK as a downstream signaling pathway of ALK, independent of the ALK variant present. Further experiments demonstrated that ALK/JNK signaling could be inactivated by either ALK- or JNK-specific inhibitors, resulting in cell growth inhibition by induction of cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Our study broadly defines the phosphoproteome in response to ALK inhibition and provides a resource for further clinical investigation of ALK as therapeutic target for the treatment of neuroblastoma.",

This suggests that malignant outgrowth of mature T lymphocytes is well controlled. Indeed, in a previous study we found that mature T cells are resistant to transformation with known T-cell oncogenes. Here, however, we observed that T-cell receptor (TCR) mono-/oligoclonal mature T cells from TCR transgenic (tg) mice (OT-I, P14) expressing the oncogenes NPM/ALK or ΔTrkA readily developed MTCLs in T-cell-deficient recipients. Analysis of cell surface markers largely ruled out that TCR tg lymphomas were derived from T-cell precursors. Furthermore, cotransplanted non-modified TCR polyclonal T cells suppressed malignant outgrowth of oncogene expressing TCR tg T lymphocytes. A dominant role of an anti-leukemic immune response or Tregs in the control of MTCLs seems unlikely as naïve T cells derived from oncogene expressing stem cells, which should be tolerant to leukemic antigens, as well as purified CD4 and CD8 were resistant to transformation.

The primary biochemical mechanism of crizotinib is to inhibit ALK expression, leading to increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Crizotinib is metabolized and excreted after O-dealkylation by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4/5; as crizotinib is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, its use entails a high potential for drug interactions, including confirmed interactions with ketoconazole and rifampin that can alter crizotinib pharmacokinetics. A Phase I trial involving patients with ALK gene mutation-positive NSCLC demonstrated significant disease control with oral crizotinib use, including an overall eight-week response rate of 87% and an estimated six-month survival of 72%. At the standard dosage of 250 mg twice daily, crizotinib is well tolerated.

However, in addition to expression of DAlk in the Drosophila brain, careful analysis reveals an additional early role for DAlk in the developing visceral mesoderm where its expression is coincident with activated ERK.;In this paper we describe a Drosophila melanogaster Alk RTK which is expressed in the developing embryonic mesoderm and CNS.

        "Doc_abstract":"Menin upregulates transcription of cell-cycle inhibitors to suppress endocrine tumors, but it is poorly understood how menin suppresses non-endocrine tumors such as lung cancer. Here, we show that menin inhibits proliferation of human lung cancer cells and growth of lung cancer in mice. The menin-mediated tumor suppression requires repression of growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN), which binds to its cell surface receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) that is activated in certain lung adenocarcinomas. Menin represses PTN transcription and PTN-induced proliferation of human lung cancer cells, and menin expression is substantially reduced in primary human lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, menin binds the PTN locus and enhances Polycomb gene Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27m3), a negative mark for gene transcription but does not affect histone H3K4 methylation that is usually upregulated by menin in endocrine cells. Together, our findings indicate that menin suppresses lung cancer partly through increasing Polycomb gene-mediated H3K27 methylation and repressing PTN transcription, unraveling a novel, epigenetically regulated PTN-ALK signaling pathway in suppressing lung cancer.",

Unfortunately, drug resistance develops after initial benefit through a variety of mechanisms. Novel generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors are currently in advanced clinical development and are producing encouraging results in patients with acquired resistance to previous generation agents.

These effects were seen only for recombinants carrying both alkST and alkBFGHJKL operons. Deletion of parts of either alkB or alkJ, which encode two major Alk proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane, modified but did not eliminate the effects described above, suggesting that they were due to induction and expression of several alk genes.

In order to unbiasedly analyze the diagnostic impact of such a screening strategy, we compared ALK IHC with ALK FISH in three large representative Swedish NSCLC cohorts incorporating clinical parameters and gene expression data.;ALK rearrangements were detected using FISH on tissue microarrays (TMAs), including tissue from 851 NSCLC patients. In parallel, ALK protein expression was detected using IHC, applying the antibody clone D5F3 with two different protocols (the FDA approved Ventana CDx assay and our in house Dako IHC protocol). Gene expression microarray data (Affymetrix) was available for 194 patients.;ALK rearrangements were detected in 1.7 % in the complete cohort and 2.0 % in the non-squamous cell carcinoma subgroup. ALK protein expression was observed in 1.8 and 1.4 % when applying the Ventana assay or the in house Dako protocol, respectively. The specificity and accuracy of IHC was high (> 98 %), while the sensitivity was between 69 % (Ventana) and 62 % (in house Dako protocol). Furthermore, only 67 % of the ALK IHC positive cases were positive with both IHC assays. Gene expression analysis revealed that 6/194 (3 %) tumors showed high ALK gene expression (≥ 6 AU) and of them only three were positive by either FISH or IHC.;The overall frequency of ALK rearrangements based on FISH was lower than previously reported.

The neuronal differentiation factor, NeuroD1, has previously been shown to promote cell motility in neuroblastoma by suppressing the expression of Slit2. Here we report that NeuroD1 is also involved in the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, including human cell lines and primary tumorspheres cultured from the tumor tissues of model mice. Interestingly, the growth inhibition of neuroblastoma cells induced by knockdown of NeuroD1 was accompanied by a reduction of ALK expression. ALK is known to be one of the important predisposition genes for neuroblastoma. The phenotype resulting from knockdown of NeuroD1 was suppressed by forced expression of ALK and, therefore, NeuroD1 appears to act mainly through ALK to promote the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, we showed that NeuroD1 directly bound to the promoter region of ALK gene. In addition, the particular E-box in the promoter was responsible for NeuroD1-mediated ALK expression. These results indicate that ALK should be a direct target gene of NeuroD1. Finally, the expressions of NeuroD1 and ALK in the early tumor lesions of neuroblastoma model mice coincided in vivo. We conclude that the novel mechanism would regulate the expression of ALK in neuroblastoma and that NeuroD1 should be significantly involved in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. ",

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues from 10 IMTs and 125 other soft tissue tumors were stained for ALK1 and p80 with standard immunohistochemistry. ALK1 and/or p80 reactivity was observed in a cytoplasmic pattern in IMT (4/10; 40%), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (4/10; 40%), rhabdomyosarcoma (6/31; 19%), leiomyosarcoma (1/10; 10%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1/11; 9%). No staining was observed in nodular fasciitis, desmoid, infantile myofibromatosis, infantile fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyoma, or myofibrosarcoma. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (4/16; 25%) displayed a distinctive dot-like cytoplasmic positivity. No cases displayed nuclear reactivity. Fluorescent in situ hybridization on 12 of the positive cases revealed a combination of abnormalities including ALK break-apart signals, nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK fusions, or extra copies of 2p23. This study demonstrates that in addition to IMT, abnormalities of ALK1 and p80 expression with a variety of structural chromosomal changes are found in several sarcomas, especially rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Although immunoreactivity in non-IMTs cannot distinguish between structural abnormalities involving 2p23 or additional copies of 2p23, it supports the concept of ALK involvement in a larger group of neoplasms, some of which have other documented clonal abnormalities. In IMT, immunohistochemistry for ALK1 and p80 is useful as an indicator of a 2p23 abnormality, but it must be interpreted in the context of histologic and other clinicopathologic data if used as an adjunct to differential diagnosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is involved frequently in chromosomal translocations, resulting in fusion genes with different partners found in various lymphoproliferative conditions. It was recently reported in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that the fusion protein encoded by echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-ALK (EML4-ALK) fusion gene conferred oncogenic properties. The objective of the current study was to identify other possible ALK fusion genes in NSCLC.;Immunohistochemical analysis was used to screen for aberrant ALK expression in primary NSCLC. The authors used 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends to screen for potential, novel 5' fusion partners of ALK other than EML4-ALK. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were used to confirm the identity of 5' fusion partners. The genomic breakpoint was verified using genomic sequencing. Overexpression of the novel ALK fusion gene and variants 3a and 3b of EML4-ALK was performed to assess downstream signaling and functional effects.;The authors identified a novel gene resulting from the fusion of kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) exon 15 to ALK exon 20 in a primary lung adenocarcinoma. Western blot analysis of clinical tumor tissues revealed the expression of a protein whose size correlated with that of the predicted KIF5B-ALK. Overexpression of KIF5B-ALK in mammalian cells led to the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and protein kinase B and to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.;The discovery of the novel KIF5B-ALK variant further consolidated the role of aberrant ALK signaling in lung carcinogenesis.",

The presence of ALK gene rearrangement predicts response to specific targeted therapy, but these rearrangements are relatively rare and FISH studies are expensive, not widely available, potentially challenging to interpret and therefore difficult to undertake in all patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We developed and then deployed into the routine clinical setting a screening program for ALK gene rearrangement in all non-small cell lung cancer patients based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 5A4).ALK IHC was strongly positive in 12 (4%) of 307 tumours from consecutive patients. Only 10 of these cancers were initially thought to be rearranged by diagnostic FISH studies. The two tumours which were IHC positive but initially interpreted as FISH negative underwent repeat FISH testing because of the discrepancy. Repeat FISH testing confirmed the presence of ALK gene rearrangement with the discrepancy being attributable to an atypical FISH pattern.Therefore, in our experienced hands, IHC for ALK performed on initial diagnosis of lung cancer is 100% specific for the presence of ALK gene rearrangement. When ALK IHC and FISH studies are discrepant, IHC may outperform FISH. Although our study was not intended to formally assess the sensitivity of ALK IHC, the 4% rate of gene rearrangements identified by this approach is consistent with the expected incidence in our population.We conclude that reflex ALK IHC followed by confirmatory FISH testing can be readily integrated into the routine clinical setting and represents a cost effective and practical approach to screening for these clinically significant gene rearrangements.",

We identified the heparin-binding cytokine pleiotrophin as a driver of vascular abnormalization in glioma. Pleiotrophin abundance was greater in high-grade human astrocytomas and correlated with poor survival. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is a receptor that is activated by pleiotrophin, was present in mural cells associated with abnormal vessels. Orthotopically implanted gliomas formed from GL261 cells that were engineered to produce pleiotrophin showed increased microvessel density and enhanced tumor growth compared with gliomas formed from control GL261 cells. The survival of mice with pleiotrophin-producing gliomas was shorter than that of mice with gliomas that did not produce pleiotrophin. Vessels in pleiotrophin-producing gliomas were poorly perfused and abnormal, a phenotype that was associated with increased deposition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in direct proximity to the vasculature. The growth of pleiotrophin-producing GL261 gliomas was inhibited by treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, or the VEGF receptor inhibitor cediranib, whereas control GL261 tumors did not respond to either inhibitor. Our findings link pleiotrophin abundance in gliomas with survival in humans and mice, and show that pleiotrophin promotes glioma progression through increased VEGF deposition and vascular abnormalization.

Although several ALK inhibitors have gained recent approval for therapy, non-invasive indicators of target engagement or for use as predictive biomarkers in vivo are lacking. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a radiolabeled analogue of the ALK inhibitor ceritinib, [(18)F]fluoroethyl-ceritinib ([(18)F]-FEC), for use with positron emission tomography. We used two methods to synthesize [(18)F]-FEC. First, [(18)F]fluoroethyl-tosylate was prepared, coupled with ceritinib, and the product purified to yield [(18)F]-FEC. Alternatively, a precursor compound was synthesized, directly fluorinated with (18)F-fluoride, and purified to yield [(18)F]-FEC. The first method produced [(18)F]-FEC with an average decay-corrected yield of 24% (n = 4), specific activity of 1200 mCi/µmol, and >99% purity; synthesis time was 115 min from the end of bombardment. The second method produced [(18)F]-FEC with an average yield of 7% (n = 4), specific activity of 1500 mCi/µmol, and >99% purity; synthesis time was 65 min from the end of bombardment.

Although the inhibitor crizotinib, as it blocks the kinase activity of the resulting EML4-ALK fusion protein, displays remarkable initial responses, a fraction of NSCLC cases eventually become resistant to crizotinib by acquiring mutations in the ALK domain or activating bypass pathways via EGFR, KIT, or KRAS. Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory provides a plausible explanation for acquisition of tumorigenesis and resistance. However, the question as to whether EML4-ALK-driven tumorigenesis is linked with the stem-like property and whether the stemness is an effective target in controlling EML4-ALK+ NSCLC including crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cells has not been addressed. Here, we report that stem-like properties stem from ALK activity in EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells. Notably, treatment with rapamycin, a CSC targeting agent, attenuates stem-like phenotypes of the EML4-ALK+ cells, which increased capability of tumor formation and higher expression of stemness-associated molecules such as ALDH, NANOG, and OCT4. Importantly, combinational treatment with rapamycin and crizotinib leads to synergistic anti-tumor effects on EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells as well as on those resistant to crizotinib. Thus, we provide a proof of principle that targeting stemness would be a novel strategy to control intractable EML4-ALK+ NSCLC. ",

EGFR mutations were detected in 23 cases (21.1%), KRAS mutations in 13 cases (11.9%), and ALK fusion genes in 5 cases (4.9%). The ALK fusion genes could not be analyzed in four cases because of insufficient tissue samples remaining after routine histochemistry and an EGFR/KRAS mutation analysis. We found that small biopsy samples from EBUS-TBNA were adequate for performing a triple gene analysis in 97 patients (96%). ALK fusion protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 100% consistent with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Conclusion Small samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA were found to be sufficient for performing a triple gene analysis following routine histology and IHC. ALK IHC showed a very good concordance with FISH for detecting ALK fusion genes.",

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation and MET aberrations occur in a subset of NSCLC. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase/MET have been shown to be inhibited by the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib. Recently, crizotinib was shown to decrease testosterone in males. Herein, we describe the effects of crizotinib on multiple hormonal axes.;Seven consecutive patients with NSCLC who were receiving crizotinib as part of their standard care were evaluated for hormonal disruptions.;Primary hypogonadism was detected in 4/5 of males, whereas mildly elevated prolactin was observed in 4/7 patients. Hypocalcemia was observed in 3/7 patients. Interestingly, 5/7 patients had elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, and the remaining 2 individuals had levels that were near the upper limits of the normal range.;Because of cellular cross-talk between MET and IGF-1 signaling, elevated IGF-1 levels induced by crizotinib treatment may have implications for long-term drug efficacy. Furthermore, this finding suggests a potential avenue of therapeutic synergy, namely coordinate inhibition of the MET and IGF-1 signaling pathways. Finally, as crizotinib has been recently approved, it is prudent to check hormone and calcium biomarkers and correct noted deficiencies for improved outcomes and quality of life.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a promising therapeutic target for treatment of human cancers, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that instigates the activation of several signal transduction pathways. In the present study, in silico methods have been employed in order to explore the structural features and functionalities of a series of tetracyclic derivatives displaying potent inhibitory activity toward ALK. Initially docking was performed using GLIDE 5.6 to probe the bioactive conformation of all the compounds and to understand the binding modes of inhibitors. The docking results revealed that ligand interaction with Met 1199 plays a crucial role in binding of inhibitors to ALK. Further to establish a robust 3D-QSAR model using CoMFA and CoMSIA methods, the whole dataset was divided into three splits. Model obtained from Split 3 showed high accuracy ([Formula: see text] of 0.700 and 0.682, [Formula: see text] of 0.971 and 0.974, [Formula: see text] of 0.673 and 0.811, respectively for CoMFA and CoMSIA). The key structural requirements for enhancing the inhibitory activity were derived from CoMFA and CoMSIA contours in combination with site map analysis. Substituting small electronegative groups at Position 8 by replacing either morpholine or piperidine rings and maintaining hydrophobic character at Position 9 in tetracyclic derivatives can enhance the inhibitory potential. Finally, we performed molecular dynamics simulations in order to investigate the stability of protein ligand interactions and MM/GBSA calculations to compare binding free energies of co-crystal ligand and newly designed molecule N1. Based on the coherence of outcome of various molecular modeling studies, a set of 11 new molecules having potential predicted inhibitory activity were designed. ",

In this study, we used the RIP1-Tag2 (RT2) mouse model of islet cell carcinogenesis to identify a genetic locus that influences tumor progression to an invasive growth state. RT2 mice inbred into the C57BL/6 (B6) background develop both noninvasive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) and invasive carcinomas with varying degrees of aggressiveness. In contrast, RT2 mice inbred into the C3HeB/Fe (C3H) background are comparatively resistant to the development of invasive tumors, as are RT2 C3HB6(F1) hybrid mice. Using linkage analysis, we identified a 13-Mb locus on mouse chromosome 17 with significant linkage to the development of highly invasive PNETs. A gene residing in this locus, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), was expressed at significantly lower levels in PNETs from invasion-resistant C3H mice compared with invasion-susceptible B6 mice, and pharmacological inhibition of Alk led to reduced tumor invasiveness in RT2 B6 mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that tumor invasion is subject to polymorphic genetic control and identify Alk as a genetic modifier of invasive tumor growth.",

The incidence of ALK rearrangements was investigated in 763 NSCLC specimens by immunohistochemistry using a D5F3 antibody, and EGFR mutations were assessed by amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) in 222 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Of these, 73 (9.6%) were detected as being ALK-positive; this designation was associated with young age, female gender, never-smokers, lymph node metastasis, and poor tumor differentiation, but not with histology. EGFR mutations were identified in 102 (45.9%) of 222 adenocarcinoma samples, and were more frequent in females and never-smokers. No difference in age was observed. Specifically, we identified several cases of complex EGFR mutations, and concomitant EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements.

For example, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib causes characteristic visual disturbances, whereas such effects are rare when another ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, alectinib, is used. To elucidate the mechanism responsible for these visual disturbances, the responses to light exhibited by retinal ganglion cells treated with these agents were evaluated using a C57BL6 mouse ex vivo model. Both crizotinib and alectinib changed the firing rate of ON and OFF type retinal ganglion cells. However, the ratio of alectinib-affected cells (15.7%) was significantly lower than that of crizotinib-affected cells (38.6%). Furthermore, these drugs changed the response properties to light stimuli of retinal ganglion cells in some of the affected cells, i.e., OFF cells responded to both ON and OFF stimuli, etc. Finally, the expressions of ALK (a target receptor of both crizotinib and alectinib) and of MET and ROS1 (additional target receptors of crizotinib) were observed at the mRNA level in the retina. Our findings suggest that these drugs might target retinal ganglion cells and that the potency of the drug actions on the light responses of retinal ganglion cells might be responsible for the difference in the frequencies of visual disturbances observed between patients treated with crizotinib and those treated with alectinib.

To the authors' knowledge, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) as an initial presentation of PA-SRC has not yet been reported. We report an autopsy case from a 59-year-old female who presented with intractable headache for 6 weeks and died of LMC as a result of metastatic PA-SRC. Premortem brain MRI showed nonspecific leptomeningeal enhancement. At autopsy, a tan rubbery mass was found in the hilar area of the right lung, which also surrounded the lower trachea and carotid arteries. A right posteromedial middle lobe mass was also found. Leptomeninges were slightly thickened, without discrete masses. Microscopic examination of the lung mass and leptomeninges showed solid sheets and nests of malignant cells with pleomorphic nuclei and frequent SRC features which comprised 50% of the mass. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells demonstrated strong diffuse expression of cytokeratin (CK)-7, TTF-1, and napsin-A. Immunostains for CK-20 and ALK were negative. These features were consistent with PA-SRC. It has been reported that approximately 70% of PAs demonstrate ALK gene rearrangement when SRCs comprised >10% of the tumor cells. The presence of SRCs can be indicative of a lung primary and, because of frequent ALK gene rearrangement in PA-SRC, proper recognition of PA-SRC may be important in determining whether further testing is advisable (e.g., ALK immunostaining and/or ALK gene rearrangement).",

The clinicopathologic characteristics of ALK-positive lung cancer were also analyzed.;From April 2008 to July 2009, NSCLC cases with hilar/mediastinal lymph node metastases detected by EBUS-TBNA were enrolled.

Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed to identify ALK fusion variants.;One hundred and nine cases were eligible for the analysis using re-sliced samples. Screening of these specimens with immunohistochemistry revealed ALK positivity in seven cases (6.4%), all of which possessed echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-ALK fusion genes as detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. All ALK-positive cases had an adenocarcinoma histology and possessed no EGFR mutations. Compared with ALK-negative cases, ALK-positive cases were more likely to have smaller primary tumors (P < 0.05), to occur at a younger age (<60 years; P < 0.05), and to occur in never/light smokers (smoking index < 400; P < 0.01).

Although molecular and cellular pathways responsible for detecting dauer pheromone and temperature have been defined in part, other sensory inputs are poorly understood, as are the mechanisms by which these diverse sensory inputs are integrated to achieve a consistent developmental outcome.;In this paper, we analyze a wild C. elegans strain isolated from a desert oasis. Unlike wild-type laboratory strains, the desert strain fails to respond to dauer pheromone at 25 degrees C, but it does respond at higher temperatures, suggesting a unique adaptation to the hot desert environment. We map this defect in dauer response to a mutation in the scd-2 gene, which, we show, encodes the nematode anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) homolog, a proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase. scd-2 acts in a genetic pathway shown here to include the HEN-1 ligand, the RTK adaptor SOC-1, and the MAP kinase SMA-5. The SCD-2 pathway modulates TGF-beta signaling, which mediates the response to dauer pheromone, but SCD-2 might mediate a nonpheromone sensory input, such as food.;Our studies identify a new sensory pathway controlling dauer formation and shed light on ALK signaling, integration of signaling pathways, and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.",

The first pathway to be effectively targeted in lung cancer was the epidermal growth factor receptor. The acceptance of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation as a strong predictive biomarker in non-small cell lung carcinoma has encouraged the search for more targets. In 2011, regulatory entities granted conditional approval to an anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor (crizotinib) based on an impressive overall response rate in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors harbored EML4/ALK translocations. The landmark approval of crizotinib based on early promising clinical data highlights the remarkable success of molecular medicine in lung cancer therapeutics. The cumulative data developed after that approval has confirmed the appropriateness of this decision as recently reported phase III has now demonstrated. Unfortunately, resistance to this agent invariably develops and we now face the challenge of understanding several resistance pathways and overcoming them with new and more potent compounds. New agents in clinical development such as alectinib, LDK378, AP26113, and AUY922 have not only demonstrated promising activity in crizotinib resistant patients, but also crossing new pharmacokinetic boundaries in ALK inhibition as potent CNS penetration.",

Napsin A is expressed in the lung and kidney and is an alternative marker for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Arginase A is a sensitive and specific marker for liver tumors. ERG (Ets-related gene) is an excellent marker for endothelium and vascular tumors as well as prostatic cancer (about 50% of cases). SOX10 (SRY-related HMG box) is expressed predominantly in melanocytic and Schwann cells and the corresponding tumors.

Interrogation of in vitro ALK-positive NSCLC cell line models of acquired resistance to first and second-generation ALK inhibitors revealed acquired epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanisms. Here we demonstrated that knockdown of upregulated mesenchymal markers in acquired resistant lines decreased the invasive and migratory capabilities of the cells, however, it did not restore sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. Removing drug for 5 weeks from H3122 cell line that acquired resistance to ceritinib restored its sensitivity to ceritinib. In addition, HSP90 inhibitors ganetespib and 17-AAG were potent in inducing cell death in cell lines resistant to crizotinib and ceritinib. Taken together, EMT does not drive resistance to ALK inhibitors and HSP90 inhibition demonstrates more efficacy when further ALK inhibition may not.

Mutation analysis of discordant cases revealed multiple mutations including oncogenic mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and ATM genes. All discordant cases in groups with split and mixed signal showed a lower number of cells with rearrangement (mean 28.5%; range 20.5-36.9%).

        "Doc_abstract":"Detection of ALK rearrangements in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents a significant technical challenge due to the existence of multiple translocation partners and break-points. To improve the performance of PCR-based tests, we utilized the combination of 2 assays, i.e. the variant-specific PCR for the 5 most common ALK rearrangements and the test for unbalanced 5'/3'-end ALK expression. Overall, convincing evidence for the presence of ALK translocation was obtained for 34/400 (8.5%) cases, including 14 EML4ex13/ALKex20, 12 EML4ex6/ALKex20, 3 EML4ex18/ALKex20, 2 EML4ex20/ALKex20 variants and 3 tumors with novel translocation partners. 386 (96.5%) out of 400 EGFR mutation-negative NSCLCs were concordant for both tests, being either positive (n = 26) or negative (n = 360) for ALK translocation; 49 of these samples (6 ALK+, 43 ALK-) were further evaluated by FISH, and there were no instances of disagreement. Among the 14 (3.5%) \"discordant\" tumors, 5 demonstrated ALK translocation by the first but not by the second PCR assay, and 9 had unbalanced ALK expression in the absence of known ALK fusion variants. 5 samples from the latter group were subjected to FISH, and the presence of translocation was confirmed in 2 cases. Next generation sequencing analysis of these 2 samples identified novel translocation partners, DCTN1 and SQSTM1; furthermore, the DCTN1/ALK fusion was also found in another NSCLC sample with unbalanced 5'/3'-end ALK expression, indicating a recurrent nature of this translocation. We conclude that the combination of 2 different PCR tests is a viable approach for the diagnostics of ALK rearrangements. Systematic typing of ALK fusions is likely to reveal new NSCLC-specific ALK partners.",

The identification of EML4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as an oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) early in the clinical development of crizotinib and the observation of promising clinical responses in patients with NSCLC harbouring ALK translocations accelerated its clinical development in ALK-positive NSCLC. Phase I and II trials of crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC reported notably high response rates that tended to be rapid and of prolonged duration. Crizotinib was well tolerated; treatment-related adverse events were typically gastrointestinal (grade 1/2) and visual disorders (almost exclusively grade 1). Crizotinib provided NSCLC symptom relief and maintained quality of life. Based on the phase I and II trial data, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval of crizotinib in August 2011. The consistency of the crizotinib data to date suggests accurate selection of the target population for crizotinib treatment. The ability to molecularly select patients likely to respond to an investigational agent argues that future clinical development of targeted agents should be re-evaluated. Updated trial designs incorporating molecular testing, early use of enrichment biomarkers and intermediary endpoints may accelerate and optimise clinical evaluation of targeted agents. Such trial designs should allow rapid clinical evaluation, minimise exposure of patients to therapies unlikely to be of benefit and, potentially, allow accelerated drug approval in molecularly specified populations.",

By analysing the sensitivity and specificity of different ALK immunohistochemical assays, we aimed to identify the most reliable assay to detect ALK rearrangement.;ALK screening performed by FISH analysis was compared with three different immunohistochemical assays, in which two ALK antibody clones (5A4 and D5F3) were used on two detection platforms (Dako AutostainerLink 48 and Ventana Benchmark GX). Data from 30 ALK FISH-positive cases show that the sensitivity of the immunohistochemical assays varies from 93.3% to 96.6%. Head-to-head comparison of the 5A4 and D5F3 ALK antibody clones demonstrates similar staining potency. In general, homogeneous, intermediate to strong staining of the ALK-positive samples was obtained.;ALK immunohistochemistry can be considered as a pre-screen method if one accepts a sensitivity of 93.3-96.6%.

Although crizotinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of ALK and Met, shows dramatic effect against EML4-ALK lung cancer cells, these cells can acquire resistance to crizotinib by several mechanisms, including ALK amplification and gatekeeper mutation. We determined whether microenvironmental factors trigger ALK inhibitor resistance in EML4-ALK lung cancer cells.;We tested the effects of ligands produced by endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and the cells themselves, on the susceptibility of EML4-ALK lung cancer cell lines to crizotinib and TAE684, a selective ALK inhibitor active against cells with ALK amplification and gatekeeper mutations, both in vitro and in vivo.;EML4-ALK lung cancer cells were highly sensitive to ALK inhibitors. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands, such as EGF, TGF-α, and HB-EGF, activated EGFR and triggered resistance to crizotinib and TAE684 by transducing bypass survival signaling through Erk1/2 and Akt. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activated Met/Gab1 and triggered resistance to TAE684, but not crizotinib, which inhibits Met. Endothelial cells and fibroblasts, which produce the EGFR ligands and HGF, respectively, decreased the sensitivity of EML4-ALK lung cancer cells to crizotinib and TAE684, respectively. EGFR-TKIs resensitized these cells to crizotinib and Met-TKI to TAE684 even in the presence of EGFR ligands and HGF, respectively.;Paracrine receptor activation by ligands from the microenvironment may trigger resistance to ALK inhibitors in EML4-ALK lung cancer cells, suggesting that receptor ligands from microenvironment may be additional targets during treatment with ALK inhibitors.",

However, chromosome translocations involving the e26 transformation-specific sequence transcription factor loci have been demonstrated recently in many prostate cancer cases. Furthermore, through a functional screening with retroviral cDNA expression libraries, we have discovered the fusion-type protein tyrosine kinase echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like-4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens. A recurrent chromosome translocation, inv(2)(p21p23), in NSCLC generates fused mRNA encoding the amino-terminal half of EML4 ligated to the intracellular region of the receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase ALK. EML4-ALK oligomerizes constitutively in cells through the coiled coil domain within the EML4 region, and becomes activated to exert a marked oncogenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Break and fusion points within the EML4 locus may diverge in NSCLC cells to generate various isoforms of EML4-ALK, which may constitute approximately 5% of NSCLC cases, at least in the Asian ethnic group. In the present review I summarize how detection of EML4-ALK cDNA may become a sensitive diagnostic means for NSCLC cases that are positive for the fusion gene, and discuss whether suppression of ALK enzymatic activity could be an effective treatment strategy against this intractable disorder.",

Recently, ALK rearrangement was described in two cases of epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma and separately in two cases reported as 'atypical' fibrous histiocytoma (with epithelioid features), with corresponding ALK expression detectable by immunohistochemistry. The goals of this study were to determine the frequency of ALK expression by immunohistochemistry in epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma, to determine its value for the diagnosis of epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma among variants and other histologic mimics, and to evaluate ALK gene rearrangement in epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma. ALK protein expression was evaluated in whole tissue sections from 33 epithelioid fibrous histiocytomas, 41 other cases of fibrous histiocytoma (11 conventional and 10 each cellular, atypical, and aneurysmal types), 10 cutaneous syncytial myoepitheliomas, and 5 atypical fibroxanthomas, using a mouse anti-ALK monoclonal antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using break-apart probes. In total, 29/33 (88%) cases of epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma showed diffuse cytoplasmic ALK expression. Staining was moderate to strong in intensity in all cases except one, which showed diffuse weak expression. All other tumor types were negative for ALK expression.

In conclusion, the majority of epithelioid fibrous histiocytomas demonstrate ALK expression and ALK gene rearrangement. ALK expression is not seen in other variants of fibrous histiocytoma, providing a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma from most histologic mimics. The expression of ALK suggests that epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma is a biologically distinct tumor type, unrelated to conventional fibrous histiocytoma and histologic variants. ",

Advances in treatments for children with high-risk neuroblastoma have, until                 recently, involved addition of cytotoxic therapy to dose-intensive regimens. In this                 era of targeted therapies, substantial efforts have been made to identify optimal                 targets for different types of cancer. The discovery of hereditary and somatic                 activating mutations in the oncogene ALK has now placed neuroblastoma among                 other cancers, such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which                 benefit from therapies with oncogene-specific small-molecule tyrosine kinase                 inhibitors. Crizotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, has transformed the                 landscape for the treatment of NSCLC harbouring ALK translocations and has                 demonstrated activity in preclinical models of ALK-driven neuroblastomas. However,                 inhibition of mutated ALK is complex when compared with translocated ALK and                 remains a therapeutic challenge. This Review discusses the biology of ALK in the                 development of neuroblastoma, preclinical and clinical progress with the use of ALK                 inhibitors and immunotherapy, challenges associated with resistance to such                 therapies and the steps being taken to overcome some of these hurdles.",

Of the 9 ALK FISH positive patients who received crizotinib treatment, 8 (88.9%) patients exhibited tumor regression. In addition, 60 (44.8%, of 134) cases were found to harbor EGFR mutations and 22 patients with EGFR sensitive mutations who received gefitinib or erlotinib treatment showed a median PFS of 16.0 months. Mutations of KRAS occurred in 8 (6.0%, of 134) cases and this was mutually exclusive from EGFR mutation.

Nevertheless, acquired resistance to this drug occurs inevitably in approximately a year, limiting the therapeutic benefits of this novel targeted therapy. In this study, we found that autophagy was induced in crizonitib-resistant lung cancer cells and contributed to drug resistance. We observed that ALK was downregulated in the crizotinib-resistant lung cancer cell line, H3122CR-1, and this was causally associated with autophagy induction. The degree of crizotinib resistance correlated with autophagic activity. Activation of autophagy in crizotinib-resistant H3122CR-1 cells involved alteration of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy, could restore sensitivity of H3122CR-1 to crizotinib and enhance its efficacy against drug-resistant lung cancer. Thus, modulating autophagy may be worth exploring as a new strategy to overcome acquired crizonitib resistance in ALK-positive lung cancer. ",

Microarrays data indicate that ALK is expressed in another paediatric tumour - medulloblastoma. Therefore, we investigated if the ALK gene is mutated in medulloblastoma and performed simultaneously the molecular profiling of tumours. Tumours from sixty-four medulloblastoma patients were studied for detection of ALK alterations in exons 23 and 25 using Sanger method. The molecular subtypes of tumours were identified by detection of mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, monosomy 6 and by immunohistochemistry using a panel of representative antibodies. Among three ALK variants detected two resulted in intron variants (rs3738867, rs113866835) and the third one was a novel heterozygous variant c.3595A>T in exon 23 identified in the WNT type of tumour. It resulted in methionine to leucine substitution at codon position 1199 (M1199L) of the kinase domain of ALK protein. Results of analysis using three in silico algorithms confirmed the pathogenicity of this single nucleotide variation. The same gene alteration was detected in both patient and maternal peripheral blood leukocytes indicating an inherited type of the detected variant. Presence of ALK expression in tumour tissue was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The tumour was diagnosed as classic medulloblastoma, however with visible areas of focal anaplastic features. The patient has been disease free for 6 years since diagnosis.

In this review we evaluate 3 promising targeted therapies: (i) (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a radiopharmaceutical that is taken up by human norepinephrine transporter (hNET), which is expressed in 90% of neuroblastomas; (ii) immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting the GD2 ganglioside, which is expressed on 98% of neuroblastoma cells; and (iii) inhibitors of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase that is mutated or amplified in ~10% of neuroblastomas and expressed on the surface of most neuroblastoma cells. Early-phase trials have confirmed the activity of (131)I-MIBG in relapsed neuroblastoma, with response rates of ~30%, but the technical aspects of administering large amounts of radioactivity in young children and limited access to this agent have hindered its incorporation into treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Anti-GD2 antibodies have also shown activity in relapsed disease, and a recent phase III randomized trial showed a significant improvement in event-free survival for patients receiving chimeric anti-GD2 (ch14.18) combined with cytokines and isotretinoin after myeloablative consolidation therapy. A recently approved small-molecule inhibitor of ALK has shown promising preclinical activity for neuroblastoma and is currently in phase I and II trials.

Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

Oral administration of crizotinib resulted in a decrease of serum testosterone levels in adult wild type male mice, which reverted to normal levels after cessation of treatment. Analysis of GnRH expression in neurons of the hypothalamus revealed a significant decrease in the number of GnRH positive neurons in ALK knock-out mice at P40 when compared with control littermates. Thus, ALK appears to be involved in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism by regulating the timing of pubertal onset and testis function at the upper levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis. ",

Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell lung cancer (n = 155), but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples (22% of cases). Using cell-based screening with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large (n = 83) panel of lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an FGFR1-resistant allele (FGFR1(V561M)), which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.",

Seven patients received oral crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily; 12 patients were administered standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed, paclitaxel, vinorelbine or gemcitabine plus either cisplatin or carboplatin) every three weeks for up to six cycles.

The common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual abnormality and diarrhea, whereas those associated with chemotherapy were neutropenia and nausea. In the crizotinib group, liver aminotransferase elevation (adverse events grade 3 or 4) occurred in one patient (14.3%). In the chemotherapy group, the same grade neutropenia adverse event occurred in two patients (16.6%). The incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar in both groups. Compared with chemotherapy, crizotinib was associated with a greater reduction in lung cancer symptoms and a greater improvement in quality of life.;As a first-line treatment, crizotinib was superior to platinum-based double chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma.

This concept is essential from a therapeutic standpoint, as clinical evidence indicates that tumours carrying deregulated RTKs are particularly susceptible to their activity but also to their inhibition. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive childhood cancer where emerging therapies rely on the use kinase inhibitors, and among druggable kinases ALK represents a potential therapeutic target to commit efforts against. However, the functional relevance of ALK in RMS is not known, likewise the multi-component deregulated RTK profile to which ALK belongs.;In this study we used RMS cell lines representative of the alveolar and embrional histotype and looked at ALK intracellular localization, activity and cell signalling.;We found that ALK was properly located at the plasma membrane of RMS cells, though in an unphosphorylated and inactive state due to intracellular tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) activity. Indeed, increase of ALK phosphorylation was observed upon PTPase inhibition, as well as after ligand binding or protein overexpression. In these conditions, ALK signalling proceeded through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, and it was susceptible to ATP-competitive inhibitors exposure. However, drug-induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis did not correlate with ALK expression only, but relied also on the expression of other RTKs with akin drug binding affinity. Indeed, analysis of baseline and inducible RTK phosphorylation confirmed that RMS cells were susceptible to ALK kinase inhibitors even in the absence of the primary intended target, due to the presence of compensatory RTKs signalling pathways.;These data, hence, provided evidences of a potentially active role of ALK in RMS cells, but also suggest caution in considering ALK a major therapeutic target in this malignancy, particularly if expression and activity cannot be accurately determined.",

In vitro, we studied the expression of total FAK1, phospho-FAK1 (Tyr 397), total ALK and phospho-ALK (Tyr 1604). In vivo, we tested CEP-37440 using FC-IBC02, SUM149, and SUM190 IBC xenograft mouse models.;CEP-37440 at low concentration decreased the proliferation of the IBC cell lines FC-IBC02, SUM190, and KPL4, while not affecting the proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells.

We find that lysosomes promote the growth of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) via Rag GTPases and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1). However, rather than employing S6K/4E-BP1, MTORC1 stimulates NMJ growth via JNK, a determinant of axonal growth in Drosophila and mammals. This role of lysosomal function in regulating JNK phosphorylation is conserved in mammals. Despite requiring the amino-acid-responsive kinase MTORC1, NMJ development is insensitive to dietary protein. We attribute this paradox to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which restricts neuronal amino acid uptake, and the administration of an ALK inhibitor couples NMJ development to dietary protein. Our findings provide an explanation for the neurodevelopmental deficits in LSDs and suggest an actionable target for treatment. ",

All peer-reviewed articles with clinically relevant information were reviewed.;ALK rearrangement results in an aberrant EML4-ALK fusion oncogene that constitutively activates ALK tyrosine kinase, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of tumor cell proliferation. Approximately 3-5% of NSCLC exhibit this rearrangement. Crizotinib is an oral selective inhibitor of ALK and mesenchymal epithelial growth factor tyrosine kinases. Early phase trials with crizotinib showed improved response rates of 50-57% and extended duration of response of 6-10 months. Results of these studies led to accelerated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of crizotinib. Further clinical trial results confirmed improvement in response rates, duration of response, as well as progression-free survival in ALK-positive patients with NSCLC receiving crizotinib. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 and demonstrates autoinhibition of CY3A4, thus predisposing it to drug interactions. The most frequent toxicities with crizotinib include mild visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, edema, and generally reversible, sometimes severe, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.;Crizotinib is a novel targeted anticancer agent that appears to be a favorable treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is ALK-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test.",

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis were used to detect this fusion gene's transcript and protein expression, respectively.

The causative genomic translocation t(2;7)(p23;q11.23) for generating this novel fusion gene was verified by using genomic sequencing.;The examined adenocarcinoma showed predominant acinar pattern, and ALK immunostaining was localized to the cytoplasm, with intense staining in the submembrane region. In break-apart, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for ALK, split of the 5' and 3' probe signals, and isolated 3' signals were observed.

To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development.",

The CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline comprises 37 recommendations (evidence grade A or B), expert consensus opinions, or suggestions that address the following five principal questions: (1) When should molecular testing be performed? (2) How should EGFR testing be performed? (3) How should ALK testing be performed? (4) Should other genes be routinely tested in lung adenocarcinoma? (5) How should molecular testing be implemented and operationalized?;The ASCO review panel endorses the CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline. This guideline represents an important advance toward standardization of EGFR and ALK testing practices and is of major clinical relevance in advancing the care of patients with lung cancer. In the Discussion section, the ASCO review panel highlights three evolving areas: advances in ALK testing methodology, considerations for selecting appropriate populations for molecular testing, and emergence of other targetable molecular alterations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor gene represent important therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma, yet their clinical translation has been challenging. The ALK(F1174L) mutation is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib only at high doses and mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-translocated cancers. We have shown that the combination of crizotinib and an inhibitor of downstream signaling induces a favorable response in transgenic mice bearing ALK(F1174L)/MYCN-positive neuroblastoma. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of this effect and assessed whether a similar strategy would be effective in ALK-mutated tumors lacking MYCN overexpression. We show that in ALK-mutated, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells, crizotinib alone does not affect mTORC1 activity as indicated by persistent RPS6 phosphorylation. Combined treatment with crizotinib and an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor abrogated RPS6 phosphorylation, leading to reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in ALK(F1174L)/MYCN-positive models compared to single agent treatment. By contrast, this combination, while inducing mTORC1 downregulation, caused reciprocal upregulation of PI3K activity in ALK-mutated cells expressing wild-type MYCN. Here, an inhibitor with potency against both mTOR and PI3K was more effective in promoting cytotoxicity when combined with crizotinib. Our findings should enable a more precise selection of molecularly targeted agents for patients with ALK-mutated tumors. ",

An extensive search of the literature was performed in Medline and Web of Science using the following terms: \"inflammatory myofibrolastic tumor,\" \"inflammatory pseudotumor,\" and \"bladder.\" A manual search was also performed using the web-based search engine Google Scholar. Reference lists of the retrieved articles were reviewed for other relevant studies. Patients' and disease characteristics of each individual case were reviewed. Further analyses were performed to compare between ALK-positive and ALK-negative IMTs. Forty-one studies were identified, and 182 patients were included for review and subsequent analyses. Of the IMTs, 65% were ALK-positive. Local tumor recurrence rate was 4%, and no cases of distant metastases have been reported. Compared with ALK-negative IMTs, ALK-positive IMTs had a female predilection with a sex ratio (male:female) of 1:1.67 (P = .048). ALK-positive IMTs also appeared to occur in younger patients (P = .072). No significant differences were noted in terms of their clinical presentations and histologic features. On immunohistochemical staining, ALK-positive IMTs had more positive results for desmin (P = .042) and p53 (P = .05), and more negative results for clusterin (P = .003). In summary, ALK-positive IMTs of the urinary bladder had a female predilection, appeared to occur more frequently in younger patients, and had different immunohistochemical staining patterns when compared with ALK-negative IMTs. Regardless of its ALK status, IMT of the urinary bladder has a good prognosis after surgical resection.",

        "Doc_abstract":"EML4-ALK is a new driver gene of non-small cell lung cancer and a target of crizotinib. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of ALK rearrangements in a large cohort of patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma and to analyze the association of ALK rearrangements with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes. The roles of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC), and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the detection of ALK rearrangements were evaluated. The ALK rearrangement was detected in 430 specimens from individual patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma using FISH and Ventana IHC based on tissue microarrays. The EGFR status was detected in all of the specimens through DNA sequencing. An RT-PCR was performed on 200 of the specimens and confirmed by sequencing. Of the 430 patients, 46 (10.7%) harbored ALK rearrangements. The ALK rearrangements were associated with a younger age and the EGFR wild type in comparison with ALK-negative patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the Ventana IHC were 100% and 98.2%, respectively, and the concordance rate between the FISH and the Ventana IHC was 98.4%. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were 95.5% and 87.0%, respectively, and the concordance rate between the FISH and the RT-PCR was 89.0%. The Cox analysis indicated that an early stage and EGFR-activating mutations were independently associated with a longer OS. This study demonstrated that ALK rearrangements are associated with a younger age and the EGFR wild type rather than with other clinicopathological factors. Although the FISH and Ventana IHC have better concordance, and RT-PCR is a more sensitive method and can identify different variants or partners, the IHC and RT-PCR need to be further evaluated in clinical trials to identify their roles in guiding patients' targeted therapy using crizotinib.
