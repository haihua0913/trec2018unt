        "Doc_abstract":"Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare variant of melanoma with distinct clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features. Clinically, DM differs from conventional melanoma by a higher propensity for local recurrence and less frequent metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes. In its pure form, DM has a distinct appearance displaying a low density of fusiform melanocytes in a collagen-rich matrix. Whereas a number of mutations have been identified in primary melanoma, including BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, GNA11, and KIT, and the occurrence of these mutations has been found to correlate to some extent with the histopathologic features, anatomic site, and/or mode of sun exposure, no distinct set of mutations has so far been reported for DM. To study the potential association of neurofibromin (NF1) mutations with DM, we examined 15 desmoplastic and 20 non-DMs by next-generation sequencing. Mutations of the NF1 gene were found in 14 of 15 (93%) DMs and 4 of 20 (20%) non-DMs. The high frequency of NF1 mutations in DMs suggests an important role for NF1 in the biology of this type of melanoma.

Our analysis established NF1, encoding a negative regulator of RAS, as the third most frequently mutated gene in melanoma, after BRAF and NRAS. Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs. We conclude that NF1 is a key tumor suppressor lost in melanomas, and that concurrent RASopathy gene mutations may enhance its role in melanomagenesis. ",

The main diagnostic signs are visible on the skin and this opens several interesting aspects for dermatological point of view. The NF1 syndrome is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene which encodes the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin. Neurofibromin functions as a Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), and NF1 mutations lead to over-activation of the Ras signaling pathway. The NF1 gene and neurofibromin have intriguing functions in keratinocytes and melanocytes. Neurofibromin regulates melanin synthesis and keratinocyte differentiation in a currently unknown manner. The NF1 gene has also an important but poorly understood role in tumorigenesis and cancer. Compared to the general population, NF1 patients have a fivefold risk for cancer and a more than 2000-fold risk for neurogenic malignancies. Mutations of the NF1 gene are common in numerous cancer types in patients without NF1, and this suggests a more general role for the NF1 gene in oncogenesis. In melanoma, NF1 mutations seem to drive tumorigenesis and contribute to drug resistance.

An excess of neoplasia especially tumours of neuroectodermal origin is classically observed. The occurrence of malignant melanoma in patients with NF1 has already been described in scattered clinical reports but little is known as to the characteristics of melanoma arising in NF1 patients. A multicentric retrospective study was conducted on a panel of French referring centres for a period of 13 years to identify patients with both melanoma and NF1. Patients with mucosal or ocular melanoma were excluded. The diagnosis of malignant melanoma was based on specific histology whereas NF1 was identified according to the criteria proposed by the NIH Consensus Conference. All patient fulfilling criteria for both melanoma and NF1 were investigated using a common procedure recording clinical and histological data along with prognostic factors for the two diseases. Eleven patients were identified with both diseases. The clinical pattern of NF1 was quite similar to the classical form of the disease, but some unusual features were present as regards to the melanoma: a sex-ratio of 10 women for one man and an average age lower than expected (median age=33 years) for melanoma occurrence. Among prognostic factors, median thickness was high compared to large series of melanoma in the literature (3.20 versus 1.5 mm). Another neoplasia occurred in three patients. An increase in melanoma incidence in patients with NF1 remains hypothetical but our small series of malignant melanoma arising in NF1 patients displays a large female preponderance, a higher thickness than expected and a frequent association with a second neoplasia. The peculiar female proneness for cancer whatever its localization and the risk of multiple neoplasias have already been reported in NF1 patients and could be true for malignant melanoma as well.",

A melanoma cell line harbouring a 1p32 deletion involving the TAL1 gene and the presence of TAL1 protein in developing mouse melanocytes led us to investigate whether TAL1 deletions and/or TAL1 protein expression occur in sporadic melanomas. DNA extracted from 32 fresh melanomas was amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction for the four common deletions of the TAL1 gene that occur in T-ALL. In addition, frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of these melanomas were stained with monoclonal antibodies that detect full-length and truncated TAL1 protein. The results of the study show that deletions of TAL1 do not occur in melanoma. Indeed, full and truncated TAL1 protein also could not be detected immunohistochemically in the paraffin-embedded and frozen sections of the melanomas.

We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor.

In a previous study, we determined the expression of a short truncated 50 kDa form of P-cadherin only consisting of the N-terminal part in malignant melanoma. Further analysis revealed that this short 50 kDa form of P-cadherin representing the N-terminal, extracellular region, is secreted by melanoma cells in contrast to the membrane bound form in melanocytes. In order to define the functional relevance of expression of the 50 kDa P-cadherin variant in malignant melanoma, antisense P-cadherin cell clones were generated. The clones in which P-cadherin expression is reduced show no changes in proliferation or in attachment-independent growth when compared to controls. However, a strong reduction of migratory and invasive properties was observed in these cells, suggesting that truncated P-cadherin promotes melanoma cell invasion and migration and therefore has an important role in the progression of malignant melanoma.

At the same time, either truncated or full-length forms of ATF2 reduced UVC-induced activation of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) promoter and decreased expression of TNFalpha. Forced expression of c-Jun in ATF2-expressing melanoma cells restored TNFalpha expression, suggesting that both forms of ATF2 sequestered transcription factors that positively regulate TNFalpha expression in response to UV irradiation. Antagonistic antibodies to Fas, but not to TNFR1, efficiently suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the Fas pathway mediates the primary apoptotic signal in melanoma cells whereas the TNFR1 pathway elicits a survival signal. Indeed, treatment of melanoma cells with TNFalpha before UVC irradiation partially suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis, further supporting the protective role of TNFalpha in UVC-treated melanoma cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that ATF2 contributes to UVC-induced apoptosis through transcriptional silencing of TNFalpha, which balances Fas-mediated cell death in melanoma.",

Skeletrophin is an actin-binding cytoskeleton-related molecule, which is induced by the overexpression of truncated human SWI1 (SMARCF1). Human SWI1 is a sub-unit of the chromatin remodeling complex and binds chromatin through its ARID (AT-rich interactive domain). Truncated SWI1 lacks one of the two glucocorticoid-receptor binding domains and inhibits the intact human SWI1 in a dominant negative manner. Skeletrophin, was therefore identified as a candidate molecule for the indication of change to a malignant phenotype due to the aberrant function of the chromatin remodeling complex. Surprisingly, the skeletrophin gene is located in 1p36.32, where the putative tumor suppressor gene of cutaneous malignant melanoma has long been postulated to be on. Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor. To overcome the clinical problem of malignant melanoma and highly invasive and metastatic activity, it is important to unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for melanoma progression. Recent studies including those from our laboratories have elucidated that skeletrophin is a novel RING-HC type ubiquitin ligase and that the ubiquitin ligase pathway mediated by skeletrophin acts to oppose melanoma cell invasion. Here, we summarize the characterization of skeletrophin, with emphasis on its biological activity, the disruption of which is linked with melanoma progression.",

We systematically examined melanoma cell lines for activating CTNNB1 mutations as well as genetic and epigenetic alterations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), another key component of the Wnt signalling transduction pathway. Of 40 cell lines tested, one carried a truncating APC mutation and loss of the corresponding wild-type allele, and one carried a CTNNB1 missense mutation. Hypermethylation of APC promoter 1A was present in five of the cell lines (13%) and in nine of 54 melanoma biopsies (17%). Cells with truncating APC or activating CTNNB1 mutations showed increased transcription from endogenous and ectopic beta-catenin/T-cell factor (Tcf)-responsive target genes, consistent with the known effects of these alterations on beta-catenin stability and Tcf transactivation. In contrast, cell lines with APC promoter 1A hypermethylation did not show increased Wnt signalling, probably due to residual APC activity expressed from promoter 1B. Suppression of APC transcripts in melanoma cells by stable expression of short hairpin RNAs led to a Wnt signalling-independent increase in cell proliferation, but also reduced the invasive growth in collagen type I. Collectively, our data suggest that the tumour-suppressive function of APC in melanocytic cells is dose dependent. We propose that epigenetic silencing of promoter 1A may contribute to the development of malignant melanoma by reducing the expression of APC to a level that promotes cell proliferation without compromising the invasive capacity.",

Thus RAD51B is a good candidate melanoma susceptibility gene, and previously, a germline splicing mutation in RAD51B has been identified in a family with early-onset breast cancer. In order to find genetic variants associated with melanoma predisposition, whole-exome sequencing was carried out on blood samples from a three-case cutaneous melanoma family.

Most Dutch melanoma families segregate for a unique founder mutation (p16-Leiden), encoding a truncated nonfunctional p16 protein. The highly variable risk for p16-Leiden carriers to develop melanoma suggests a role for other genetic and/or environmental factors. We hypothesized that a 9p21 gene other than CDKN2A may be relevant in the remaining 9p21-linked melanoma families without p16 mutations but may also act as a risk modifier in p16-Leiden carriers. Haplotype analysis for 9p21 was performed using microsatellite markers in six p16-Leiden families originating from a founder population. p16-Leiden carriers in two families shared an unexpectedly large founder haplotype ( approximately 20-cM) around CDKN2A, mostly in proximal direction. Melanoma-positive p16-Leiden carriers from these families showed this extensive proximal haplotype compared with melanoma-negative p16-Leiden carriers from the same families. Additional p16-Leiden families less heavily affected with melanoma showed shorter haplotypes sharing, excluding the region proximally of CDKN2A. The presence of a gene involved in melanoma susceptibility proximal of CDKN2A is corroborated by somatic deletions of 9p in tumors, which frequently do not include CDKN2A but a more proximal chromosomal area instead. Our results provide a candidate region for further gene mapping in p16-negative 9p21-linked melanoma families and guide the search for risk modifiers in melanoma development.",

Chromosome 17 contains important tumor suppressor genes such as p53, NM23, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which have been implicated in melanoma tumorigenesis. The role of p53 has already been studied by a number of laboratories, showing contrasting results. In the present study, two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes for the NM23 and NF1 genes, together with five other RFLP and four variable number of tandem repeat chromosome 17 probes, were investigated at the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) level in a Southern blot-based assay. The NF1 gene was also tested for LOH by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach in two different experiments, using a dinucleotide repeat polymorphic probe at locus D17S250 (17q11.2-q12), and an Alu probe intragenic to the NF1 gene (17q11.2). A PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism assay was included in the study for mutation detection at the NF1-GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD). A total of 68 melanocytic tumors were analyzed. LOH was detected in 9 of 87 informative cases (10%). LEW301 (17p11.2-pcen) presented the highest LOH frequency (22%). NM23 showed LOH in 17% of the informative cases, while NF1 did not show either LOH in the Southern blot- and PCR-based experiments or mutations at the NF1-GRD. These results are in concordance with those of previous smaller studies, but when compared with higher LOH frequencies obtained from other chromosomes, these findings indicate that the LOH values found in our study can most likely be attributed to background effect. Thus, chromosome 17 LOH is likely to play and unimportant role as a genetic event in melanoma tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, NF1 merits further study, since homozygous deletions have been detected at this locus in melanoma cell lines.",

This leads to increased PI3K/AKT signaling associated with reduced DNA methylation and increased cell proliferation in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Here, we provide additional data that indicates a reciprocal regulation of PREX2 by PTEN whereby loss of PTEN results in a dramatic increase in expression of PREX2 at the protein level. Pharmacologic studies revealed destabilization of PREX2 by inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling. Additionally, we provide data to show a selective decrease in a particular histone mark, H4 Lys20 trimethylation, in cells expressing PREX2 (E824*) truncating mutation globally and at the imprint control region of CDKN1C (also known as p57) and IGF2. The decrease in H4K20 trimethylation coupled with DNA hypomethylation at this particular locus is associated with genomic imprinting and regulation of expression of p57 and IGF2. Taken together, these results demonstrate the complex signaling mechanisms that involve PREX2, PI3K/AKT/PTEN and downstream epigenetic machinery to deregulate expression of key cell cycle regulators.

We analyzed 8 benign melanocytic nevi, 8 primary melanomas and 19 melanoma metastases for alterations of TA-p73 and DeltaTA-p73 expression using isoform-specific real-time RT-PCR. Based on our results, p73Deltaex2 and Deltaex2/3 spliced transcripts derived from the first promoter were significantly up-regulated in melanoma metastases, whereas DeltaN-p73 generated from the second promoter was the predominant isoform in benign nevi.

However, high levels of p53 were detected in all cell lines, including melanoma cells with wild-type p53, with the exception of one line with a truncated form. Upon UV induction, p53 accumulated in lines with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes p21Cip1/Waf1, GADD45, and mdm2 were induced, but the induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 was significantly delayed as compared with the increase in p53 DNA-binding activity. However, despite p53 target gene induction, p53 DNA-binding activity was absent in one melanoma line with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes were induced also in cells with mutant p53. In response to UV, DNA replication ceased in all cell lines, and apoptosis ensued in four lines independently of p53 but correlated with high induction of GADD45. The results suggest that in melanoma, several p53 regulatory steps are dislodged; its basal expression is high, its activation in response to UV damage is diminished, and the regulation of its target genes p21Cip1/Waf1 and GADD45 are dissociated from p53 regulation.",

The cytotoxicity of human IFNβ gene lipofection resulted higher or equivalent to that of the corresponding addition of the recombinant protein (rhIFNβ) to human cells. IFNβ gene lipofection was not cytotoxic for only one canine melanoma cell line. When cultured as monolayers, three human and three canine IFNβ-lipofected melanoma cell lines displayed a remarkable bystander effect. As spheroids, the same six cell lines were sensitive to IFNβ gene transfer, two displaying a significant multicell resistance phenotype. The effects of conditioned IFNβ-lipofected canine melanoma cell culture media suggested the release of at least one soluble thermolabile cytotoxic factor that could not be detected in human melanoma cells. By using a secretion signal-free truncated human IFNβ, we showed that its intracellular expression was enough to induce cytotoxicity in two human melanoma cell lines. The lower cytoplasmatic levels of reactive oxygen species detected after intracellular IFNβ expression could be related to the resistance displayed by one human melanoma cell line. As IFNβ gene transfer was effective against most of the assayed melanomas in a way not limited by relatively low lipofection efficiencies, the clinical potential of this approach is strongly supported.

An unexpected finding was that one of the clones encoded a truncated scFv molecule with most of the VL domain deleted, indicating that a VH domain alone can exhibit tumor-specific binding. In this report a VH fusion phage library containing VH domains unassociated with VL domains was compared with a scFv fusion phage library as a source of melanoma-specific clones; both libraries contained the same VH domains from the vaccinated melanoma patient. The results demonstrate that the clones can be isolated from both libraries, and that both libraries should be used to optimize the chance of isolating clones binding to different epitopes. Although this strategy has been tested only for melanoma, it is also applicable to other cancers. Because of their small size, human origin and specificity for cell surface tumor antigens, the VH and scFv molecules have significant advantages as tumor-targeting molecules for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and can also serve as probes for identifying the cognate tumor antigens.",

We have discovered that in WM1158, a highly aggressive melanoma cell line, down-regulation of ACTN4 by shRNA induces a collagen I-dependent amoeboidal-to-mesenchymal transition. Re-expression of low levels of WT ACTN4 but not similar expression levels of ACTN1 successfully restores the amoeboidal morphology and limits collagen I gel compaction. A truncated ACTN4 mutant 1-890, which lacks the C-terminal tail, fails to rescue the amoeboidal morphology and to compact collagen I gel. Interestingly, in three-dimensional collagen I gels, ACTN4 KD cells are more polarized compared with cells in which scrambled shRNA is expressed. Surprisingly, ACTN4 KD cells migrate faster than the ones expressing the scrambled shRNA on a collagen I gel (two-dimensional) although these two cell lines migrate similarly on tissue culture. Most importantly, down-regulation of ACTN4 significantly reduced invasion of WM1158 cells into the three-dimensional collagen I gel, a representative of the dermis. Taken together, these findings suggest that ACTN4 plays an important role in maintaining the amoeboidal morphology of invasive melanoma and thus promoting dissemination through collagen-rich matrices.

We performed a systematic analysis of telomere-related genes and tagSNPs within these genes, in relation to the risk of melanoma, dysplastic nevi, and nevus count combining data from four studies conducted in Italy. In addition, we examined whether telomere length measured in peripheral blood leukocytes is related to the risk of melanoma, dysplastic nevi, number of nevi, or telomere-related SNPs. A total of 796 cases and 770 controls were genotyped for 517 SNPs in 39 telomere-related genes genotyped with a custom-made array. Replication of the top SNPs was conducted in two American populations consisting of 488 subjects from 53 melanoma-prone families and 1,086 cases and 1,024 controls from a case-control study. We estimated odds ratios for associations with SNPs and combined SNP P-values to compute gene region-specific, functional group-specific, and overall P-value using an adaptive rank-truncated product algorithm. In the Mediterranean population, we found suggestive evidence that RECQL4, a gene involved in genome stability, RTEL1, a gene regulating telomere elongation, and TERF2, a gene implicated in the protection of telomeres, were associated with melanoma, the presence of dysplastic nevi and number of nevi, respectively. However, these associations were not found in the American samples, suggesting variable melanoma susceptibility for these genes across populations or chance findings in our discovery sample.

We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series.

Mel-CAM was first identified as an integral membrane glycoprotein in human melanoma and is also abundantly expressed by endothelial cells of various origins. In a previous study (I. M. Shih et al., Cancer Res., 54: 2514-2520, 1994), we showed that Mel-CAM is a cell-cell adhesion molecule with a possible role in melanoma invasion and metastasis. Here, we define the molecular mechanism responsible for cell-cell adhesion of Mel-CAM and demonstrate its role in melanoma-endothelial cell interactions. Most of human melanoma cells, including Mel-CAM-negative SBcl-2 cells, adhered to nitrocellulose-immobilized Mel-CAM produced by baculovirus recombinants. This adhesion can be blocked by full-length Mel-CAM or polyclonal antiserum against Mel-CAM. Adhesion is not affected by the presence of EDTA, truncated Mel-CAM extracellular domain, or heparan sulfate proteoglycan. In cell aggregation assays, Mel-CAM-negative SBcl-2 cells cluster with U937TM cells (U937 transfected with Mel-CAM cDNA) but not with control nontransfectants, suggesting that SBcl-2 cells express the ligand for Mel-CAM. SBcl-2 cells also form heterotypic aggregates with Mel-CAM-positive human endothelial cells but not with Mel-CAM-negative but ligand-positive smooth muscle cells. Taken together, our results show that Mel-CAM mediates cell-cell adhesion through heterophilic adhesion to an as yet unidentified ligand present on melanoma but not on endothelial cells.

Whole-exome sequencing identified an apparent missense mutation of BAP1 in UMM, CMM, as well as paraganglioma, breast cancer, and suspected mesothelioma cases in the family. Bioinformatic analysis and splicing assays demonstrated that this mutation creates a strong cryptic splice donor, resulting in aberrant splicing and a truncating frameshift of the BAP1 transcript.

We analyzed genomics data from 136 uveal melanoma samples and found a recurrent mutation in CYSLTR2 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) encoding a p.Leu129Gln substitution in 4 of 9 samples that lacked mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, and PLCB4 but in 0 of 127 samples that harbored mutations in these genes. The Leu129Gln CysLT2R mutant protein constitutively activates endogenous Gαq and is unresponsive to stimulation by leukotriene. Expression of Leu129Gln CysLT2R in melanocytes enforces expression of a melanocyte-lineage signature, drives phorbol ester-independent growth in vitro, and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo.

The homophilic cell adhesion function of wild-type ALCAM mediates homotypic clustering of melanoma cells and would, thus, antagonize cell release from the primary tumor, an early prerequisite for metastasis. Stable transfection of a transmembrane, amino-terminally truncated ALCAM (DeltaN-ALCAM) into metastatic cells diminished cell clustering mediated by wild-type ALCAM. We have addressed the biological effects of DeltaN-ALCAM on tumorigenicity and found that the relief of cell clustering constraints promoted motility in vitro and the transition from expansive tumor growth to tissue invasion in reconstructed skin in culture. In a transplant tumor model, the changes were reflected in reduced subcutaneous tumor growth and in accelerated, spontaneous lung metastasis. These data indicate that the intact cell adhesion function of ALCAM may both favor primary tumor growth and represent a rate-limiting step for tissue invasion from VGP melanoma.

A patient with multiple neurofibromas was referred with a provisional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior molecular testing, though, had failed to identify an NF1 mutation by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. His family history was significant for multiple in situ/malignant melanomas at young ages and several different cancers reminiscent of an underlying syndrome. A search of the Familial Cancer Database, FaCD Online, highlighted several families with cutaneous melanoma and nervous system tumours who were subsequently identified to have large deletions spanning CDKN2A. Although sequencing of CDKN2A and TP53 failed to identify a mutation, a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion was identified by targeted array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH and SNP analysis identified an interstitial deletion of at least 1.5 Mb within 9p21.3 and spanning approximately 25 genes. Identification of the underlying molecular abnormality permits predictive testing for at-risk relatives.

Anti-Pmel17 immunoprecipitates from metabolically pulse labeled melanoma cells and melanocytes contain, in addition to full-length Pmel17, a glycoprotein that migrates with a lower relative molecular weight. Here we show that this glycoprotein is encoded by an mRNA that results from alternative splicing of the human Pmel17 gene from which a cryptic intron is excised. Immunoprecipitation recapture experiments showed that this glycoprotein contained both the N- and C-termini of full-length Pmel17. Sequence analysis of cDNA corresponding to the alternatively spliced form reveals the loss of three of 10 imperfect direct repeats from the central region of the lumenal domain. The product of the splice variant is processed with similar kinetics to full-length Pmel17, and localizes similarly to late endosomes when expressed ectopically in nonpigment cells. We speculate that truncation of the repeat region within Pmel17 alters either fibrillogenic activity or the interaction of Pmel17 with melanin intermediates. The expression of an alternatively spliced product may furthermore affect the cohort of peptides generated for recognition of melanoma cells by tumor-directed T lymphocytes.",

HLA-A2 antigen is selectively lost in primary melanoma lesions and more frequently in metastases. Only scanty information is available about the molecular mechanisms underlying this abnormality, in spite of its potentially negative impact on the clinical course of the disease and on the outcome of T cell-based immunotherapy. Therefore, in this study we have shown that the selective HLA-A2 antigen loss in melanoma cells 624MEL28 is caused by a splicing defect of HLA-A2 pre-mRNA because of a base substitution at the 5' splice donor site of intron 2 of the HLA-A2 gene. As a result, HLA-A2 transcripts are spliced to two aberrant forms, one with exon 2 skipping and the other with intron 2 retention. The latter is not translated because of an early premature stop codon in the retained intron. In contrast, the transcript with exon 2 skipping is translated to a truncated HLA-A2 heavy chain without the alpha(1) domain. Such a polypeptide is synthesized in vitro but is not detectable in cells, probably because of the low steady state level of the corresponding mRNA and the low translation efficiency. These results indicate that a single mutational event in an HLA class I gene is sufficient for loss of the corresponding allele. This may account, at least in part, for the high frequency of selective HLA class I allele loss in melanoma cells. Our conclusion emphasizes the need to implement active specific immunotherapy with a combination of peptides presented by various HLA class I alleles. This strategy may counteract the ability of melanoma cells with selective HLA class I allele loss to escape from immune recognition.",

In addition, application of the monoclonal antibody L235 against MTf as well as truncated, soluble MTf (sMTf) abolished plasminogen binding to MTf-transfected and SK-MeL-28 cells, indicating that mMTf is a potential cell surface plasminogen receptor. Moreover, mMTf expression in CHO cells stimulates plasminogen activation at the cell surface by about 2.5-fold. In addition to the induced binding and activation of plasminogen, cell motility, migration and invasion were about 3-fold higher in CHO cells expressing mMTf.

In this study, we have detected both the full-length and the truncated versions of P-cadherin in cell lysates of differentiated head and neck oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, whereas in cell lysates of dedifferentiated cell lines, we detected only the truncated 50 kDa version of P-cadherin. Treatment of the cell lines with a recombinantly expressed biotinylated, soluble 50 kDa form of the N-terminal part of P-cadherin revealed a major effect on cell aggregation and migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. However, the 50 kDa N-terminal fragment of P-cadherin did not show any influence on cell proliferation in 2D and 3D cell culture.

The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

Cell invasion was analyzed in vitro by Matrigel invasion assays. Gelatinase A was activated in all cell clones. However, the localization of MT1-MMP to the leading edge of migrating cells and cell invasion through Matrigel were strongly enhanced only in cells expressing either wild type or truncated MT1-MMP lacking 6 C-terminal amino acid residues (Delta577).

A synthetic MMP inhibitor but not a gelatinase inhibitor prevented the processing, suggesting that autocatalytic cleavage occurs.

Yet, the impact of sequence variation on the regulatory potential of gene promoters has not been systematically evaluated. This study assesses the impact of promoter mutations on promoter activity in the whole-genome sequenced malignant melanoma cell line COLO-829. Combining somatic mutation calls from COLO-829 with genome-wide chromatin accessibility and histone modification data revealed mutations within promoter elements. Interestingly, a high number of potential promoter mutations (n = 23) were found, a result mirrored in subsequent analysis of TCGA whole-melanoma genomes. The impact of wild-type and mutant promoter sequences were evaluated by subcloning into luciferase reporter vectors and testing their transcriptional activity in COLO-829 cells. Of the 23 promoter regions tested, four mutations significantly altered reporter activity relative to wild-type sequences. These data were then subjected to multiple computational algorithms that score the cis-regulatory altering potential of mutations. These analyses identified one mutation, located within the promoter region of NDUFB9, which encodes the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 9, to be recurrent in 4.4% (19 of 432) of TCGA whole-melanoma exomes. The mutation is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved SP1/KLF transcription factor binding motif and its frequent co-occurrence with mutations in the coding sequence of NF1 supports a pathologic role for this mutation in melanoma. Taken together, these data show the relatively high prevalence of promoter mutations in the COLO-829 melanoma genome, and indicate that a proportion of these significantly alter the regulatory potential of gene promoters.;Genomic-based screening within gene promoter regions suggests that functional cis-regulatory mutations may be common in melanoma genomes, highlighting the need to examine their role in tumorigenesis.",

To identify regulatory sequences involved in locus-specific HLA class I gene transcription, a series of truncated HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 promoter-reporter constructs were transfected into melanoma cell lines expressing high and low levels of endogenous HLA-B, but comparable levels of HLA-A. These experiments showed that differential regulation of HLA-B expression in melanoma cell lines is mediated by a previously unidentified co-operative action of enhancer A, located 175 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (+1), and a specific region of 20 nucleotides located at +13 to +33 bp downstream of the transcription initiation site. Furthermore, we demonstrated binding of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 to the HLA-A +13/+33 bp region, but not to the equivalent HLA-B region.

The present study demonstrates that this effect depends on the activation of STAT transcription factors. We observed a correlation between the extent of growth inhibition exerted by IL-6, IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor or oncostatin M (OSM) and the intensities of STAT3 and STAT1 signals. A truncated chimeric receptor retaining only the membrane-proximal region of gp130, the common signal transducer of IL-6-type cytokines, did neither activate STATs nor mediate growth arrest of stable transfectants. These functions were restored by the addition of short STAT recruitment modules comprising critical tyrosine residues from gp130 (Y767, Y814). A receptor carrying tyrosine module Y759 of gp130 effectively mediated activation of the phosphatase SHP-2 but did not alter cell growth. Overexpression of dominant negative forms of STAT3 but not STAT1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of OSM and IL-6 in A375 cells. In addition, we have identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kipl as a novel target to be regulated by IL-6-type cytokines. Stimulation-dependent upregulation of p27 mRNA occurred STAT3-dependently. Also p27 protein accumulated which coincided with the disappearance of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein in three human melanoma cell lines sensitive to IL-6-type cytokines.",

Two of these loss-of-function mutants were analyzed for genetic defects in ONC-Xmrk's.

TX-1 is obviously an active LTR-containing retrotransposon in Xiphophorus that was not found in other fish species outside the family Poeciliidae. Surprisingly, it does not encode any protein, suggesting the existence of a helper function for this retroelement. In the lof-2 mutant the entire ONC-Xmrk gene was found to be deleted.

Since neurofibromin is expressed in the adrenal gland, six pheochromocytomas and one adrenal cortical tumor were examined for neurofibromin expression. In all seven tumors, no neurofibromin could be detected. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis demonstrated that in one of the pheochromocytomas, reduction to homozygosity was observed for both 17p and 17q markers while the adrenal cortical tumor demonstrated LOH for only 17q markers.

We hypothesized that tyrosinase expression in transfected nonmelanotic cells can be used in a gene therapy paradigm of prodrug activation. To verify our hypothesis, we used the following tyrosinase variants: (a) a full-length human tyrosinase clone (T); (b) a mutant lacking the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (TdeltaC); (c) a mutant lacking the COOH-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (TdeltaTC); and (d) a fusion with the eight COOH-terminal amino acids of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (TL). Expression of mutant and wild-type tyrosinases was induced by transfection in nontumorigenic human cells of epithelial origin (293HEK, MCF-10A adenoma, and NHDF-Ad human dermal fibroblasts) as well as in tumor cells (9L gliosarcoma, MCF7 adenocarcinoma, and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma). When compared with the wild-type tyrosinase transfectants, truncated mutant expression resulted in higher mRNA levels that paralleled higher enzyme activity of the truncated mutants. Two model tyrosinase prodrugs, hydroxyphenyl-propanol (HPP) and N-acetyl-4-S-cysteaminylphenol (NAcSCAP) inhibited proliferation and caused cell death of transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Effects of prodrug treatment were compared for tumorigenic cells and their nontumorigenic counterparts. Two truncated mutants (TdeltaC and TdeltaTC) showed low endogenous cytotoxicity and efficiently suppressed proliferation and induced cytotoxicity in transfected tumor cells in the presence of NAcSCAP. Overall, these results indicate that the developed tyrosinase mutants hold promise as prodrug activation systems for tumoral gene therapy.",

To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Primary neoplastic transformation and metastatic spread were suggested by the appearance of multiple swellings over the \"garment\" precursor nevus at the posterior trunk, multiple ipsilateral axillary nodal enlargement, and fresh occipital swellings postadmission. Smaller-sized hyperpigmented lesions with irregular, nonlobulated, and frequently hairy surfaces were also discernible over the upper and lower extremities, but the face, anterior trunk, and mucosal surfaces were relatively spared. A diagnosis of MM was confirmed by the subsequent histopathologic findings from the fine-needle aspirate and biopsy specimens. Chemotherapy was initiated but was truncated shortly after by parent-pressured discharge. Despite the rarity of MM in a tropical African setting where management options are few, the current case underscores the need for a high clinical index of diagnostic suspicion, an early pursuit of investigative confirmation, and prophylactic excision in children with the predisposing skin lesions, like congenital giant hairy nevus. An expounded discourse of the possible precursors and management options of MM is provided. We emphasize the need for institutional cost subsidy for anticancer care in tropical children.",

In this study, biochemical protein purification methods were used in conjunction with novel mass spectrometry sequencing techniques and molecular cloning to isolate a unique melanoma Ag recognized by a CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) line. The HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted Ag was determined to be a mutated glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). A C to T mutation identified by cDNA sequencing caused a Thr to Ile conversion in TPI, which could be detected in a tryptic digest of tumor-derived TPI by mass spectrometry. The Thr to Ile conversion created a neoepitope whose T cell stimulatory activity was enhanced at least 5 logs compared with the wild-type peptide. Analysis of T cell recognition of serially truncated peptides suggested that the mutated amino acid residue was a T cell receptor contact.

Pure DM displays a low density of fusiform melanocytes in a collagen-rich matrix. In mixed DM, tumor cell density is higher, and parts of the tumor lack abundant stromal fibrosis. Both pure and mixed DMs usually express S100 protein homogenously. We report herein an unusual biphenotypic tumor characterized by the association of a pure DM with an undifferentiated solid spindle cell nodule. It occurred on the scalp of a 66-year-old man. A biopsy of the undifferentiated spindle cell nodule was initially interpreted at a commercial laboratory as atypical fibroxanthoma. The pure DM was seen only in the excisional specimen. All cells of the pure DM stained for S100 protein and SOX10. The adjacent solid sarcomatoid spindle cell nodule lacked expression of S100 protein, SOX10, as well as melan-A, gp100, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor in >95% of its tumor cells. Although focal expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens in the solid tumor component made us favor a combined DM with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, we also considered the possibility of a collision scenario, that is, a pleomorphic dermal sarcoma incidentally colliding with a DM. To further assess a possible relationship of the sarcomatoid nodule with the DM, we performed next-generation sequencing analysis on each component separately. The analysis revealed shared chromosomal copy number changes and a high number of common mutations, thereby supporting the concept of a DM with a dedifferentiated sarcomatoid component. An interesting finding is the presence of mutations of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in both tumor components. ",

Inoculation of syngeneic mice with B16alpha vaccine cells triggers immunity to the parental B16 tumor that is mediated by host macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Lymph node cells from mice inoculated with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells, but not with irradiated parental cells, proliferate when cultured in vitro, suggesting long-term in vivo activation of lymphoid cells. Long-term IFN-alpha treatment of B16alpha vaccine cells induced both interleukin-15 (IL-15) mRNA and IL-15 protein. The bulk of the induced IL-15 remained cell associated, either cytoplasmic or associated with the cell membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that the cell-associated IL-15 was broadly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that long-term IFN-alpha treatment may induce primarily the truncated isoform of IL-15. Vaccination with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells may promote tumor immunity by releasing high levels of cell-associated IL-15 when spontaneously lysed or directly killed by innate immune cells. The release of accumulated cell-associated IL-15 may then trigger a host T cell response to tumor antigens and cause host development of immunity to the B16 tumor cells.",

Here we provide genomic, cellular, and mouse modelling data demonstrating that the polycomb group gene SUZ12 functions as tumour suppressor in PNS tumours, high-grade gliomas and melanomas by cooperating with mutations in NF1. NF1 encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and its loss drives cancer by activating Ras. We show that SUZ12 loss potentiates the effects of NF1 mutations by amplifying Ras-driven transcription through effects on chromatin. Importantly, however, SUZ12 inactivation also triggers an epigenetic switch that sensitizes these cancers to bromodomain inhibitors. Collectively, these studies not only reveal an unexpected connection between the PRC2 complex, NF1 and Ras, but also identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be exploited for a variety of cancers.

Although it has been proposed to contribute to the control of cell growth and migration through association with the Ras GTPase-activating protein and the adapter protein Nck, the role of Dok-1 remains largely unknown. The functions of Dok-1 have now been investigated by the generation of two different COOH-terminal truncation mutants of this protein: one (DokPH+PTB) containing the pleckstrin homology and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, and the other (DokPH) composed only of the pleckstrin homology domain. Both of these mutant proteins were shown to act in a dominant negative manner. Overexpression of each of the mutants in highly metastatic B16F10 mouse melanoma cells thus both inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Dok-1 induced by cell adhesion as well as reduced the association of the endogenous protein with cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. Overexpression of DokPH+PTB in these cells also markedly reduced both the rates of cell spreading, migration, and growth as well as the extent of Ras activation. The effects of DokPH on these processes were less pronounced than were those of DokPH+PTB, indicating the importance of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain. These results suggest that at least in B16F10 cells, Dok-1 positively regulates not only cell spreading and migration but also cell growth and Ras activity.",

Despite specific attention, evidence for a role of factors other than sun and ultraviolet exposure is weak.;To update time trends of CMM in Israel.;A population-based cancer registry data base of CMM among Jews and non-Jews by age and gender was analyzed. A quality control survey was conducted to insure complete coverage and data validation for the period 1960-1989.;The incidence rate of CMM in All Jews increased throughout the study period, with a monotonic annual increase of 4.8% for males and 4.3% for females. There was a steep increase in incidence until the mid-1970s, with an a posteriori levelling-off. Also, incidence was higher in females than in males. There were variations in incidence among Jewish subpopulations. Israel-born Jews are the highest incidence subgroup (average age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) 7.8 and 9.4 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively), followed by Jews born in Europe and America (AAIR, 6.1 and 7.3 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively). The lowest rate was for Jews born in Africa and Asia (AAIR, 1.3 per 100,000 for both males and females).

Non-Jews have a stable rate which could either be real or an artifact of underdiagnosis.;The different time trend incidence patterns between subpopulations could be due to differing cumulative sun exposure over the last 40-50 years, mainly in those at age 45 and over.

Epigenetic markers, in particular, those based on aberrant DNA methylation, can be used to diagnose cancer. B melanoma antigens (BAGE) are a family of genes and truncated genes located in the heterochromatic regions of several human chromosomes. Our previous work showed that BAGE loci (i.e., genes and truncated genes) were hypermethylated in normal tissues and hypomethylated in 98% of human cancers. In the present study, we analyzed DNA methylation of the BAGE loci in 54 colon cancers and in neighboring histopathologic normal tissue samples. Using a combined bisulfite restriction assay, we showed that BAGE loci were hypomethylated in 81% of carcinoma samples. Colon cancer could be diagnosed with 94% specificity, 83% sensitivity, and 89% accuracy. No correlation was found between DNA methylation of BAGE loci and age, gender of patients, nor with the tumor stage or site. Based on the hypothesis that during neoplastic transformation, hypomethylation occurs in juxtacentromeric CpG islands, we suggest that other genes located in the heterochromatic compartment should be tested.

The truncated tetrasaccharide on alpha-TM served as an acceptor, whereas the linkage tetrasaccharide-serine did not. Our characterization of the radioactively labelled product by enzymic digestion revealed that the N-[3H]acetylgalactosamine residue was transferred to alpha-TM through a beta1,4-linkage. The substrate competition experiments with the chondro-hexasaccharide and alpha-TM reinforced our speculation that a common N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase catalysed the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to both the linkage tetrasaccharide and the longer chondroitin oligosaccharides. Moreover, chondroitin polymerization was demonstrated on the tetrasaccharide of alpha-TM using both UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine as sugar donors. Much longer chains were synthesized on alpha-TM than on the linkage penta- and hexa-saccharide-serines. Together, these results indicated that the core protein is required for the transfer of the first N-acetylgalactosamine residue through a beta1,4-linkage and also for subsequent efficient chain polymerization reactions, and that the critical determining step for chondroitin sulphate biosynthesis is the transfer of the first N-acetylgalactosamine residue.",

To determine the need for the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha v-subunit, in the association of pp60c-src with alpha v beta 3, a cell line expressing truncated alpha v was studied. M21-L cells lacked alpha v expression but stably transfected with complementary DNAs encoding alpha v full length protein alpha v 1018 or alpha v 995 (lacking 23 carboxyl-terminal amino acids), and a fibroblast cell line (FG) expressing alpha v beta 5 but not alpha v beta 3, were used. Western analysis and immune complex kinase assays of anti- alpha v immunoprecipitates demonstrated that M21-L/alpha v995 cells did not exhibit pp60c-src association with alpha v, whereas the alpha v1018 complementary DNA transfected cells and FG cells had pp60c-src associated with the alpha v integrins. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed pp60c-src, alpha v beta 3 integrin, and actin distribution along the plasma membrane of M21 cells. 35S-labeling of cells and analysis of complexes immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody against alpha v beta 3 demonstrated association of actin with the immune complexes.

Heterologous expression would also facilitate drug discovery for this important target. DNAs encoding ABCB5 sequences were cloned into the chromosomal PDR5 locus of a S. cerevisiae strain in which seven endogenous ABC transporters have been deleted. Protein expression in the yeast cells was monitored by immunodetection using both a specific anti-ABCB5 antibody and a cross-reactive anti-ABCB1 antibody. ABCB5 function in recombinant yeast cells was measured by determining whether the cells possessed increased resistance to known pump substrates, compared to the host yeast strain, in assays of yeast growth. Three ABCB5 constructs were made in yeast. One was derived from the ABCB5-β mRNA, which is highly expressed in human tissues but is a truncation of a canonical full-size ABC transporter. Two constructs contained full-length ABCB5 sequences: either a native sequence from cDNA or a synthetic sequence codon-harmonized for S. cerevisiae. Expression of all three constructs in yeast was confirmed by immunodetection. Expression of the codon-harmonized full-length ABCB5 DNA conferred increased resistance, relative to the host yeast strain, to the putative substrates rhodamine 123, daunorubicin, tetramethylrhodamine, FK506, or clorgyline.

Analysis of a substantial panel of cell lines and patient lesions showed that Notch activity is significantly higher in melanomas than their nontransformed counterparts. The use of a constitutively active, truncated Notch transgene construct (N(IC)) was exploited to determine if Notch activation is a \"driving\" event in melanocytic transformation or instead a \"passenger\" event associated with melanoma progression. N(IC)-infected melanocytes displayed increased proliferative capacity and biological features more reminiscent of melanoma, such as dysregulated cell adhesion and migration. Gene expression analyses supported these observations and aided in the identification of MCAM, an adhesion molecule associated with acquisition of the malignant phenotype, as a direct target of Notch transactivation. N(IC)-positive melanocytes grew at clonal density, proliferated in limiting media conditions, and also exhibited anchorage-independent growth, suggesting that Notch alone is a transforming oncogene in human melanocytes, a phenomenon not previously described for any melanoma oncogene.

Classification of rare non-truncating sequence variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is problematic because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Several studies have reported the biochemical analysis of BRCA2 variants, which disrupted the 5' and 3'splicing consensus elements (the GU-AG rule). However, little has been done to look into the consequences of variants located outside the 5' and 3' consensus splice sites. cDNA analysis demonstrates that the BRCA2*IVS4-12del5 splice site variant results in the deletion of exon 5, and the gene putatively produces a truncated BRCA2 protein of 164 amino acids instead of 3418 with the incorporation of 22 out of frame amino acids. The pattern of breast, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers in the paternal kindred is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance of a deleterious BRCA2 mutation. Analysis of a tumor specimen indicates loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Sequence alignment indicates the deleted region is well conserved across different species. These results support the conclusion that BRCA2 IVS4-12del5 is a deleterious mutation.

Previous studies with sarcoma tumor cells expressing transfected class II gene products with truncated cytoplasmic domains suggested that during the process of tumor rejection costimulatory molecules are induced on the tumor cells, contributing to the cells' ability to stimulate immunity. In the present study we directly demonstrate that tumor cells containing full-length class II heterodimers are induced to express B7-1 and B7-2 costimulatory molecules during the rejection process. In contrast, tumor cells expressing class II heterodimers truncated for their cytoplasmic tails are not induced to express B7-1 and/or B7-2. Blocking the interaction of the induced costimulatory molecules with their corresponding receptors on T cells prevents tumor rejection. These results support the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic domain of the MHC class II molecule is involved in induction of costimulatory molecule expression, perhaps via intracellular signalling pathways. Because class II, B7 transfected tumor cells are such effective immunogens against ascites and solid tumors, they have also been tested in metastatic disease.

ASXL proteins consist of ASXN, ASXH, ASXM1, ASXM2 and PHD domains. ASXL1 directly interacts with BAP1, KDM1A (LSD1), NCOA1 and nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), such as retinoic acid receptors, oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor. ASXL family members are epigenetic scaffolding proteins that assemble epigenetic regulators and transcription factors to specific genomic loci with histone modifications. ASXL1 is involved in transcriptional repression through an interaction with PRC2 and also contributes to transcriptional regulation through interactions with BAP1 and/or NHR complexes. Germ-line mutations of human ASXL1 and ASXL3 occur in Bohring-Opitz and related syndromes. Amplification and overexpression of ASXL1 occur in cervical cancer. Truncation mutations of ASXL1 occur in colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), malignant myeloid diseases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and liver, prostate and breast cancers; those of ASXL2 occur in prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer and those of ASXL3 are observed in melanoma. EPC1-ASXL2 gene fusion occurs in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. The prognosis of myeloid malignancies with misregulating truncation mutations of ASXL1 is poor.

The condition is characterized by an increased sensitivity of the skin to UV radiation, with early development of pigmentary changes and premalignant lesions in sun-exposed areas of the skin, signs of photoageing and a greatly increased incidence from a young age of skin tumours including melanoma. Approximately 20% of patients with XP show neurological abnormalities of varying severity due to primary neuronal degeneration. Genetic analysis by somatic cell hybridization has led to the identification in the NER-defective form of XP of seven complementation groups, designated XP-A to XP-G. These complementation groups correspond to different proteins involved in the NER process. XP-A classically includes some of the most severely affected patients.;We describe a 61-year-old Punjabi woman with XP. Remarkably she had only mild cutaneous abnormalities, minimal neurological features and unusual longevity, and developed a malignant spindle cell melanoma. There are few previous reports of spindle cell melanoma associated with XP. To gain insight into the aetiology of these unusual features, we sought to analyse the DNA repair properties of the patient and identify the complementation group and the causative mutation in the defective gene.;Unscheduled DNA synthesis and the inhibition of RNA synthesis were measured. The complementation group was assigned by fusing the cells of our patient with XP cells of known complementation groups and determining the ability to carry out unscheduled DNA repair. Molecular analysis of the cDNA was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing.;Levels of DNA repair were extremely low and complementation analysis assigned the defect to the XP-A group. Sequencing of the XPA gene revealed a novel homozygous mutation of A-->G at the eighth nucleotide of intron 4 causing aberrant splicing and a nonfunctional truncated XP-A protein. However, a small amount of normally spliced mRNA was detected at <5% the level in normal cells.;The small amount of normally spliced mRNA detected may be sufficient to explain the relatively mild clinical features in our patient.",

The 70 NF1 patients had previously been investigated in a population-based study.;The first part of this study involved a cancer registry study. The authors compared the number of tumors in the 70 NF1 patients reported to the Swedish Cancer Registry during the period 1978-1989 with the number of tumors expected in the general population by matching the incidence rates of the two populations specific to age, time of follow-up, and gender. The 95% confidence interval for the risk quotient between the risk to the patients and the risk to the general population was estimated. The second part of the study was a clinical pathologic follow-up study. All living patients were offered a clinical reexamination in 1990. All hospital records for all the NF1 patients were reviewed, and death certificates were also reviewed when available.;Malignant tumors were reported to the Cancer Registry four times as often in the NF1 patient group as in the general population (95% confidence interval, 2.1-7.6) during the follow-up period 1978-1989. Before 1978, 5 of 70 patients (7%) had 6 malignant tumors; these patients were not included in the Cancer Registry study. Using all available clinical data on the 70 NF1 patients from their birth up to 1990, the authors found that 17 of 70 patients (24%) had developed a total of 19 malignant tumors, namely, 5 sarcomas (in 7% of patients), 13 carcinomas (in 16%), and 1 malignant melanoma (in 1%). Four pheochromocytomas (in 6% of patients), 2 adenomas, and 1 C-cell hyperplasia were diagnosed. Five gastrointestinal stromal tumors (in 7% of patients) were also diagnosed.;Malignant tumors were reported to the Swedish Cancer Registry significantly more often in the NF1 patients than was expected in the general population matched for age, gender, and time of follow-up.

MAPK pathway activation requires the cytoskeletal scaffold protein filamin A. Here we examine the interactions of CaR with filamin A in HEK-293 and M2 or A7 melanoma cells to determine how interactions with filamin A facilitate signaling. Filamin A interacts with CaR through two predicted beta-strands from residues 962 to 981; interactions between filamin A and CaR are greatly enhanced by exposure to 5 mM Ca2+. Truncations or deletions (from 972 to 997 or 962 to 981) of the CaR carboxyl terminus eliminate high affinity interactions with filamin A, but CaR-mediated MAPK pathway activation still occurs. CaR-mediated ERK phosphorylation can be localized to a predicted alpha-helix proximal to the membrane, which has been shown to be important for G protein-mediated signaling (residues 868-879). In M2 cells (-filamin A), CaR expression levels are very low; cotransfection of CaR with filamin A increases total cellular CaR and increases plasma membrane localization of CaR, facilitating CaR signaling to the MAPK pathway; similar results were obtained in HEK-293 cells. Interaction with filamin A increases cellular CaR by preventing CaR degradation, thereby facilitating CaR signaling. In addition, filamin A facilitates signaling to the MAPK pathway even by CaR truncations or deletion mutants that cannot engage in high affinity interactions with filamin A, suggesting the targeting of critical signaling proteins to CaR.",

With respect to an equally important role for amino-truncated p73 splice forms (DeltaTAp73) and DeltaNp73 (summarized as DNp73) in the tumorigenic process, we designed locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmers against individual species that were complementary to DeltaEx2 and DeltaEx2/3 splice junctions and a region in exon 3B unique for DeltaN' and DeltaN.;Treatment of cancer cells with these ASOs resulted in a strong and specific reduction of tumorigenic p73 transcripts and proteins, importantly, without abolishing the wild-type p73 tumor suppressor form as observed with p73-shRNA. The specific antisense oligonucleotides rescued cells from apoptosis inhibition due to overexpression of their corresponding amino-truncated p73 isoform and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, ASO-116 against DeltaEx2/3 coupled to magnetic nanobead polyethyleneimine (MNB/PEI) carriers significantly inhibited malignant melanoma growth, which correlated with a shift in the balance between endogenous TAp73 and DeltaEx2/3 towards apoptotic full-length p73.;Our study demonstrates the successful development of LNA-ASOs that selectively differentiate between the closely related p73 oncoproteins, and provide new tools to further delineate their biological properties in different human malignancies and for therapeutic cancer targeting.",

The specificity for the pri-miRNAs and determination of the cleavage site are provided by its binding partner DGCR8, which is necessary for efficient processing. The crucial Drosha domains for pri-miRNA cleavage are the middle part, the two enzymatic RNase III domains (RIIID), and the dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) in the C-terminus. Here, we identify alternatively spliced transcripts in human melanoma and NT2 cell lines, encoding C-terminally truncated Drosha proteins lacking part of the RIIIDb and the entire dsRBD. Proteins generated from these alternative splice variants fail to bind to DGCR8 but still interact with Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS). In vitro as well as in vivo, the Drosha splice variants are deficient in pri-miRNA processing. However, the aberrant transcripts in melanoma cells do not consistently reduce mature miRNA levels compared with melanoma cell lines lacking those splice variants, possibly owing to their limited abundance. Our findings show that alternative processing-deficient Drosha splice variants exist in melanoma cells. In elevated amounts, these alternatively spliced transcripts could provide one potential mechanism accounting for the deregulation of miRNAs in cancer cells.

Defects in genetic recombination can often lead to phenotypic differences; therefore, it is possible that metastatic variant cell lines exhibit their particular phenotype as a result of an altered ability to catalyse homologous recombination. We have investigated recombination efficiency in B16 melanoma metastatic variants, using a plasmid, pDR, as a recombination substrate. The plasmid contains two truncated, nontandem but overlapping segments of the neomycin resistance gene (neo 1 and neo 2), separated by the functional gpt gene unit. Only a successful recombination of the two neo segments will generate a functionally intact neomycin gene. Extrachromosomal recombination here was a transient measure of the cells to recombine the neo fragments in an intra- or intermolecular manner. Extrachromosomal recombination frequencies were higher in the high metastasis variants (BL6, ML8) compared with the low metastatic F1 cells. On the other hand, the frequency of chromosomal recombination (after plasmid integration) was higher for the low metastasis (F1) cell line compared with the highly metastatic variants, BL6 and ML8. Since the recombination assay measures only successful recombination events, we have interpreted the observed higher incidence of chromosomal recombination in the low metastatic variant line as indicative of a more stable genome. Similarly, a higher inherent instability in the genome of the high metastasis variants would render these less efficient at producing and maintaining successful recombination events, and this was found to be true by Southern analysis. The results presented show that frequency of recombination may be adduced as evidence for implicating genomic instability in the generation of variant cell populations during metastatic spread. Such an interpretation is also compatible with the Nowell hypothesis for tumour progression.",

In our continued effort to design a proteolytically stable ligand with specific receptor binding, we have engineered peptides by cyclizing γ-MSH using a thioether bridge. A number of novel cyclic truncated γ-MSH analogues were designed and synthesized, in which a thioether bridge was incorporated between a cysteine side chain and an N-terminal bromoacyl group.

This novel peptide is the most selective antagonist for the hMC1R to date. Further pharmacological studies have shown that this peptide can specifically target melanoma cells. The nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of this peptide in a membrane-like environment revealed a new turn structure, specific to the hMC1R antagonist, at the C-terminus, where the side chain and backbone conformation of D-Trp(5) and Phe(9) of the peptide contribute to hMC1R selectivity. Cyclization strategies represent an approach for stabilizing bioactive peptides while keeping their full potencies and should boost applications of peptide-based drugs in human medicine.",

FHOD1 is a member of this family, interacts with Rac1 and induces transcription from the serum response element. In this study, we examined the effects of FHOD1 expression on cytoskeletal organization and function in mammalian cells. FHOD1 proteins were stably expressed in WM35 melanoma cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Cells expressing full-length FHOD1 demonstrated an elongated phenotype compared with vector-transfected cells and cells expressing a truncated FHOD1 (1-421) that lacks the conserved FH1 and FH2 domains. Full-length FHOD1 co-localized with filamentous actin at cell peripheries. Cells transiently expressing a C-terminal FHOD1 truncation mutant (DeltaC, residues 1-1010), which lacks an autoinhibitory protein-protein interaction domain, displayed prominent stress fibers. FHOD1 (1-421) did not induce stress fibers but localized to membrane ruffles in a manner similar to the full-length protein, indicating that the FH1 and FH2 domains are required for stress fiber appearance. FHOD1 DeltaC (1-1010)-dependent stress fibers were sensitive to dominant-negative RacN17 and the RhoA and ROCK inhibitors, C3 transferase and Y-27632. Stable overexpression of full-length FHOD1 enhanced the migration of WM35 and NIH-3T3 cells to type-I collagen and fibronectin, respectively. Cells expressing FHOD1 (1-421) migrated similar to control cells. Integrin expression and activation were not affected by FHOD1 expression. Moreover, FHOD1 overexpression did not alter integrin usage during adhesion or migration.

In the present study, we examined the structure-activity relationships of the NSA9 peptide in inhibiting the proliferation of endothelial cells lines e.g. BCE and HUVE (human umbilical vein endothelial). N- or C-terminal truncated derivatives and reverse sequence analogues of NSA9 were prepared and their anti-proliferative activities were assessed using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay. This cell proliferation assay demonstrated that both the N-terminal region and sequence orientation of NSA9 are important for inhibiting the proliferation of endothelial cells. In particular 2 C-terminal truncation derivatives of NSA9 [NSA7 (NSAVQLV) and NSA8 (NSAVQLVE)] inhibited cellular proliferation to a greater extent than did NSA9. The heptapeptide NSA7, was found to be more potent than NSA9 in inhibiting CAM angiogenesis, and tubular formation and migration of HUVE cells. In addition NSA9, NSA8 and NSA7 peptides exhibited considerable inhibitory effects on the proliferation of tumour cells such as B16F10 (murine melanoma), LLC and L929 (murine fibroblast). Also, cellular internalization studies demonstrated that NSA7 was internalized into both endothelial and tumour cells more easily than was NSA9. In conclusion, these results suggest that NSA7, residing within the full sequence of NSA9, contains the required sequence for anti-proliferative activity and cellular internalization.",

We have shown that GAP (the GTPase-activating protein) is a potent negative regulator of normal Ras in cells. Reduction or loss of the NF1 gene product neurofibromin, in association with genetic abnormalities of the NF1 locus, has been identified in schwannoma cell lines from patients with neurofibromatosis and in melanoma and neuroblastoma lines from patients without neurofibromatosis. Although loss of neurofibromin in the schwannoma lines was associated with a high proportion of normal Ras protein in the active GTP-bound state, Ras-GTP appeared to be appropriately regulated in the melanoma and neuroblastoma lines, which contain normal levels of GAP. Therefore the GTPase-activating activity of neurofibromin is not essential for negative regulation of Ras in some cell types and the putative tumour suppressor function of neurofibromin in such cell types is independent of its GTPase-activating activity. Mitogen activation of Ras in fibroblasts is mediated primarily by exchange factors, which probably interact with a region on the Ras protein distinct from the region required for interaction with GAP.

Herein we report for the first time that the functional activities of GLI2 are parted into different protein isoforms by alternative promoter usage, selection of alternative splicing, transcription initiation and termination sites. Functional studies using melanoma cells revealed that transcriptional regulation of GLI2 is TGFbeta-dependent and supports the predominant production of GLI2∆N and C-terminally truncated GLI2 (GLI2∆C) isoforms in cells with high migratory and invasive phenotype.

For incidence rates to be accurate, it is critical that diagnosed cases be reported in a timely manner. Registries typically allow a fixed amount of time (e.g. two years) for diagnosed cases to be reported before releasing the initial case counts for a particular diagnosis year. Inevitably, however, additional cases are reported after the initial counts are released; these extra cases are included in subsequent releases that become more complete over time, while incidence rates based on earlier releases will underestimate the true rates. Statistical methods have been developed to estimate the distribution of reporting delay (the amount of time until a diagnosed case is reported) and to correct incidence rates for underestimation due to reporting delay. Since the observed reporting delays must be less than the length of time the registry has been collecting data, most methods estimate a truncated delay distribution. These methods can be applied to a group of registries that began collecting data in the same diagnosis year. In this paper, we extend the methods to two groups of registries that began collecting data in two different diagnosis years (so that the delay distributions are truncated at different times). We apply the proposed method to data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, a consortium of U.S. cancer registries that includes nine registries with data collection beginning in 1981 and four registries with data collection beginning in 1992.

Truncation of CXCR2 by substitution of a stop codon for Ser-342 (342T) or Ser-331 (331T) results in total loss of melanoma growth stimulatory activity/growth-related protein (MGSA/GRO)-enhanced receptor phosphorylation, which cannot be explained based upon altered ligand binding affinity or receptor number. 3ASubE cells expressing 342T or CXCR2 with mutation of Ser-342, -346, -347, and -348 to alanine (4A) exhibit strong mobilization of Ca2+ in response to ligand (interleukin-8 or MGSA/GRO), with a recovery phase significantly slower than that of cells expressing wild type (WT) CXCR2. In contrast to the WT CXCR2, which is 93% desensitized by 20 nM ligand, the 331T, 342T, and 4A CXCR2 mutants do not undergo significant ligand-induced desensitization, and respond to a second ligand challenge by mobilizing Ca2+. The 3ASubE cells expressing CXCR2 with mutation of Ser-346, -347, and -348 to alanine, or with mutation of only one serine in this domain, continue to be phosphorylated in response to ligand and are 60-70% desensitized following the initial ligand challenge. WT CXCR2 phosphorylation and desensitization occur in <1 min, while receptor sequestration is a much later event (30-60 min). However, mutant receptors that are neither phosphorylated nor desensitized in response to ligand are <10% sequestered 60 min following ligand challenge.

We investigated TERT promoter and BRAF mutation frequency in respectively 94 and 86 consecutive MPNST cases from our institute.

In comparison with other neuroectodermal derived malignant neoplasms, TERT promoter mutations occur at relatively low frequency in MPNSTs.

In solid tumors, NO is generally acknowledged to mediate angiogenic responses to several growth factors. This contrasts with conflicting evidence that NO can acutely increase tumor perfusion through local vasodilation or diminish perfusion by preferential relaxation of peripheral vascular beds outside the tumor. Because thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) is an important physiological antagonist of NO in vascular cells, we examined whether, in addition to inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, TSP1 can acutely regulate tumor blood flow. We assessed this activity of TSP1 in the context of perfusion responses to NO as a vasodilator and epinephrine as a vasoconstrictor. Nitric oxide treatment of wild type and TSP1 null mice decreased perfusion of a syngeneic melanoma, whereas epinephrine transiently increased tumor perfusion. Acute vasoactive responses were also independent of the level of tumor-expressed TSP1 in a melanoma xenograft, but recovery of basal perfusion was modulated by TSP1 expression. In contrast, overexpression of truncated TSP1 lacking part of its CD47 binding domain lacked this modulating activity. These data indicate that TSP1 primarily regulates long-term vascular responses in tumors, in part, because the tumor vasculature has a limited capacity to acutely respond to vasoactive agents.",

While an unusually large repertoire of CD8(+) T cells specific for this antigen has been documented, the reasons for its generation have remained elusive. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Pinto et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2014. 44: 2811-2821] uncover one important mechanism by comparing the thymic expression of the Melan-A gene to that in the melanocyte lineage. This study shows that medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) dominantly express a truncated Melan-A transcript, the product of misinitiation of transcription. Consequently, the protein product in mTECs lacks the immunodominant epitope spanning residues 26-35, thus precluding central tolerance to this antigen. In contrast, melanocytes and melanoma tumor cells express almost exclusively the full-length Melan-A transcript, thus providing the target antigen for efficient recognition by HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) T cells. The frequency of these alternative gene transcription modes may be more common than previously appreciated and may represent an important factor modulating the efficiency of central tolerance induction in the thymus.",

To address the limitations of melanoma therapies, we included multiple tumor samples of patients relapsed from current treatments, with a diverse genetic background (with or without the common BRAF, NRAS or NF1 mutations) in these studies. Excitingly, the combination treatment reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis of the non-MICs; disrupted primary spheres, decreased the ALDH+ cells, and inhibited the self-renewability of the MICs in multiple melanoma cell lines and relapsed patient samples. Using a low-cell-number mouse xenograft model, we demonstrated that the combination significantly reduced the tumor initiating ability of MIC-enriched cultures from relapsed patient samples.

        "Doc_abstract":"Neuraminic acid is the core structure of most known sialic acids. In natural systems, the amino group at the 5 position of neuraminic acid residues is usually assumed to be acylated. Previously, synthetic de-N-acetyl-gangliosides (with free amino groups at the 5 position of neuraminic acids) have been shown to modulate cellular proliferation and tyrosine phosphokinase reactions. While indirect evidence has suggested that traces of these molecules exist naturally in certain tumor cells, further exploration has been hampered by the lack of a system showing consistent expression at an easily detectable level. Using synthetic compounds as antigens, we have developed highly specific monoclonal antibodies against de-N-acetyl-GM3 and de-N-acetyl-GD3 that require both the free amino group and the exocyclic side chain of sialic acids for recognition. Cultured human melanoma cells showed low but variably detectable levels of reactivity with these antibodies. The ability of various biologically active molecules to stimulate this reactivity was explored. Of many compounds tested, only the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein induced reactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Antibody reactivity with ganglioside extracts from genistein-treated cells was abolished by chemical re-N-acetylation and/or truncation of sialic acid side chains by mild periodate oxidation. High performance thin layer chromatography immuno-overlay analysis confirmed the presence of the novel compound de-N-acetyl-GD3 in these extracts. Several other tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested did not give the same increase in de-N-acetyl-ganglioside expression. However, the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole caused a similar accumulation of these molecules, particularly in non-adherent cells expected to be arrested at metaphase. Thus, genistein may induce de-N-acetyl-ganglioside expression by virtue of its known ability to arrest cells in the G2M phase, rather than as a general consequence of tyrosine kinase inhibition. These studies also provide a system in which to analyze the enzymatic basis of de-N-acetyl-ganglioside expression and their potential roles as growth regulating molecules.",

One is a single base insertion in the exon 2 of the tyrosinase gene that shifts the reading frame and introduces a premature termination codon (TGA) after the amino acid residue 298 (codon 316). The other is a G to A transition at residue 312, leading to a single amino acid substitution, arginine at position 59 (codon 77) to glutamine. The promoter activity of the patients' tyrosinase genes was evaluated in the cell-free transcription system prepared from pigmented melanoma cells, indicating that the patients' genes were accurately transcribed in vitro. It is therefore conceivable that the tyrosinase gene is expressed in their melanocytes. Furthermore, transient expression of the mutated genes indicates that the truncated tyrosinase or the tyrosinase containing glutamine 59 is unable to form melanin in melanocytes. We therefore propose that these mutations in the tyrosinase genes lead to a phenotype of tyrosinase-negative OCA.",

The gene has been found to be deleted, truncated, mutated, or silenced by promoter methylation in a wide range of tumor types. Where melanoma CDKN2A mutations have been characterized, C --> T and CC --> TT transitions were found, indicating a direct role for ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced pyrimidine dimers in the formation of some tumors. The South American opossum, Monodelphis domestica, has been shown by our group and others to be susceptible to the induction of melanoma on chronic exposure to UVR alone. The CDKN2A gene and its exon 1beta alternate transcript p19ARF were cloned and sequenced from M. domestica to investigate the role of these genes in the development of UVR-induced melanoma and non-melanoma tumors. Both genes were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cDNA from an opossum corneal-tumor cell-line library and degenerate primers based on human, mouse, and rat CDKN2A gene sequences. To verify these as normal sequences, both genes were then RT-PCR amplified from cultured normal opossum melanocyte mRNA. When comparing the tumor and melanocyte sequences, we found a UVR signature point mutation, a C --> T transition, within exon 2 in the corneal tumor cell line. The same mutation at this site in other tumors has been shown to alter the CDKN2A protein's ability to bind CDK4 kinase, which may lead to uncontrolled cell cycling. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of opossum CDKN2A showed identities relative to human, mouse, and rat between 57% and 63%, and when conserved amino acid substitutions are considered (similarity), the range is 63% to 67%.

Of those, PMEL17/GP100 has been widely studied as a melanoma-specific antigen as well as a protein required for the formation of fibrils in melanosomes. PMEL17 is synthesized, glycosylated, processed, and delivered to melanosomes, allowing them to mature from amorphous round vesicles to elongated fibrillar structures. In contrast to other melanosomal proteins such as TYR and TYRP1, the processing and sorting of PMEL17 is highly complex. Monoclonal antibody HMB45 is commonly used for melanoma detection, but has the added advantage that it specifically reacts with sialylated PMEL17 in the fibrillar matrix in melanosomes. In this study, we generated mutant forms of PMEL17 to clarify the subdomain of PMEL17 required for formation of the fibrillar matrix, a process critical to pigmentation. The internal proline/serine/threonine-rich repeat domain (called the RPT domain) of PMEL17 undergoes variable proteolytic cleavage. Deletion of the RPT domain abolished its recognition by HMB45 and its capacity to form fibrils. Truncation of the C-terminal domain did not significantly affect the processing or trafficking of PMEL17, but, in contrast, deletion of the N-terminal domain abrogated both. We conclude that the RPT domain is essential for its function in generating the fibrillar matrix of melanosomes and that the luminal domain is necessary for its correct processing and trafficking to those organelles.",

Interestingly, the GPR56-heparin interaction is modulated by collagen III but not TG2, even though both ligands are also heparin-binding proteins. Finally, we show that the interaction with heparin reduces GPR56 receptor shedding, and enhances cell adhesion and motility.

ROS can damage DNA, and the repair of damaged DNA is a well-known process involved in tumor initiation and promotion, but the role of DNA repair in tumor progression is not fully understood. In this regard the X-ray cross complementing 1 (XRCC1) protein is known to orchestrate the assembly of repair complexes at sites of DNA single strand breaks either directly or indirectly through repair of damaged bases, largely as the result of ROS-induced damage. XRCC1 polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with increased cancer. It was therefore of interest to investigate the effect of XRCC1 gene mutations on cancer progression. In an attempt to make XRCC1 point mutant mice, we generated a truncated protein (XRCC1tp) by the insertion of a neomycin cassette in intron12 of the XRCC1 gene. This unique finding allowed us to investigate cellular and tumor progression phenotypes in mice associated with expression and function of an altered XRCC1 protein on one allele. XRCC1tp cells showed increased toxicity to MMS, enhanced MMS-induced depletion of NADH suggesting increased PARP activity, and normal functional repair of MMS-induced DNA damage. Six months following treatment with the alkylating carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) at 10 mg/kg once a week for 6 weeks, XRCC1tp mice had a decrease in average colon tumor volume of 14±3 mm(3) compared to 34±4 mm(3) in WT littermates (p ≤ 0.03, N= 20/genotype). XRCC1tp mice had a 72 per cent decrease in B16 melanoma tumor burden compared to wt littermates. Average tumor volume in transgenic PyMT metastatic breast cancer mice expressing XRCC1tp was 359 cubic mm in PyMT mice expressing XRCC1tp compared to 730 cubic mm in PyMT mice expressing XRCC1wt (p ≤ 0.001, N= 20/genotype). These data suggest that the presence of an XRCC1 truncated protein alters XRCC1 function independent of DNA repair, and is associated with anti-tumor activity.",

These findings prompted us to investigate the performance of an anti-H3K27me3 monoclonal antibody clone C36B11 as an immunohistochemical marker for MPNSTs. We assessed the C36B11 reactivity pattern in a pathologically and genetically well-characterized cohort of 68 MPNSTs, spanning various clinical presentations, such as type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), radiotherapy, and sporadic MPNSTs. We found that 69% (n=47) of all MPNSTs demonstrated loss of H3K27me3 expression, with 42 (61%) showing complete loss and 5 (7%) showing partial loss, whereas 31% (n=21) retained H3K27me3 expression. Among the NF1-related high-grade MPNSTs, 60% demonstrated loss of expression. In contrast, the majority of both sporadic (95%) and radiotherapy-related (91%) MPNSTs showed loss of H3K27me3 expression.

Altered CCN3 expression is associated with numerous solid tumors including glioblastoma, melanoma, adrenocortical tumours, prostate cancer and bone malignancies including osteosarcoma. Mature CCN3 protein has five distinct modules and truncated protein variants with altered function are found in many cancers. Regulation by CCN3 is therefore cell type and isoform specific. CCN3 has emerged as a key player in stem cell regulation, hematopoiesis and a crucial component within the bone marrow microenvironment.",

TARP is expressed in the androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line but not in the androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cell line, indicating that TARP may play a role in prostate cancer progression. To elucidate the function of TARP, we generated a stable PC3 cell line that expresses TARP in a constitutive manner. Expression of TARP in PC3 cells resulted in a more rapid growth rate with a 5-h decrease in doubling time. cDNA microarray analysis of 6538 genes revealed that caveolin 1, caveolin 2, amphiregulin, and melanoma growth stimulatory activity alpha were significantly up-regulated, whereas IL-1beta was significantly down-regulated in PC3 cells expressing TARP. We also demonstrated that TARP expression is up-regulated by testosterone in LNCaP cells that express a functional androgen receptor. These results suggest that TARP has a role in regulating growth and gene expression in prostate cancer cells.",

However, although age-at-onset traits are often of interest, family-based quantitative genetic analysis of such data is still not commonly used. One reason is that we need multiple random components to capture the genetic and environmental contributions, so it becomes hard to use the existing frailty models for correlated survival data. In this paper we consider the alternative accelerated failure-time models with random effects. The method allows both left truncation and right censoring, and it can deal with an arbitrary family structure and multiple random components. For estimation we use the h-likelihood procedure, which avoids the integration of the random effects in the marginal likelihood approach. To deal with large cohort data, we propose a case-control scheme, where we ascertain all families with at least two events and a subsample of control families. A pseudo-h-likelihood approach is used to analyse the ascertained data. We study the performance of the method using simulated data, and provide an illustration with analysis of melanoma in the Swedish population.",

One of the most abundant tegument proteins of HSV-1 is the U(L)49 gene product, VP22, a 38-kDa protein of unknown function. To study its subcellular localization, a VP22-green fluorescent protein chimera was expressed in transfected human melanoma (A7) cells. In the absence of other HSV-1 proteins, VP22 localizes to acidic compartments of the cell that may include the trans-Golgi network (TGN), suggesting that this protein is membrane associated. Membrane pelleting and membrane flotation assays confirmed that VP22 partitions with the cellular membrane fraction. Through truncation mutagenesis, we determined that the membrane association of VP22 is a property attributed to amino acids 120 to 225 of this 301-amino-acid protein. The above results demonstrate that VP22 contains specific information required for targeting to membranes of acidic compartments of the cell which may be derived from the TGN, suggesting a potential role for VP22 during tegumentation and/or final envelopment.",

IFN-gamma also synergized with the TLR ligands peptidoglycan (TLR2), dsRNA (TLR3) or LPS (TLR4). Under these conditions, intact MCP-2/CCL8(1-76) produced by fibroblasts was found to be processed into MCP-2/CCL8(6-75), which lacked chemotactic activity for monocytic cells. Furthermore, the capacity of MCP-2/CCL8(6-75) to increase intracellular calcium levels through CCR1, CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5 was severely reduced. However, the truncated isoform still blocked these receptors for other ligands. MCP-2/CCL8(6-75) induced internalization of CCR2, inhibited MCP-1/CCL2 and MCP-2/CCL8 ERK signaling and antagonized the chemotactic activity of several CCR2 ligands (MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7). In contrast to MCP-3/CCL7, parvoviral delivery of MCP-2/CCL8 into B78/H1 melanoma failed to inhibit tumor growth, partially due to proteolytic cleavage into inactive MCP-2/CCL8 missing five NH(2)-terminal residues. However, in an alternative tumor model, using HeLa cells, MCP-2/CCL8 retarded tumor development.

The recognition event leads to intimate contact between the two cells and activation of the cytolytic effector. Activation and target cell lysis can also occur in the presence of antibodies to the TCR. This is accomplished by bridging the effector cell TCR to the target cell FcR by an anti-TCR monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Recent findings have placed the role of the FcR in this event in a questionable light. We confirm the importance of Fc gamma R by demonstrating that: (a) melanoma cells are killed by CTL clones in the presence of anti-TCR-CD3 antibodies only when the melanoma cells express the Fc gamma R on their surface; (b) native Ig, heat-aggregated Ig, or an Fc fragment from an antibody expressing the same isotype as the anti-TCR antibody can block the killing of high avidity Fc gamma RI-bearing cells mediated by anti-TCR antibody (F23.1); and (c) anti-Fc gamma R MoAb (2.4G2) and a truncated soluble Fc gamma RII molecule inhibit the killing of low-avidity Fc gamma RII-bearing cells mediated by anti-CD3 MoAb (145-2C11).

Two T cell lines were derived from a patient with Wilms tumor.

A T cell line was derived from a patient with sarcoma and expressed a disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR, whereas, a T cell line derived from a patient with melanoma expressed a non-disulfide-linked gamma chain of 62 kDa. Several T cell clones were developed from patients with metastatic melanoma or Wilms tumor and expressed either disulfide- or non-disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR. Northern analysis of RNA from certain of these clones revealed a full-length gamma chain transcript, whereas, the alpha or beta chain transcripts were either absent or truncated. These T cell clones exhibited nonspecific cytotoxicity.

GBP-5ta is C-terminally truncated by 97aa and has therefore lost its isoprenylation site. Although RT-PCR results indicated expression of GBP-5 members in selected normal tissues, western blotting using two newly generated antibodies revealed that expression of both proteins is restricted to peripheral blood monocytes with GBP-5ta at lower levels. In contrast, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) tumor tissues (seven of seven) were positive solely for GBP-5ta, and four of four CTCL cell lines expressed both proteins. Eight of nine melanoma cell lines expressed GBP-5a/b and four of nine additionally low levels of GBP-5ta.

In HCC cells, cytosolic CPE-ΔN was translocated to the nucleus and interacted with histone deacetylase 1/2 to upregulate expression of the gene encoding neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated gene 9 (Nedd9)--which has been shown to promote melanoma metastasis. Nedd9 upregulation resulted in enhanced in vitro proliferation and invasion. Quantification of mRNA encoding CPE-ΔN in HCC patient samples predicted intrahepatic metastasis with high sensitivity and specificity, independent of cancer stage. Similarly, high CPE-ΔN mRNA copy numbers in resected pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs), rare neuroendocrine tumors, accurately predicted future metastasis or recurrence.

In vivo studies in mice bearing human adenocarcinomas (CCL185), melanoma (M21), and fibrosarcoma (HT1080) revealed that i.v. administration of tTF-RGD induced thrombotic occlusion of tumor vessels resulting in tumor growth retardation or regression in all three types of solid tumors.

In this work, we analyzed the role of the C terminus domain of the IL-8 receptor on the signal transduction and receptor internalization mechanisms. The IL-8 receptor A was tagged with an epitope corresponding to the monoclonal antibody 1D4 to monitor the localization of the IL-8 receptor. We demonstrated IL-8-dependent receptor internalization by monitoring the density of surface 125I-labeled IL-8 binding sites and by immunofluorescence microscopy. Truncation of the last 27 amino acids of the IL-8 receptor A severely impaired the IL-8-induced internalization of the receptor. Of importance was the observation that binding of IL-8 to receptors A and B triggered a dramatically faster rate of internalization of receptor B than receptor A, suggesting that the heterologous C termini among receptor subtypes modulate the rate of internalization of IL-8 receptors. However, substitution of the C terminus of the receptor subtype A for the C terminus of receptor B reduced the internalization rate of receptor A. Furthermore, we found that the rate of internalization of IL-8 receptor B triggered by IL-8 was faster than the one induced by the IL-8-related peptide, melanoma growth stimulatory activity. Studies with human neutrophils pretreated with 100 nM IL-8 for 5 min revealed a positive and a negative calcium response mediated by receptors A and B, respectively. In contrast, neutrophils pretreated with melanoma growth stimulatory activity showed positive calcium responses to both receptors A and B.

        "Doc_abstract":"In many cases, the biologic responses of cells to extracellular signals and the specificity of the responses cannot be explained solely on the basis of the interactions of known signaling proteins. Recently, scaffolding and adaptor proteins have been identified that organize signaling proteins in cells and that contribute to the nature and specificity of signaling pathways. In an effort to identify proteins that might organize the signaling system(s) activated by the extracellular Ca(2+) receptor (CaR), we used a bait construct representing the intracellular C terminus of the human CaR and the yeast two hybrid system to screen a human kidney cDNA library. We identified a clone representing the C-terminal 1042 amino acids (aa) of the cytoskeletal protein filamin (ABP-280). Analysis of truncation and deletion constructs of the CaR C terminus and the filamin cDNA clone demonstrated that the CaR and filamin interact via regions containing aa 907-997 of the CaR C terminus and aa 1566-1875 of filamin. Interaction of the two proteins in mammalian HEK-293 cells was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of them using immunofluorescence microscopy. The functional importance of their interaction was documented by transiently expressing the CaR in M2 melanoma cells that lack filamin, or in A7 melanoma cells that stably express filamin, and demonstrating that the CaR activated ERK only in the presence of filamin. Co-expression of the CaR with a peptide derived from the region of the CaR C terminus that interacts with filamin reduced the ability of the CaR to activate p42ERK in a dose-dependent manner, but did not inhibit the ability of the ET(A) receptor to activate ERK. The fact that filamin interacts with the CaR and other cell signaling proteins including mitogen-activated protein kinases and small GTPases, indicates that it may act as a scaffolding protein to organize cell signaling systems involving the CaR.",

Several MAGE proteins interact with ubiquitin E3 ligases and modulate their activities. However, it remains unknown whether MAGE family proteins interact with SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) E3 ligases such as PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family, Nsmce2/Mms21 and Cbx4/Pc2. In the present study, we examined whether necdin interacts with these SUMO E3 ligases. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that necdin, MAGED1, MAGEF1 and MAGEL2 bound to PIAS1 but not to Nsmce2 or Cbx4. These SUMO E3 ligases bound to MAGEA1 but failed to interact with necdin-like 2/MAGEG1. Necdin bound to PIAS1 central domains that are highly conserved among PIAS family proteins and suppressed PIAS1-dependent sumoylation of the substrates STAT1 and PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein). Remarkably, necdin promoted degradation of PIAS1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In transfected HEK293A cells, amino- and carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants of PIAS1 bound to necdin but failed to undergo necdin-dependent ubiquitination. Both PIAS1 and necdin were associated with the nuclear matrix, where the PIAS1 terminal deletion mutants failed to localize, implying that the nuclear matrix is indispensable for necdin-dependent ubiquitination of PIAS1. Our data suggest that necdin suppresses PIAS1 both by inhibiting SUMO E3 ligase activity and by promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation. ",

BL6 cells are more invasive than F10 cells and differ genetically from F10 cells by an alteration of the gene encoding the B56gamma regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This alteration results in the transcription of mRNA encoding a truncated variant of the B56gamma1 isoform (Deltagamma1). When F10 cells were stained with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes three B56gamma isoforms, B56gamma1, B56gamma2, and B56gamma3, the immunofluorescent signals co-localized well with the cis-Golgi marker proteins. When BL6 cells were fractionated in a sucrose gradient, B56gamma1 and B56gamma2, but not B56gamma3, were present in the Golgi-enriched fraction. This fraction also contained the catalytic subunit of PP2A. FLAG-tagged Deltagamma1 preferentially localized to the trans-Golgi area rather than the cis-Golgi. This localization was the same as that of FLAG-tagged B56gamma1. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Deltagamma1 transported a mutant viral protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane much faster than wild-type cells. Their directional migration, as assessed by the advance of cells into a cell-free area, was also elevated. As Deltagamma1 reduces the activity of the B56gamma-containing PP2A holoenzymes, these results suggest that the normal holoenzymes suppress vesicle transport and that Deltagamma1 might increase the invasive ability of BL6 cells by activating Golgi function.",

By high resolution SDS-PAGE, all the proteins were shown to migrate with an Mr of 6,700 (alpha-FINAP), 3,600 (beta-FINAP), and 5,300 (gamma-FINAP). All purified cytokine preparations were found to be chemotactic for human neutrophils. In addition, all FINAP induced release of lysosomal enzymes in neutrophils. Deactivation of chemotaxin-elicitable enzyme release showed cross-desensitization of all FINAP with NAP-1/IL-8. Western blot analysis of alpha-FINAP by using mAb against neutrophil-activating protein (NAP)-1/IL-8 reveals immunologic cross-reactivity with NAP-1/IL-8. By amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis alpha-FINAP could be identified as the 77-residue extended form of NAP-1/IL-8 containing the 79-residue form as a minor contaminant. Whereas beta-FINAP has been found to be a truncation product of alpha-FINAP, gamma-FINAP shows identity with authentic melanoma growth stimulatory activity with respect to retention time upon reversed phase HPLC, high resolution SDS-PAGE, and biologic properties, as well as amino-terminal amino acid sequence.

KIF27 is one of the mammalian orthologs for Drosophila Cos2. KIF7 gene is the paralog of KIF27 gene; however, complete coding sequence (CDS) of KIF7 remains elusive. Here we characterized human KIF7 gene by using bioinformatics.

Three coiled-coil regions were located within the KIF727H domain. KIF7 and KIF27 were N-type Kinesins with the KIF727H domain. KIF7 mRNA was expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, melanotic melanoma and Jurkat T cells, while KIF27 mRNA was expressed in testis, pancreatic islet, germ cell tumors and Jurkat T cells.

Domain I was replaced by the scFv, thus conferring restricted specificity for CD7-positive cells. The bacterially expressed and purified toxin retained binding specificity for CD7-positive cells.

These responses include increased melanogenesis, enhanced DNA repair, and induction of TNF-alpha, and are accomplished, at least in part, through the induction and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor and transcription factor. Here it is reported that other, but not all, larger oligonucleotides induce the pigmentation response even more efficiently than pTpT. A 9 base oligonucleotide (p9mer) stimulated pigmentation in Cloudman S91 murine melanoma cells to 6-times the level of control cells while a 5 base oligonucleotide (p5mer#1) was inactive. In addition, the p9mer increased p21 mRNA levels and inhibited cell proliferation to a greater degree than did pTpT, consistent with the presumptive mechanism of action involving p53. Smaller, truncated versions of the p9mer also stimulated pigmentation, although to a lesser extent than did the p9mer. The ability of these oligonucleotides to stimulate pigmentation was highly dependent on the presence of a 5' phosphate group on the molecule, which was shown by confocal microscopy and fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to greatly facilitate the uptake of these oligonucleotides into the cells. Although the melanogenic activity of the oligonucleotides was directly related to increased length and 5' phosphorylation, nucleotide sequence is also critical because a p20mer was efficiently internalized yet was a poor inducer of pigmentation.",

LKB1 contains a conserved serine residue near the C terminus (Ser-431 in mouse LKB1) that is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK. Although some studies suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and is not rate-limiting for activation of AMPK, others have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-431 is necessary to allow LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate AMPK and other downstream kinases. Prompted by our discovery of an LKB1 splice variant (LKB1S) that lacks Ser-431, we have reinvestigated this question. In HeLa cells (which lack endogenous LKB1), co-expression with STRADalpha and MO25alpha of wild type LKB1, the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1, or LKB1(S) gave equal levels of activation of endogenous AMPK. Similarly, recombinant STRADalpha.MO25alpha complexes containing these LKB1 variants were equally effective at phosphorylating and activating AMPK, BRSK1, and BRSK2 in cell-free assays. Finally, all four LKB1 variants and a truncated LKB1 lacking the C-terminal region altogether were equally effective at causing cell cycle arrest when co-expressed with STRADalpha and MO25alpha in the G361 melanoma cell line.

        "Doc_abstract":"Genomic instability is a major hallmark of cancer. To maintain genomic integrity, cells are equipped with dedicated sensors to monitor DNA repair or to force damaged cells into death programs. The tumor suppressor p53 is central in this process. Here, we report that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upstream Stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) coordinates p53 function in making proper cell fate decisions. USF1 stabilizes the p53 protein and promotes a transient cell cycle arrest, in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, cell proliferation is maintained inappropriately in Usf1 KO mice and in USF1-deficient melanoma cells challenged by genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate that the loss of USF1 compromises p53 stability by enhancing p53-MDM2 complex formation and MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In USF1-deficient cells, the level of p53 can be restored by the re-expression of full-length USF1 protein similarly to what is observed using Nutlin-3, a specific inhibitor that prevents p53-MDM2 interaction. Consistent with a new function for USF1, a USF1 truncated protein lacking its DNA-binding and transactivation domains can also restore the induction and activity of p53. These findings establish that p53 function requires the ubiquitous stress sensor USF1 for appropriate cell fate decisions in response to DNA-damage. They underscore the new role of USF1 and give new clues of how p53 loss of function can occur in any cell type. Finally, these findings are of clinical relevance because they provide new therapeutic prospects in stabilizing and reactivating the p53 pathway.",

Dishevelled proteins are implicated in the WNT - beta-catenin pathway and the WNT-PCP pathway. DAAM1/KIAA0666 is a Dishevelled-binding protein transducing WNT signals to the PCP pathway. Here, we identified and characterized DAAM2 gene by using bioinformatics. Uncharacterized FLJ34430 and KIAA0381 cDNAs were homologous to DAAM1. FLJ34430 was recombined with URB (XM_087331) in the 3'-region, and KIAA0381 was truncated in the 5'-region. Nucleotide sequence of DAAM2 cDNA was determined in silico by adding nucleotide position 1-793 of FLJ34430 onto the 5'-end of KIAA0381. DAAM2 gene consists of 27 exons, and gives rise to four splicing variants due to alternative splicing of alternative promoter type as well as of cassette exon type. DAAM2 gene was linked to the MOCS1 gene on human chromosome 6p21.3 with an interval less than 1 kb. DAAM2 mRNA was expressed in fetal heart, adult hypothalamus, eye, spinal cord, lung, prostate, kidney, and also in glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, melanoma, mammary adenocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma. DAAM2 was a 1077-amino-acid protein with Formin-homology FH1 and FH2 domains, which showed 68.9% total-amino-acid identity with DAAM1. Among Formin-homology proteins, FDD (Formin-like, Diaphanous, Daam) domain was conserved in FMNL1/FMNL/KW-13, FMNL2/KIAA1902/FHOD2, DIAPH1, DIAPH2, DAAM1 and DAAM2, but not in Fmn1, Fmn2, FHOD1 and Grid2ip. Therefore, it was concluded that FMNL1, FMNL2, DIAPH1, DIAPH2, DAAM1 and DAAM2 proteins constitute the Formin-homology FDD subfamily.",

The main focus of Raf regulation studies has been on phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and scaffolding proteins; however, Raf also has its own auto-regulatory domain. Removal of the N-terminal regulatory domain, initially discovered in the viral Raf oncogene (v-Raf), results in a kinase domain with high basal activity independent of Ras activation. In this report, we show that activating phosphorylations are still required for activity of the truncated C-terminal kinase domain (called 22W). The interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain is disrupted by activated Ras. Mutations in the Ras binding domain, cysteine-rich domain, or S259A do not affect the inhibition of 22W by the N-terminal domain. When phosphomimetic residues are substituted at the activating sites (DDED) in 22W, this results in a higher basal activity that is no longer inhibited by expression of the N-terminal domain, although binding to the N-terminal domain still occurs. Although the interaction between 22W/DDED and the N-terminal domain may be in a different conformation, the interaction is still disrupted by activated Ras. These data demonstrate that N-terminal domain binding to the kinase domain inhibits the activity of the kinase domain. However, this inhibition is relieved when the C-terminal kinase domain is activated by phosphorylation.",

We performed array comparative genomic hybridization analysis on a number of NK cell lines and primary tumors to gain better understanding of the pathogenesis and tumor biology of these malignancies. We also obtained transcriptional profiles of genes residing in these regions and compared them with normal and activated NK cells. Only 30-50% of the genes residing in the gained or deleted regions showed corresponding increased or decreased expression. However, many of the upregulated genes in regions of gain are functionally important for the proliferation and growth of the neoplastic population. Genes downregulated in regions of loss included many transcription factors or repressors, tumor suppressors or negative regulators of the cell cycle. The minimal common region of deletion in 6q21 included three known genes (PRDM1, ATG5 and AIM1) showing generally low expression. Mutations resulting in truncated PRDM1 and changes in conserved amino-acid sequences of AIM1 were detected. Highly methylated CpG islands 5' of PRDM1 and AIM1 correlated with low expression of the transcripts. Reversal of methylation by Decitabine induced expression of PRDM1 and cell death. In conclusion, we have shown a general tumor-promoting effect of genetic alterations and have identified PRDM1 as the most likely target gene in del6q21.

Deletion of both gI and gE prevented virus replication. Complete deletion of gI or deletions of 60% of the N terminus or 40% of the C terminus of gI resulted in a small plaque phenotype as well as reduced yields of infectious virus. Melanoma cells infected with gI deletion mutants formed abnormal polykaryocytes with a disrupted organization of nuclei. In the absence of intact gI, gE became localized in patches on the cell membrane, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. A truncated N-terminal form of gI was transported to the cell surface, but its expression did not restore plaque morphology or infectivity. The fusogenic function of gH did not compensate for gI deletion or the associated disruption of the gE-gI complex. These experiments demonstrated that gI was dispensable for VZV replication in vitro, whereas gE appeared to be required. Although VZV gI was dispensable, its deletion or mutation resulted in a significant decrease in infectious virus yields, disrupted syncytium formation, and altered the conformation and distribution of gE in infected cells. Normal cell-to-cell spread and replication kinetics were restored when gI was expressed from a nonnative locus in the VZV genome.

Its effectiveness against brain tumors such as glioblastomas has not been studied. The meningitis-causing bacterium Neisseria meningitidis also harbors an azurin-like protein. Unlike all other known azurins, Neisserial azurin, termed Laz, is surface-exposed and has in its N-terminal region a 39 amino acid epitope called H.8. Upstream of this H.8 moiety is a lipobox that results in the truncation of the protein at the N-terminal cysteine residue with modification by a lipid group. No function of Laz is known. We demonstrate that while Paz is deficient in entering glioblastoma cells and exhibits low cytotoxicity, Laz is much more proficient in entering glioblastoma cells and shows a higher level of cytotoxicity. When the Neisserial H.8 moiety containing the lipobox is fused in frame with Paz either in its N-terminal (H.8-Paz) or in its C-terminal (Paz-H.8), both had high cytotoxicity for glioblastoma cells and a higher level of internalization. When expressed in E. coli, H.8-Paz was much more exposed on the surface than Paz-H.8. The replacement of the Laz N-terminal cysteine residue involved in acylation with an alanine residue abolished the surface display, but had no effect on cytotoxicity or entry in glioblastoma cells, suggesting a role of the H.8 moiety, but not its lipidation, in disrupting the entry barrier in brain tumor cells.",

BL6 cells differ from F10 cells by an alteration of the gene encoding the B56gamma regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which results in the expression of a truncated variant of the subunit (Deltagamma1). PP2A is involved in regulating the cell-cycle checkpoint and we found that the checkpoint in BL6 cells is aberrant when the Deltagamma1 protein is expressed. That is, although Deltagamma1 protein levels in cultured BL6 cells are low and these cells do not show an altered checkpoint on gamma-irradiation, irradiated footpad BL6 tumor cells show both a marked increase in Deltagamma1 levels and more extensive polyploidy and less apoptosis than F10 cells. These observations were reproduced with Deltagamma1 gene-transfected F10 cells (F10(Deltagamma1)). Deltagamma1 expression and an aberrant checkpoint are also associated with a higher metastatic ability because irradiated F10(Deltagamma1) tumors metastasized much more frequently than F10 tumors, which rarely metastasized whether irradiated or not. Nonirradiated F10(Deltagamma1) tumors, which do not express Deltagamma1 protein, had similarly low rates of metastasis. The greater metastatic ability of irradiated F10(Deltagamma1) tumors also correlated with the acquisition of many more genomic alterations. Thus, it seems that Deltagamma1 expression may damage the checkpoint, which may then allow the acquisition of genetic alterations that promote metastasis.

In contrast, it has been only insufficiently explored how the higher order structure of an antigenic protein influences immunogenicity of embedded epitopes in vivo. Potent CD8+ T cell responses specific for a single immunogenic epitope are induced upon electrovaccination with plasmid DNA encoding the full-length heavy chain of the human HLA-Cw3 molecule. Contrary to expectations, a minimal construct, which provoked a substantial release of IFN-gamma from specific CTLs in vitro, did not induce a significant response in vivo. Systematically altered variants of the Cw3 molecule were thus tested both in vivo and in vitro to determine which structural parts are responsible for this discrepancy. In complementation experiments the participation of trans-acting helper epitopes was ruled out. Successive C-terminal truncations, human/mouse domain swap variants, and subdomain modifications defined the alpha3 region of the HLA heavy chain and membrane anchoring as critical elements. Based on these data, refined minimal constructs were engineered that triggered very high in vivo responses. The most advanced variant consisted only of an adenoviral leader, antigenic epitope, alpha3 domain, and 16 aa of the transmembrane domain. When a tumor Ag epitope was incorporated into one of these high performer minimal constructs, protection against melanoma metastases was attained upon vaccination. Thus, structural elements of the Ag can dominantly influence immunogenicity in vivo. These elements can also markedly improve the immunogenicity of unrelated Ags and may form the basis of a new generation of DNA vaccines.",

The necdin gene NDN is maternally imprinted and expressed only from the paternal allele, the deficiency of which is implicated in the pathogenesis of the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. Necdin binds to its homologous MAGE protein MAGE-D1 (also known as NRAGE or Dlxin-1), which interacts with Msx (msh homeobox) and Dlx (distal-less homeobox) family homeodomain transcription factors. Members of the Dlx homeobox gene family are involved in the differentiation and specification of forebrain GABAergic neurons. Here we demonstrate that necdin associates with Dlx homeodomain proteins via MAGE-D1 to promote the differentiation of GABAergic neurons in mouse embryonic forebrain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that necdin was coexpressed with Dlx2, Dlx5, or MAGE-D1 in a subpopulation of embryonic forebrain cells. Necdin bound to Dlx2 and Dlx5 via MAGE-D1 and enhanced Dlx2-dependent activation of the Wnt1 (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) promoter. Necdin significantly increased the populations of cells expressing the GABAergic neuron markers calbindin D-28k and glutamic acid decarboxylase when overexpressed by electroporation in cultured forebrain slices. In this assay, Dlx5N, a truncated Dlx5 mutant that competes with Dlx2 to bind MAGE-D1, diminished the effect of necdin on GABAergic neuron differentiation. Furthermore, mutant mice lacking the paternal necdin allele showed a significant reduction in the differentiation of forebrain GABAergic neurons in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that paternally expressed necdin facilitates the differentiation and specification of GABAergic neurons in cooperation with Dlx homeodomain proteins.",

Since detergent traces and cell debris hamper subsequent peptide analysis, exceedingly large cell samples are often required. To avoid the use of detergents, truncated MHC-I heavy chains have recently been expressed by stable DNA transfection or retroviral transduction, resulting in the secretion of soluble MHC-I complexes to the growth medium. The electroporation of in vitro-transcribed mRNA achieves remarkable efficacy and uniformity of gene expression in numerous cell types, exhibiting exceedingly fast kinetics. We reasoned that mRNA transfection offers a simple, fast and widely applicable alternative to current gene delivery protocols for expressing secreted MHC-I products in cells of interest. To test this assumption we used mRNA to express soluble derivatives of HLA-A2 in the human AF10 B cell myeloma and 624mel melanoma and H-2K(d) in the mouse SP2/0 B cell myeloma. The level of MHC-I complexes secreted by these cells peaked within less than 24h post-transfection and they could be affinity-purified directly from the culture medium in considerably greater yields when compared to nonionic detergent lysates on a cell-to-cell basis. Mass-spectrometry analysis of eluted peptides revealed larger pools in the secreted material than in lysates with substantial overlap in composition.

Whereas common acquired naevi and melanoma often harbour BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or inactivation of NF1, Spitz tumours show HRAS mutations, inactivation of BAP1 (often combined with BRAF mutations), or genomic rearrangements involving the kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, BRAF, RET, and MET. In Spitz naevi, which lack significant histological atypia, all of these mitogenic driver aberrations trigger rapid cell proliferation, but after an initial growth phase, various tumour suppressive mechanisms stably block further growth. In some tumours, additional genomic aberrations may abrogate various tumour suppressive mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, telomere shortening, or DNA damage response. The melanocytes then start to grow in a less organised fashion and may spread to regional lymph nodes, and are termed atypical Spitz tumours. Upon acquisition of even more aberrations, which often activate additional oncogenic pathways or alter cell differentiation, the neoplastic cells become entirely malignant and may colonise and take over distant organs (spitzoid melanoma). The sequential acquisition of genomic aberrations suggests that Spitz tumours represent a continuous biological spectrum, rather than a dichotomy of benign versus malignant, and that tumours with ambiguous histological features (atypical Spitz tumours) might be best classified as low-grade melanocytic tumours. The number of genetic aberrations usually correlates with the degree of histological atypia and explains why existing ancillary genetic techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), are usually capable of accurately classifying histologically benign and malignant Spitz tumours, but are not very helpful in the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Nevertheless, we expect that progress in our understanding of tumour progression will refine the classification of spitzoid melanocytic tumours in the near future. By integrating clinical, pathological, and genetic criteria, distinct tumour subsets will be defined within the heterogeneous group of Spitz tumours, which will eventually lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

NO, in turn, is associated with cell death, suppression of tumor development, and inhibition of metastasis of murine melanoma cells. Moreover, the in vivo induction of iNOS is associated with regression of established hepatic metastases. Whether this regression required the activation of the iNOS gene in every tumor cell or whether NO-producing tumor cells can also kill bystander (neighboring) cells has been previously unknown.;The goal of this study was to determine whether cells producing NO and then undergoing autolysis can also kill bystander cells in vitro and in vivo.;Murine K-1735 C4.parental (C4.P) melanoma cells were transfected with the functional iNOS gene (transfectant denoted as C4.L8) or with a control truncated-nonfunctional iNOS gene (transfectant denoted as C4.S2). NO-mediated cytolysis and bystander cell killing were determined in vitro and in vivo.;Only the functional iNOS-transfected C4.L8 cells produced NO and underwent autolysis. C4.L8 cells also produced statistically significant lysis of iNOS-negative C4.P cells. This lysis was suppressed by the specific iNOS inhibitor N(G)-methyl-L-arginine. NO-producing C4.L8 cells and control C4.P or C4.S2 cells were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic C3H/HeN mice. Control C4.P and C4.S2 cells produced rapidly growing subcutaneous tumors, whereas C4.L8 cells did not. The mixture of C4.P and C4.S2 cells (1:5 ratio) produced rapidly growing subcutaneous tumors, whereas the mixture of C4.P and C4.L8.5 cells (1:5 ratio) produced slow-growing tumors. The subcutaneous growth of C4.P cells was not affected by C4.L8.5 cells injected subcutaneously at a distant site. Mixtures of C4.P cells labeled with [(125)I]iododeoxyuridine and C4.L8 cells (NO producing) or C4.S2 cells (control) were injected subcutaneously. The survival rate of the radiolabeled cells indicated that the NO-producing C4.L8.5 cells lysed the bystander C4.P cells.;The production of high-level endogenous NO causes autolysis in tumor cells and lysis of bystander cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions.;NO-mediated cell killing does not require transfection of genes into every cell in a neoplasm.",

Quantitative real-time PCR was also performed with the LTq primer set. Nested PCR using the LT3a primer set detected more cases of MCPyV infection in MCC. In total, 12 of 14 (85.7%) MCC cases were positive for MCPyV by PCR, which was consistent with published data. Some SCC specimens were also positive for MCPyV (37.5%) by PCR. PCR products from MCC and SCC cases showed premature truncation and frameshift mutation. Furthermore, one case of ES/PNET and one gastric carcinoma showed MCPyV DNA. However, MCPyV DNA and transcript were only detected in MCCs with quantitative real-time PCR analysis. In addition, 11 of 13 (84.6%) MCC cases and 6 of 23 (26.1%) SCC cases showed immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibodies against MCPyV large T-antigen.

This study aimed to identify secreted proteins regulated by the PI3K pathway in ovarian cancer cell lines. Surface-enhanced laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry with cation-exchange protein-chips was used to analyze secreted proteins from five ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3, PE01, OVCAR-3, OV167, and OV207). To activate the PI3K pathway, cells were treated with 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) with or without 10 micromol/L LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Proteins induced by EGF and inhibited by LY294002, in the m/z range 7,500 to 9,500, were purified chromatographically, identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and NH(2)-terminal sequencing, and confirmed by immunodepletion. Two immunologically related proteins, m/z approximately 8,385 and 8,922, were identified as truncated and intact forms, respectively, of interleukin 8, a chemokine previously shown to be elevated in serum of ovarian cancer patients. Another protein, m/z 7,866, was identified as CXC chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) or GRO-alpha, a chemokine associated with melanoma formation and some epithelial cancers. EGF-stimulated CXCL1 levels were variably decreased by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and p38 MAPK inhibition in the five cell lines, but only LY294002 fully reversed the EGF effect in all cell lines. Immunoreactive CXCL1 levels in 160 conditioned media were highly correlated with corresponding peak intensities at m/z 7,866 by mass spectrometry, indicating the quantitative nature of these analyses.

CAI, a carboxyamido-triazole with a halogenated benzophenone tail, is a novel inhibitor of receptor-operated calcium influx and arachidonic acid release which inhibits malignant proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The focus of this investigation was structural analysis of CAI and to determine if the inhibition of calcium influx and arachidonic acid release by CAI and its antiproliferative activity were mediated through the same chemical domains. Four families of molecular modifications of the CAI parent were synthesized: (I) modification or substitution of the triazole ring; (II) removal of the substituted benzophenone tail; (III) dehalogenation or partial truncation of the benzophenone moiety; and (IV) removal of the triazole and altered substitutions of the benzophenone tail. Compounds were tested for the inhibition of calcium influx and arachidonic acid release and inhibition of proliferation and colony formation in soft agar using the malignant CHO line transfected with the m5 muscarinic receptor and the A2058 human melanoma cell line. Only CAI and Group I compounds inhibited stimulated calcium influx, arachidonic acid release, and proliferation. Linear regression analysis of the relationship of the 50% inhibitory concentration values for all compounds in inhibition of calcium influx and arachidonate release was statistically significant (r2 = 0.993). Similarly, a linear relationship was demonstrated between inhibition of calcium influx and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (r2 = 0.971). Groups II-IV had minimal or no signal or growth inhibitory activity.

Earlier, we have reported the discovery of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) within the p53 mRNA that regulate the translation of the full length and its N-terminal-truncated isoform, ΔN-p53. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an IRES trans-acting factor that positively regulates the IRES activities of both p53 isoforms by relocating from nucleus to the cytoplasm during stress conditions. Here we have demonstrated the putative contact points of PTB on the p53 IRES RNA. Studies on mutations that occur naturally in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) in p53 mRNA were lacking. We have investigated a naturally occurring C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) first reported in human melanoma tumors. This SNP is at position 119 in the 5' UTR of p53 mRNA and we demonstrate that it has consequences on the translational control of p53. Introduction of this SNP has led to decrease in cap-independent translation from p53 5' UTR in bicistronic reporter assay. Further, the effects of this SNP on cap-independent translation have been studied in the context of p53 cDNA as well. Interestingly, the 5' UTR with this SNP has shown reduced binding to PTB that can be corroborated to its weaker IRES activity. Previously, it has been shown that G2-M checkpoint, DNA-damaging stress and oncogenic insult favor IRES-mediated translation. Under similar conditions, we demonstrate that this SNP interferes with the enhancement of the IRES activity of the 5' UTR. Taken together, the results demonstrate for the first time that SNP in the 5' UTR of the p53 mRNA might have a role in translational control of this critical tumor-suppressor gene.",

Phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses of this subtype appear to have contributed to the generation of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. Little is known about the host responses to H9N2 viruses in human airway respiratory epithelium, the primary portal for viral infection. Using an apically differentiated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) culture, we examined host immune responses to infection by an avian H9N2 virus, in comparison with a human H9N2 isolate. We found that IFN-β was the prominent antiviral component, whereas interferon gamma-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-5 and TNF-α may be critical in proinflammatory responses to H9N2 viruses. In contrast, proinflammatory IL-1β, IL-8, and even IL-6 may only play a minor role in pathogenicity. Apparently Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, TLR-7, and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) contributed to the innate immunity against the H9N2 viruses, and MDA-5 was important in the induction of IFN-β. We showed that the avian H9N2 virus induced apoptosis through the mitochondria/cytochrome c-mediated intrinsic pathway, in addition to the caspase 8-mediated extrinsic pathway, as evidenced by the cytosolic presence of active caspase 9 and cytochrome c, independent of truncated BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid) activation. Further, we demonstrated that FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP), an apoptotic dual regulator, and the p53-dependent Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bcl-x(s), appeared to be involved in the regulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively.

From the analysis of patients carrying deletions and translocations involving the distal short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.3) we have identified a region of approximately 110 kb in which the OA1 gene must lie. We have extensively searched for genes in this region using a variety of techniques which included exon amplification, cDNA selection and direct hybridization of cosmid inserts to cDNA libraries. Putative exons identified by exon amplification were used to screen a human retina cDNA library and several cDNA clones corresponding to an approximately 7.5 kb transcript were isolated and characterized. Transcripts of this newly identified gene were found to be abundant in retina and melanoma and could also be detected in brain, placenta, lung, kidney and pancreas. Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed that this new gene encodes a 1616 amino acid protein sharing significant similarities with the Apical Protein from Xenopus laevis (APX) which is implicated in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity. The gene, termed APXL (APX-Like), spans approximately 160 kb, contains 10 exons and covers over 70% of the 110 kb critical region for OA1. A truncated pseudogene sharing very high levels of homology with the rat eIF-5 gene, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, was found to lie in the middle of intron 1. APXL was found deleted in two patients with contiguous gene syndromes including OA1 and in one patient with isolated OA1. Mapping, expression and patient analysis data led us to consider the APXL gene a strong candidate for the OA1 gene. DNA from 57 unrelated patients with OA1 was, therefore, scanned for mutations in the coding region, using both SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. No functionally significant mutation was identified, suggesting that APXL is not directly involved in OA1. Further studies are needed to clarify the physiologic role of this highly conserved gene.",

The function of gD is to interact with a cognate receptor, and soluble forms of gD block HSV entry by tying up cell surface receptors. Both gB and the nonessential gC interact with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), promoting viral attachment. However, cells deficient in proteoglycan synthesis can still be infected by HSV. This suggests another function for gB. We found that a soluble truncated form of gB bound saturably to the surface of Vero, A431, HeLa, and BSC-1 cells, L-cells, and a mouse melanoma cell line expressing the gD receptor nectin-1. The HSPG analog heparin completely blocked attachment of the gC ectodomain to Vero cells. In contrast, heparin only partially blocked attachment of soluble gB, leaving 20% of the input gB still bound even at high concentrations of inhibitor. Moreover, heparin treatment removed soluble gC but not gB from the cell surface. These data suggest that a portion of gB binds to cells independently of HSPG. In addition, gB bound to two HSPG-deficient cell lines derived from L-cells. Gro2C cells are deficient in HSPG, and Sog9 cells are deficient in HSPG, as well as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). To identify particular gB epitopes responsible for HSPG-independent binding, we used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to gB to block gB binding. Only those gB MAbs that neutralized virus blocked binding of soluble gB to the cells. HSV entry into Gro2C and Sog9 cells was reduced but still detectable relative to the parental L-cells, as previously reported. Importantly, entry into Gro2C cells was blocked by purified forms of either the gD or gB ectodomain. On a molar basis, the extent of inhibition by gB was similar to that seen with gD. Together, these results suggest that soluble gB binds specifically to the surface of different cell types independently of HSPG and CSPG and that by doing so, the protein inhibits entry. The results provide evidence for the existence of a cellular entry receptor for gB.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Trends in overall age-standardized, truncated (35-64 years) and age-specific (40 to 49) cancer death certification rates in Switzerland from 1951 to 1984 were analysed. There was a substantial rise in lung cancer mortality in males, with an over 100% increase in overall rates. Thus, in the early 1980's, lung cancer alone accounted for 26% of all cancer deaths in Swiss males. However, male lung cancer rates tended to level off in subsequent cohorts starting from younger middle age in the late 1960's. In females, lung cancer mortality was approximately ten times lower than in males, but rates had been consistently rising since the late 1960's in all age groups. Declines were observed for several neoplasms of the digestive tract: besides stomach (overall decline 68% in males, 77% in females), trends were markedly downwards also for oesophageal cancer in males (-57%), and there was some moderate fall for intestinal sites in both sexes and gallbladder in females. Several trends for other common neoplasms were similar to those observed in other developed countries, such as the declines for (cervix) uteri, the general stability for breast cancer, or the increases in pancreatic cancer and (melanoma) of the skin. A peculiar feature of Swiss data, besides the marked decline in oesophageal cancer in males, was the consistent downward trend in thyroid cancer for both sexes. Thus, overall age-standardized total cancer mortality over the last three decades was moderately upwards in Swiss males, but consistently downwards in females. Male trends were more reassuring in middle age, chiefly in consequence of the flattening in lung cancer rises. Possible interpretations of these trends in terms of aetiological hypotheses (i.e., changes in alcohol drinking and improvements in diet for oesophageal cancer, or reduced prevalence of iodine deficiency for thyroid neoplasms) are discussed.;Trends in cancer mortality from 1951 to 1984 are analyzed by age, sex, and cancer site using official Swiss data.  A substantial rise in lung cancer mortality among males is noted, although a decline is seen among younger cohorts.  Mortality from lung cancer among females is 10 times lower than for males but shows signs of an increase. Declines in mortality from cancer of the digestive tract for both sexes were apparent.  Overall age-standardized cancer mortality was moderately up for males but consistently down for females.  Reasons for these trends are discussed.  Comparisons are then made with other developed countries.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The MICA gene encodes for major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related proteins (MIC), which belong to a recently identified new family of nonclassical major histocompatibility complex molecules. The general structure of the MICA molecule resembles that of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. MIC molecules are considered to be stress-induced antigens that are recognized by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells, which play an important role in the surveillance of transformed infected and damaged cells. Associations of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules with skin cancer have been described before. To evaluate the possible association of MICA gene polymorphism with the risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer we evaluated 153 cases with squamous cell carcinoma, 261 cases with basal cell carcinoma, 111 controls with malignant melanoma, and 247 controls without a history of skin cancer. Five distinct MICA alleles A4, A5, A6, A9, and A5.1 were studied. As the MICA 5.1 variant gene contains a four-nucleotide insertion that causes a stop codon in the trans membrane region, the resulting truncated MICA molecule does not reside on the cellular membrane. In the case of individuals who are homozygous for MICA 5.1 this results in cells that are naked for the MICA molecule. We therefore specifically addressed the possible association between MICA 5.1 homozygosity and skin cancer, as these individuals are expected to be at the highest risk for skin cancer if the MICA gene plays a role in skin carcinogenesis. Viral proteins may serve as antigens for recognition of skin cancer by the immune system. Human papillomavirus is the most likely candidate virus to be involved in the carcinogenesis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Hence, we also assessed the association between MICA polymorphism and squamous cell carcinoma in human-papillomavirus-positive and human-papillomavirus-negative individuals as identified by the presence of human papillomavirus DNA in hairs plucked from their eyebrows. Our analyses did not reveal any significant differences regarding the MICA allele frequencies between cases and controls. Also homozygotes and heterozygotes for the MICA 5.1 variant gene were not at an increased risk for skin cancer compared to individuals without this variant gene and infection with human papillomavirus did not materially influence these findings. The same group of cases and controls was large enough to show an association between melanocortin 1 receptor gene polymorphism and skin cancer and to reasonably exclude an association between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and skin cancer. Therefore, we conclude that an association between MICA gene polymorphism and nonmelanoma skin cancer is not likely.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla originating in the chromaffin cells derived from the neural crest. Ten % of these tumors are associated with the familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), and rarely, neurofibromatosis type 1, in which germ-line mutations have been identified in RET, VHL, and NF1, respectively. In both the sporadic and familial form of pheochromocytoma, allelic loss at 1p, 3p, 17p, and 22q has been reported, yet the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors is largely unknown. Allelic loss at chromosome 1p has also been reported in other endocrine tumors, such as medullary thyroid cancer and tumors of the parathyroid gland, as well as in tumors of neural crest origin including neuroblastoma and malignant melanoma. In this study, we performed fine structure mapping of deletions at chromosome 1p in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas to identify discrete regions likely housing tumor suppressor genes involved in the development of these tumors. Ten microsatellite markers spanning a region of approximately 70 cM (1pter to 1p34.3) were used to screen 20 pheochromocytomas from 19 unrelated patients for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). LOH was detected at five or more loci in 8 of 13 (61%) sporadic samples and at five or more loci in four of five (80%) tumor samples from patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. No LOH at 1p was detected in pheochromocytomas from two VHL patients. Analysis of the combined sporadic and familial tumor data suggested three possible regions of common somatic loss, designated as PC1 (D1S243 to D1S244), PC2 (D1S228 to D1S507), and PC3 (D1S507 toward the centromere). We propose that chromosome 1p may be the site of at least three putative tumor suppressor loci involved in the tumorigenesis of pheochromocytomas. At least one of these loci, PC2 spanning an interval of <3.8 cM, is likely to have a broader role in the development of endocrine malignancies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Individuals with inherited cancer syndromes are at significant risk of developing both benign and malignant tumours as a result of a germline mutation in a specific tumour suppressor gene. Tumours of familial origin are a rare event in the head and neck but despite this, they deserve a growing interest. Familial paragangliomas are most of the time limited to the paraganglionar system, but also may be part of different syndromic associations. Since early detection of paragangliomas reduces the incidence of morbidity and mortality, genotypic analysis in the search of SDHB, SDHC and SDHD mutations in families of affected patients plays a front-line diagnostic role, leading to more efficient patient management. Multiple endocrine neoplasias type 1 are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of at least two of the three main related endocrine tumours: parathyroid, enteropancreatic and anterior pituitary. These tumours arise from inactivating germline mutations in the MEN-1 gene. No clear correlation of MEN-1 genotype with genotype has emerged to date, and MEN-1 mutation testing in tumours is not used clinically because it have not implications for tumour staging. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is due to a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Hallmarks of MEN-2A (the commonest phenotypic variant) include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The most central clinical difference with MEN-1 is that the associated cancer can be prevented or cured by early thyroidectomy in mutation carriers. Individuals with neurofibomatosis type 1 present early in life with pigmentary abnormalities, skinfold freckling and iris hamartomas, as result of NF1 gene mutation. Neurofibromatosis 2 is caused by inactivating mutations of the NF2 gene, and is characterized by the development of nervous system tumours (mainly bilateral vestibular schwannomas), ocular abnormalities, and skin tumours. The molecular genetic basis of nasopharyngeal carcinomas remains unknown, but there is evidence for the linkage of these tumours to chromosome 3p. Finally, the high rate of p16 mutations in squamous cell carcinomas and the association of p16 with familial melanoma propose p16 as an ideal candidate gene predisposing to familial squamous cell carcinomas. The elucidation of the cellular processes affected by dysfunction in familial tumours of the head and neck may serve to identify potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.",

A second specific aim was to cross-sectionally assess hypocholesterolemia (defined by total serum cholesterol [TC] < 130 mg/dL) in 1,314 white and 165 black men aged 26 to 46 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I). The 141 black and 631 white firemen had 4,973 person-years of follow-up time (median, 7.1 yr/man). Of 772 men, 44 (5.7%) had entry LDL levels less than 75 mg/dL; they had a mean follow-up time of 7.3 yr/man. Of these 44 men, there were 12 (1.8% of the cohort) with entry LDLC less than 75 mg/dL, and at least 67% of their follow-up LDLC levels were less than 75. Their mean entry TC and LDLC levels were low (130 and 58 mg/dL), mean triglyceride (TG) was low (63 mg/dL), and mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) was high (60 mg/dL), LDLC remained at less than 75 mg/dL in 81% of their follow-up samples. Their mean entry and follow-up cholesterol and LDLC did not differ (P > .1, 130 v 133 mg/dL and 58 v 63 mg/dL). Compared with 32 men with entry LDLC less than 75 mg/dL but with less than 87% of follow-up LDLC less than 75 mg/dL, the 12 men with persistently low LDLC had lower mean Quetelet indices and diastolic blood pressure at entry (2.36 v 2.58, P = .056; 73 v 80 mm Hg, P = .03) and on follow-up study (2.45 v 2.69, P = .04; 72 v 79 mm Hg, P = .05). Of 12 men with persistently low LDLC, two had truncated apolipoprotein (apo) B (familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, two had the apo E genotype 2/3, and two had acquired hypobetalipoproteinemia that antedated mortality from melanoma by 9 years and from alcoholism by 2 years. Comparable to white and black firemen aged 26 to 46 years, 2.9% and 3.6% of whom had entry serum TC less than 130 mg/dL, of 1,314 white and 165 black men in the NHANES I study (aged 26 to 46), 1.8% and 3.6% had hypocholesterolemia (entry TC < 130 mg/dL). Daily mean calorie, fat, and protein intake (grams per day) did not differ (P > .05) in men with entry TC less than 130 mg/dL compared with those with TC 130 to 230 or greater than 230 mg/dL. Hypocholesterolemia in white and black men in NHANES I could not be attributed to hypocaloric intake or to protein, fat, or carbohydrate undernutrition. There appear to be racial differences in the prevalence of hypocholesterolemia. Blacks comprised 18% of the firemen's cohort but 42% of those with persistent hypobetalipoproteinemia; among NHANES I subjects, 3.6% of blacks were hypocholesterolemic versus 1.8% of whites. Unless persistent hypobetalipoproteinemia reflects an underlying disease, alcoholism, etc., it is often heritable, and may be associated with a reduced likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD) and with increased longevity.",
