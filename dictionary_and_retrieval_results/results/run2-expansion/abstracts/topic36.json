        "Doc_abstract":"Patients with CLL have an excess risk of developing second primary malignancies. The etiology of this excess risk is unclear, and has been thought to be related to smoking. HER-2/neu overexpression has evolved as a prognostic/predictive factor in some solid tumors. We reviewed our experience with non-smokers who had CLL and subsequently developed lung carcinoma, in an effort to better understand the clinical course of these patients, and to evaluate the role of HER-2/neu overexpression. We reviewed the records of all patients who had a diagnosis of both CLL and lung carcinoma between 1986 and 2000. HER-2/neu overexpression was estimated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the Hercep test (DAKO). An IHC score of 2+ or greater was considered positive. Overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis of lung carcinoma by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Fourteen non-smokers in whom a diagnosis of CLL was made at least 6 months prior to the diagnosis of lung carcinoma were identified. The median age for diagnosis of CLL in this group was 67 years while that for lung carcinoma was 70 years. The lung carcinomas included 10 non-small cell (NSCLC) and four small cell (SCLC) carcinomas. Nine specimens (six NSCLC and three SCLC) showed HER-2/neu overexpression. Interestingly, 90% of patients with advanced stage cancer (stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or extensive SCLC) overexpressed HER-2/neu. The presence of CLL did not alter outcome in patients with early stage lung cancer. However, after adjustment for age and performance status, patients with advanced stage NSCLC and CLL had a worse than expected outcome. HER-2/neu overexpression (independent of smoking) may be involved in the development/progression of lung cancer in patients with CLL, and has an associated worse outcome. It is appropriate to consider heightened surveillance of CLL patients for lung carcinoma.",

Conflicting data in many literatures were reported about the association between HER2 and poor prognosis in lung cancer.;We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies from 1966 to the 12th week of 2010. In absence of significant quality difference between positive and negative studies, combined hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in terms of overall survival.;Forty studies(6135 patients) were included in the analysis. The pooled data showed that HER2 overexpression was a marker of poor prognosis in lung cancer. HR was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.22-1.80) and 3.11 (95% CI: 2.26-4.28) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, respectively. In the NSCLC subgroup analysis of early stage and ethnicities using IHC and in SCLC subgroup of extensive stage using IHC, it also showed that HER2 overexpression determined by IHC was a marker of poor prognosis in NSCLC and SCLC. In other subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma tested by IHC, the combined HR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.61-1.25), indicating that HER2 overexpression was not a prognostic factor for squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, in the subgroup analysis of HER2 amplification status of NSCLC using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we also found that HER2 amplification determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization was not significantly related to prognosis.;Although bias could be inevitable, this meta-analysis suggests that HER2 overexpression is a poor prognostic factor in lung cancer, especially for SCLC, adenocarcinoma, and early-stage NSCLC.",

PIK3CA mutations are one of the most common gene changes present in human cancers. We analyzed the mutational status of exons 9 and 20 and gene copy number of PIK3CA using 86 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, 43 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, 3 extrapulmonary small cell cancer (ExPuSC) cell lines, and 691 resected NSCLC tumors and studied the relationship between PIK3CA alterations and mutational status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway genes (EGFR, KRAS, HER2, and BRAF). We also determined PIK3CA expression and activity and correlated the findings with effects on cell growth. We identified mutations in 4.7% of NSCLC cell lines and 1.6% of tumors of all major histologic types. Mutations in cell lines of small cell origin were limited to two ExPuSC cell lines. PIK3CA copy number gains were more frequent in squamous cell carcinoma (33.1%) than in adenocarcinoma (6.2%) or SCLC lines (4.7%). Mutational status of PIK3CA was not mutually exclusive to EGFR or KRAS. PIK3CA alterations were associated with increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and phosphorylated Akt expression.

In an effort to identify possible targets for treatment, we utilized comprehensive genomic profiling in small cell carcinoma of the breast. Under an IRB approved protocol, we identified patients with small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung profiled by Caris Life Sciences between 2007 and 2015. Tumors were assessed with up to 25 immunohistochemical stains, in situ hybridization of cMET, EGFR, HER2, PIK3CA, and TOP2A, and next generation sequencing as well as Sanger sequencing of 47 genes. 19 patients with small cell carcinoma of the breast were identified, median age was 58 years (range 37-79) and 42 % had metastatic disease at presentation; for comparison, 58 patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung were identified (66 [36-86], 65 % metastatic). By immunohistochemistry, 31 % of small cell carcinoma of the breast patients expressed ER, 13 % expressed PR, and 16 % expressed AR; small cell carcinoma of the lung patients expressed ER 0 %, PR 2 %, and AR 6 %. Small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung patients had similar patterns of other immunohistochemical expression (0 v 0 % PDL1, 50 v 42 % PD1, and 77 v 95 % TOP2A, respectively). All small carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung patients were negative for HER2 and cMET amplification by in situ hybridization. Next generation sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 75 % of patients both with small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung and PIK3CA mutations in 33 % of small cell carcinoma of the breast patients but no small cell carcinoma of the lung patients (Fisher's exact test p = 0.005, OR 0.02 [0.00-0.52]). No other mutations were found in small cell carcinoma of the breast patients and no other mutation occurred in over 10 % of small cell carcinoma of the lung patients except RB1 in 19 % (p = 0.31). Small cell carcinoma of the breast is an aggressive tumor with few therapeutic options. Molecular profiling suggests many similarities between small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung with the exception an increased incidence of PIK3CA mutations in small cell carcinoma of the breast, which may have therapeutic implications.

HER2 (also known as NEU, EGFR2, or ERBB2) is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of certain human cancers, and mutations have recently been reported in lung cancers. We sequenced the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 in 671 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 80 NSCLC cell lines, and 55 SCLCs and other neuroendocrine lung tumors as well as 85 other epithelial cancers (breast, bladder, prostate, and colorectal cancers) and compared the mutational status with clinicopathologic features and the presence of EGFR or KRAS mutations. HER2 mutations were present in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC and were absent in other types of cancers. Only one adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H1781) had a mutation. All HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions in exon 20 and target the identical corresponding region as did EGFR insertions. HER2 mutations were significantly more frequent in never smokers (3.2%, 8 of 248; P=0.02) and adenocarcinoma histology (2.8%, 11 of 394; P=0.003). In 394 adenocarcinoma cases, HER2 mutations preferentially targeted Oriental ethnicity (3.9%) compared with other ethnicities (0.7%), female gender (3.6%) compared with male gender (1.9%) and never smokers (4.1%) compared with smokers (1.4%). Mutations in EGFR, HER2, and KRAS genes were never present together in individual tumors and cell lines. The remarkable similarities of mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes involving tumor type and subtype, mutation type, gene location, and specific patient subpopulations targeted are unprecedented and suggest similar etiologic factors. EGFR, HER2, and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting different pathways to lung cancer in smokers and never smokers.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Regarding HER-2/neu expression (gene or protein level) in lung cancer, several studies with inconsistent results have been recently reported, partially due to variable techniques used and/or heterogeneous populations examined. The objective of this study was to examine HER-2/neu expression in a well-defined cohort of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and in nonneoplastic lung tissue utilizing a combination of high-density tissue microarray, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) under uniform test conditions. One hundred forty stage I-IIIA primary NSCLCs and 38 non-neoplastic lung samples were examined. IHC, using an FDA-approved Hercept monoclonal antibody kit, was performed and HER-2/neu gene alteration was assessed by FISH. The association of expression of HER-2/neu with clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Ninety-four percent of tumor samples (131/140) were fully interpretable after tissue processing. Twenty-five of them (19%) overexpressed (2+, 3+) HER-2/neu, while 106 (81%) had no or weak expression. All thirty-four interpretable non-neoplastic lung samples were negative for HER-2/neu alteration at protein and gene level. HER-2/neu protein overexpression correlated well with HER-2/neu gene amplification (r =.83, P < 0.001). HER-2/neu overexpression was significantly associated with histologic subtype: 19 adenocarcinomas (19/82, 23%) versus 4 squamous cell carcinomas (4/44, 9%) overexpressed Her-2/neu (P = 0.04). Statistical significance was observed between HER-2/neu expression and tumor differentiation, with strong positive (3+) expression observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.01). Patients with HER-2/neu abnormalities, particularly HER-2/neu gene amplification, exhibited a shorter survival (P = 0.043). The statistically significant difference (P < 0.005) between HER-2/neu alteration in tumor samples(25/131, 19%) and in the nonneoplastic tissue (0/34, 0%) implies that HER-2/neu may have a role in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC. The findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the HER-2/neu receptor may represent a useful molecular target in the treatment of NSCLC. The significant association of HER-2/neu expression and gene amplification with poorly differentiated carcinoma compared with well differentiated carcinoma suggests that HER-2/neu may be involved in NSCLC tumor evolution. Patients with HER-2/neu gene amplification and strong positive expression of HER-2/neu protein showed a strong tendency toward shorter survival.",

In contrast, 13 lung cancer cell lines expressed p185HER2, and eight of these 13 expressed p185HER2 at levels at least 2-fold higher than that found in normal bronchiole epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes. Genomic Southern analysis showed that amplification of the HER2 gene was present in only one of the eight cell lines that expressed p185HER2 at these higher levels. Increased levels of steady-state HER2 mRNA occurred in the remaining seven cell lines.

        "Doc_abstract":"We have previously demonstrated that solamargine (SM), the major steroidal glycoalkaloid extracted from Chinese herb Solanum plants, reveals down-regulation of HER2 and up-regulation of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) expressions, triggers the mitochondria-mediated cell apoptosis pathway, and sensitizes human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H441 and A549 adenocarcinoma cells to chemotherapy. The present study shows that SM enhances HER2 expression in NSCLC large cell carcinoma H661 and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) H69 cells and may increase the susceptibility of the cells to trastuzumab, the humanized anti-HER2 antibody. The combinational treatment of SM and trastuzumab synergistically augments and inhibits H661 and H69 cell proliferation. After treatment with SM, coexpression of HER2 and topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) H661 and H69 cells is more sensitive to the TOP2 inhibitor, epirubicin. The combinatory use of low concentrations of SM with the low-toxic epirubicin accelerated greater apoptotic cell death than each drug did alone in H661 and H69 cells. Relevant studies have shown that HER2 overexpressing cancer cells are more resistant than HER2 low-expressing cells to the chemotherapeutic agent and tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. These investigations have indicated that HER2 overexpression does not suffice to induce intrinsic and pleomorphic drug resistance. The data presented herein suggest that the expression of HER2 did not influence the SM-induced apoptosis of different types of lung cancer cells and that the SM up-regulation of HER2 and TOP2A expressions simultaneously augmented trastuzumab and epirubicin-induced deaths of lung cancer H661 and H69 cells.",

Tissue macro-arrays prepared from surgical resection specimens from 35 patients with typical carcinoid (TC), six with atypical carcinoid (AC), 13 with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and 15 with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. Hybridizations with locus-specific DNA probes demonstrated a high incidence of deletion for the tumour suppressor genes p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), and for the oncogene cyclin D1, comparable in all carcinoma types. Similarly, an increase of DNA copy number for the Her-2/neu and c-myc oncogenes was noted in all neoplasms. A more detailed quantitative analysis of the results, however, demonstrated increasing numbers of cells harbouring these genomic alterations, from low-grade TC to highly malignant SCLC, with the exception of cyclin D1 deletion. Mutations of the p53 and Rb genes, as assayed by immunohistochemical studies, were observed at high incidence in high-grade carcinomas, compared with a low incidence in the low-grade carcinomas. Conversely, in all carcinoma types, neither membrane-bound Her-2/neu nor nuclear cyclin D1 was detected. It is concluded that structural genomic alterations are frequent in neuroendocrine lung carcinomas and that their occurrence may be underestimated by immunohistochemical studies alone. The quantitative expansion of the Rb, p53, c-myc, and Her-2/neu alterations towards high-grade carcinomas suggests common pathogenetic mechanisms in the spectrum of these neoplasms.",

It has been reported that somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR or ERBB2 genes occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer. We searched for mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to determine the prevalence of these mutations in Korean lung cancer patients. In addition, we examined the relationship between the mutations and clinicopathologic features of lung cancers. Mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing in 115 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers. EGFR mutations were present in 20 patients (17.4%). The EGFR mutations were found only in adenocarcinomas (20 of 55 adenocarcinomas, 36.4%). The ERBB2 mutation was found in 1 adenocarcinoma of the 115 NSCLCs (0.9% overall; 1.8% of the 55 adenocarcinomas). KRAS mutations were found in 6 (5.2%) of the 115 NSCLCs (2 of 60 squamous cell carcinomas, or 3.3%, and 4 of 55 adenocarcinomas, or 7.3%). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.02) and in never-smokers (P = 0.004). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were not associated with pathologic stage in never-smokers, but were more frequent in pathologic stage II-IV than in stage I in ever-smokers (P = 0.01). Of the 55 adenocarcinomas, 25 (45.5%) had mutations of one or another of the three genes; EGFR mutations were never found in adenocarcinomas together with ERBB2 or KRAS mutations. These findings suggest that the EGFR mutation is frequent in Korean lung cancer patients, and that the ERBB2 mutation is rare. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EGFR mutations in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma among smokers.",

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of gefitinib against the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines NCI-H82, NCI-H209, NCI-H510, NCI-H526 and NCI-H660. SCLC has been reported to express a low to undetectable level of EGFR. We compared the effects of gefitinib between cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression. First, we evaluated expression levels of EGFR and HER2/neu by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation respectively; EGFR protein was detected in two of the five SCLC cell lines, whereas HER2/neu was not detected in any. Next, we analyzed expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and compared these results with EGFR (HER-1/ErbB1) and HER2/neu (ErbB2) expression levels, as EGFR conducts signals through Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway; gefitinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF addition in cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression. These data suggest that gefitinib is potentially effective against cancers with low EGFR expression such as SCLC.",

The morphological changes progress from hyperplasia, to metaplasia, to dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, to invasive cancer and finally to metastatic cancer. Multiple molecular changes have been documented in lung cancers, both small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell (NSCLC) types. The number of changes has been estimated to be in double digits. These changes include activation of dominant oncogenes myc family, (K-ras and neu genes), as well as loss of recessive growth regulatory genes or anti-oncogenes (p53, and RB as well as unidentified gene or genes on chromosome 3). However, cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies indicate that multiple other specific sites of actual or potential DNA loss may be present in lung cancers. Other changes may include development of drug resistance, and production of growth factors and their receptors. It is tempting to associate specific molecular changes with specific morphological changes, as has been attempted in the colon. However, because of the difficulties in serially sampling the respiratory tract, such studies have not been performed to date.

Here we demonstrate that inducible expression of the most common HER2 mutant (HER2(YVMA)) in mouse lung epithelium causes invasive adenosquamous carcinomas restricted to proximal and distal bronchioles. Continuous expression of HER2(YVMA) is essential for tumor maintenance, suggesting a key role for HER2 in lung adenosquamous tumorigenesis. Preclinical studies assessing the in vivo effect of erlotinib, trastuzumab, BIBW2992, and/or rapamycin on HER2(YVMA) transgenic mice or H1781 xenografts with documented tumor burden revealed that the combination of BIBW2992 and rapamycin is the most effective treatment paradigm causing significant tumor shrinkage. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors treated with BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination revealed decreased phosphorylation levels for proteins in both upstream and downstream arms of MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling axes, indicating inhibition of these pathways. Based on these findings, clinical testing of the BIBW2992/rapamycin combination in non-small cell lung cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 mutations is warranted.",

Its overexpression is observed in 25-30% of primary breast carcinomas and is associated with a poor clinical prognosis. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Labor approved the use of trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast carcinomas overexpressing HER-2 /neu. Results of clinical trials with Herceptin suggest that it may prolong the survival of patients with advanced metastatic breast carcinoma. Relatively little is known concerning the relationship between HER-2 /neu status and ovarian clear cell carcinoma. If HER-2 /neu overexpression status were demonstrable in ovarian clear cell carcinoma and a clinical correlation between overexpression and prognosis could be established, a rationale for clinical use of Herceptin for this tumor could be established. Our aim was to evaluate HER-2 /neu status in ovarian clear cell carcinomas. Fifteen ovarian clear cell carcinoma cases were immunostained for HER-2 /neu using HercepTest (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Overexpression of HER-2 /neu was detected in only one case. Unlike in breast carcinoma, HER-2 /neu overexpression appeared to be uncommon in ovarian clear cell carcinomas. Herceptin may thus target only a small proportion of ovarian clear cell carcinomas and be of limited clinical value for treatment of this carcinoma.",

The methylation frequencies (29.70-64.36%) of 7 genes (MYF6, SIX6, SOX1, RARB, BCL2, PHOX2A and FOLX2) in stage I NSCLC were significantly higher compared with those in non-cancerous lung disease controls (P<0.05). The co-methylation of SIX6 and SOX1, or the co-methyaltion of SIX6, RARB and SOX1 was associated with adenosquamous carcinoma (ADC), and the co-methylation of BCL2, RARB and SIX6 was associated with smoking. A panel of 4 genes (MYF6, SIX6, BCL2 and RARB) may offer a sensitivity of 93.07% and a specificity of 83.33% in the diagnosis of stage I NSCLC. Furthermore, we also detected the expression of 8 pathological markers (VEGF, HER-2, P53, P21, EGFR, CHGA, SYN and EMA) in cancer tissues of stage I NSCLC by immunohistochemistry, and found that high expression levels of p53 and CHGA were associated with the methylation of BCL2 (P=0.025) and PHOX2A (P=0.023), respectively. In this study, among the 7 genes which demonstrated hypermethylation in stage I NSCLC compared with non-cancerous lung diseases, 5 genes (MYF6, SIX6, PHOX2A, FOLX2 and SOX1) were found for the first time to be abonormally methylated in NSCLC.

It plays an important role in the pathogenesis of certain human cancers. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HER2 amplification or mutations have been reported. However, little is known about the benefit of HER2-targeted therapy for NSCLCs harboring HER2 alterations. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of afatinib, an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-HER2 dual inhibitor, in lung cancers harboring HER2 oncogene alterations, including novel HER2 mutations in the transmembrane domain, which we recently identified. Normal bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, ectopically overexpressing wild-type HER2 or mutants (A775insYVMA, G776VC, G776LC, P780insGSP, V659E, and G660D) showed constitutive autophosphorylation of HER2 and activation of downstream signaling. They were sensitive to afatinib, but insensitive to gefitinib. Furthermore, we examined the antitumor activity of afatinib and gefitinib in several NSCLC cell lines, and investigated the association between their genetic alterations and sensitivity to afatinib treatment. In HER2-altered NSCLC cells (H2170, Calu-3, and H1781), afatinib downregulated the phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR as well as their downstream signaling, and induced an antiproliferative effect through G1 arrest and apoptotic cell death. In contrast, HER2- or EGFR-non-dependent NSCLC cells were insensitive to afatinib. In addition, these effects were confirmed in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model of HER2-altered lung cancer cells. Our results suggest that afatinib is a therapeutic option as a HER2-targeted therapy for NSCLC harboring HER2 amplification or mutations. ",

To circumvent problems of cellular heterogeneity in whole tissue, relative gene expression of ERalpha, ERbeta, EGFR, and HER-2 (c-erb-B2) was examined in pure lung carcinoma (LC) cells and normal epithelia by LCM. Cell-specific RNA was isolated and purified for RT-qPCR and microarray. Comparison of NSCLC cells to normal epithelia indicated increased levels of mRNA expression of ERbeta, ERalpha, EGFR, and HER-2 by 31%, 38%, 54%, and 62%, respectively, in LCs. The majority of NSCLC exhibiting low ERalpha and high HER-2 expression were from smokers. Although there was no correlation between ERbeta or EGFR expression and smoking history, there appeared to be an inverse relationship between levels of ERbeta and EGFR mRNAs in normal and neoplastic lung. Additionally, microarray analyses of LCM cells revealed >2,000 genes significantly altered in LC compared with normal epithelia. Herein, differences in NSCLC gene expression and normal lung cells were noted between specimens from gender and smoking groups. Microarray data revealed ERa expression was associated with alterations in <20 genes while ERbeta expression revealed >500 associated genes, suggesting a more prominent role for ERbeta in lung. HER-2 mRNA levels appeared associated with >1,000 genes, while EGFR mRNA levels were associated with far fewer genes.

Preexisting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to HER-2/ neu has so far been mainly evaluated in terms of detection of CTL precursor (CTLp) frequencies to the immunogenic HLA-A2-binding nona-peptide 369-377 (HER-2(9(369))). In the present study, we examined patients with HER-2/ neu(+) breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers for preexisting CTL immunity to four recently described HER-2/ neu-derived and HLA-A2-restricted \"cytotoxic\" peptides and to a novel one spanning amino acids 777-785 also with HLA-A2-binding motif. We utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay, which allows a quantitative and functional assessment of T cells directed against specific peptides after only brief in vitro incubation. CTL reactivity was determined with an interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot assay detecting T cells at the single cell level secreting IFN-gamma. CTLp were defined as peptide-specific precursors per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Patients' PBMCs with increased CTLp were also tested against autologous tumor targets and peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) in cytotoxicity assays. We also studied patients with HER-2/ neu-negative ((-)) tumors and healthy individuals. Of the HER-2/neu(+) patients examined, 31% had increased CTLp to HER-2(9(952)), 19% to HER-2(9(665)), 16% to HER-2(9(689)), and 12.5% HER-2(9(435)), whereas only 2 of 32 patients (6%) responded to HER-2(9(777)). The CTLp recognizing HER-2(9(952)) were extremely high in two patients with breast cancer, one with lung cancer, and one with prostate cancer. None of the HER-2/neu(-) patients or healthy donors exhibited increased CTLp to any of these peptides. Besides IFN-gamma production, preexisting CTL immunity to all five HER-2/ neu peptides was also shown in cytotoxicity assays where patients' PBMCs with increased CTLp specifically lysed autologous tumor targets and autologous peptide-pulsed DCs. Our results demonstrate for the first time that (1) preexisting immunity to peptides HER-2(9(435)), HER-2(9(952)), HER-2(9(689)), HER-2(9(665)), and HER-2(9(777)) is present in patients with HER-2/ neu(+) tumors of distinct histology, (2) HER-2(9(777)) is a naturally processed peptide expressed on the surface of HER-2/ neu(+) tumors, as are the other four peptides, and (3) HER-2/ neu(+) prostate tumor cells can be recognized and lysed by autologous HER-2 peptide-specific CTL.

High levels of p185(neu) is correlated with intrinsic chemoresistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. We investigated the effects of tyrphostin AG825, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor preferentially inhibiting HER-2/neu kinase, on the chemosensitivities and on the drug-induced cell cycle changes of NSCLC cell lines that expressed different levels of p185(neu). Compared to the low-p185(neu) expressing cell lines, we found that the high-p185(neu) expressing cell lines were more resistant to doxorubicin, etoposide, and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) but more sensitive to AG825. AG825 was able to significantly enhance the chemosensitivities of the high-p185(neu) expressing cell lines, whereas it had little effect on the chemosensitivities of the low-p185(neu) expressing cells, with a few exceptions in which minor antagonistic effects were observed. Although high concentrations of AG825 could reduce the drug-induced G(2) arrest that was accompanied by the activation of phosphorylated p34(cdc2), we failed to find any remarkably differential effects of AG825 on drug-induced G(2), arrest and the accompanying phosphorylation status of p34(cdc2) of the high- and and the low-p185(neu) expressing cell lines. In summary, tyrphostin AG825 can enhance chemosensitivity in high- but not in low-p185(neu) expressing NSCLC cell lines. This differential effect cannot be explained by the alterations of drug-induced cell cycle changes by AG825. Our results provide a rationale to develop p185(neu)- specific tyrphostin and to test them in combination with anticancer agents in vivo and in clinical trials.",

Microscopically, the involved pleurae are infiltrated by numerous tumor foci, which suggests that the cancer cells are highly invasive. Overexpression of HER-2/neu has been related to proliferation, antiapoptosis, and the high invasiveness of various cancer cells. We therefore were interested in studying the role of HER-2/neu in MPE-associated adenocarcinoma cell lung cancer (ADCLC).;The expression of HER-2/neu in pleural effusion was measured by ELISA. The HER-2/neu protein expression on tumor cells was evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and gene amplification was assayed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;The mean value of HER-2/neu in pleural effusions of patients with ADCLC and other nonmalignant lung diseases was 9.9 and 2.7 ng/ml, respectively. The difference is statistically significant (P < 0.001). Compared with cytokeratin 19 fragment CYFRA 21-1, the performance of HER-2/neu as a tumor marker in pleural effusion diagnosis was better. Overexpression of HER-2/neu in tumor tissues was found in 70% (23 of 32) of patients with MPE-associated ADCLC, 30% (13 of 43) with stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 44% (14 of 32) with stage III NSCLC. The incidence of HER-2/neu overexpression in tumor tissues of patients with MPE-associated ADCLC was significantly higher than that of patients with stage I-III NSCLC without MPE. HER-2/neu gene amplification was uncommon (1.9%). The correlation between the IHC H-score in tumor samples and the pleural effusion level of HER-2/neu was significant (P < 0.01). A higher incidence of HER-2/neu expression beyond the cutoff point (5.5 ng/ml) in pleural effusions was also found in patients whose IHC H-scores were >50.;These findings indicate that HER-2/neu is important in the pathogenesis of MPE-associated ADCLC and is a potential tumor marker for a diagnosis of pleural effusion.",

As multimodality treatments are now able to ensure better local control and a lower rate of extracranial metastases, brain relapse has become a major concern in lung cancer. As survival is poor after development of brain metastases (BM) in spite of specific treatment, PCI has been introduced in the 1970's. PCI has been evaluated in randomized trials in both SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to reduce the incidence of BM and possibly increase survival. PCI reduces significantly the BM rate in both limited disease (LD) and extensive disease (ED) SCLC and in non-metastatic NSCLC. Considering SCLC, PCI significantly improves overall survival in LD (from 15 to 20% at 3 years) and ED (from 13 to 27% at 1 year) in patients who respond to first-line treatment; it should thus be part of the standard treatment in all responders in ED and in good responders in LD. No dose-effect relationship for PCI was demonstrated in LD SCLC patients so that the recommended dose is 25 Gy in 10 fractions. In NSCLC, even if the risk of brain dissemination is lower than in SCLC, it has become a challenging issue. Studies have identified subgroups at higher risk of brain failure. There are more local treatment possibilities for BM related to NSCLC, but most BM will eventually recur so that PCI should be reconsidered. Few randomized trials have been performed. Most of them could demonstrate a decreased incidence of BM in patients with PCI, but they were not able to show an effect on survival as they were underpowered. New trials are needed. Among long-term survivors, neuro-cognitive toxicity may be observed. Several approaches are being evaluated to reduce this possible toxicity. PCI has no place for other solid tumours at risk such as HER2+ breast cancer patients.",

Tissue RNA was prepared and the specific mRNA analyzed by the highly sensitive nuclease S1 protection assay. Oncogene mRNA in the tumors was quantified by comparison with the homogeneously weak signals in normal lung tissue preparations with densitometry. The presence of two- to four-fold excess RNA was defined as moderate and a greater than fourfold RNA amount as strong gene overexpression. In contrast to normal tissue the oncogene mRNA amount varied considerably among tumors, showing increases up to 64-fold in erbB2, 13-fold in Ki-ras, and 57-fold in c-myc. Moderate and strong (in brackets) mRNA overexpression occurred with 33% (33%) in erbB2, 36% (18%) in Ki-ras, and 18% (23%) in c-myc. Simultaneous overexpression of two genes was observed with 41% and increased mRNA of all genes tested with 20% of the NSCLC samples. Augmented oncogene mRNA was observed most frequently in large-cell carcinoma. The c-myc overexpression was significantly more prevalent in large-cell cancer than in adenocarcinoma.

For the last several decades, the standard treatment for SCLC has been deadlocked, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. HER2 is a member of the HER family and has been reported to be overexpressed in 30% of SCLC cases with poor prognosis. However, the clinical relevance of HER2-targeted therapy for SCLC remains unclear. Here, we first identify that cytotoxic drugs induce significant HER2 overexpression through microRNA-125a (miR-125a) and miR-125b downregulation, which in turn act as a novel therapeutic target for trastuzumab-mediated cellular cytotoxicity in SCLC. In this study, we showed that treatment of the HER2-positive SCLC cells, SBC-3 and SBC-5, with cytotoxic drugs induced a significant upregulation of HER2. Cisplatin (CDDP) treatment of SCLC cells resulted in a significant downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b. We confirmed that miR-125a and miR-125b bound to the 3'-untranslated regions of HER2 mRNA, and that downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b resulted in upregulation of HER2 in SCLC cells, suggesting a relationship between cytotoxic drug exposure and miR-125/HER2 dysregulation. Furthermore, using a calcein assay, we demonstrated a significantly enhanced cytotoxic effect of CDDP and trastuzumab that was mediated via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Finally, we clearly demonstrated the enhanced antitumor effect of these agents in an orthotopic lung cancer model in vivo. Our results offer a novel therapeutic strategy for HER2-positive SCLCs by using trastuzumab combined with cytotoxic drugs.",

Comparative transcriptomic and in vivo cistromic analyses determine that loss of PTEN and SMAD4 results in ELF3 and ErbB2 pathway activation due to decreased expression of ERRFI1, a negative regulator of ERBB2 in mouse and human cells. The combinatorial inhibition of ErbB2 and Akt signaling attenuate tumor progression and cell invasion, respectively. Expression profile analysis of human lung tumors substantiated the importance of the ErbB2/Akt/ELF3 signaling pathway as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic drug target for treating lung cancer.",

We also compared the HER2 mutational status with clinicopathologic features and the presence of EGFR and BRAF mutations.;HER2 mutation was present in one male, non-smoking patient with low differentiated adenocarcinoma (0.67% of all patients and 1.5% of patients with adenocarcinoma). The mutations of EGFR and BRAF genes were not found in HER2-mutated patient.;The literature data suggests that patients with HER2 mutations may be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of both EGFR and HER2 receptors (e.g. afatinib).

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

However, a review of the studies measuring HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein expression in SCLC reveals discordant results. The aim of the present study was to re-examine HER-2/neu expression in SCLC in relation to gene copy number using the new, highly sensitive, immunofluorescence automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) technology.;Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to measure HER-2/neu gene copy number and amplification status and AQUA was used to measure protein expression in a series of 23 SCLC tumours on a tissue microarray. None of the 17 SCLC specimens assessable by FISH exhibited HER-2/neu gene amplification as defined by a HER-2/neu/chromosome 17 ratio = or > 2. Twelve of 17 (70.1%) SCLC samples were polysomic for chromosome 17 with corresponding increases in HER-2/neu gene copy numbers. Intermediate levels of protein expression corresponding to AQUA scores in the range of 4-24 were detected in all 23 specimens. High protein expression levels corresponding to AQUA scores up to 83, observed previously in association with gene amplification and poor prognosis in breast cancer cases, were not detected in the present study. No statistically significant association was observed between absolute chromosome 17 or HER-2/neu gene copy numbers and protein expression levels in tumour cells (P > 0.45).;The lack of gene amplification and robust HER-2/neu protein expression in SCLC tumour cells in this series does not suggest a prominent role for the HER-2/neu gene in SCLC tumour progression and does not support the general applicability of targeted immunotherapy with trastuzumab to this malignancy.",

Forty, thirty-six, and twenty-three patients with lung, colon and breast cancer were included in this study, respectively. Serum levels of HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP were measured. Her-2 neu levels were significantly higher in the breast cancer groups than colorectal and lung cancer and controls groups (P < 0.01). There is no significant difference when compared with others groups (P > 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the HER-2/neu and CA15-3 values in breast cancer groups. We found 0.75(0.59-0.90) for Her-2/neu from the area under the curve (AUC). P-value for breast cancer is 0.003, and we discovered that 9 ng/ml was the best inersection point. In this situation, we calculated that sensitivity was 65.2%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100%, negative predictive value 75.8%, and accuracy was 83.4%. These findings indicate that serum HER2/neu levels are clinically valuable in monitoring metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Prognosis of breast cancer provides an additional value over the commonly used CA15-3 test. Measurements of levels of serum HER-2/neu provide prognostic and predictive information to the clinician and can especially be used for monitoring metastatic breast cancer patients.

Clinical phase II and III trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the humanized anti-HER2 MAb, trastuzumab (Herceptin), both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients. However, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression/amplification in various tumor types raises the possibility of using anti-HER2 MAbs to antagonize the abnormal function of overexpressed HER2 receptors in HER2-positive tumors other than breast. Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that anti-HER2 MAbs suppress the proliferation of ovarian, gastric and NSCLC cell lines that overexpress the HER2 receptor.

        "Doc_abstract":"To date, lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality with short overall survival despite adequate therapy. New immunotherapeutic strategies using peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can induce a specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response leading to a targeted tumor cell death. In the present study, we addressed whether there are further significant immunogenic candidate targets that may induce strong immune reactions with a high frequency in lung cancer patients eligible for cellular immunotherapeutic approaches, such as in a polyvalent vaccination approach. In this study, we investigated specific CTL responses of 14 HLA-A*0201-positive patients (of 33 screened patients) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n=12) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC; n=2) against several known and novel TAA-derived peptides from lung cancer and/or other tumor entities, by measuring granzyme B (GrB) and/or interferon γ (IFNγ) secretion using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) analysis. Specific T cell responses could be detected for hTERT (4/13), two MAGE-A3-derived peptides (4/13 and 3/13, respectively), RHAMM (4/14), PRAME (8/14), G250 (7/12), survivin (3/13), HER2 (5/10) and WT1 (2/14), but also novel epitopes derived from Aurora kinase A (4/13) and B (5/13). Additionally, simultaneous CTL responses against the different peptides were examined and specific T cell responses against at least one of these TAAs could be detected in 13/14 (93%) patients. It could be shown that all patients with immune reactions against RHAMM and hTERT showed also immune responses against PRAME. Furthermore, patients with CTL responses against the Aurora kinase A peptide (Aura A1) also demonstrated a response against the Aurora kinase B peptide (Aura B1). Taken together, we showed that these TAA-derived peptides induce frequent specific T cell responses in patients with metastatic lung cancer and are, therefore, novel candidates for targeted immunotherapies and polyvalent approaches.",

Several molecular alterations involving different genes (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, and HER2) seem to have a remarkable predilection for adenocarcinoma and specific inhibitors of EGFR and ALK are now available for patients with adenocarcinoma harboring the relevant gene alterations. The efficacy of histology-based and molecular-targeted therapies had a deep impact in (1) re-defining classification of lung cancer (particularly adenocarcinomas) and (2) routine clinical practice of pathologists involved in optimization of handling of tissue samples in order to guarantee NSCLC subtyping with the help of immunohistochemistry and adequately preserve tumor cells for molecular analysis.

Concentration of p185(neu) protein was determined by using enzyme immunoassay and evaluated by using several variables.

Recent advances in the detection of genetic alterations in patient samples along with physiologically relevant animal models has yielded a new understanding of the molecular etiology of lung cancer. This has facilitated the development of potent and specific targeted therapies, based on the genetic and biochemical alterations present in the tumor, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is now clear that heterogeneous cell signaling pathways are disrupted to promote NSCLC, including mutations in critical growth regulatory proteins (K-Ras, EGFR, B-RAF, MEK-1, HER2, MET, EML-4-ALK, KIF5B-RET, and NKX2.1) and inactivation of growth inhibitory pathways (TP53, PTEN, p16, and LKB-1). How these pathways differ between smokers and non-smokers is also important for clinical treatment strategies and development of targeted therapies.

By use of monoclonal antibody CK2 to the epithelial cytokeratin component number 18 (CK18), individual disseminated carcinoma cells present in bone marrow of cancer patients can now be identified (G. Schlimok, I. Funke, B. Holzmann, G. Göttlinger, G. Schmidt, H. Häuser, S. Swierkot, H. H. Warnecke, B. Schneider, H. Koprowski, and G. Riethmüller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84: 8672-8676, 1987; F. Lindemann, G. Schlimok, P. Dirschedl, J. Witte, and G. Riethmüller, Lancet, 340: 685-689, 1992). In the present study, we applied this approach to patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer. CK18 was expressed on 84 of 88 (95.5%) primary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Irrespective of primary tumor histology, single aspirates of iliac bone marrow from 18 of 82 (21.9%) lung cancer patients exhibited between 1 and 531 CK18+ cells/4 x 10(5) nucleated marrow cells. The specificity of our assay is underlined by the small rate of \"false-positive\" cells being observed in only 2 of 117 (1.7%) marrow samples from control patients with no evidence for an epithelial malignancy at the time of aspiration. Comparison with established risk factors demonstrated positive correlations (P < 0.05) between the size and histological grade of the primary carcinoma and cytokeratin positivity in iliac bone marrow. In contrast, the association with the metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes was only weak (P = 0.09). Following a median observation period of 13 months, patients who displayed cytokeratin-positive cells in iliac bone marrow at the time of primary surgery relapsed more frequently as compared to patients with a negative marrow finding (66.7 versus 36.6%; P < 0.05). This difference was even more pronounced by comparing the rates of manifest skeleton metastasis observed in both groups (26.7 versus 2.4%; P < 0.005). Finally, colabeling of CK18+ cells in marrow with monoclonal antibodies to proliferation-associated markers, such as the nucleolar antigen p120 or the tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2, exemplified the oncogenic capacity of CK18+ micrometastatic cells. In conclusion, CK18+ cells present in the bone marrow of patients with apparently operable non-small cell lung cancer exhibit the potential to form solid metastases. Therefore, the approach presented here may be used to determine the risk of early relapse in operable non-small cell lung cancer with potential consequences for adjuvant therapy.",

Human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro are being used to investigate the functional role of these specific oncogenes and growth regulatory genes in carcinogenesis and tumour progression. When transferred into normal human bronchial epithelial cells by the highly efficient protoplast fusion method, the v-Ha-ras oncogene initiates a cascade of events leading to decreased responsiveness of these cells to inducers of squamous differentiation, aneuploidy and, less frequently, 'immortality' and tumorigenicity with metastasis in athymic nude mice. Transfection of the SV40 T antigen gene results in nontumorigenic cell lines that have a nearly normal pathway of terminal squamous differentiation and can be transformed into malignant cells by transfected Ha-ras, N-ras or Ki-ras. The combination of transfected c-myc and c-raf-1 also transforms human bronchial epithelial cells into neoplastic cells that exhibit some phenotypic traits found in small-cell carcinomas. These and other results indicate that proto-oncogenes dysregulate the pathways of growth and differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells and play an important role in human carcinogenesis. Analyses of allelic deletion and somatic cell hybrids are being used to identify the chromosomal localization of tumour suppressor genes. We have examined 54 non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinomas with 13 polymorphic markers. Loss of heterozygosity was more frequent than among 23 squamous-cell carcinomas than among 23 adenocarcinomas or eight large-cell carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 17p was found in 89% of cases of squamous-cell carcinoma and 18% of adenocarcinomas. Analysis of chromosome 11 for allelic deletions revealed two commonly deleted regions (11p13 and 11p15.5). Somatic cell hybrids between normal human bronchial epithelial cells and Hut292DM, a lung carcinoma cell line, had a finite lifespan in vitro and were nontumorigenic in athymic nude mice. Tumour suppressive effects of individual or combinations of specific human chromosomes on Hut292DM are being examined by formation of microcell-cell hybrids. Chromosome 11 has tumour suppressor activity in these hybrids. Both of these studies suggest that tumour suppressor genes play a dominant role in lung carcinogenesis and provide in-vitro model systems for isolating these genes by subtraction library and insertional mutagenesis techniques.",

Receptor activation via ligand binding leads to downstream signaling that influence cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Aberrant expression or activity of EGFR and HER2 have been strongly linked to the etiology of several human epithelial cancers including but not limited to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer. With this, intense efforts have been made to inhibit the activity of the EGFR and HER2 by designing antibodies against the ligand binding domains (cetuximab, panitumumab and trastuzumab) or small molecules against the tyrosine kinase domains (erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib). Both approaches have shown considerable clinical promise. However, increasing evidence suggests that the majority of patients do not respond to these therapies, and those who show initial response ultimately become refractory to treatment. While mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been extensively studied, resistance to monoclonal antibodies is less well understood, both in the laboratory and in the clinical setting. In this review, we discuss resistance to antibody-based therapies against the EGFR and HER2, similarities between these resistance profiles, and strategies to overcome resistance to HER family targeting monoclonal antibody therapy.",

For the detection of the oncoproteins the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase-complex method was used.

We tested the therapeutic activity of a proven prophylactic anti-HER-2/neu vaccine against successive stages of mammary carcinoma progression in HER-2/neu transgenic mice. The vaccine consisted of transgenic mammary carcinoma cells expressing HER-2/neu and two adjuvants: allogeneic class I histocompatibility antigens and interleukin (IL)-12. Vaccination of mice bearing lung micrometastases resulted in a 90% inhibition of metastasis development, whereas vaccination of mice with incipient local tumors was ineffective. The antimetastatic response was hampered by immune tolerance, as the protection of transgenic mice was lower than that of wild-type congenics not tolerant to HER-2/neu. A significant gain in immunotherapeutic activity in transgenic mice was obtained through the coadministration of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody targeting regulatory T cells, which resulted in a >99% inhibition of metastasis. The immune responses elicited in transgenic mice comprised the activation of lung granulocytes and macrophages and of systemic adaptive responses based on helper T cells and their cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-4) and anti-HER-2/neu antibodies. Dissection of relevant antimetastatic mechanisms by means of knockout mice and of depleting antibodies revealed a major difference between tumor prevention, which was completely dependent on anti-HER-2/neu antibodies, and metastasis therapy, which was antibody independent. In conclusion, a vaccine successfully developed for cancer immunoprevention showed a strong therapeutic activity against lung metastases mediated by protective immune mechanisms distinct from those preventing the onset of primary mammary carcinoma.",

We have previously reported that the adenovirus type 5 early region 1A (E1A) gene product can suppress HER-2/neu-mediated transformation phenotypes through inhibition of HER-2/neu expression. To find an efficient way to treat HER-2/neu-overexpressing lung cancer with E1A, a replication-deficient adenovirus containing the E1A gene, Ad.E1A(+), was used to transduce E1A into HER-2/neu-overexpressing and low expressing human lung cancer cell lines. Tumour cell growth in vitro and colony formation in soft agarose were greatly inhibited by Ad.E1A(+) transduction in HER-2/neu-overexpressing lung cancer cell lines. In HER-2/neu low expressing cell lines, E1A could not inhibit cell growth in vitro but could reduce the colony formation ability in soft agarose, indicating different effects of E1A in these two types of cancer cells. To test the therapeutic efficacy of E1A to lung cancer by systemic delivery in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were established by intratracheal injection of lung cancer cells and treated by i.v. tail injections of Ad.E1A(+). As a result, Ad.E1A(+) suppressed HER-2/neu overexpression and inhibited intratracheal lung cancer growth. However, no significant tumor suppression effect of Ad.E1A(+) was observed in mice bearing HER-2/neu low expressing cell line when the same therapeutic procedure was followed. Thus, we conclude that systemic delivery of Ad.E1A(+) can efficiently achieve therapeutic effect in HER-2/neu-overexpressing lung cancer in vivo.",

EGFR and HER-2/neu activate numerous signaling pathways leading to cancer cell proliferation, survival and migration. In vitro, BIBW-2992 effectively and selectively inhibited EGFR and HER-2/neu and inhibited EGFR and HER-2/neu total tyrosine phosphorylation and tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Importantly, BIBW-2992 was active against tumors overexpressing EGFR with the secondary Thr790Met point mutation, which confers resistance to the first-generation EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. In phase I/II trials, BIBW-2992 was effective in patients with solid tumors, including those with NSCLC tumors activating mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. BIBW-2992 was generally well tolerated with the main adverse effects being gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders. At the time of publication, BIBW-2992 was undergoing phase II trials for NSCLC, breast and prostate cancers, head and neck carcinoma, as well as glioma. BIBW-2992 was granted Fast-Track status by the FDA for NSCLC and was investigated in phase III trials for this indication.",

Little, however, is known about the prevalence and clinical implications of CD117 in stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. We evaluated 201 consecutive stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung for CD117 immunoreactivity (dichotomized as negative or positive if containing less than 5% or >/=5% immunoreactive neoplastic cells, respectively), also taking into account the pattern (either membranous or cytoplasmic), and the intensity of immunostaining in comparison with intratumoral mast cells. The immunostaining results were then correlated with tumor biopathological characteristics and patients' survival. Membranous CD117 immunoreactivity was documented in 19 (22%) of 88 adenocarcinomas and 15 (13%) of 113 squamous cell carcinomas, whereas cytoplasmic labelling was seen in 28 (32%) adenocarcinomas and eight (7%) squamous cell carcinomas. In both tumor types, membranous or cytoplasmic CD117 immunoreactivity was associated with higher proliferative fraction and with features of more aggressive tumor behavior, including higher stage, size and grade, occurrence of clinical symptoms, high microvessel density and neuroendocrine differentiation. Furthermore, immunoreactive tumors exhibited increased levels of bcl-2, cyclin-E, Her-2, p27(Kip1) and fascin, the latter being a marker of tumor cell metastatization in lung cancer. Membranous but not cytoplasmic labelling emerged as an independent risk factor for death and reduced time to progression in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma patients, when singly adjusted for confounding factors. CD117 immunoreactivity identifies a peculiar subset of stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with highly proliferative tumors and may have prognostic relevance in adenocarcinoma patients. Targeting the CD117 pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy in a subset of pulmonary carcinomas.",

Erlotinib and gefitinib, two EGFR-targeted agents, have been shown to be relevant drugs for lung cancer treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2 receptors, is clinically effective against HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In this report, we investigated the activity of lapatinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;We selected the lung cancer cell line A549, which harbors genomic amplification of EGFR and HER-2. Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assays, and signaling cascade analyses (by western blot) were performed in vitro. In vivo experiments with A549 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice treated with lapatinib (with or without radiotherapy) were also carried out.;Lapatinib dramatically reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.0001), DNA synthesis (P < 0.006), and colony formation capacity (P < 0.0001) in A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, lapatinib induced G1 cell cycle arrest (P < 0.0001) and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.0006) and reduced cyclin A and B1 levels, which are regulators of S and G2/M cell cycle stages, respectively. Stimulation of apoptosis in lapatinib-treated A549 cells was correlated with increased cleaved PARP, active caspase-3, and proapoptotic Bak-1 levels, and reduction in the antiapoptotic IAP-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels. We also demonstrate that lapatinib altered EGFR/HER-2 signaling pathways reducing p-EGFR, p-HER-2, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, c-Myc and PCNA levels. In vivo experiments revealed that A549 tumor-bearing mice treated with lapatinib had significantly less active tumors (as assessed by PET analysis) (P < 0.04) and smaller in size than controls. In addition, tumors from lapatinib-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in angiogenesis (P < 0.0001).;Overall, these data suggest that lapatinib may be a clinically useful agent for the treatment of lung cancer.",

RET and ROS1 fusion-positive tumors are mainly observed in young, female, and/or never smoking patients. Studies based on in vitro and in vivo (i.e., mouse) models and studies of several fusion-positive patients indicate that inhibiting the kinase activity of the RET and ROS1 fusion proteins is a promising therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, there are several ongoing clinical trials aimed at examining the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against RET and ROS1 proteins in patients with fusion-positive lung cancer. Other gene fusions (NTRK1, NRG1, and FGFR1/2/3) that are targetable by existing TKIs have also been identified in NSCLCs.

Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Met receptor families have been identified as important molecular targets for NSCLC. Two EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; erlotinib and gefitinib) are in current clinical use, but a majority of patients do not respond to these targeted therapies. We used receptor TK (RTK) capture arrays to identify receptors active in NSCLC cell lines. As Met and ErbBs were active, we explored the potential therapeutic advantage of combined targeting of Met with ErbB receptor family inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. We found that Met physically interacts with both EGFR and Her2 in a NSCLC cell line with overexpression/overactivation of Met. Combined use of a dual EGFR/Her2 inhibitor with a Met inhibitor yields maximal growth inhibition compared with the use of EGFR and/or Met inhibitors. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of multiple RTKs may be needed to effectively abrogate tumour cell growth. Phosphoproteomic analysis by RTK capture arrays may be a valuable tool for identifying the subset of tumours with functional receptor activation, regardless of mechanism.",

Rapid and efficient identification of these alterations is thus becoming increasingly important.;In this study, 121 triple negative lung adenocarcinomas were screened by both IHC with the ROS1 D4D6 antibody, and FISH using two commercially available ROS1 break-apart probes. To address a possible cross-reactivity of the ROS1 antibody with other protein kinase receptors, we screened 80 additional cases with known EGFR, KRAS, PI3KCA, BRAF, HER2 mutations or ALK-rearrangement.;We diagnosed 9 ROS1-rearranged adenocarcinomas, with both a positive FISH result (51-87% rearranged nuclei) and a positive IHC staining (2+/3+ cytoplasmic staining). Only one of the ROS1-positive FISH cases was characterized by a classical split pattern, the others showed a variant pattern, most commonly involving a loss of the 5' telomeric probe. Considering a positivity threshold of 2+ stained cells, the sensitivity of the ROS1 D4D6 antibody compared to FISH was 100% and the specificity 96.9%, as two HER2-mutated tumors were positive with D4D6 antibody, without any translocation in FISH. All the ROS1-positive cases were at an advanced stage, arising in never or light smokers.

As p185HER2 is also expressed in human lung cancers and human lung cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that these cell lines would also respond to p185HER2 antibodies.

Mechanistically, 4D5 appeared to have a weak agonist effect on the tyrosine kinase function of p185HER2, as exposure of p185HER2-expressing cell lines to 4D5 resulted in increased p185HER2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of tyrosine kinase function with Genistein reversed the 4D5-induced growth inhibition.

Indeed, about 1-37% of tumors of the following types harbor HER2 aberrations: bladder, cervix, colon, endometrium, germ cell, glioblastoma, head and neck, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreas, and salivary duct. Four HER2-targeted therapies have been approved for HER2-positive breast cancer: two antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), an antibody-drug conjugate (ado-trastuzumab emtansine), and a small molecule kinase inhibitor (lapatinib). In addition, afatinib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor that causes irreversible inhibition of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2, was recently approved for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. A large number of novel HER2-targeted agents are also in clinical trials. Herein we discuss the state of the art in understanding and targeting HER2 across anatomic tumor types. ",

We found that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is not only expressed in pretreated human SCLC specimens, but is also upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquire chemoresistance. Trastuzumab induced differential levels of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to HER2-positive SCLC cells. Furthermore, as a mechanism of the differential levels of ADCC, we have revealed that coexpression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on SCLC cells is essential to facilitate and accelerate the trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Although SN-38-resistant SCLC cells lacking ICAM-1 expression were still refractory to trastuzumab, their in vivo growth was significantly suppressed by bevacizumab treatment due to dependence on their distinctive and abundant production of vascular endothelial growth factor. Collectively, stepwise treatment with trastuzumab and bevacizumab is promising for the treatment of chemoresistant SCLC. ",

Afatinib is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker that covalently binds and blocks signaling from EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2) and ErbB4. The compound inhibits also the transphosphorylation of ErbB3. With this mode of action, afatinib is thought to have a mechanistic advantage over EGFR blockade alone, in that it provides a sustained, covalent inhibition of ErbB homo- and hetero-dimers. In the pivotal LUX-Lung 3 study, afatinib demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival over standard pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy (11.1 versus 6.9 months; HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.43-0.78; P = 0.001) in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.

Immunohistochemical studies suggest that non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours may over-express HER2. Our aim was to evaluate HER2 gene amplification and semi-quantitative immuno-expression in NSCLC. A total of 344 NSCLC cases were immunostained for HER2 expression in 2 centres using the HercepTest. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis for HER2 gene amplification was performed on most positive cases and a subset of negative cases. Fifteen cases (4.3%) demonstrated 2+ or 3+ membranous HER2 immuno-expression. There was no correlation between immuno-expression and tumour histology or grade. Tumours from higher-stage disease were more often HercepTest-positive (p < 0.001). All 4 HercepTest 3+ cases demonstrated gene amplification. One of the 5 2+ cases tested for gene amplification showed areas of borderline amplification and areas of polyploidy. None of the 19 HercepTest-negative cases demonstrated gene amplification or polyploidy (p < 0.001). Gene amplification was demonstrated in all HercepTest 3+ scoring NSCLC cases. Unlike breast cancer, gene amplification and HER2 protein over-expression assessed by the HercepTest appeared to be uncommon in NSCLC. Herceptin may therefore target only a small proportion of NSCLC tumours and be of limited clinical value in this disease, particularly in the adjuvant setting.",

Biochemical studies show that commonly observed variants of EGFR [G719C, G719S, L858R, L861Q, and Delta746-750 (del15)] are enzyme activating, increasing the tyrosine kinase V(max) and increasing the K(m)((app)) for ATP. The point mutations G719C and L861Q had minor effects on lapatinib K(i)s, whereas EGFR mutations L858R and del15 had a higher K(i) for lapatinib than wild-type EGFR. Structural analysis of wild-type EGFR-lapatinib complexes and modeling of the EGFR mutants were consistent with these data, suggesting that loss of structural flexibility and possible stabilization of the active-like conformation could interfere with lapatinib binding, particularly to the EGFR deletion mutants. Furthermore, EGFR deletion mutants were relatively resistant to lapatinib-mediated inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation in recombinant cells expressing the variants, whereas EGFR point mutations had a modest or no effect. Of note, EGFR T790M, a receptor variant found in patients with gefitinib-resistant NSCLC, was also resistant to lapatinib-mediated inhibition of receptor autophosphorylation. Two HER2 insertional variants found in NSCLC were less sensitive to lapatinib inhibition than two HER2 point mutants. The effects of lapatinib on the proliferation of human NSCLC tumor cell lines expressing wild-type or variant EGFR and HER2 cannot be explained solely on the basis of the biochemical activity or receptor autophosphorylation in recombinant cells. These data suggest that cell line genetic heterogeneity and/or multiple determinants modulate the role played by EGFR/HER2 in regulating cell proliferation.",

In pulmonary carcinomas, however, there has been disagreement between the reported frequencies of gene amplification and overexpression. To clarify their relationship, the correlation between the cellular expression of p185(ERBB2) and the level of c-erb B-2 gene amplification was studied. A total of 195 pulmonary carcinomas (182 primary and 13 metastatic) were examined immunohistochemically using a polyclonal antibody, which recognizes the internal domain of the human c-erb B-2 protein, and positive tumors were further examined for the gene amplification by dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes for centromere 17 and 17q11.2--12. By immunohistochemistry, distinct membrane staining was found in an adenocarcinoma, a large cell carcinoma and a metastatic carcinoma from the breast, and cytoplasmic and/or faint membranous staining was observed in 23 non-small cell lung carcinomas. It was in the two primaries and the metastatic carcinoma that more than 8-fold amplification of c-erb B-2 was found by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Especially, in the two primary carcinomas, tumor cells had amplified genes with the signals forming one or two clusters, indicating that the amplified gene was present in homogeneously staining regions. Among the 23 tumors, three tumors showed low-level amplification (less than 3-fold), which was differentiated from polysomy 17 found in the other two. In the 30 non-small cell lung carcinomas selected at random from 151 with negative immunostaining, there were five trisomy 17, but no tumors with the gene amplification. This suggests that although c-erb B-2 amplification in pulmonary carcinoma is rare, it occurs in the form of a homogeneously staining region and is thought to control the overexpression of the protein in the cell membrane. New adjuvant therapy using a humanized antibody to the oncoprotein may be beneficial to patients with these tumors.",

Its overexpression is closely associated with poor prognosis in the course of disease. Here we demonstrate HER-2/neu overexpression in both established cell lines and biopsy material obtained from renal epithelial tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of human kidney tumor lesions using 2 HER-2/neu-specific antibodies revealed HER-2/neu expression in more than 40% of primary epithelial renal tumors and more than 30% of primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specimens. A distinctive HER-2/neu expression pattern was found in different subtypes of kidney tumors with the highest frequency in chromophilic and chromophobic RCC, but neither associated with disease stage nor tumor grade. Eight of 10 RCC cell lines expressed significant levels of HER-2/neu mRNA and protein, but at a lower level compared with HER-2/neu overexpressing ovarian carcinoma cells. To evaluate the immune response against HER-2/neu expressing HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) RCC cells, allogeneic HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines generated by pulsing dendritic cells with 3 different HER-2/neu-derived peptides, (HER-2(9.369), HER-2(9.435) and HER-2(9.689), were utilized in chromium-release assays. Specific lysis of HER-2/neu expressing HLA-A2(+) RCC cell lines was mediated by CTL lines specific for each of these 3 HER-2/neu-derived epitopes. The fine specificity of 2 CTL clones was defined to the epitopes HER-2(9.435) and HER-2(9.689). Their specificity was then confirmed by cold target inhibition assays. In addition, CTL-mediated lysis was enhanced by pulsing tumor cells with exogenous HER-2/neu-specific peptides. Our data suggest that (i) HER-2/neu is heterogeneously expressed in different subtypes of RCC, (ii) HER-2/neu is naturally processed by RCC and (iii) HER-2/neu epitopes presented by RCC can be recognized by HLA-A2-restricted, HER-2/neu-specific CTL.",

Clinicopathological information were obtained from the medical records.;NKX2-1, SETDB1, MET, HER2, SOX2, FGFR1, and PIK3CA gene amplification were observed in 30 of 277 (10.8%), 16 of 280 (5.7%), 38 of 278 (13.7%), 8 of 270 (3.0%), 34 of 278 (12.2%), 18 of 282 (6.4%), and 53 of 278 (19.1%) cases, respectively.

It is overexpressed in several human cancers of epithelial origin, such as pancreatic cancer. Previously, we demonstrated that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) derived from breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer recognized a peptide derived from HER2/neu. To evaluate whether this HLA-A2-binding peptide is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in pancreatic cancer, the ability of HER2/neu-reactive CTL to lyse human pancreatic carcinoma cells was tested. CTL were generated from tumor-associated T lymphocytes from HLA-A2+ HER2/neu+ breast and ovarian cancer patients. All CTL recognized autologous and allogeneic HER2/ neu+ tumor cells in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. Furthermore, all CTL recognized p654-662 (GP2) derived from HER2/neu. These CTL also recognized HER2/neu+ pancreatic cancer cells in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. HER2/neu+ HLA-A2- pancreatic cancer were not or only poorly lysed. Repeated stimulation of HLA-A2+ PBL from pancreatic cancer patients using the HER2/neu-derived peptide resulted in specific recognition of this peptide and, more importantly, HER2/neu+ pancreatic tumors in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. Autologous HLA-A2+ fibroblasts or HLA-A2+ malignant melanoma cells were not recognized. HLA-A2- peptide-stimulated T lymphocytes showed no significant cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that this HER2/neu-derived peptide is a shared TAA among several adenocarcinomas including pancreatic carcinoma, suggesting a common mechanism of recognition of these human tumors by T lymphocytes. The identification of the HER2/neu-derived peptide GP2 as a TAA in pancreatic cancer provides an opportunity for the design of novel immunotherapy and vaccine strategies.",

Furthermore, these clones also recognized HER-2/neu(+) tumor cell lines, and tumor cells from breast, colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas induced to express HLA-DR4, but also the HLA-DR4(+) melanoma cell line FM3 transfected to express HER-2/neu. The recognition of tumor cells was strongly inhibited by an anti-HLA-DR mAb. Taken altogether, we provide novel information for the role of HER-2(884-899) as a naturally processed epitope expressed by breast, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas and the capacity of HER-2/neu protein to follow the endogenous class II processing pathway. Our results suggest that HER-2(884-899) might be attractive for broadly applicable vaccines and may prove useful for adoptive immunotherapy designed for breast, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas.",

We discuss the challenge of acquired resistance to these small-molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors and review promising agents which may overcome resistance, including the EGFR T790M-targeted agents CO-1686 and AZD9291, and the ALK-targeted agents ceritinib (LDK378), AP26113, alectinib (CH/RO5424802), and others. Emerging therapies directed against other driver oncogenes in NSCLC including ROS1, HER2, and BRAF are covered as well.

In this study, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect HER2 and COX-2 expression in NSCLC tissues. Then, pcDNA3.1-HER2 was used to overexpress HER2, while HER2 siRNA and COX-2 siRNA were used to silence HER2 and COX-2 expression. MTT assay and invasion assay were used to detect the effects of HER2 on cell proliferation and invasion. Our study revealed that HER2 and COX-2 expression were upregulated in NSCLC tissues and HER2 exhibited a significant positive correlation with the levels of COX-2 expression. Overexpression of HER2 evidently elevated COX-2 expression, while silencing of HER2 evidently decreased COX-2 expression. Furthermore, overexpressed HER2 induced the ERK phosphorylation, and this was abolished by the treatment with U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, an upstream kinase of ERK. HER2-induced expression and promoter activity of COX-2 were also suppressed by U0126, suggesting that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway regulates COX-2 expression. In addition, HER2 induced activation of AKT signaling pathway, which was reversed by pretreatment with U0126 and COX-2 siRNA. MTT and invasion assays revealed that HER2 induced cell proliferation and invasion that were reversed by pretreatment with U0126 and COX-2 siRNA. In this study, our results demonstrated for the first time that HER2 elevated COX-2 expression through the activation of MEK/ERK pathway, which subsequently induced cell proliferation and invasion via AKT pathway in NSCLC tissues.

Conversely, inhibition of ErbB pathways with targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), blocks cell cycle progression, inhibits the production of pro-angiogenic factors and induces apoptosis in numerous in vitro and xenograft models. Accordingly, the ErbB receptor family with their most prominent members EGFR and HER-2 represents validated targets for anti-cancer therapy, and anti-ErbB MoAbs (cetuximab, panitumumab, and trastuzumab) and TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib) have now been approved for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, as well as pancreatic and breast cancer.

In a first step, proteins were selected which showed a relationship to lymph node involvement. The expression of JUN, ERBB2, MYC, cyclin D, PCNA, bFGF, VEGF and Hsp70 proteins revealed a positive correlation to lymph node involvement. In contrast, caspase-3, Fas ligand, Fas/CD95, and PAI showed an inverse correlation to lymph node involvement. In a second step, these parameters were further analyzed by hierarchical cluster analyses. The resulting clusters were correlated to patients with or without lymph node involvement.

When breast cancers were examined for NGAL mRNA and protein levels, they were found to exhibit heterogeneous expression. NGAL levels varied in these tumors from undetectable to exceeding those in normal breast parenchyma. Immuno-histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of NGAL within breast carcinoma cells but detected only low levels of this protein in normal ductal epithelium. In contrast, large amounts of the protein were localized to the lumen of normal breast ducts in the vicinity of NGAL-expressing tumors. Interestingly, unlike NRL in rat mammary carcinomas, no significant association between NGAL expression and HER-2/neu activation was found in human breast tumors. In contrast, a significant correlation between NGAL expression in breast cancer was found with several other markers of poor prognosis, including estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative status and high proliferation (S-phase fraction).

Possible risk factors were easily identified from patients. Twenty-eight potential risk factors were investigated. Finally, 78 patients with complete data in the potential factors were found eligible, and univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.;Univariate analyses showed that the status of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and the status of the epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2) were high-risk factors for invasive ductal breast cancer metastasis to the lung as the first organ. P values were, respectively, 0.045, 0.049 and 0.026. Multivariate analyses showed that the pN3 stage needs to be combined with vascular invasion to predict initial lung metastasis. The status of ER and PR was also viewed in combination with p53 negative to predict lung metastasis. Further analyses demonstrated that a subtype of four negative in breast cancer was significantly associated with initial lung metastasis.;Patients with pN3 stage and vascular invasion were more likely to develop lung metastasis.

In this study, we examined the molecular basis of sensitivity to gefitinib using nine human lung cancer cell lines derived from NSCLC. PC9 was the most sensitive to gefitinib of the nine NSCLC cell lines when assayed either by colony formation or MTS assays. The various cell lines expressed different levels of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4, but there was no correlation between levels of EGFR and/or HER2 expression and drug sensitivity. Phosphorylation of EGFR, protein kinase B/AKT (Akt), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was inhibited by much lower concentration of gefitinib in PC9 cells than in the other eight cell lines under exponential growing conditions. About 80% of cell surface EGFR in PC-9 was internalized within 10 min, whereas only about 30-50% of the cell surface EGFR was internalized in more drug-resistant cell lines in 15-60 min. The present study is the first to demonstrate that sensitivity to growth inhibition by gefitinib in NSCLC cell lines under basal growth condition is associated with dependence on Akt and ERK1/2 activation in response to EGFR signaling for survival and proliferation and also that drug sensitivity may be related to the extent of EGF-induced down-regulation of cell surface EGFR.",

Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumor samples were analyzed by Sanger sequencing for mutations in selected exons of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and HER2. ALK rearrangements were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.;Between July 1, 2009 and August 1, 2010, 427 specimens from 419 patients were referred for genomic characterization; 344 (81%) specimens were successfully genotyped with a median turnaround time of 31 days (range, 9-155). Of the 344 specimens, 185 (54%) had at least one identifiable somatic alteration (KRAS: 24%, EGFR: 17%, ALK: 5%, BRAF: 5%, HER2: 4%, PIK3CA: 2%). As of August 1, 2011, 63 of 288 advanced NSCLC patients (22%) had received molecularly targeted therapy based on their genotypic results, including 34 of 42 patients (81%) with EGFR mutations, 12 of 15 (80%) with ALK rearrangements, and 17 of 95 (18%) with KRAS, BRAF, or HER2 mutations.;Large-scale testing for somatic alterations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, HER2, and ALK is feasible and impacts therapeutic decisions. As the repertoire for personalized therapies expands in lung cancer and other malignancies, there is a need to develop new genomics technologies that can generate a comprehensive genetic profile of tumor specimens in a time- and cost-effective manner.",

The effect of ectopic expression of MDGI on EGFR, ErbB2, and integrin function and traffic was investigated in breast and lung cancer cell lines using multiple methods. The effect of anti-EGFR agents on these cells were tested by cell proliferation measurements and by assessing tumor growth of breast cancer cells in cetuximab treated and control athymic nude mice.;Here, we show that although MDGI is absent in cultured cell lines because of epigenetic silencing, MDGI mRNA is expressed in 40% of clinical breast carcinomas and 85% of lung cancers. Ectopic expression of MDGI rendered breast and lung cancer cells resistant to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in vitro and in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. When expressed in cancer cells, MDGI induces intracellular accumulation of EGFR, but not ErbB2, and the internalized receptor is phosphorylated and not degraded.;MDGI-driven inherent desensitization of cancer cells is a novel molecular mechanism for resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and MDGI may be a biomarker for responsiveness to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.",

Ganetespib was also approximately 20-fold more potent in isogenic Ba/F3 pro-B cells rendered IL-3 independent by expression of EGFR and ERBB2 mutants. In mice bearing NCI-H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M) xenografts, ganetespib was rapidly eliminated from plasma and normal tissues but was maintained in tumor with t(1/2) 58.3 hours, supporting once-weekly dosing experiments, in which ganetespib produced greater tumor growth inhibition than 17-AAG. However, after a single dose, reexpression of mutant EGFR occurred by 72 hours, correlating with reversal of antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Consecutive day dosing resulted in xenograft regressions, accompanied by more sustained pharmacodynamic effects.

Microscopic examination revealed an endometrial carcinoma composed of papillary serous carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. There was a differential immunoreactivity between the two components: the cells of the papillary serous carcinoma were positive for cytokeratin, CA-125, CEA, and HER-2/Neu, whereas these markers were negative in the small cell carcinoma. Various neuroendocrine markers were positive in the small cell carcinoma and negative in the papillary serous carcinoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using 4, 8, and 10 centromeric probes revealed hyperploidy (6-8 signals) in the small cell carcinoma cells. Most of the serous carcinoma cells were euploid, with scattered trisomies and tetrasomies of these chromosomes. The patient died of progressive disease 5 months after surgery.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression correlates with poor prognosis in extensive disease-SCLC. We have reported previously that HER2 expression is upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquire chemoresistance, and also demonstrated that trastuzumab exerts significant antitumor activity toward HER2-upregulated chemoresistant SCLC, mainly via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanism. Based on these preclinical data, we treated two patients with HER2-positive SCLC by combination of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, day 1) and irinotecan (80 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8) every 21 days as the third-line chemotherapy following two prior regimens, first-line carboplatin plus etoposide and second-line amrubicin. One patient achieved partial response after the first cycle and received 6 cycles in total without disease progression for 4.5 months. The other also received 4 cycles and kept stable disease for 3.5 months. This treatment can be continued safely at an outpatient clinic without any severe adverse event. In conclusion, trastuzumab plus irinotecan chemotherapy is promising and feasible against HER2-positive relapsed SCLC. Further clinical studies are encouraged to confirm the antitumor efficacy of trastuzumab in SCLC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"An important recent advance in anticancer therapy was the development of molecular-targeting drugs, such as the epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting drug ZD1839 (Iressa) and the HER2-trageting anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). ZD1839 and trastuzumab are reported to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer, respectively, although the effectiveness of either drug alone is not satisfactory. NSCLC cells often express both EGFR and HER2. We therefore investigated whether a combination of ZD1839 and trastuzumab had an additive or synergistic antitumor effect. In culture ZD1839 inhibited the growth of four NSCLC cell lines (A549, NCI-H23, NCI-H727, and NCI-H661) that expressed various levels of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4. A significant cytotoxic effect was observed when ZD1839 was combined with trastuzumab in A549 cells. However, this combination had no apparent effect in NCI-H23 cells. Significant G(1)-phase arrest, increased p27 expression and decreased cyclin E or D1 levels were detected in A549 cells treated with ZD1839 and trastuzumab. No significant effects were detected in NCI-H23 cells examined. The combination treatment significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, retinoblastoma, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, and protein kinase B/Akt in A549 cells, but not in NCI-H23 cells. Our results indicated that increased levels of constitutive EGFR/HER2 heterodimers were formed in A549 cells in the presence of ZD1839, whereas no heterodimer formation was detected in NCI-H23 cells. We therefore suggest that combination treatment with ZD1839 and trastuzumab might have improved therapeutic efficacy against NSCLC cells expressing both EGFR and HER2.",

It is known that many patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib have tumors with EGFR-activating mutations. This might suggest that patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma, who also have tumors with EGFR-activating mutations, might represent a patient population who could benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy. High-resolution melting amplicon analysis (HRMAA) is a recently described technique which can be used for screening tumor DNA isolated from paraffin blocks for tyrosine kinase-activating mutations. In this report we screened 24 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, either primary in the head and neck or secondarily involving the head and neck area, for activating mutations in EGFR exons 18, 19, 20, 21, and for HER2 exons 19 and 20. All cases were followed up by direct DNA sequencing. Two (8%) of the 24 cases were positive. One case was a maxillary sinus tumor which contained an exon 20-activating mutation (N771YinsG). Surprisingly, the other case was a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which invaded the head and neck area only secondarily. This tumor contained an exon 19-activating mutation (G729E). No HER2-activating mutations were found. The presence of a small number of squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck area with EGFR-activating mutations suggests the existence of a population of patients who could derive benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy. HRMAA could serve as a screening method to easily and rapidly identify these patients.",

Here, we report a case of an advanced chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC, harboring a novel HER3(V855A) somatic mutation homologous to the EGFR(L858R)activating mutation. Co-expression of HER3(V855A) and wild-type HER2 enhances ligand-induced transformation of murine and human cell lines, while HER-targeted inhibitors potently suppress mutant HER3 activity. Consistent with these observations, in silico computational modeling predicts that mutant V855A alters the kinase domain and c-terminal end of the HER3 protein. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for the clinical exploration of targeted therapies in HER3 mutant NSCLC and by extrapolation, in other cancers that more frequently carry somatic HER3 mutations.",

We show here that somatic deletions in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were associated with increased EGFR gene copy number in NSCLC. Treatment with the specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib or erlotinib or the EGFR inhibitory antibody cetuximab induced apoptosis of HCC827, a NSCLC cell line with EGFR gene amplification and an exon 19 deletion.

Immunohistochemistry was performed for the detection of Axin expression in 232 breast cancer tissues. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to assess the relation of Axin expression with classic clinicopathological parameters, patients' survival and various biologic markers Human Epidermal Factor-2 (HER-2), Ki-67, topoIIα, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)].

Stromal Axin showed a parallel association with lymph node status and HER-2. In the subgroup of lobular breast carcinomas, preserved Axin was found to exert an unfavorable impact on patients' overall survival.

Unlike typical dual specificity phosphatases, VHR lacks the MAPK-binding domain and shows poor activity against MAPKs.

Expression of VHR inhibited the activation of phospholipase Cγ and protein kinase C, both downstream effectors of Tyr-992 phosphorylation of EGFR. Decreasing VHR expression by RNA interference caused higher EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-992. In addition to EGFR, VHR also directly dephosphorylated ErbB2. Consistent with these results, suppression of VHR augmented the foci formation ability of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, whereas overexpression of VHR suppressed cell growth in both two- and three-dimensional cultures. Expression of VHR also suppressed tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, VHR expression was significantly lower in NSCLC tissues in comparison to that in normal lung tissues. Collectively, this study shows that down-regulation of VHR expression enhances the signaling of ErbB receptors and may be involved in NSCLC pathogenesis.",

A 51-year-old premenopausal female, who had a history of partial mastectomy for right breast cancer at the age of 40, was referred to Toyama City Hospital (Toyoma, Japan) for an endoscopic diagnosis of gastric linitis plastica. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis, while peritoneal metastasis and malignant ascites were not detected. Chest CT detected a left lung tumor, which had invaded the left upper bronchus. Biopsy specimens were obtained and the histopathological findings on both the gastric tumor and lung tumor demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, whereas the histology of the original breast cancer was IDC with a solid-tubular type. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the biopsied specimens of the gastric and lung tumors were positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and negative for human epithelial growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). These molecular characteristics indicated the case was metastatic gastric carcinoma from the breast cancer with lung metastasis, since the statuses of ER, PgR and HER2 were concordant with those of the original breast cancer. However, the possibility of primary gastric cancer could not be completely ruled out. Therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed for the purpose of both diagnosis and treatment. Pathological examination of the resected specimen provided a definite diagnosis of multiple metastatic gastric carcinomas from the breast.

We established two clones, LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57, by transfecting HER2 cDNA into LK2, a NSCLC line with a low expression level of HER2. We observed no mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 of EGFR gene in LK2, LK2/mock- and two HER2-trasfectants when we observed in-frame deletion mutations (E746-A750) adjacent to K745 in a gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell line, PC9. These LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57 were much more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib than the parental LK2 lines. Treatment with 0.5 to 1 micromol/L gefitinib specifically blocked Akt activation in both HER2-transfectant lines, but not in the parental LK2 cells. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activation, however, was not blocked by gefitinib up to 10 micromol/L in either the parent or transfectant lines. Gefitinib was also shown to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1-S phase, and an accompanying increase of p27Kip1 was observed. LK2/HER2 transfectants showed constitutive formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimer, which were seen to associate with a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, p85alpha, when active. Treatment of LK2/HER2 cells with gefitinib markedly decreased the formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimers, HER3 basal phosphorylation, and the association of p85alpha with HER3. This study is the first to show that under basal growth conditions, HER2 sensitizes low-EGFR NSCLC cell lines to growth inhibition by gefitinib.",

Research on non-small cell lung cancer has elucidated factors that may predict response to gefitinib. Less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in HNSCC patients.;We analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established HNSCC lines in vitro. IC50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. ErbB signaling was assessed by Western and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pEGFR, pErbB2, pErbB3, pAkt, and pErk. EGFR sequences encoding kinase domain and EGFR gene copy numbers were determined by cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux).;Expression levels of pErbB2 (P = 0.02) and total ErbB3 protein (P = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC. However, other EGFR/ErbB receptor family members than EGFR may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. ErbB2 and ErbB3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of HNSCC with gefitinib.",

Despite improvements in conventional treatment for NSCLC, survival remains poor and improvements in patient outcome are warranted. Over recent years, basic scientific research has dramatically increased our knowledge of the pathogenesis of lung cancer and allowed us to uncover and understand the cellular pathways involved in this process. This has led to the development of therapies to selectively target these pathways. Among these, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase family and related downstream pathways play a critical role in cancer development and over recent years have become a validated target in NSCLC. The development of monoclonal antibodies and first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted towards EGFR has had a considerable impact on patient outcomes. However, despite dramatic and sustained responses and the discovery of specific patient subgroups that may derive clinical benefit, resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs inevitably develops. A new generation of agents have been developed to provide superior potency of target inhibition and further individualize the treatment of NSCLC. This article reviews EGFR-targeted therapies currently available for use and undergoing clinical development for the treatment of NSCLC, specifically focusing on next generation agents including BIBW 2992, an irreversible dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases.",

We explored immunohistochemical co-expression of HER family receptors (HER1, HER2, HER3, HER4) and its potential role as prognostic factor in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expression of HER family receptors was assessed by immunohistochemistry on 125 surgically resected NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence were calculated for clinical variables and HER expression, using the Cox model for multivariate analysis. HER1 and HER3 expression was detected more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.002 and p = <0.001, respectively). HER4 was more often expressed in patients older than 60 years (p = 0.02) and in tumors of low histological grade (p = 0.04). Cases which expressed only HER1 had a worse DFS (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.01) compared to cases expressing HER1 and one or more of the other family members and to cases which did not express HER1 but one of the other HERs. By multivariate analysis, stage was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS. Furthermore, different patterns of co-expression of HER family receptors showed a statistically significant correlation with a shorter DFS (p = 0.03) and OS (p = 0.02). Our findings suggest that expression of HER1 only is correlated with worse DFS and OS.

Here we demonstrate that 2 of 10 of the cancer-associated mutations of ErbB4 lead to loss of ErbB4 kinase activity due to disruption of functionally important structural features. Interestingly, the kinase-dead ErbB4 mutants were as efficient as wild-type ErbB4 in forming a heterodimeric neuregulin receptor with ErbB2 and promoting phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt in an ErbB2 kinase-dependent manner.

The rarer epidermal growth factor receptors harboring exon 20 insertions and vIII mutations are also Hsp90 clients. Lung cancers may also be driven by mutant ErbB2, mutant B-Raf, or mutant or overexpressed c-Met, all of which are also degraded on Hsp90 inhibition. Hsp90 inhibitors may be synergistic with other drugs that disrupt chaperone function, including inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 and the proteasome and agents that inhibit Hsp70 function. Hsp90 plays a unique antiapoptotic role in small cell lung cancer cells, so that Hsp90 inhibition results in substantial cell death in both chemosensitive and chemoresistant small cell lung cancer cell lines.

Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIa (sPLA2-IIa) is involved in inflammation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. We were the first to uncover that cancer cells secrete sPLA2‑IIa. sPLA2‑IIa is overexpressed in almost all specimens of human lung cancers examined and is significantly elevated in the plasma of lung cancer patients. High levels of plasma sPLA2-IIa are significantly associated with advanced stage and decreased overall cancer survival. In this study, we further showed that elevated HER/HER2‑PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling contributes to sPLA2-IIa overexpression in lung cancer cells. sPLA2-IIa in turn phosphorylates and activates HER2 and HER3 in a time- and dose‑dependent manner in lung cancer cells. The structure and sequence‑based docking analysis revealed that sPLA2-IIa β hairpin shares structural similarity with the corresponding EGF hairpin. sPLA2-IIa forms an extensive interface with EGFR and brings the two lobes of EGFR into an active conformation. sPLA2-IIa also enhances the NF-κB promoter activity. Anti-sPLA2-IIa antibody, but not the small molecule sPLA2-IIa inhibitor LY315920, significantly inhibits sPLA2‑IIa-induced activation of NF-κB promoter. Our findings support the notion that sPLA2-IIa functions as a ligand for the EGFR family of receptors leading to an elevated HER/HER2-elicited signaling.

To address this, we carried out immunostaining for TTF-1 on 546 primary breast carcinomas submitted for routine estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 testing. Cases were considered TTF-1 positive if they showed any nuclear staining for this marker. TTF-1 expression was identified in 13 cases (2.4%). Expression varied from focal and weak to diffuse and strong and was seen in both invasive and in situ components. We conclude that a small proportion of breast carcinomas show TTF-1 expression.

Supporting our hypothesis, exogenous supplementation of cultured breast cancer cells with physiological concentrations of OA was found to suppress the overexpression of HER2 (Her-2/neu, erbB-2), a well-characterized oncogene playing a key role in the etiology, progression and response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in approximately 20% of breast carcinomas. OA treatment was also found to synergistically enhance the efficacy of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody binding with high affinity to the ectodomain (ECD) of the Her2-coded p185(HER2) oncoprotein. Moreover, OA exposure significantly diminished the proteolytic cleavage of the ECD of HER2 and, consequently, its activation status, a crucial molecular event that determines both the aggressive behavior and the response to trastuzumab of Her2-overexpressing breast carcinomas. Our most recent findings further reveal that OA exposure may suppresses HER2 at the transcriptional level by up-regulating the expression of the Ets protein PEA3 -a DNA-binding protein that specifically blocks HER2 promoter activity- in breast, ovarian and stomach cancer cell lines. This anti-HER2 property of OA offers a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism by which olive oil may regulate the malignant behavior of cancer cells. From a clinical perspective, it could provide an effective means of influencing the outcome of Her-2/neu-overexpressing human carcinomas with poor prognosis. Indeed, OA-induced transcriptional repression of HER2 oncogene may represent a novel genomic explanation linking \"Mediterranean diet\", olive oil and cancer as it seems to equally operate in various types of Her-2/neu-related carcinomas.",

In total, 55 breast carcinomas morphologically diagnosed as apocrine were evaluated for the steroid receptor expression profile characteristic of normal apocrine epithelium (androgen receptor positive/estrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative), and for the expression of EGFR and Her-2/neu proteins, and the copy number ratios of the genes EGFR/CEP7 and HER-2/CEP17. On the basis of the results of steroid receptors expression, 38 (69%) cases were classified as pure apocrine carcinoma (androgen receptor positive/ER negative/PR negative), whereas 17 (31%) were re-classified as apocrine-like carcinomas because they did not have the characteristic steroid receptor expression profile. Her-2/neu overexpression was observed in 54% of the cases (57% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 47% apocrine-like carcinomas). HER-2/neu gene amplification was demonstrated in 52% of all cases (54% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 46% apocrine-like carcinomas). EGFR protein (scores 1 to 3+) was detected in 62% of all cases and was expressed in a higher proportion of pure apocrine carcinomas than in the apocrine-like carcinomas group (76 vs 29%, P=0.006). In the pure apocrine carcinoma group, Her-2/neu and EGFR protein expression were inversely correlated (P=0.006, r=-0.499). EGFR gene amplification was observed in two pure apocrine carcinomas and one apocrine-like carcinoma. Polysomy 7 was commonly present in pure apocrine carcinomas (61 vs 27% of apocrine-like carcinomas; P=0.083) and showed a weak positive correlation with EGFR protein expression (P=0.025, r=0.326). Our study showed that apocrine breast carcinomas are molecularly diverse group of carcinomas. Strictly defined pure apocrine carcinomas are either HER-2-overexpressing breast carcinomas or triple-negative breast carcinomas, whereas apocrine-like carcinomas predominantly belong to the luminal phenotype. Pure apocrine carcinomas show consistent overexpression of either EGFR or HER-2/neu, which could have significant therapeutic implications.",

The high rate of mortality is mainly caused by the difficulties of early detection of this disease and the lack of effective treatment for advanced stages of ovarian cancers when they are detected. One of the common pathological features of many primary ovarian cancers is the amplification/overexpression of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, HER-2 (also known as neu or ErbB2) gene (1). Although there are some discrepancies in the literature (2), HER-2 overexpression in cancer cells correlates well with a greater resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in certain experimental systems (3). In addition, HER-2 overexpression has been shown to enhance metastatic potential in many different model systems (4). Therefore, the HER-2 gene has become an excellent target for developing therapeutic agents that could reverse malignant transformation of HER-2-overexpressing cancer cells (5).",

We used an immunocytochemical technique for p53, Bcl-2, HER-2 and Ki67 analysis in fine-needle aspirates obtained from surgical samples that were also evaluated by flow cytometric DNA analysis using a FACScan flow cytometer.;From April 2000 to December 2005, 136 patients with radically resected NSCLC were recruited.

Although heterotransplants of certain human solid tumors can be successfully grown in nude mice, they have never been appropriately explored for prediction of in vivo chemosensitivity to anticancer agents. We determined the tumor response rate and studied the influence of several biological and molecular tumor parameters on the in vivo sensitivity to paclitaxel in a series of heterotransplanted human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. One hundred consecutive resected NSCLC tumors were heterotransplanted s.c. in nude mice. The in vivo sensitivity to i.v. paclitaxel (60 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was studied in 34 successfully grown heterotransplants. Treatment started when the tumors reached a size of 5 mm in diameter, and strict standard clinical criteria (>50% shrinkage in tumor weight or cross-sectional surface) were used to define tumor response. Baseline multidrug resistance protein (MRP), Her-2/neu, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, and pre- and posttherapy bax and bcl-2 expression were determined by Western blot analysis. p53 status was determined by sequencing. The overall take rate was 46% (95% confidence interval, 36-56%) and was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for squamous carcinoma tumors (75%) than for adenocarcinoma tumors (30%) and bronchoalveolar tumors (23%). The heterotransplants were morphologically very similar to the original tumors. The response rate to paclitaxel was 21% (95% confidence interval, 9-38%). Baseline tumor parameters associated with response were no Her-2/neu expression (none of the responding tumors expressed Her-2/neu versus 48% of the nonresponding tumors, P = 0.05) and baseline bcl-2 expression (all responding tumors expressed bcl-2 versus only 43% of the nonresponding tumors, P = 0.02). There was a trend toward a higher response rate in bax-positive tumors, and MRP- and EGFR-negative tumors, but it was not statistically significant. The response was independent of baseline p53 status and baseline mitotic index. Responding tumors had a higher bax/bcl-2 ratio 24 h after therapy, but the difference was only marginally significant (2.8 for responding tumors versus 1.1 for nonresponding tumors, P = 0.07). The extent of mitotic arrest at 24 h after therapy was not associated with response. Human NSCLC heterotransplants are morphologically identical to the original tumors and have a response rate to paclitaxel that is equivalent to that reported in Phase II studies in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with single-agent paclitaxel. NSCLC heterotransplants deserve to be explored to evaluate new agents for lung cancer and to predict clinical response on an individual basis in selected groups of patients.",

In this paper, we showed identification of a CTL epitope peptide of HER2 / neu restricted by HLA-A24.

The peptide with a sequence of RWGLLLALL (position 8-16) named HE1 showed the highest affinity. We induced CTLs from CD8(+)cells of HLA-A24 healthy donors by stimulation with HE1-pulsed autologous dendritic cells. The CTLs showed cytotoxic activity against not only the peptide-pulsed target cells but also HLA-A24 colorectal tumour cell lines that endogenously overexpressed HER2 / neu. The antigen-specificity was confirmed by cold target inhibition assay using HE1-pulsed target cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung adenocarcinomas with bronchioalveolar features (ABAF), formerly called bronchioloalveolar cancers (BAC), constitute a distinct clinical, radiological and pathological entity among lung malignancies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and to a less extent, HER-2/neu, are known to be overexpressed in non-small lung cancers, but their exact status in ABAF is not well-documented. Stimulation of these two receptors results in the initiation of two major cascades, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) and Ras-dependent pathways. We have therefore studied the expressions of EGFR, HER-2/neu as well as phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and phosphorylated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK), which are key molecules in these two pathways, in 15 ABAF patients. EGFR was found to be overexpressed in 9 of 15 patients (60%). HER-2/neu overexpression was detected in 6 of the 14 tumors tested (43%). pAKT and pERK were both found to be positive in 13 of 15 patients (87%). Six of the seven tumors with mucinous pattern were negative for EGFR, while all of the other eight cases were positive (P=0.001). Mucinous tumors were also less likely than non-mucinous tumors to overexpress HER-2/neu (17% versus 63%, respectively). These findings suggest that ABAF, particularly those with non-mucinous histology, commonly harbors EGFR and HER-2/neu overexpression. PI-3K and Ras-dependant pathways that lie downstream are generally activated, even in the absence of EGFR and/or HER-2/neu overexpression. ABAF may be a particularly promising candidate for EGFR-targeted strategies and this possibility merits extensive evaluation in clinical trials.",

We assessed 23 mutations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis. We also amplified EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the fusion genes ALK, ROS1, and RET using reverse transcription PCR.;Between July 2011 and January 2013, 60 SCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6). EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in patients with combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of patients with and without genomic aberrations. However, serum neuron-specific enolase and progastrin-releasing peptide levels were significantly higher in patients without genomic aberrations than in those with aberrations (p=0.01 and 0.04, respectively).;Genomic aberrations were found in 15% SCLC patients, with PIK3CA amplifications most frequently observed.

A clinically relevant intratumoral HER2 heterogenous tumor model was established by inoculating mice with tumor cells consisting of TUBO and TUBO-P2J at a ratio of 1,000:1 or 10,000:1. Tumor growth and mouse survival were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-neu antibody.;The TUBO-P2J cell line is a HER2/neu negative and highly metastatic variant of TUBO. This cell line was resistant to anti-neu antibody therapy, and when inoculated subcutaneously, metastasized to the lungs within 14 days. Compared to the parental TUBO cell line, TUBO-P2J displayed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related gene expression profile including: the loss of E-cadherin, and increased Vimentin, Snail, and Twist1 expression. In addition, TUBO-P2J exhibited increased invasion and migration activity, and was resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Finally, mixed tumor implantations experiments revealed that an increased percentage of TUBO-P2J rendered tumors less responsive to anti-neu antibody therapy.;This study describes a novel model of intratumoral heterogenous metastatic breast cancer in immune competent mice that can be used to develop novel or combined immunotherapies to overcome antibody resistance.",

We seek to complement the existing small literature with this report of a histopathologic analysis of breast cancers from women with documented LFS. Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germline TP53 mutation carriers were assembled from investigators in the LFS consortium. Central histology review was performed on 93% of the specimens by a single breast pathologist from a major university hospital. Histology, grade, and hormone receptor status were assessed by immunohistochemistry; HER-2 status was defined by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). No other histologies were observed. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years (range 22-46). Of the invasive cancers, 84% were positive for ER and/or PR; and 81% were high grade. Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Of the invasive tumors, 53% were positive for both ER and HER2+; other ER/PR/HER2 combinations were observed. The DCIS were positive for ER and HER2 in 27% of the cases. This report of the phenotype of breast cancers from women with LFS nearly doubles the literature on this topic. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive.

Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

Here we addressed this question by examining SFK phosphorylation in NSCLC biopsy samples and using genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit SFK expression and activity in cultured NSCLC cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLC biopsy samples using a Tyr416 phosphorylation-specific, pan-SFK antibody revealed staining in 123 (33%) of 370 tumors. Because c-Src is known to be both an upstream activator and downstream mediator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we next investigated SFK phosphorylation in a panel of NSCLC cell lines, including ones that depend on EGFR for survival. The EGFR-dependent NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and H3255 had increased phosphorylation of SFKs, and treatment of these cells with an SFK inhibitor (PP1 or SKI-606) induced apoptosis. PP1 decreased phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 and strikingly enhanced apoptosis by gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor. HCC827 cells transfected with c-Src short hairpin RNA exhibited diminished phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 and decreased sensitivity to apoptosis by PP1 or gefitinib. We conclude that SFKs are activated in NSCLC biopsy samples, promote the survival of EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells, and should be investigated as therapeutic targets in NSCLC patients.",

Amplification of HER-2/neu oncogene and over-expression of its gene product have both prognostic and therapeutic implications in breast cancer. Recent report on salivary duct carcinomas for HER-2/neu using immunohistochemistry (IHC) has shown over-expression in most cases. However, correlation between IHC and molecular genetic analysis of HER-2/neu in salivary duct carcinoma has not yet been performed.;We have now evaluated 11 cases of salivary duct carcinomas for HER-2/neu status using IHC and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). To our knowledge, this is the first molecular genetic analysis of HER-2/neu in salivary duct carcinoma.;In immunohistochemistry, over-expression of HER-2/neu protein was identified as distinct membrane staining in most carcinoma cells in all our salivary duct carcinoma cases, while only four cases revealed an amplification of HER-2/neu gene by means of FISH analysis. Both amplified and non-amplified salivary duct carcinomas with strong immunohistochemical staining for HER-2/neu protein were associated with poor clinical outcome for the patients. Apparently, HER-2/neu protein over-expression could also be controlled by mechanisms other than gene amplification. In the group of salivary gland tumours other than salivary duct carcinoma, strong over-expression was detected only in three cases of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Thus, over-expression of HER-2/neu protein is also a useful marker of malignant transformation in pleomorphic adenomas.",

We identified a novel mechanism by which integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 expression, Ras activation, and the invasion of breast carcinoma cells. Here we show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates Ras activity especially in serum-depleted condition. Down-regulation of beta(4) integrin by beta(4) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased Ras activity and carcinoma invasion whereas reexpression of this integrin restored Ras activity. ErbB2, a binding partner of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EGFR modulated Ras activity, and integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulated phospho-EGFR level without affecting EGFR expression. We also found that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) is involved in ErbB2 expression. Depletion of beta(4) by shRNA reduced ErbB2 protein level without affecting ErbB2 mRNA level and reexpression of beta(4) increased ErbB2 protein level. Reduction of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, a rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, decreased ErbB2 protein level, and beta(4) shRNA cells exhibited a shift in ErbB2 mRNA to light polysomes compared with control cells. These results show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 through translational control. In summary, we propose a novel mechanism for ErbB2 up-regulation and Ras activation in serum-depleted breast cancer cells; integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates the expression of ErbB2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of Ras. These findings provide a mechanism that substantiates the reported role of alpha(6)beta(4) in carcinoma invasion.",

Structural dysfunction of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR is associated with the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with NSCLC. The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene, mainly substitution T790M in exon 20. Through intense research a few different mechanisms of resistance to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified: amplification of MET or IGF-1R genes, abnormalities of PTEN and mTOR proteins as well as rare mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes. Extensively investigated new drugs could be of significant efficiency in NSCLC patients with secondary resistance to reversible EGFR TKI. ",

In addition, we have recently proposed a further categorization into 5 subgroups: the first 3 categories encompass solid lesions and include (i) solid cohesive carcinomas, (ii) alveolar carcinomas, and (iii) small cell carcinoma; the last subgroups include mucin-producing tumors which are (iv) solid papillary carcinomas and (v) cellular mucinous carcinomas. Chromogranin A and synaptophysin have been considered as the most sensitive and specific neuroendocrine markers in NEBC. At the molecular level, recent gene expression profiling studies have shown that NEBCs pertain to the luminal molecular type, being positive for hormone receptors and negative for HER2. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that mucinous and neuroendocrine carcinomas are transcriptionally distinct from conventional invasive ductal carcinomas. Following the above criteria, NEBCs constitute approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas.

Thus, ErbB2 is an important target for cancer therapies. Increased ErbB2 expression has been associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and caspase 3/7 activity were measured as the markers of apoptosis. The relative expressions of NF-kB-p50 and Survivin mRNAs were evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our results show that Herceptin treatment inhibits cell proliferation and activates apoptosis but without effects on Survivin and NF-kB expression in Calu-3 cell line. Intracellular glutathione levels and SOD and CAT activities were decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner associated with oxidative stress. Also, ROS were increased at 24 h.

However, to develop CTL-based immunotherapies for the general population, it is necessary to identify epitopes restricted by other common histocompatibility alleles. Here, we describe two HLA-A3-restricted CTL epitopes from the CEA and HER-2/neu antigens. HLA-A3 binding synthetic peptides from CEA and HER-2/neu were tested for immunogenicity by in vitro primary CTL induction protocol using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal healthy volunteers. One peptide from CEA (CEA[9(61)]: HLFGYSWYK) and one peptide from HER-2/neu (HER2[9(754)]: VLRENTSPK) were shown to induce CTL that was capable of killing a tumor cell line expressing HLA-A3 and the corresponding tumor-associated antigen. Additional MHC binding studies with the most common HLA molecules belonging to the HLA-A3 superfamily (HLA-A*1101, -A*3101, -A*3301, and -A*6801), demonstrated that CEA[9(61)] binds five of five A3 supertype molecules with high affinity, and the HER2[9(754)] epitope was able to bind to four of the same five alleles.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

Ultimately, however, patients fatally relapse. In this review we will focus on the search to improve survival for NSCLC patients deemed to be pan-negative for the common driver alterations susceptible to targeted therapy, above all those with EGFR mutations or ALK, ROS or RET translocations. Other uncommon driver mutations such as HER2 and BRAF mutations should be tested in order to rule out targeted treatment before assigning patients to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy yields short lived response with median survival still less than one year. Customized chemotherapy represents one way to attempt to prolong survival, although to date no prospective randomized customized studies have reported sufficient evidence to support this. In one attempt to demonstrate the role of tailoring chemotherapy, the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) phase II customized chemotherapy trial (NCT00883480) showed that RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, influenced outcome in patients with low BRCA1 expression treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine, and in patients with intermediate/high BRCA1 levels receiving cisplatin/docetaxel or docetaxel alone. We are currently performing a prospective, randomized phase III trial comparing non-customized cisplatin/docetaxel with customized therapy in metastatic NSCLC patients (NCT00617656/GECP-BREC) and a parallel phase II study (ChiCTR-TRC-12001860) is being carried out in China (BREC-China) under the auspices of the SLCG.

HDAC inhibitors, such as depsipeptide FR901228 (FK228), induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells by mechanisms that cannot be attributed solely to histone acetylation. This study evaluated the mechanisms by which FK228 mediates apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.;Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines that vary in the expression of the growth-regulating proteins p53, pRb, and K-Ras treated with a clinically relevant dose of FK228 (25 ng/mL). Western blot and immunoprecipitation techniques were used to analyze expression of cell-cycle proteins (cyclin A, cyclin E, p53, and p21), signaling-related proteins (ErbB1, ErbB2, and Raf-1), activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), binding of mutant p53 and Raf-1 to heat shock protein (Hsp)90, and acetylation of Hsp90.;FK228 treatment inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type or mutant p53. FK228 treatment led to altered expression of cyclin A, cyclin E, and p21, and to reduced expression of mutant, but not wild-type, p53. FK228-treated cells also were depleted of ErbB1, ErbB2, and Raf-1 proteins, and exhibited lower ERK1/2 activity. FK228 treatment also inhibited the binding of mutant p53 and Raf-1 to Hsp90; this inhibition was associated with acetylation of Hsp90.;FK228 depletes the levels of several oncoproteins that are normally stabilized by binding to Hsp90 in cancer cells. The resulting ability of FK228 to diminish signal transduction via pathways involving Raf-1 and ERK may contribute to the potency and specificity of this novel antitumor agent.",

Several studies have pointed to the macrophage as the normal partner in this fusion, suggesting that the fused cells could acquire new invasive properties and become able to disseminate to distant organs. However, this conclusion is mainly based on studies with transplantable cell lines. We tested the occurrence of cell fusion in the MMTV-neu model of mouse mammary carcinoma. In the first approach, we generated aggregation chimeras between GFP/neu and RFP/neu embryos. Tumor cells would display both fluorescent proteins only if cell fusion with normal cells occurred. In addition, if cell fusion conferred a growth/dissemination advantage, cells with both markers should be detectable in lung metastases at increased frequency. We confirmed that fused cells are present at low but consistent levels in primary neoplasms and that the macrophage is the normal partner in the fusion events. Similar results were obtained using a second approach in which bone marrow from mice carrying the Cre transgene was transplanted into MMTV-neu/LoxP-tdTomato transgenic animals, in which the Tomato gene is activated only in the presence of CRE recombinase. However, no fused cells were detected in lung metastases in either model. We conclude that fusion between macrophages and tumor cells does not confer a selective advantage in our spontaneous model of breast cancer, although these data do not rule out a possible role in models in which an inflammation environment is prominent.",

Within the first 5 months of life the tissue-specific expression of HER-2/neu causes a progression in all their 10 mammary glands from atypical hyperplasia to invasive carcinoma. It was previously observed that chronic administration of interleukin (IL)-12 increased tumor latency, but every mouse eventually succumbed to multiple carcinomas. A significant improvement in tumor prevention was sought by administering allogeneic mammary carcinoma cells expressing HER-2/neu combined with systemic IL-12. This treatment reduced tumor incidence by 90% and more than doubled mouse lifetime. For the maximum prevention p185(neu) antigen must be expressed by allogeneic cells. IL-12 treatment strongly increased the cell vaccine efficacy. The mammary glands of mice receiving the combined treatment displayed a markedly reduced epithelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and HER-2/neu expression, while the few hyperplastic foci were heavily infiltrated by granulocytes, macrophages, and CD8(+) lymphocytes. Specific anti-HER-2/neu antibodies were produced and a nonpolarized activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells secreting IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were evident. A central role for IFN-gamma in the preventive effect was proven by the lack of efficacy of vaccination in IFN-gamma gene knockout HER-2/neu transgenic Balb/c mice. A possible requirement for IFN-gamma is related to its effect on antibody production, in particular on IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses, that were not induced in IFN-gamma knockout HER-2/neu mice. In conclusion, our data show that an allogeneic HER-2/neu-expressing cell vaccine combined with IL-12 systemic treatment can prevent the onset of genetically determined tumors.",

As HER2 over-expression/amplification is a prerequisite for treatment with trastuzumab, an accurate assessment of HER-2 status is the first step for successful treatment. In metastatic breast cancer, we routinely assess HER2 expression in the primary tumour, assuming that HER2 status remains stable through cancer progression. However, it is frequent to find reports that describe discordance between HER2 expression in primary and metastatic tumours. The aim of this paper was to verify whether HER2 status of breast carcinomas is maintained in the corresponding axillary metastasis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 52 breast carcinomas and their matched axillary metastasis. HercepTest results were concordant in 46 out of 52 cases (88.5%). FISH proved that the differences observed were clinically relevant in only one of the 52 cases studied (98% concordance). We concluded that HER2 status was stable during axillary metastatic progression. Evaluation of gene HER2 status in axillary metastasis rather than in the primary can be useful in certain situations, e.g., small invasive component intimately mixed with in situ component and difficult to recognize in dark field, no tumor after biopsy, or axillary relapse (in this case we can find occasional de novo amplifications susceptible to trastuzumab treatment).",

In a previous study on HNSCC cell lines, we found that epigalocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major biologically active component of green tea, inhibited activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thereby inhibited EGFR-related downstream signaling pathways in HNSCC cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of EGCG on activation of the HER-2 receptor in human HNSCC and breast carcinoma cell lines that display constitutive activation of HER-2. Treatment of these cells with 10 or 30 microg of EGCG, respectively, doses that cause 50% inhibition of growth, markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of HER-2 in both cell lines. This was associated with inhibition of Stat3 activation, inhibition of c-fos and cyclin D1 promoter activity, and decreased cellular levels of the cyclin D1 and Bcl-XL proteins. Although these concentrations of EGCG are quite high, we found that concentrations of 0.1-1.0 microg/ml, which are in the range of plasma concentrations after administering a single oral dose of EGCG or a green tea extract, markedly enhanced the sensitivity of both types of cell lines to growth inhibition by Taxol, a drug frequently used in the treatment of breast carcinoma and HNSCC. These results, taken together with previous evidence that EGCG also inhibits activation of the EGFR in carcinoma cells, suggest that EGCG may be useful in treating cases of breast carcinoma and HNSCC in which activation of the EGFR and/or HER-2 plays important roles in tumor survival and growth.",

The present study retrospectively investigates survival in 97 patients with esophageal carcinoma in regard to their HER-2 status as examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogen in situ hybridization (CISH). Sixty-eight patients had localised disease and 29 patients had advanced disease. Seventy patients had squamous cell carcinoma, and nine of these patients (13%) had HER-2 overexpression (3+). Eight (30%) of 27 adenocarcinoma patients overexpressed (3+) HER-2. In patients overexpressing (3+) HER-2 a statistical trend towards poorer survival was observed (P = 0.057). In squamous cell carcinoma patients, HER-2 overexpression (3+) correlated with poorer survival (P = 0.035), whereas in adenocarcinoma patients, HER-2 status (3+) did not. HER-2 amplification according to CISH was present in five (two squamous cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas) out of 17 HER-2 overexpressing (3+) tumours. In conclusion, HER-2 overexpression (3+) seems to be associated with poorer survival in esophageal carcinomas, especially in patients with squamous cell esophageal carcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Over the past 30 years, a relatively simple growth factor and its cognate receptor have provided seminal insights into the understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, as well as growth factor signalling. The epidermal growth factor (EGF), its cognate receptor (EGFR) and related family members have been shown to be important in normal, as well as the malignant growth of many cell types including: glioblastomata, astrocytomas, medulloblastomata, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and breast cancer. This review summarises the history of the EGFR gene and the v-ErbB oncogene, as well as diverse approaches developed to inhibit EGFR activity. The two most advanced therapies use either small-molecule cell membrane permeable kinase inhibitors or antibodies which prevent receptor activation. Recent clinical trials indicate that certain NSCLC patients have mutations in the EGFR gene which makes them more responsive to kinase inhibitors. These mutations appear to enhance the ability of the ligand to activate EGFR activity and also prolong the binding of the EGFR inhibitor to the kinase domain. Evidence to date suggests that these EGFR mutations in NSCLC occur more frequently in Japan than in the western hemisphere. Although these mutations are correlated with enhanced efficacy to the inhibitors in NSCLC, they can not explain or predict the sensitivity of many other cancer patients to the beneficial effects of the EGFR kinase inhibitors or antibody mediated therapy. As with as other small-molecule kinase inhibitors and susceptible diseases (e.g., imatinib and chronic myeloid leukaemia), resistance to EGFR inhibitors has been reported recently, documenting the requirement for development of multi-pronged therapeutic approaches. EGFR kinase inhibitors are also being evaluated as adjuvants in hormonal therapy of breast cancer - especially those which overexpress EGFR. Genetically engineered antibodies specific for the EGFR family member ErbB2 have been developed which show efficacy in the treatment of primary, and prevent the relapse of, breast cancer. Clearly, the EGF/EGFR signalling cascade has, and continues to play, an important role in the development of novel anticancer targeted therapies.",

A novel somatic mutation (V659E) was also detected in the transmembrane domain of HER2 in one of 253 sporadic lung adenocarcinomas. Because the transmembrane domain of HER2 is considered to be responsible for the dimerization and subsequent activation of the HER family and downstream signaling pathways, we performed functional analyses of these HER2 mutants. Mutant HER2 G660D and V659E proteins were more stable than wild-type protein. Both the G660D and V659E mutants activated Akt. In addition, they activated p38, which is thought to promote cell proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma.

This manuscript comprehensively reviews the preclinical data on afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) including EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4. Afatinib covalently binds to cysteine 797 of the EGFR and the corresponding cysteines 805 and 803 in HER2 and ErbB4, respectively. Such covalent binding irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in reduced auto- and transphosphorylation within the ErbB dimers and inhibition of important steps in the signal transduction of all ErbB receptor family members. Afatinib inhibits cellular growth and induces apoptosis in a wide range of cells representative for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and several other cancer types exhibiting abnormalities of the ErbB network. This translates into tumour shrinkage in a variety of in vivo rodent models of such cancers. Afatinib retains inhibitory effects on signal transduction and in vitro and in vivo cancer cell growth in tumours resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, such as those exhibiting the T790M mutations. Several combination treatments have been explored to prevent and/or overcome development of resistance to afatinib, the most promising being those with EGFR- or HER2-targeted antibodies, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or inhibitors of downstream signalling molecules.

We have previously shown in 3 out of 4 ovarian carcinoma cell lines an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-mediated reduction in HER-2 specific protein and RNA levels. The oncogene expression was lowered only in the ovarian carcinoma cell lines but not in 3 IFN-gamma-sensitive human breast cancer cell lines. We extended our observations also to IFN type I, alpha and omega. The expression of the oncogene was measured by both the p185HER-2 ELISA and in selected cases by a living cell radioimmunoassay using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 4D5 against the extracellular domain. Both IFN types reduced the expression of HER-2 in the ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3, HTB-77, 2774 and SKOV-6, and in the SKUT-2 endometrial carcinoma cells. In contrast, SKOV-8 human ovarian carcinoma cells were sensitive for both IFN types regarding proliferation, but only IFN-gamma reduced proto-oncogene expression. In the SKBR-3 human mammary carcinoma cells, neither IFN type had an effect on HER-2 expression. The antibodies 4D5, 7C2, 3E8, and 3H4 which bind to the extracellular domain of p185HER-2 protein specifically inhibited anchorage-independent growth of SKBR-3 and HTB-77 cells.

It is depended on the type II TGFβ receptor (TβRII) for signaling. Previously, we have shown that deletion of TβRII in mammary epithelial of MMTV-PyMT mice results in shortened tumor latency and increased lung metastases. However, active TGFβ signaling increased the number of circulating tumor cells and metastases in MMTV-Neu mice. In the current study, we describe a newly discovered connection between attenuated TGFβ signaling and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling in mammary tumor progression.;All studies were performed on MMTV-Neu mice with and without dominant-negative TβRII (DNIIR) in mammary epithelium. Mammary tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. The levels of secreted proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whole-lung mount staining was used to quantitate lung metastasis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to determine the relevance of our findings to human breast cancer.;Attenuated TGFβ signaling led to a delay tumor onset, but increased the number of metastases in MMTVNeu/DNIIR mice. The DNIIR tumors were characterized by increased vasculogenesis, vessel leakage, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). During DNIIR tumor progression, both the levels of CXCL1/5 and the number of CD11b+Gr1+ cells and T cells decreased. Analysis of TCGA datasets demonstrated a significant negative correlation between TGFBR2 and VEGF genes expression. Higher VEGFA expression correlated with shorter distant metastasis-free survival only in HER2+ patients with no differences in HER2-, estrogen receptor +/- or progesterone receptor +/- breast cancer patients.;Our studies provide insights into a novel mechanism by which epithelial TGFβ signaling modulates the tumor microenvironment, and by which it is involved in lung metastasis in HER2+ breast cancer patients. The effects of pharmacological targeting of the TGFβ pathway in vivo during tumor progression remain controversial. The targeting of TGFβ signaling should be a viable option, but because VEGF has a protumorigenic effect on HER2+ tumors, the targeting of this protein could be considered when it is associated with attenuated TGFβ signaling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Identification of activating mutations in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) has been a focus in recent years. This led to successful evidence of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over the standard platinum doublet based chemotherapy as the first line treatment in the metastatic setting.The rearrangements of fusion protein EML4-ALK in NSCLC lead to the use of crizotinib for this class of tumors. Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies show that ceritinib is more effective against both crizotinib sensitive and resistant tumors. Although robust responses to crizotinib are observed in NSCLC harboring ALK mutations, majority of tumors eventually become resistant, posing a major challenge in treatment course. Thus, there is a need for the identification and development of second-generation of ALK inhibitors. Computer aided molecular docking data show Tivozanib and Lapatinib bind EML4-ALK with high score. Tivozanib is in clinical trials for renal cell cancer and Lapatinib is a known dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor effective in breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression. Additional data on these compounds for use in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC will provide evidence for use in patients treated with crizotinib. Data shows the importance of computer aided molecular docking in developing candidates with improved activity for further consideration in vitro and in vivo validation. ",

Dacomitinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER2, EGFR (HER1), and HER4 tyrosine kinases, has demonstrated activity in cell-line models with HER2 exon 20 insertions or amplifications. Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers.;As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity.;We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine.;Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions.

It is an attractive target for receptor-directed antitumor therapy using mAbs. Unlike other epidermal growth factor receptor family members, HER-2/neu does not bind a high-affinity ligand, but rather functions as the preferred dimerization partner. Pertuzumab (Omnitarg) is a humanized mAb directed against the HER-2/neu dimerization domain that inhibits receptor signaling. The recent definition of the crystal structure of the HER-2/neu-pertuzumab complex demonstrated that the receptor dimerization region encompassed residues 266-333. Based on the three-dimensional structure of the complex, we have designed three conformational peptide constructs (sequences 266-296, 298-333, and 315-333) to mimic regions of the dimerization loop of the receptor and to characterize their in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy. All the constructs elicited high-affinity peptide Abs that inhibited multiple signaling pathways including HER-2/neu-specific inhibition of cellular proliferation and cytoplasmic receptor domain phosphorylation. All the peptide Abs showed Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to varying degrees with the 266-296 constructs being equally effective as compared with Herceptin. The 266-296 peptide vaccine had statistically reduced tumor onset in both transplantable tumor models (FVB/n and BALB/c) and significant reduction in tumor development in two transgenic mouse tumor models (BALB-neuT and VEGF(+/-)Neu2-5(+/-)). The 266-296 construct represents the most promising candidate for antitumor vaccination and could also be used to treat a variety of cancers with either normal or elevated expression of HER-2 including breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between mutation status and expression of EGFR and HER2 in lung cancer. Immunostaining took place for EGFR and HER2, and mutational analyses for EGFR, HER2, and KRAS (a signaling protein) were conducted using 130 resected lung cancer specimens. Thirty-seven EGFR mutations (28%) and 8 HER2 mutations (6%), both of the TK domains, and 5 KRAS (4%) mutations were found, whereas 73 (56%) EGFR and 47 (36%) HER2 overexpressions were found. EGFR overexpression was seen more frequently in tumors with EGFR mutation (28/37, 76%) than in tumors without EGFR mutations (45/93, 48%; P = .0059). No correlation was found between HER2 mutation and HER2 expression. Multivariate regression revealed that EGFR mutation, adenocarcinoma histology, and HER2 expression were associated with EGFR expression, whereas female sex, EGFR mutation, and EGFR expression were associated with HER2 expression. In conclusion, EGFR and HER2 overexpression is frequent in lung cancer, and EGFR overexpression correlates with the EGFR TK domain mutations.",

Overexpression of Her-2/NEU is related to poor survival in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients. Accordingly, this study attempted to analyze the association between the Her-2/NEU oncogene and VEGF-C in ovarian carcinoma and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of VEGF-C induction by Her-2/NEU. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of Her-2/NEU and VEGF-C in tissues from 41 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Several Her-2/NEU-stably-transfected Caov-3 ovarian carcinoma cells were used to evaluate the effect of Her-2/NEU on VEGF-C, the possible regulation mechanism, and the biological function of VEGF-C. Our experimental results identified a significant association between the Her-2/NEU oncogene and VEGF-C expression in both epithelial ovarian cancer patients (p < 0.05; Fisher's exact test) and in vitro cell lines. The overexpression of Her-2/NEU in Caov-3 ovarian cancer cells resulted in induction of a considerable amount of VEGF-C mRNA and protein; this process was dose-dependently inhibited by herceptin. The generation of VEGF-C significantly increased endothelial permeability. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition assays revealed that the cytoplasmic signaling molecule, p38 MAPK, and the transcriptional factor, NF-kappa B, are critically involved in the transcriptional activation of the VEGF-C gene by Her-2/NEU. In conclusion, this work clearly establishes that the Her-2/NEU oncogene is essential for the regulation of VEGF-C in ovarian carcinoma. It may be possible to use the monoclonal antibody targeting Her-2/NEU receptor to limit the formation of malignant ascites and lymphatic spread in ovarian carcinoma.",

HER2 and FoxM1 expression levels were compared in breast carcinoma cell lines, paraffin-embedded breast cancer patient samples and at the mRNA level in purified breast epithelial cells. To further examine the relationship between HER2 and FoxM1 expression, we either overexpressed or siRNA-mediated depleted endogenous HER2 in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, a mammary epithelium-targeted HER2 (neu) transgenic mouse model was also used to assess the effect of HER2 on FoxM1 levels. Furthermore, the effect of the HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib on FoxM1 in HER2 positive breast cancer cells was investigated. HER2 protein levels directly correlated with FoxM1 expression in both breast carcinoma cell lines and paraffin-embedded breast cancer patient samples. Moreover, in purified breast epithelial cells, overexpression of HER2 was associated with high levels of FoxM1 mRNA, suggesting that the upregulation of FoxM1 expression is at least partially mediated transcriptionally. Furthermore, overexpression or ablation of endogenous HER2 resulted in parallel changes in FoxM1 expression. Critically, mammary epithelium-targeted HER2 mouse tumours also resulted in increased FoxM1 expression, suggesting that HER2 directed FoxM1 expression occurs in vivo and may be a critical downstream effector of HER2-targeting therapies. Indeed, treatment of breast cancer cells with lapatinib reduced FoxM1 expression at protein, mRNA and gene promoter levels. Moreover, analysis of normal and breast cancer patient samples revealed that elevated FoxM1 expression at protein and mRNA levels correlated with breast cancer development, but not significantly with cancer progression and survival.

ERBB2 amplification was identified in 9 (15%) of 61 micropapillary carcinomas compared with 9 (9%) of 100 urothelial carcinomas. In patients with micropapillary carcinoma, ERBB2 amplification was associated with a nearly threefold increased risk of cancer death. ERBB2 amplification (hazard ratio 4.3; P=0.0008) remained associated with an increased risk of death from bladder cancer among patients with micropapillary urothelial carcinoma on multivariate analysis. The association of cancer-specific survival and ERBB2 amplification was not seen in patients with urothelial carcinoma. ERBB2 immunohistochemistry correlated with ERBB2 amplification but there was no association of ERBB2 protein expression and survival. ERBB2 amplification is more frequent in micropapillary urothelial carcinoma than typical urothelial carcinoma, and patients with micropapillary carcinoma who have ERBB2 amplification have worse cancer-specific survival than those who do not. Identification of ERBB2 amplification in micropapillary carcinoma could provide important prognostic information and possibly provide a role for ERBB2 targeted therapy. ",

Metastasis to regional lymph node was most common, followed by skin and then lungs. Follow-up was available in 12 patients (5 months to 8 years) with 1 died of widespread metastases. Although EGFR overexpression was a prevalent feature in this cohort, seen in 7/11 (64%) primary tumors and 10/14 (71%) metastases; FISH for EGFR gene amplification was negative in 9 tested primary tumors and 12 metastases.

Several subtypes of common cancers have been identified based on alterations of individual cancer genes, such as HER2, EGFR, and others. However, cancer is a complex disease driven by the interaction of multiple genes, so the copy number status of individual genes is not sufficient to define cancer subtypes and predict responses to treatments. A classification based on genome-wide copy number patterns would be better suited for this purpose.;To develop a more comprehensive cancer taxonomy based on genome-wide patterns of copy number abnormalities, we designed an unsupervised classification algorithm that identifies genomic subgroups of tumors. This algorithm is based on a modified genomic Non-negative Matrix Factorization (gNMF) algorithm and includes several additional components, namely a pilot hierarchical clustering procedure to determine the number of clusters, a multiple random initiation scheme, a new stop criterion for the core gNMF, as well as a 10-fold cross-validation stability test for quality assessment.;We applied our algorithm to identify genomic subgroups of three major cancer types: non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and malignant melanoma. High-density SNP array datasets for patient tumors and established cell lines were used to define genomic subclasses of the diseases and identify cell lines representative of each genomic subtype. The algorithm was compared with several traditional clustering methods and showed improved performance. To validate our genomic taxonomy of NSCLC, we correlated the genomic classification with disease outcomes. Overall survival time and time to recurrence were shown to differ significantly between the genomic subtypes.;We developed an algorithm for cancer classification based on genome-wide patterns of copy number aberrations and demonstrated its superiority to existing clustering methods. The algorithm was applied to define genomic subgroups of three cancer types and identify cell lines representative of these subgroups.

It has been recently reported that molecular-targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are effective in patients with lung carcinoma. In efforts to improve the prognosis of patients with LCNEC, we analyzed gene expression, gene mutations and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of known molecular targets in LCNECs, and compared the expression to that of lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Thirteen patients with primary LCNEC and 14 patients with AC were analyzed. We evaluated IHC expression for c-KIT, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gene mutations for EGFR, K-ras and c-kit, and gene expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR. In cases with LCNEC, the IHC expression of c-KIT, HER2 and VEGF was 76.9, 30.8 and 100%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the IHC expression of c-KIT and HER2 between the LCNEC and AC cases. Two cases of LCNEC had overexpression of HER2, and the frequency of EGFR gene mutations was higher in the the AC group, with only a single EGFR mutation (exon 18) identified in the LCNEC group. Although LCNEC had a higher rate of expression of c-KIT by IHC, no c-kit gene mutations were found. These findings suggest a potential role for anti-VEGF-, anti-c-KIT- and possibly anti-HER2-targeted agents in the treatment of LCNEC.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive role of IGF-1R expression in the response to EGFR-TKIs of NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations.;We retrospectively studied 62 NSCLC patients who had activating EGFR mutations and received TKIs. Protein expression of IGF-1R, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were measured by immunohistochemical staining. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictive factors associated with the responses to EGFR-TKIs. The relationship of progression-free survival (PFS) with IGF-1R expression and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined.;Of 62 EGFR mutation positive patients, 26 expressed IGF-1R, and 13 had DM. In the multivariate analysis, young age, squamous cell carcinoma, and IGF-1R expression were independently associated with a shorter PFS after treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Patients expressing IGF-1R showed a significantly shorter PFS in response to EGFR-TKIs compared with those lacking IGF-1R expression (9.1 vs. 20.1 months, p=0.005). The 13 patients with DM were more likely to express IGF-1R (p=0.001) and had shorter PFS times when treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs (7.6 vs. 18.6 months, p=0.005), compared with those without DM.;IGF-1R expression was a negative predictive factor for a response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations. Moreover, patients with DM highly expressed IGF-1R in tumor tissues, which was associated with a poor response to first-line TKI therapy. Further studies aimed at overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance will need to also address IGF-1R pathways.",

Preclinical data suggested that anti-VEGF-A therapy may prevent the formation of nsNSCLC brain metastases. Whether non-brain metastases are also prevented, and whether bevacizumab shows a brain metastases-preventive activity in cancer patients is unknown. Data of one nsNSCLC (stage IIIB/IV, AVAiL) and two breast cancer bevacizumab trials (HER2 negative, AVADO; HER2 positive, AVEREL) were retrospectively analyzed regarding the frequency of the brain versus other organs being the site of first relapse. For animal studies, the outgrowth of PC14-PE6 lung adenocarcinoma cells to brain macrometastases in mice was measured by intravital imaging: under control IgG (25 mg/kg) treatment, or varying doses of bevacizumab (25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg). Brain metastases as site of first relapse were significantly less frequent in the bevacizumab arm of the AVAiL trial (HR = 0.36, P < 0.001). In AVADO and AVEREL, no significant difference was seen. In mice, bevacizumab treatment led to secondary regressions of non-brain macrometastases, but did not reduce their total incidence, and did not improve survival. In a brain-seeking nsNSCLC metastasis model, treatment with bevacizumab inhibited brain metastases formation, which resulted in improved overall survival. In summary, bevacizumab has the potential to prevent brain metastases in nsNSCLC, but no preventive activity could be detected outside the brain. These data indicate that anti-VEGF-A agents might be particularly relevant for those stage III nsNSCLC patients who are at high risk to develop future brain metastases.

The prognostic significance, however, remains somewhat controversial, partly because of discrepancies among different methodologies used for detection of the oncogene amplification or overexpression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has recently been shown to be a useful technique for analyzing genetic alterations in interphase nuclei in various tumors. In this study, FISH was used to quantitate HER-2/ neu and c-myc gene amplification in touch preparations of frozen tissue from 100 node-negative breast carcinomas. HER-2/neu amplification was found to be associated with an abnormal DNA index (P < .001) and tumor size (P < .04). Amplification of c-myc was associated with S phase (P < .0003), abnormal DNA index (P < .003), and a negative estrogen receptor status (P < .01). The coamplification of both oncogenes was strongly associated with an abnormal DNA index (P < .0001) and with tumor size (P < .009). The use of FISH for detection of HER-2/neu gene amplification was 92% concordant with immunocytochemistry (ICC) used for detection of overexpression of HER-2/neu protein. Fifteen of the 100 cases were both amplified for HER-2/neu by FISH and positive by ICC analysis. Seven cases without HER-2/neu gene amplification demonstrated HER-2/neu protein overexpression by ICC. One HER-2/neu-amplified case was negative by ICC. Repeat analysis of a subset of cases showed FISH to be a more reproducible method than ICC in the analysis of HER-2/neu in touch preparations of breast carcinoma. FISH is a rapid and reproducible method that allows the accurate measurement of the level of oncogene amplification within interphase nuclei. The use of FISH should provide a more accurate assessment of the prognostic significance of oncogene amplification in breast carcinoma.",

All double scoring negative cases were non-amplified (100% sensitivity), whereas all cases scored 6+ were amplified.

Basal carcinomas are generally oestrogen receptor (ER)-progesterone receptor (PR)-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, and cytokeratin (CK)5/6+. This profile overlaps with that of mesothelial cells. This study of high-grade breast carcinomas was undertaken to determine the expression of mesothelial markers.;Immunohistochemistry was performed on 23 basal-like breast carcinomas and 30 high-grade breast carcinomas with variable ER, PR and HER2 expression. The incidence of staining of CK5/6, CK14, calretinin, Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1), thrombomodulin and epithelial membrane antigen was assessed statistically. CK14 staining was more specifically associated with triple-negative tumours than CK5/6. Calretinin positivity was statistically associated with basal-like carcinomas. WT1 and thrombomodulin expression was infrequent and limited to a small number of non-basal carcinomas.;There is an overlap between the immunophenotype of mesothelial cells and that of basal-like carcinomas of breast. Positive calretinin and CK5/6 are not specific, and may be seen in both mesothelial cells and basal-like breast carcinomas. Negative ER and PR of basal carcinomas may also bias the observer against a breast origin. However, other negative mesothelial markers, such as WT1 and thrombomodulin, may help point to the correct diagnosis.",

Aberrant EGFR signaling is correlated with progression of various malignancies, and somatic tyrosine kinase domain mutations in the EGFR gene have been discovered in patients with non-small cell lung cancer responding to EGFR-targeting small molecular agents, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. EGFR overexpression is thought to be the principal mechanism of activation in various malignant tumors. Moreover, an increased EGFR copy number is associated with improved survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients, suggesting that increased expression of mutant and/or wild-type EGFR molecules could be molecular determinants of responses to gefitinib. However, as EGFR mutations and/or gene gains are not observed in all patients who respond partially to treatment, alternative mechanisms might confer sensitivity to EGFR-targeting agents. Preclinical studies showed that sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors depends on how closely cell survival and growth signalings are coupled with EGFR, and also with HER2 and HER3, in each cancer. This review also describes a possible association between EGFR phosphorylation and drug sensitivity in cancer cells, as well as discussing the antiangiogenic effect of gefitinib in association with EGFR activation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation in vascular endothelial cells.",

However, a frequently observed in-frame mutation that inserts amino acid quadruplex Tyr776-Val777-Met778-Ala779 at G776 (G776(YVMA)) in HER2 kinase domain can cause drug resistance and sensitivity, largely limiting the application of reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. A systematic investigation of the intermolecular interactions between the HER2(YVMA) mutant and clinical small-molecule inhibitors would help to establish a complete picture of drug response to HER2 G776(YVMA) insertion in lung cancer, and to design new tyrosine kinase inhibitors with high potency and selectivity to target the lung cancer-related HER2(YVMA) mutant. Here, we combined homology modeling, ligand grafting, structure minimization, molecular simulation and binding affinity analysis to profile a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against the G776(YVMA) insertion in HER2. It is found that the insertion is far away from HER2 active pocket and thus cannot contact inhibitor ligand directly. However, the insertion is expected to induce marked allosteric effect on some regions around the pocket, including A-loop and hinges connecting between the N- and C-lobes of HER2 kinase domain, which may exert indirect influence to inhibitor binding. Most investigated inhibitors exhibit weak binding strength to both wild-type and mutant HER2, which can be attributed to steric hindrance that impairs ligand compatibility with HER2 active pocket. However, the cognate inhibitor lapatinib and the non-cognate inhibitor bosutinib were predicted to have low affinity for wild-type HER2 but high affinity for HER2(YVMA) mutant, which was confirmed by subsequent kinase assay experiments; the inhibitory potencies of bosutinib against wild-type and mutant HER2 were determined to be IC(50) > 1000 and =27 nM, respectively, suggesting that the bosutinib might be exploited as a selective inhibitor for mutant over wild-type HER2. Structural examination revealed that formation of additional non-bonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with HER2 A-loop region due to G776(YVMA) insertion is the primary factor to improve bosutinib affinity upon the mutation.",

Patients with HER-2/neu protein-overexpressing breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung, colon, and prostate cancers have been shown to have a pre-existent immune response to HER-2/neu. No matter what the tumor type, endogenous immunity to HER-2/neu detected in cancer patients demonstrates two predominant characteristics. First, HER-2/neu-specific immune responses are found in only a minority of patients whose tumors overexpress HER-2/neu. Secondly, immunity, if detectable, is of low magnitude. These observations have led to the development of vaccine strategies designed to boost HER-2/neu immunity in a majority of patients. HER-2/neu is a non-mutated self-protein, therefore vaccines must be developed based on immunologic principles focused on circumventing tolerance, a primary mechanism of tumor immune escape. HER-2/neu-specific vaccines have been tested in human clinical trials. Early results demonstrate that significant levels of HER-2/neu immunity can be generated with active immunization. The T-cell immunity elicited is durable after vaccinations have ended. Furthermore, despite the generation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells responsive to HER-2/neu in a majority of patients, there is no evidence of autoimmunity directed against tissues that express basal levels of the protein. Cancer vaccines targeting the HER-2/neu oncogenic protein may be useful adjuvants to standard therapy and aid in the prevention of relapse in patients whose tumors overexpress the protein. Furthermore, boosting HER-2/neu-specific T-cell frequencies via active immunization may allow the ex vivo expansion of HER-2/neu-specific T-cells for use in adoptive immunotherapy, a therapeutic strategy directed against the treatment of established disease.",

Emerging protein kinase inhibitors may enhance our ability to effectively treat these and other genomic subtypes of NSCLC.;This article reviews the next-generation kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC. In addition, targeted kinase inhibitors in clinical development for other specific molecular subtypes of NSCLC are covered, including ROS1, BRAF, RET, HER2, KRAS (upstream of the MEK kinase), MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, DDR2, VEGFR and AAK.;In EGFR-mutant NSCLC, there are several kinase inhibitors with promising activity, most notably dacomitinib and CO-1686 in tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. Next-generation ALK inhibitors appear to have greater potency than crizotinib and several ongoing trials may shed light on their role in both ALK- and ROS1-positive NSCLC. While there is optimism regarding the role of kinase inhibitors in other molecular subtypes, the available evidence is too immature to make recommendations and results from prospective trials are needed.",

Topoisomerase 2 Alpha (TOP2A) which is located nearby the HER-2/neu gene is an important molecular target for several anti cancer drugs. The frequency of TOP2A amplification in urinary bladder cancer is unknown. It was the aim of this study to determine the frequency of HER-2 and TOP2A amplification in urinary bladder cancer and to evaluate the association of these amplifications with tumor phenotype. For this purpose a tissue microarray containing 768 pTa, 425 pT1 and 571 pT2-4 carcinomas was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Amplifications of both genes were significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and high grade. HER-2 amplification was found in 1.6% of pTa, 7.2% of pT1 and 13.8% of pT2-4 carcinomas (p < 0.0001). HER-2 amplification was present in only 1.1% of grade 1 and 0.8% of grade 2 tumors but in 14.2% of grade 3 tumors (p < 0.0001). TOP2A amplification was present in 0.7% pTa, 1.8% pT1 and 3.4% pT2-4 carcinomas (p < 0.0001). TOP2A was found in none of the grade 1, in 0.2% of grade 2 and 3.8% of grade 3 tumors (p < 0.0001). 1% of all analyzed tumors had simultaneously high level amplification of TOP2A and HER-2. Amplification of both genes were significantly associated with tumor specific survival if all tumors were analyzed together. Given the high frequency of HER-2 amplification in urinary bladder cancer, some of these tumors may respond favorable to Herceptin therapy. The TOP2A amplification status may influence response to anthracyclin treatment.",

It is well known that ErbB2 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) plays an important part in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ErbB2 action needs to be well studied. In this report, we discovered that the decreased expression levels of miR-34a were inversely correlated with the increased ErbB2 levels in breast cancer. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between ErbB2 and miR-34a. Over-expression of miR-34a reduces ErbB2 expression and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion and growth in vitro. What's more, reduced expression of ErbB2 inhibits breast Cancer cell proliferation and re-expression of ErbB2 reversed miR-34a-dependent tumor suppression. Meanwhile, miR-34a levels were correlated inversely with breast cancer malignancy. Our study demonstrates that miR-34a, like ErbB2, might be a diagnostic target in breast cancer.",

In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance. In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a novel compound, PF00299804, an irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor. The results from these studies show that PF00299804 is a potent inhibitor of EGFR-activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M resistance mutation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, PF00299804 is a highly effective inhibitor of both the wild-type ERBB2 and the gefitinib-resistant oncogenic ERBB2 mutation identified in lung cancers.

Immunoprevention of viral tumors is already implemented at the population level for human hepatocellular and cervical carcinomas. Altogether, viral vaccines could prevent more than 10% of all human tumors. The big question is whether immunoprevention can be applied to nonviral tumors, including breast cancer. Promising results were obtained in preclinical models, in particular in HER-2/neu transgenic mice, which are prone to mammary carcinoma development, using vaccines against HER-2/neu oncoprotein p185. The life expectancy of vaccinated mice was more than doubled. Protective immune mechanisms elicited by effective vaccines were mainly based on helper T cell cytokines, in particular γ-interferon, and anti-p185 antibodies. The term \"oncoantigens\" was coined to define those antigenic molecules that, like HER-2, are indispensable for tumor growth, thus representing the best class of targets for cancer immunoprevention. The study of immunopreventive vaccines against subsequent phases of neoplastic progression showed a dramatic loss of efficacy against established mammary carcinomas, whereas the prevention of micrometastasis growth was successful.

Clinical trials established that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors produced objective responses in a minority of NSCLC patients. We examined the sensitivity of 23 NSCLC lines with wild-type or mutated EGFR to gefitinib to determine genes/proteins related to sensitivity, including EGFR and HER2 cell surface expression, phosphorylated EGFR expression, EGFR gene copy number, and EGFR mutational status. Downstream cell cycle and signaling events were compared with growth-inhibitory effects.;We determined gefitinib sensitivity by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, EGFR expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunohistochemistry, phosphorylated EGFR by Western blotting, EGFR gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and EGFR mutation by sequencing. The cellular effects of gefitinib on cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry and the molecular effects of gefitinib EGFR inhibition on downstream signal proteins by Western blotting. Gefitinib in vivo effects were evaluated in athymic nude mice bearing sensitive and resistant NSCLC xenografts.;There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity. EGFR protein was necessary but not sufficient for predicting sensitivity. Gefitinib-sensitive lines showed a G(1) cell cycle arrest and inactivation of downstream signaling proteins; resistant cell lines had no changes. The in vivo effects mirrored the in vitro effects.;This panel of NSCLC lines characterized for gefitinib response was used to identify predictive molecular markers of response to gefitinib.

Their specific activating ligands are collectively known as neuregulins (NRG). We hypothesized that one member of the NRG family, NRG-1, and the HER family would play a role in fetal lung development. To test this hypothesis, we defined NRG-1 and HER gene expression in mid-trimester human fetal lung tissue. HER2 and HER3 messenger RNA and protein were detected in the fetal lung, but HER4 expression was not detected. Immunohistochemical staining of fetal lung tissue localized HER2 and HER3 protein to the developing lung epithelium. NRG-1 expression was not found in freshly isolated human fetal lung, but it was observed in fetal lung explants after 2 d of explant culture. Immunohistochemistry of cultured human fetal lung explants revealed that NRG-1 protein was also expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells. Exposing human fetal lung to recombinant NRG-1 activated the HER receptor complex as measured by approximately 4-fold increases in receptor phosphotyrosine content. In addition, NRG-1 increased explant epithelial cell volume density approximately 2-fold (P < 0. 03); increased epithelial cell proliferation approximately 2-fold, as determined by bromodeoxyuridine labeling (P = 0.002); and reduced surfactant protein-A (SP-A) levels by 53% (P < 0.05). These data are consistent with an autocrine regulatory process mediated by NRG-1 activation of HER2/HER3 heterodimers expressed on developing human fetal lung epithelial cells. Receptor activation results in increased lung epithelial cell proliferation and volume density, and decreased SP-A production, a marker of type II pneumocyte differentiation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Several studies have suggested that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumors have neuroendocrine (NE) features may be more responsive to chemotherapy. In addition, increased expression of p53 and HER2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B performed a series of studies involving sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. The objectives of this study were to analyze pathological specimens using immunohistochemistry for NE markers, p53 and HER2 to determine if there was a correlation between marker expression and response or survival. Of 160 eligible patients, 28 (18%) were not evaluable because of inadequate material. The percentage of specimens positive for markers was as follows: neuron-specific enolase 38%, Leu-7 2%, chromogranin A 0%, synaptophysin 5%, > or =2+NE markers 3%, p53 61%, and HER2 65%. There was no statistically significant correlation between any individual marker and response to induction chemotherapy or response to combined chemotherapy/radiation except for synaptophysin. Six of 6 (100%) synaptophysin positive tumors responded by the completion of all therapy compared with 69/125 (55%) synaptophysin negative tumors (P=0.04). None of the individual markers had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis. Neuron-specific enolase was marginally significant in multivariate analysis (P=0.08). In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate that expression of NE markers, p53 and HER2 were predictive of response to chemotherapy, combined chemotherapy/radiation or for survival in this group of patients with stage III NSCLC. Future studies must employ either different markers or be performed on more adequate surgical specimens.",

Trastuzumab, in vitro, has demonstrated growth-inhibiting synergy with platinating agents, and additivity with paclitaxel. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group therefore launched a phase II study evaluating combination carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.;Eligibility stipulated the following: measurable tumor, HER-2/neu positivity (1+ to 3+ by Herceptest [Dako Corp, Carpinteria, CA], confirmed by central review), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0 to 1, adequate marrow, hepatic and renal function, and left ventricular ejection fraction >or= 45%. Patients received paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2)/3 hours, and carboplatin (area under the curve, 6) every 3 weeks, and trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, then 2 mg/kg weekly for <or= 1 year.;Between August 1999 and May 2000, 139 patients were screened; seven specimens (5%) were indeterminate. Fifty patients (36%) were HER-2/neu negative, 38 (27%) were HER-2/neu 1+, 31 (22%) were 2+, and 13 (9%) were 3+. Fifty-six patients were enrolled; 53 were eligible (22 [42%] were 1+, 23 (43%) were 2+, and eight (15%) were 3+). Thirteen (24.5%) of 52 assessable patients (95% CI, 13.8 to 38.3) responded. The incidence of grade >or= 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 57% (34%) and 16% (2%), respectively. Asymptomatic grade <or= 2 reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in 7%. Other nonhematologic toxicities, including nausea, fatigue, arthralgias, and peripheral sensory neuropathy, were mild to moderate and matched those expected with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. Eighteen patients (35%) received maintenance trastuzumab. Median progression-free survival was 3.3 months; median survival was 10.1 months, and 1-year survival rate was 42%.;Combination paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab is feasible. Toxicity appears no worse than cytotoxic therapy alone. Overall survival is similar to historical data using carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.

Overexpression of HER2 was reported in several human adenocarcinomas, including mammary and ovarian carcinomas. A family of glycoproteins, the heregulin/neu differentiation factors, was characterized and implicated as the ligands for HER2. Recently, it has been shown that HER2 alone is not sufficient to reconstitute high affinity heregulin receptors and that HER3 or HER4 may be the required components of the heregulin receptors on mammary carcinoma cells (Sliwkowski, M.X., Schaefer, G., Akita, R.W., Lofgren, J.A., Fitzpatrick, V.D., Nuijens, A., Fendly, B.M., Cerione, R.A., Vandlen, R.L., and Carraway, K.L., III (1994) J.

Using the Cytosensor to measure the extracellular acidification rate, we have examined the effects of recombinant human heregulin-alpha on three mammary carcinoma cell lines expressing HER2 (MDA-MB-453, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7), an ovarian carcinoma cell line expressing HER2 (SK-OV-3), and CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells stably transfected with HER2. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, we found that the breast cells also express HER3 and that the ovarian line co-expresses the HER4 message. A dramatic increase in the acidification rate was observed for the mammary carcinoma cells co-expressing high levels of HER2 and HER3. In contrast, the ovarian cells expressing high levels of HER2 and low levels of HER4 or CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells expressing HER2 alone were not responsive to heregulin. When these same transfected cells were exposed to monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody followed by anti-IgG to cause aggregation of the HER2 molecules, an increase in the acidification rate was observed, indicating coupling of transfected HER2 to the signal transduction pathway. Transfection of HER2 into MCF-7 cells, on the other hand, gave 4-fold enhanced acidification responses. These data, together with the previously reported high affinity heregulin binding and activation of tyrosine phosphorylation in HER2 and HER3 co-transfected cells support the role of HER2 and HER3 as components of the heregulin receptor in breast cells.",

Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib). Evolving genomic events in which TKI responses have been reported in smaller series include MET exon 14 skipping mutations (2-4% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); high-level MET amplification (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); RET rearrangements (1% of tumors, drug: cabozantinib); and ERBB2 mutations (2-3% of tumors, drug: afatinib), among others. Unfortunately, the most common genomic event in NSCLC, KRAS mutations (25-30% of tumors), is not targetable with approved or in development small molecule inhibitors. Here, we review currently approved, emerging, and evolving systemic precision therapies matched with their driver oncogenes for the management of advanced NSCLC. ",

Although broad expression of Id1 has recently been documented in tumors of the rare metaplastic subtype, here we report that rare Id1-expressing cells are also present in the more common TN subset of human breast tumors but not in other subtypes. We also provide evidence that Id1 expression is enriched in clinically obtained hormone receptor negative lung metastases. Functional studies demonstrate that Id1 and its closely related family member Id3 are required for tumor initiating functions, both in the context of primary tumor formation and during metastatic colonization of the lung microenvironment. In vivo characterization of lung metastatic progression reveals that Id1 and Id3 facilitate sustained proliferation during the early stages of metastatic colonization, subsequent to extravasation into the lung parenchyma. These results shed light on the proliferative mechanisms that initiate metastatic colonization, and they implicate Id1 and Id3 as mediators of this malignant function in the TN subgroup of breast cancers.",

The patients received erlotinib (days -8 to -1), then combination therapy (21-day cycles for 6 cycles). Pertuzumab was given intravenous at 840 mg, then 420 mg once every three weeks, with erlotinib given daily (100 or 150 mg).;No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2 and manageable. The objective response rate was 20% (3/15 patients; 2 responders had mutant HER1, 1 responder had wild-type HER1), median overall progression-free survival was 9.3 weeks. High HER1, HER2, and HER3 messenger RNA expression correlated with increased progression-free survival. Combination therapy did not affect erlotinib's pharmacokinetics; however, pertuzumab mean exposures (maximum concentration, 231 mg/L; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, 1780 mg*d/L) were slightly higher than in previous studies.;Combination therapy was well tolerated in patients with good performance status, with encouraging efficacy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastasis and drug resistance are the major causes of mortality in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including AXL, are involved in the progression of NSCLC. The AXL/MER/SKY subfamily is involved in cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis, and signal transduction and may play a significant role in the invasiveness of cancer cells. Notably, no specific inhibitors of AXL have been described. A series of CL1 sublines with progressive invasiveness established from a patient with NSCLC has been identified that positively correlates with AXL expression and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The ectopic overexpression of AXL results in elevated cell invasiveness and drug resistance. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling activity is associated with AXL expression and may play an important role in the enhancement of invasiveness and doxorubicin resistance, as shown by using the NF-kappaB inhibitor, sulfasalazine, and IkappaB dominant-negative transfectants. In the current study, sulfasalazine exerted a synergistic anticancer effect with doxorubicin and suppressed cancer cell invasiveness in parallel in CL1 sublines and various AXL-expressing cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation of AXL and other RTKs (ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor receptor) was abolished by sulfasalazine within 15 min, suggesting that the inhibition of NF-kappaB and the kinase activity of RTKs are involved in the pharmacologic effects of sulfasalazine. Our study suggests that AXL is involved in NSCLC metastasis and drug resistance and may therefore provide a molecular basis for RTK-targeted therapy using sulfasalazine to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in NSCLC.",

Some recurrent tumors have a common secondary mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, T790M, conferring drug resistance, but in other cases the mechanism underlying acquired resistance is unknown. In studying multiple sites of recurrent NSCLCs, we detected T790M in only a small percentage of tumor cells. To identify additional mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib, we used NSCLC cells harboring an activating EGFR mutation to generate multiple resistant clones in vitro. These drug-resistant cells demonstrate continued dependence on EGFR and ERBB2 signaling for their viability and have not acquired secondary EGFR mutations. However, they display increased internalization of ligand-activated EGFR, consistent with altered receptor trafficking. Although gefitinib-resistant clones are cross-resistant to related anilinoquinazolines, they demonstrate sensitivity to a class of irreversible inhibitors of EGFR. These inhibitors also show effective inhibition of signaling by T790M-mutant EGFR and killing of NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation. Both mechanisms of gefitinib resistance are therefore circumvented by irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our findings suggest that one of these, HKI-272, may prove highly effective in the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs, including tumors that have become resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Current treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, provide only limited improvement in the natural course of this disease. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies is highly awaited. This review focuses on recent achievements on a novel class of anticancer drugs targeting the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). The EGFR family is a group of four structurally similar growth factor receptors with tyrosine-kinase activity (EGFR, HER2/neu, ErbB-3, ErbB-4), which dimerize upon binding with a number of ligands, including EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and TGF (Transforming Growth Factor), allowing downstream transduction of mitogenic signals. Overexpression of EGFR and HER2 is frequently found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for over 80% of all malignant lung tumors, and has been associated with a worse clinical outcome. New agents developed to inhibit EGFR function include monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. In this review, results of most recent clinical with EGFR inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), IMC-C225 (Cetuximab) and others (ABX-EGF, EMD 72000), and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, such as ZD1839 (Gefitinib, Iressa), OSI-774 (Erlotinib, Tarceva) and others (CI-1033, GW2016), are summarized. In particular, final results of phase II (IDEAL 1 and 2) and III (INTACT 1 and 2) studies of ZD1839 are reported. In IDEAL trials (ZD1839 single agent in patients pre-treated with chemotherapy) there was clear evidence of tumor regression, symptoms improvement and overall clinical benefit, whereas in the two INTACT trials (ZD1839 in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in chemo-naive patients) ZD1839 did not improve either survival or other clinical endpoints. Possible explanations for these contradictory results and future perspectives are discussed.",

The mechanisms of action of trastuzumab involve several pathways including Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Because human γδ T lymphocytes mediate Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and can be activated further by phosphoantigens, these cells are prone to improve the efficacy of Abs, as recently demonstrated for CD20(+) B cell lymphomas. Whether this concept applies as well with carcinomas remained to be demonstrated in vivo, however. In this study, we asked whether a combination of trastuzumab and phosphoantigen-stimulated γδ lymphocytes increases the efficacy of trastuzumab against HER-2(+) breast carcinoma cell lines in vivo. We report that repeated infusions of this combination had a better efficacy than that of trastuzumab alone against HER-2(+) mammary carcinoma xenografts in mice. In these models, reduction of tumor growth was observed together with trastuzumab opsonization of HER-2(+) cells and tumor infiltration by γδ lymphocytes. In addition in humans, the mammary carcinomas of 27 of 30 patients showed significant γδ T cell infiltrates. Altogether, these findings indicate that combination of trastuzumab and stimulated γδ cells represents a new strategy to improve the efficacy of Herceptin (trastuzumab) in HER-2(+) breast cancer.",

Blocking HER2-mediated signaling with antibodies or small molecules has been shown to be effective in inhibiting cell growth. After analyzing the crystal structure of the HER2-herceptin complex, several peptidomimetics (HERP5, 6, and 7) were designed to inhibit HER2-mediated signaling for cell growth. We have used an in silico screening method to investigate the chemical diversity of the designed compounds. autodock software was used to dock the different analogs of HERP5 and HERP7 with HER2 protein extracellular domain. A total of 53 compounds were docked to HER2 protein, and their binding modes were analyzed in terms of docking energy, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Compounds that exhibited low-energy docked structures were chosen for chemical synthesis and biological activity. Two of the compounds (HERP5 and HERP7) exhibited antiproliferative activity, with IC(50) values of 0.396 microm and 0.143 microm, respectively, against SKBR-3 cell lines (breast cancer cell lines) that overexpress HER2 protein.",

The stimulation of PKCalpha up-regulated HER2 expression, whereas PKCalpha inhibition by pharmacologic treatments and PKCalpha-specific small interfering RNA led to a dramatic down-regulation of HER2 levels only in breast cancer cells HER2 2+. Consistent with the in vitro data, our biochemical analysis of HER2 2+ human primary breast specimens revealed significantly higher levels of phosphorylated PKCalpha compared with HER2-negative tumors. Inhibition of HER2 activation by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib led to decreased levels of PKCalpha phosphorylation, clearly indicating a cross-talk between PKCalpha and HER2 molecules. These data suggest that HER2 overexpression in HER2 2+ carcinomas is due to an accumulation of the recycled oncoprotein to the cell surface induced by activated PKCalpha.",

Fifty-five percent (18/33) of DCIS and 10% (2/21) of ADH were positive. Significant c-erbB-2 expression in DCIS was generally divided on histologic grounds: ten of ten comedocarcinomas showed strong membrane staining, while only one of 14 small cell DCIS cases (micropapillary or cribiform patterns) showed immunostaining (which was weak and basilar in this single case). DCIS cases of mixed histology were strongly positive in areas of comedocarcinoma. In two of three cases of associated Paget's disease strong membrane staining was seen. The two c-erbB-2-positive ADH cases showed weak basilar staining akin to the small cell DCIS cases. Five cases of lobular neoplasia (atypical lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ) associated with DCIS or ADH were negative for c-erbB-2 expression. We conclude that comedocarcinoma in situ and Paget's disease frequently express the c-erbB-2 protein and are both histologically and biochemically distinct from ADH and small cell patterns of DCIS.

Detailed analysis of tumor progression indicates that transition from lobular hyperplasia to overt carcinoma is associated with a high epithelial proliferation rate, as assessed by anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining, and coincides with the activation and maximal extension of tumor angiogenic process as assessed by microvessel count (anti-CD31), anti-beta3 integrin, and anti-laminin immunostaining. Neovascularization is accompanied by vascular endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor production by hyperplastic epithelial cells. By contrast with the BALB-NeuT tumors, E-cadherin expression is almost nonexistent in those arising in FVB-NeuN mice and this may explain their high metastatic potential.

Recent evidence suggests that type I receptor signaling may be mediated by the CD44 family of transmembrane glycoproteins that also have been implicated in mammary tumor progression. Here, the authors tested whether CD44, EGFR, and erbB2 interacted and colocalized with one another in four mammary carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-436) and in cytology samples obtained from patients with metastatic breast cancer. CD44 constitutively colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with erbB2 and EGFR in all four mammary carcinoma cell lines. CD44 also colocalized with erbB2 and EGFR in all cytology samples expressing erbB2. CD44 colocalized with EGFR in cells from only 1 of 16 erbB2-negative cytology samples. These data indicate that CD44-EGFR-erbB2 protein complexes occur in a high proportion of metastatic mammary carcinomas and suggest that CD44-type I receptor colocalization may be a novel prognostic marker for aggressive mammary cancers.",

In this era of personalized therapy, there is a critical need to uncover the signaling architecture of brain metastases; however, little is known about what signaling pathways are activated in the context of the brain microenvironment. Using a unique study set of 42 brain metastases from patients with breast or nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the phosphorylation/activation states of 128 key signaling proteins involved in cancer signaling were measured in laser capture microdissected tumor epithelium using reverse phase protein microarray (RPMA) technology. Distinct pathway activation subgroups from both breast and lung metastases were underpinned by, among others, ERBB2, AKT, mTOR, EGFR, SMAD, and ERK-p38 signaling. Breast cancer metastases showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher activation of the c-ERBB2/IGFR-AKT pathway network compared to NSCLC metastases, whereas NSCLC metastases to the brain exhibited higher relative levels of many members of the EGFR-ERK signaling network. Protein pathway activation mapping using RPMA revealed both the heterogeneity of signaling networks in brain metastases that would require a prior stratification to targeted therapies as well as the requirement of direct analysis of the metastatic lesion.",

In previous work, we showed that the adenovirus type 5 E1A can repress HER-2/neu expression at the transcriptional level. Here we first demonstrated that paclitaxel sensitivity correlates with HER-2/neu expression level in a panel of mouse fibroblasts expressing different levels of HER-2/ neu, and that downregulation of HER-2/neu expression by E1A sensitizes the cells to paclitaxel. To further test whether E1A can sensitize HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cells to paclitaxel through E1A-mediated HER-2/neu repression, an adenoviral vector was used to transfer the E1A gene into two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361, that overexpress HER-2/neu. After E1A delivery, we observed that HER-2/neu expression level was reduced, and cells were treated with paclitaxel. Cell proliferation assays showed a synergistic growth inhibition effect of E1A and paclitaxel. The synergistic effect was also confirmed by soft agar colony-formation assay. Breast cancer cell lines that express low levels of HER-2/neu, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells showed no synergistic growth inhibition effect when treated on the same protocols. Thus, we concluded that the adenovirus type 5 E1A gene can sensitize paclitaxel-resistant HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells to the drug by repressing HER-2/neu expression. This in turn may have important implications for the development of a novel therapy that combines chemotherapy and gene therapy.",

Examples of such aberrations are EGFR mutation and ALK fusion. Lung adenocarcinoma harboring such mutations can be treated with anticancer drugs that target the aberrant gene products. Additional oncogene aberrations, including RET, ROS1, and NRG1 fusions, skipping of exon 14 of MET, and mutations in BRAF, HER2, NF1, and MEK1, were recently added to the list of such \"druggable\" driver oncogene aberrations, and their responses to targeted therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, approximately 30% and 50% of LADCs in patients in Japan and Europe/USA, respectively, lack the driver oncogene aberrations listed above. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies, such as those that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells with non-oncogene aberrations, are urgently required. This review summarizes the current status of research on precision medicine against LADC and enumerates the research priorities for the near future. ",

To better understand the molecular events associated with overexpression of this gene in human breast cancer cells, differential hybridization was used to identify genes whose expression levels are altered in cells overexpressing this receptor. Of 16 000 clones screened from an overexpression cell cDNA library, a total of 19 non-redundant clones were isolated including seven whose expression decreases (C clones) and 12 which increase (H clones) in association with HER-2/ neu overexpression. Of these, five C clones and 11 H clones have been confirmed to be differentially expressed by northern blot analysis. This group includes nine genes of known function, three previously sequenced genes of relatively uncharacterized function and four novel genes without a match in GenBank. Examination of the previously characterized genes indicates that they represent sequences known to be frequently associated with the malignant phenotype, suggesting that the subtraction cloning strategy used identified appropriate target genes. In addition, differential expression of 12 of 16 (75%) cDNAs identified in the breast cancer cell lines are also seen in HER-2/ neu -overexpressing ovarian cancer cells, indicating that they represent generic associations with HER-2/ neu overexpression. Finally, up-regulation of two of the identified cDNAs, one novel and one identified but as yet uncharacterized gene, was confirmed in human breast cancer specimens in association with HER-2/ neu overexpression. Further characterization of these genes may yield insight into the fundamental biology and pathogenetic effects of HER-2/ neu overexpression in human breast and ovarian cancer cells.",

It was recently demonstrated that trastuzumab, an FDA approved humanized monoclonal antibody against Her-2/ neu tyrosine kinase receptor, did not induce endocytosis of the internalization resistant Her-2/ neu receptor. Here we report that accelerated internalization of trastuzumab can be induced by cross-linking the cell membrane bound antibody-receptor complex with an avidin/streptavidin-biotin system. We demonstrated that internalization was achieved both in vitro and in vivo in Her-2/ neu expressing human breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, SK-BR-3 and AU-565) and that repetitive labeling cycles further amplified the loading of cargo molecules within the targeted cells. No trastuzumab binding and internalization was observed in Her-2/ neu negative MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas weak membrane binding and negligible internalization were detected in MCF-7 cells with low expression level of Her-2/ neu receptor. The method was used to noninvasively image Her-2/ neu receptors in isolated cells and in a preclinical breast cancer model with MRI. The controlled internalization of Her-2/ neu receptors can potentially enhance intracellular delivery of drugs and imaging probes, and improve imaging sensitivity and selectivity as well as therapeutic efficacy, through antibody-directed binding and internalization using a pretargeting approach.",

The clinical features and pathologic findings were studied and immunohistochemistry was performed for the expression of ER, PR, HER2, p53, E-cadherin, CK34βE12 and CK8.;Among the breast cancer patients, the incidence of TLC was about 1.0% (8/880). The mean age of the patients was 59 years, with a range of 45 to 79 years. All patients were asymptomatic, with incidental finding of a mass in the breast on health examination. Common findings on sonography included a hypoechoic nodule with irregular shape and spiculated margin. Histologically, the small uniform tumor cells were arranged in a mixed pattern showing single cells, single-cell files or cords, small round to angulated tubules, and infiltrating lobular or targetoid patterns around ducts that were specific for classical invasive lobular carcinoma. Low or intermediate grade intraepithelial neoplasms which had similar cellular morphology with the invasive tumor often appeared in the periphery, including ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ and intraductal papillary carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor cells showed intense reactivity to ER (7/8) and PR (8/8), but no reactivity to HER2 or p53.

Here, we show that autocrine motility factor (AMF) binds to HER2 and induces cleavage to the ectodomain-deleted and constitutively active form p95HER2. Mechanistic investigations indicated that interaction of AMF with HER2 triggers HER2 phosphorylation and metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and ablating the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit breast carcinoma cell growth. Furthermore, we found that HER2 expression and AMF secretion were inversely related in breast carcinoma cells.

After stratification based on the results of HER-2 immunohistochemistry, chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus docetaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel. The study was designed so patients with or without HER-2 overexpression would be distributed equally between the study arms.;Immunohistochemistry for HER-2 protein expression was attempted for 182 pathologic samples from 169 patients. Twenty-eight of the 179 evaluable samples (16%) revealed 2+ or 3+ staining. The objective response rate was 23% (7 of 30 patients) in the patients treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab and 32% (11 of 34 patients) in the patients treated with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (P=0.76, Wilcoxon test). No difference was noted in the median survival (16 mos vs. 14 mos) or 1-year survival (57% vs. 55%) (P=0.998). Toxicities were mild in both treatment arms.

The response rates and toxicities for patients treated with docetaxel and trasuzumab or paclitaxel and trasuzumab were not significantly different, though survival in both arms was better than expected. HER-2 expression status did not appear to affect outcomes for this uniform group of patients who were treated in a comparable fashion.

        "Doc_abstract":"Hsp90 is an ATP dependent molecular chaperone protein which integrates multiple oncogenic pathways. As such, Hsp90 inhibition is a promising anti-cancer strategy. Several inhibitors that act on Hsp90 by binding to its N-terminal ATP pocket have entered clinical evaluation. Robust pre-clinical data suggested anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer types. Clinically, encouraging results have been demonstrated in melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, castrate refractory prostate cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma and multiple myeloma. In breast cancer, proof-of-concept was demonstrated by first generation Hsp90 inhibitors in combination with trastuzumab mainly in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+metastatic breast cancer. There are a multitude of second generation Hsp90 inhibitors currently under investigation. To date, however, there is no FDA approved Hsp90 inhibitor nor standardized assay to ascertain Hsp90 inhibition. This review summarizes the current status of both first and second generation Hsp90 inhibitors based on their chemical classification and stage of clinical development. It also discusses the pharmacodynamic assays currently implemented in clinic as well as other novel strategies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors. Ultimately, these efforts will aid in maximizing the full potential of this class of agents. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90).",

Chemotherapy has also been shown to be beneficial in some patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present randomized phase II trial examined the effect of adding trastuzumab to a standard chemotherapeutic combination (gemcitabine-cisplatin) in patients with HER2-positive NSCLC.;Patients with untreated stage IIIB/IV HER2-positive NSCLC received up to six 21-day cycles of gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2) (days 1 and 8) and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) (day 1). Patients in the trastuzumab arm received trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) followed by 2 mg/kg/week i.v. until progression.;Of 619 patients screened, 103 were eligible. Fifty-one patients were treated with trastuzumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin and 50 with gemcitabine-cisplatin alone. Efficacy was similar in the trastuzumab and control arms: response rate 36% versus 41%; median time to progression 6.3 versus 7.2 months; and median progression-free survival (PFS) 6.1 versus 7 months. Response rate (83%) and median PFS (8.5 months) appeared relatively good in the six trastuzumab-treated patients with HER2 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive NSCLC. Addition of trastuzumab to gemcitabine-cisplatin was well tolerated, side-effects were as expected, and trastuzumab did not exacerbate the known toxicity of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Symptomatic cardiotoxicity was observed in one trastuzumab-treated patient. Serum trastuzumab concentrations in the presence of gemcitabine-cisplatin were comparable to those of trastuzumab alone.;Trastuzumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin is well tolerated. Clinical benefit was not observed. Although HER2 3+/FISH-positive patients may benefit from trastuzumab, the subgroup is too small to provide definitive information.

Cells that are transfected with the closely related receptor, erbB3, display a single class of lower affinity heregulin binding sites than has been previously observed on breast carcinoma cell lines. Little or no stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heregulin occurs in cells that are transfected with erbB3 alone. Transfection of cells with erbB3 and erbB2 reconstitutes a higher affinity binding receptor, which is also capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal in response to heregulin. A monoclonal antibody to erbB2 will inhibit heregulin activation of tyrosine phosphorylation and binding in cells transfected with both receptors but not with erbB3 alone. In cells expressing erbB2 and erbB3, both proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interaction with heregulin.

However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs could affect long-term outcome in almost all patients. To identify the potential mechanisms of resistance, we established cell lines resistant to EGFR-TKIs from the human lung cancer cell lines PC9 and11-18, which harbored activating EGFR mutations. One erlotinib-resistant cell line from PC9 and two erlotinib-resistant cell lines and two gefitinib-resistant cell lines from 11-18 were independently established. Almost complete loss of mutant delE746-A750 EGFR gene was observed in the erlotinib-resistant cells isolated from PC9, and partial loss of the mutant L858R EGFR gene copy was specifically observed in the erlotinib- and gefitinib-resistant cells from 11-18. However, constitutive activation of EGFR downstream signaling, PI3K/Akt, was observed even after loss of the mutated EGFR gene in all resistant cell lines even in the presence of the drug. In the erlotinib-resistant cells from PC9, constitutive PI3K/Akt activation was effectively inhibited by lapatinib (a dual TKI of EGFR and HER2) or BIBW2992 (pan-TKI of EGFR family proteins). Furthermore, erlotinib with either HER2 or HER3 knockdown by their cognate siRNAs also inhibited PI3K/Akt activation. Transfection of activating mutant EGFR complementary DNA restored drug sensitivity in the erlotinib-resistant cell line. Our study indicates that loss of addiction to mutant EGFR resulted in gain of addiction to both HER2/HER3 and PI3K/Akt signaling to acquire EGFR-TKI resistance.",

Here we report an uncommon case in which apocrine carcinomas developed concurrently in both breasts; in addition, a sarcomatoid spindle cell lesion was coincident in the right breast. Both apocrine carcinomas were immunohistochemically negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), but diffusely positive for androgen receptor (AR), GCDFP-15, and HER2. The presence of intraductal components in bilateral carcinomas and the absence of lymph node metastasis suggested that they were more likely to be individual primary lesions rather than metastatic disease. The spindle cell lesion showed a relatively well-circumscribed nodule contiguous with the apocrine carcinoma. HER2 oncoprotein overexpression was observed not only in the apocrine carcinoma, but also in the spindle cell lesion. Since the spindle cell component was intimately admixed with apocrine carcinoma and had focal cytokeratin expression, we diagnosed it as metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma, which was originated from the apocrine carcinoma.

Abundant expression of C35 transcript in tumors was confirmed by Northern blot and real-time PCR. The C35 gene is located on chromosome 17q12, 505 nucleotides from the 3' end of the ERBB2 oncogene, the antigenic target for trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy. The chromosomal arrangement of the genes encoding C35 and ERBB2 is tail to tail. An open reading frame encodes a 12-kDa protein of unknown function. Immunohistochemical analysis detected robust and frequent expression of C35 protein, including 32% of grade 1 and 66% of grades 2 and 3 infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast (in contrast to 20% overexpressing HER-2/neu), 38% of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (typically HER-2/neu negative), as well as tumors arising in other tissues.

We have previously shown that EGFR, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, binds to GEP100/BRAG2 to activate Arf6, which induces cancer invasion and metastasis. We now show that overexpressed Her2 in lung adenocarcinoma cells also employs GEP100. Like EGFR-GEP100 binding, this association is primarily mediated by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of GEP100 and Tyr1139/Tyr1196 of Her2. Tyr1139/Tyr1196 are autonomously phosphorylated, when Her2 is overexpressed. Accordingly, invasive activities mediated by the Her2-GEP100 pathway are not dependent on external factors. Blocking Her2-GEP100 binding, as well as its signaling pathway all inhibit cancer invasive activities. Moreover, our clinical study indicates that co-overexpression of Her2 with GEP100 in primary lung adenocarcinomas of patients is correlated with the presence of their node-metastasis with a statistical significance. Since the GEP100 PH domain interacts with both Her2 and EGFR, targeting this domain may provide novel cancer therapeutics.",

ErbB3 and TGF-alpha were not detected in the nontransformed E10 and C10 cell lines. Nevertheless, exposure of E10 or C10 cells to TGF-alpha activated PI3K and Akt and increased cyclin D1 and cell growth.

We show in vitro and in vivo that afatinib plus cetuximab significantly inhibits HER2 phosphorylation. HER2 overexpression or knockdown confers resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line models. FISH analysis revealed that HER2 was amplified in 12% of tumors with acquired resistance versus only 1% of untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, HER2 amplification and EGFR(T790M) were mutually exclusive. Collectively, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs and provide a rationale to assess the status and possibly target HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",

The aim of this study was to validate the incidence of PXN somatic alterations in NSCLC and to correlate them to other common genetic alterations.

We found PXN polymorphisms including nonsynonymous ones but no PXN amplification and only 1/159 (<1%) somatic tumor mutation F416L.

ERalpha positivity was significantly associated with ERbeta and PR positivity. There were more EGFR mutations seen in tumors with ERbeta positivity (60%) compared with those with negative expression (37.9%), and there was a trend toward a poorer outcome for patients with tumor that were positive for ERbeta and Her-2.;We found that ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and Her-2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma are present but limited.

Therefore, in this study, we asked (a) whether EIA might sensitize response to paclitaxel in human HER-2/neu-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells, and, if so, what is the mechanism responsible; and (b) whether this enhanced chemosensitivity would translate into a therapeutic effect in an ovarian cancer xenograft model. Consequently, we demonstrated that: (a) adenovirus type 5 E1A could enhance the sensitivity of paclitaxel in paclitaxel-resistant HER-2/neu-overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis, (b) this induction was heavily dependent on activation of the caspase-3 pathway, and (c) nude mice bearing i.p.

Additional information on NSCLC cell lines such as that of transcriptomic data, genomic aberrations, and drug sensitivity was analyzed in the context of proteomic data using supervised and non-supervised approaches for data analysis. First, the unsupervised analysis of proteomic data indicated that proteins clustering closely together reflect well-known signaling modules, e.g. PI3K/AKT- and RAS/RAF/ERK-signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. However, mutations of EGFR, ERBB2, RAF, RAS, TP53, and PI3K were found dispersed across different signaling pathway clusters. Merely cell lines with an amplification of EGFR and/or ERBB2 clustered closely together on the proteomic, but not on the transcriptomic level. Secondly, supervised data analysis revealed that sensitivity towards anti-EGFR drugs generally correlated better with high level EGFR phosphorylation than with EGFR abundance itself. High level phosphorylation of RB and high abundance of AURKA were identified as candidates that can potentially predict sensitivity towards the aurora kinase inhibitor VX680. Examples shown demonstrate that the RPPA approach presents a useful platform for targeted proteomics with high potential for biomarker discovery.

The effect of PKD1 reexpression on cell invasion was analyzed in vitro by transwell invasion assay. Tumor growth and metastasis were monitored in vivo using the IVIS Spectrum Pre-clinical In Vivo Imaging System.;Herein we show that the gene promoter of PRKD1 is aberrantly methylated and silenced in its expression in invasive breast cancer cells and during breast tumor progression, increasing with the aggressiveness of tumors. Using an animal model, we show that reversion of PRKD1 promoter methylation with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine restores PKD1 expression and blocks tumor spread and metastasis to the lung in a PKD1-dependent fashion.;Our data suggest that the status of epigenetic regulation of the PRKD1 promoter can provide valid information on the invasiveness of breast tumors and therefore could serve as an early diagnostic marker.

Gene copy numbers were evaluated using the Zeiss Axioskop50 fluorescence microscope. HER-2/neu amplification was noted in 24 (38%) of 63 cases. By multivariate analysis, only aneuploidy (P = .04) and HER-2/neu amplification by FISH (P = .04) independently correlated with survival. Although we saw a relationship between HER-2/neu protein expression and gene amplification, this trend did not achieve statistical significance. HER-2/neu oncogene amplification can be assessed using automated FISH on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. HER-2/ neu amplification predicts poor outcome in Stage I endometrial cancer. HER-2/neu amplification status has potential use in the identification of patients with high risk of disease recurrence who might benefit from intensified therapy.",

During the progression of these lesions, Treg cells expand in the spleen, tumor draining lymph nodes, and tumors. Repeated administration of anti-CD25 antibodies extends tumor-free survival, reduces carcinoma multiplicity, and leads to the manifestation of a natural antibody and CTL-mediated reactivity against r-Erbb2. Loss of Foxp3(+) Treg cells during anti-CD25 treatment remarkably caused the disappearance of Gr1(+) immature myeloid cells, suggesting a cross-talk between these two inhibitory immune cell types.

HER2/neu overexpression is a negative prognostic factor in breast cancer patients. Cancer cells that overexpress HER2/neu may also be less sensitive to chemotherapy. In order to further define mechanisms by which HER2/neu overexpression drives neoplastic cell growth and chemoresistance, antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) have been utilized to selectively down-regulate HER2/neu expression in human breast cancer cells. Such antisense ODNs suppress HER2/neu mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent, sequence-specific manner. Down-regulation of HER2/neu expression in HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells inhibits cell cycle progression in G0/G1 and results in apoptotic cell death. In tissue culture studies, combined treatment of HER2/ neu overexpressing breast cancer cells with HER2/neu antisense ODNs and conventional chemotherapeutic agents results in synergistic inhibition of cancer cell growth and activation of apoptotic cell death mechanisms. These studies have been extended to demonstrate synergistic antitumor effects following systemic treatment with antisense ODNs plus doxorubicin in nude mice bearing human breast carcinoma xenografts. Collectively these findings demonstrate that HER2/neu overexpression stimulates anti-apoptotic cell survival mechanisms and suggest that HER2/neu antisense ODNs may be of use in cancer therapeutics.",

Therefore, we examined its expression and functions in breast carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for NUDT2 was examined by invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC: n = 145) and pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS: n = 82), and NUDT2 mRNA was examined by real-time PCR in 9 DCIS, 19 IDC and 6 non-neoplastic breast tissues. We also used T47D breast carcinoma cells in in vitro studies. NUDT2 immunoreactivity was detected in 78% of DCIS and 63% of IDC, and NUDT2 mRNA level was significantly higher in DCIS or IDC than non-neoplastic breast. NUDT2 status was significantly correlated with Van Nuys classification, HER2 or Ki-67 in DCIS, and with stage, lymph node metastasis, histological grade or HER2 in IDC. NUDT2 status was significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome of IDC patients and proved an independent prognostic factor. Results of transfection experiments demonstrated that proliferation activity of T47D cells was significantly associated with NUDT2 expression level according to the treatment of estradiol and/or tamoxifen. NUDT2 expression was significantly decreased by estradiol, and it was also significantly decreased in T47D cells transfected with HER2 siRNA. These findings suggest that NUDT2 is an estrogen-repressed gene and is also induced by HER2 pathways in breast carcinoma cells.

In NeuT mice, vaccination with self neu but not heterologous Her-2 DNA induced anti-neu antibodies and delayed spontaneous tumorigenesis. Both neu and Her-2 DNA induced anti-neu T cell response, but depletion of CD8 T cells did not change the delay in tumorigenesis. Therefore, in NeuT mice, both self and heterologous DNA activated anti-neu T cells, although T cell response did not reach sufficient level to suppress spontaneous tumorigenesis. Rather, induction of anti-neu antibodies by self neu DNA is associated with the delay in spontaneous tumor growth.

EGFR overexpression is associated with reduced survival and is inversely correlated with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). This study assessed EGFR expression in breast carcinomas with squamous differentiation. The immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of EGFR was evaluated in 39 breast carcinomas with squamous differentiation (30 pure squamous, 6 adenosquamous, 3 carcinosarcomas) by use of the pharmDx assay (clone 2-18C9, DakoCytomation). Cases were considered positive if at least 10% of the cells showed 1+ positivity in the squamous component. Squamous differentiation was confirmed with IHC for CK5-6 (clone D5/16B4, DakoCytomation). ER, PR, and HER2 status as well as clinical information regarding treatment and outcome were correlated. As a control, a tissue microarray comprising 280 lymph node positive breast carcinomas was evaluated with the same EGFR assay. The 39 patients ranged in age from 33 to 77 years (mean 52). The tumors measured 1.3-30 cm (mean 4.8). Sentinel or full axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 28 patients. Fourteen patients had positive lymph nodes. At the time of initial diagnosis, 3 patients had distant metastasis. Follow-up was available for 16 patients (mean 45 months). Disease-free survival at 3 years was 70%. Among the 39 tumors 87% (34) were positive for EGFR (p<0.0001). Sixty-nine percent (27 of 39) showed >50% 2+ EGFR staining. EGFR-positive tumor cells (showing squamous morphology) were also found in 1 bone, 1 lung, and 8 of 11 lymph node metastases available for evaluation. All 11 lymph nodes showed squamous differentiation. All but 1 of the EGFR+ tumors examined were ER and PR negative. Six EGFR-positive tumors were HER2 positive. No statistically significant differences in HER2 status, size, lymph node status and disease-free survival were observed between EGFR+ and EGFR- cases, but the number of EGFR-negative tumors was quite small. Nine of 280 (3%) of lymph node-positive invasive carcinomas on the tissue microarray were EGFR+; review of the initial diagnostic slides failed to reveal squamous features in all but 1 of the 9 EGFR+ tumors. Breast carcinomas with squamous differentiation are a distinct subgroup of breast tumors with a very high frequency of EGFR positivity.

        "Doc_abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are known to possess potent antitumor properties. Previous studies have indicated that IFNs are capable of modulating the expression of various tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. In this study, we looked at the effect of IFN-gamma on the neu/HER-2 proto-oncogene in the DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. IFN-gamma inhibited cell proliferation in both DU145 and PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no inhibition of proliferation was seen in LNCaP cells. Correspondingly, IFN-gamma treatment of DU145 and PC-3 cells resulted in an increased production of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1), whereas no increase in p21(WAF1) was seen in LNCaP cells. In addition, IFN-gamma induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 in DU145 and PC-3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Consistent with these findings, we found that IFN-gamma treatment of DU145 and PC-3 cells caused a reduction in neu/HER-2 expression, with no change seen in the LNCaP cell line. Transfection and overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator p300 in PC-3 cells suppressed the reduction in neu/HER-2 expression after IFN-gamma treatment, suggesting a role for p300 in neu/HER-2 expression. The antiproliferative activity and p21(WAF1) production of these cells after IFN-gamma treatment were found to be reduced as well. We propose that the down-regulation of neu/HER-2 by IFN-gamma occurs via the interaction of phosphorylated STAT1 with p300 because IFN-gamma activities requiring phosphorylated STAT1 are reduced in cells overexpressing p300. These findings suggest that neu/HER-2 may play a role in the growth of some prostate cancers and that IFN-gamma may suppress such cancers by down-regulation of neu/HER-2.",

In DCIS, HER2 overexpression is found specifically in poorly histologically differentiated disease and not in well differentiated cancers. Various methods have been used to analyse the HER2 status of a tumour. These either measure the degree of HER2 gene amplification, receptor overexpression or the amount of circulating HER2 protein.

In order to diagnose and treat NSCLC effectively, greater understanding of its molecular mechanism is required. In the present study, 36 NSCLC tissues and 10 normal tissues were selected. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was used to analyze the CD44 mRNA expression level in NSCLC tissue and DNA sequencing was performed to further verify the CD44 expression level. Differentially expressed genes between tumor tissues and controls were determined by DNA sequencing and the Gene_act_net between CD44 and its associated genes was constructed. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes was performed by the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed based on the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer test applied in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. RT‑qPCR results showed that CD34 was overexpressed in 21 of the 36 NSCLC tissues (58.3%). The Gene_act_net indicated that there were 20 differentially expressed genes with 17 upregulated and 3 downregulated. Among them, CD44, MET, ERBB2, EGFR, AKT1, IQGAP1 and STAT3 were associated with the occurrence and migration of NSCLC. In KEGG pathway analysis, extracellular matrix‑receptor interaction and hematopoietic cell lineage pathways were the most affected by overexpressed CD44; and thus may be important in the development and migration of NSCLC. In conclusion, CD44 was overexpressed in NSCLC and the overexpression was associated with the occurrence of NSCLC and migration of NSCLC cells. ",

Widely accepted guidelines for HER2 testing in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer have not been established. The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of HER2 expression in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer using a tissue microarray approach, which closely simulates small biopsies routinely tested for HER2. One hundred sixty-nine patients, including 99 primary gastric adenocarcinomas and 70 primary gastroesophageal junction carcinomas were analyzed for HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry and HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization using scoring schemes proposed by both American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) and the results of the recently published Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) trial. In our analysis, 19 adenocarcinomas were HER2 positive, defined as either a HER2/CEP17 ratio >2.2 and/or a 3+ HER2 immunohistochemistry score with either the ASCO/CAP or ToGA scoring schemes. Of the 19 HER2-positive adenocarcinomas, 8 (42%) exhibited a characteristic strongly intense basolateral membranous staining pattern which would be interpreted as negative (1+) using the accepted ASCO/CAP scoring scheme for HER2 assessment in breast carcinoma, but were correctly labeled as 3+ positive using the proposed ToGA scoring scheme. Of the 19 HER2-positive adenocarcinomas, 8 (42%) demonstrated heterogeneous HER2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Twelve of 99 (12%) gastric carcinomas were positive for HER2. Of these, HER2 was more often identified in intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (10 of 52, 19%) compared with diffuse (2 of 34, 6%) adenocarcinoma.

The infiltration pattern was similar to that of invasive lobular carcinoma with targetoid and Indian file arrangements. The invasive histiocytoid cells had finely granular, eosinophilic to vesicular cytoplasm and nuclei with a bland uniform appearance, a single small eosinophilic nucleolus and finely granular chromatin. We compared the immunohistochemical profiles of 17 breast cancer markers between invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia and normal breast epithelium. Although they all shared the same reactivity for many of the proteins, they exhibited differences in GCDFP-15, E-cadherin, P120, CEA, HER-2, ER and PR expression, and these are discussed. This is the first case study of two HBC masses occurring in one breast simultaneously.

We inserted the sequence for neu into a novel plasmid called ELVIS containing a Sindbis virus replicon that reproduces multiple copies of mRNA. Mice vaccinated one time intramuscularly demonstrated a strong antibody response against A2L2, a murine breast cancer cell line transfected to express neu. Vaccinated mice challenged in the mammary fatpad with A2L2 had reduced tumor incidence and reduced tumor mass compared to mice challenged with tumor cells lacking the neu insert. Intradermal vaccination was also protective and required 80% less plasmid for a similar level of protection. Vaccination reduced the incidence of lung metastasis from mammary fatpad tumors and reduced the number of lung metastases resulting from intravenous injection of A2L2 cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes cultures of immune spleen cells with P815-neu cells produced high levels of interferon-gamma indicating an antigen-specific Th1-type immune response resulting from the vaccination.

The combination of Trastuzumab and cisplatin is expected to be active against HER-2 / neu-expressing tumors. We examined the mechanisms of this combination effect against human solid tumor cells in the presence of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an in vitro MTT assay. The growth-inhibitory effects of cisplatin (CDDP) on the tumor cells were not significantly affected by Trastuzumab in the absence of effector cells. CDDP alone at a dose of less than 12.5 mM did not affect the viability of PBMCs, as determined by MTT assay, suggesting that PBMCs could exert antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) at this CDDP concentration. The combination of Trastuzumab and CDDP showed higher cytotoxic effects against the tumor cells in the presence of PBMCs. The CDDP concentration required to inhibit tumor cell growth by 50% was reduced to approximately 20% by Trastuzumab in the presence of PBMCs at an effector/target ratio of 10. It may be important to select combined chemotherapeutic agents which do not diminish the ADCC activity of Trastuzumab via PBMCs.

In this study, clinicopathological analysis of MGACA from 11 Chinese patients was conducted. Microscopically, all cases showed a spectrum of structure and glandular proliferations ranging from microglandular adenosis (MGA) to atypical MGA (AMGA) to MGACA. Carcinoma components were composed of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 1 case and invasive carcinoma in 10 cases. Invasive carcinomas were grade 3 in 10 tumors and grade 2 in 1. Invasive components in 5 of 10 cases were composed of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST), and 1 case showed partially acinic cell differentiation. In 5 cases, invasive components were mixed of NST and matrix-producing carcinoma (MPC). All epitheliums in 11 cases were triple negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-), and diffuse positive for CK and S-100 protein. No myoepithelial cells were demonstrable from MGA to invasive components with immunohistochemical staining for P63 and calponin. PAS or reticulin stain showed the presence of a basement membrane around glands in MGA, AMGA, DCIS, and its absence in invasive components. Follow-up time ranged from 10 to 64 months. One patient developed a lung metastasis 24 months after surgery, 10 patients have been alive without recurrence. Our study revealed that MGACA is a distinct subset of breast carcinoma, with triple negative phenotype, high grade nuclear and variable morphology. Despite histopathologic and immunohistochemical features usually associated with a poor prognosis, MGACA seems to have a relatively favorable outcome. ",

The molecular mechanism of the observed synergy was studied in cultured cells, and the combination of seliciclib and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib was evaluated in an H358 xenograft model.;Seliciclib synergized with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab in a breast cancer cell line, which overexpresses the HER2 receptor, and with the erlotinib analogue AG1478 in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. In the H358 non-small cell lung cancer cell line, synergy involved decreased signaling from the EGFR, with AG1478 directly inhibiting kinase activity while seliciclib decreased the levels of key components of the receptor signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced loss of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclin D1. The combination of seliciclib and erlotinib was evaluated further in an H358 xenograft and shown to be significantly more active than either agent alone. An enhanced loss of cyclin D1 was also seen in vivo.;This is the first report that investigates combining seliciclib with an EGFR inhibitor. The combination decreased signaling from the EGFR in vitro and in vivo and was effective in cell lines containing either wild-type or mutant EGFR, suggesting that it may expand the range of tumors that respond to erlotinib, and therefore, such combinations are worth exploring in the clinic.",

The c-erbB2 gene (HER-2/neu) is a proto-oncogene expressed in 10-34% of breast cancers. Its expression is associated with poor clinical outcome. The hypothesis that the progression of in situ ductal carcinoma of breast to invasive ductal carcinoma is associated with alterations of ER, PgR and HER-2/neu protein expression was tested. Of 100 mastectomy specimens examined, all contained both ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) not otherwise specified (NOS). The status of ER, PgR and HER-2/neu proteins was examined by immunochemistry. ER and PgR protein expression was scored as the mean value of positively stained cells. HER-2/neu protein expression was evaluated on ts staining pattern (0, 1+, 2+ and 3+). We found variations between DCIS and IDC with significant decrease of the mean values of ER and PgR positively stained cells in high-grade (Grade 3) IDC (ER: 49.2+/-10.3 vs. 30.8+/-5.5 and PgR: 40.0+/-10.0 vs. 22.3+/-5.1 in DCIS and IDC, respectively, P<0.05). Invasive carcinomas with lymph node metastases or lymphovascular invasion or both had lower mean values of ER and PgR positively stained cells compared to those without these features. In IDC (Grade 3), HER-2/neu protein expression values (1.2+/-0.2) were significantly high compared to DCIS (0.7+/-0.3, P<0.05). In addition, HER-2/neu protein expression values were significantly higher (P<0.05) in IDC with lymph node metastases or lymphovascular invasion (1.5+/-0.3) than those without these features (0.8+/-0.2). A significantly high mean (P<0.05) of ER and PgR positively stained cells was observed in postmenopausal females compared to premenopausal women. In contrast, high HER-2/neu expression values were seen only in premenopausal females. A significant positive correlation was observed between ER and PgR receptor expression (r=0.81). A low degree inverse correlation (r=-0.24, P<0.012) was found between ER+/PgR+ tumors and HER-2/neu expression. These findings substantiate the notion that breast cancer progression is often associated with alterations of ER, PgR and HER-2/neu expression.

In this report, we evaluated the potential of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of Foxo3 in antigen-presenting cells as an adjuvant for HER2/neu DNA cancer vaccines. Bicistronic plasmids expressing the N-terminal extracellular domain of human HER-2/neu and the Foxo3 short hairpin RNA (hN'-neu-Foxo3 shRNA) or the scrambled control (hN'-neu-scramble shRNA) were subcutaneously injected into mice by gene gun administration to elicit antitumor immunity against p185neu-overexpressing MBT-2 bladder tumor cells. We found that mice treated with hN'-neu-Foxo3 shRNA showed greater reductions in tumor growth and longer survival times than mice treated with hN'-neu-scramble shRNA, indicating that the silencing of Foxo3 enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the HER-2/neu cancer vaccine. Cytotoxicity analyses further revealed that the Foxo3 shRNA-enhanced antitumor effect was associated with significant increases in the number of functional CD8(+) T cells and in the levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes activity. Interleukin-6 was induced by hN'-neu-Foxo3 shRNA treatment but did not have a critical role in the antitumor effect of the hN'-neu-Foxo3 shRNA vaccine. Moreover, in vivo lymphocyte depletion analyses confirmed that the antitumor efficacy of the hN'-neu-Foxo3 shRNA vaccine depended on functional CD8(+) T cells. Finally, Foxo3 suppression was shown to markedly improve the effect of the HER-2/neu DNA vaccine in limiting the growth and lung metastases of MBT-2 cells. Overall, these results support RNAi-mediated silencing of Foxo3 as an effective strategy to enhance the therapeutic antitumor effect of HER-2/neu DNA vaccines against p185neu-positive tumors.",

Two of the eight cell lines in our study (SKOV3 and YAOVBIX1) exhibited five- to ninefold neu DNA sequence amplification, accompanied by up to 200-fold overexpression of transcripts and protein (p185). Both of these cell lines expressed a major approximately 7.5 kb neu-complementary transcript not previously reported in other neu-positive tumor cell lines. One pair of cell lines (YAOVBIX1 and YAOVBIX3), isolated from a single ovarian carcinoma patient's ascites sample differed dramatically in regard to level of neu gene amplification and expression. Immunohistochemical staining of the primary ovarian tumor from which these two lines were derived demonstrated populations of both neu-positive and neu-negative malignant epithelial cells. Seven of the eight ovarian carcinoma lines produced intra-abdominal tumors after intraperitoneal injection into nude mice, irrespective of level of neu gene expression. This study demonstrates tumor cell heterogeneity with regard to neu gene amplification and expression in an ovarian adenocarcinoma, reveals the overexpression of novel neu-complementary transcripts in two independently isolated ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines, and suggests that neu gene expression is not required for intraperitoneal tumorigenicity of ovarian carcinoma xenografts in a nude mouse model system.",

However, de novo and acquired antibody resistance is one of the major limitations of trastuzumab therapy warranting the search for other therapeutic strategies. One of the most remarkable features of adenovirus (AdV)-based vaccine is its ability to induce exceptionally high and sustained frequencies of transgene product-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. In this study, we constructed two recombinant AdVs (AdV(OVA) and AdV(HER-2)) expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and HER-2/neu, and assessed AdV-induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses and preventive/therapeutic antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that AdV(OVA) stimulates efficient OVA-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer responses, leading to preventive long-term immunity against OVA-expressing BL6-10ova melanoma in wild-type C56BL/6 mice. We further demonstrate that AdV(HER-2) stimulates HER-2/neu-specific CD8(+) CTL responses, leading to a significant reduction in breast carcinogenesis in transgenic FVBneuN mice (P<0.05), but has little therapeutic effect on pre-existing Tg1-1 tumor even at early stage (15 mm(3)). In contrast, the anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy is capable of completely inhibiting Tg1-1 tumor growth at early stage, but fails to eradicate well-established Tg1-1 breast tumor (100 mm(3)). Interestingly, a combinatorial immunotherapy of anti-HER-2/neu antibody with AdV(HER-2) vaccine was capable of curing 4 of 10 studied mice bearing well-established Tg1-1 breast tumors and significantly delaying in death of the remaining six tumor-bearing mice (P<0.05). Taken together, our results suggest an adjuvant effect of AdV(HER-2) on anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy for well-established breast tumor in transgenic FVBneuN mice, and this combinatorial immunotherapy of trastuzumab with AdV(HER-2) vaccine may be used as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of advanced HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer.",

Each fusion protein was designed to target the PRLR-positive cells via the G129R moiety and at the same time attack a hallmark common to cancer cells via the second moiety. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the three fusion proteins as a combination therapy in an aggressive but clinically relevant mouse tumor model. To test the feasibility and to optimize a treatment regimen, allografts of a mammary carcinoma cell line (McNeuA) derived from an MMTV-neu transgenic mouse were first used. Growth of the allografts was significantly retarded by regimens which combined all three fusion proteins. In addition, a significant increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells was observed within the tumors of the combination treated groups. After establishing the dosing regimen, two doses of cocktail treatment (low and high doses administered twice weekly) along with individual component controls were administered to female MMTV-neu transgenic mice after surgical removal of a naturally occurring tumor. The average tumor recurrence time was significantly delayed in both low and high combination treatment groups in comparison to the no treatment control group (34, 50 and 18 days, respectively). The total number of lung metastases was also significantly decreased in both combination treatment groups.

Previous studies have shown that HER-2 protein over-expression is present in canine mammary tumours, however, possible prognostic and predictive analogies between protein over-expression patterns in canine and human species are still controversial. Thirty-five canine mammary carcinomas, 11 mammary adenomas, and normal, hyperplastic or dysplastic tissues taken at the marginal area of the tumours were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER-2 expression, using the Hercept Test® system scoring guidelines. HER-2 over-expression was detected in 3/11 adenomas and 10/35 carcinomas. Normal, hyperplastic and dysplastic mammary tissues were also found to be positive. The correlations between HER-2 expression and tumour histological grading, mitotic index, the presence of lymphatic invasion, and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. In carcinomas, HER-2 positive status only correlated with the mitotic index. A positive correlation was also found between HER-2 positive status and the presence of HER-2 over-expression in normal, hyperplastic or/and dysplastic mammary tissues surrounding the tumours. The percentage of HER-2 over-expressing tumours was similar to the percentage previously observed in canine benign and malignant mammary tumours. However an investigation regarding morphologically normal and hyperplastic or dysplastic tissues surrounding neoplastic lesions also showed HER-2 over-expression. In contrast with human mammary tumours, this study confirmed that in canine species, HER-2 over-expression does not identify a subgroup of tumours with a poor prognosis. In fact, we found HER-2 over-expression in morphologically non-neoplastic mammary tissues, surrounding hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions.",

This diversity was reflected in S-phase fraction and aneuploidy. Breast tumours transplanted to nude mice showed variable responses to interferon (IFN)-alpha and gamma. A tumour transplanted to BALB/c mice responded to interleukin (IL)-12. There was significant decline in transgene positivity with successive generations.

We examined cytologically pleural liquid in renal carcinoma metastases to the pleura in 6 patients (2.3% of carcinomatous pleuricies). High efficacy was shown by a cytocentrifuge CYTOSPIN-4. In 3 cases initial cancer was renal cell carcinoma, pleural exudation developed 2 years later, clear cell carcinoma appeared 6 years later and papillary cancer--10 years later. In the other 3 cases malignant cells were detected in new-onset cases. Renal carcinoma was diagnosed in one case. Cytological preparations were studied with identification of cytological signs typical for classic clear cell, granulocell and papillary renal cancer. Immunohistochemical examination of primary tumor lesion in the kidney discovered high proliferative activity of tumor cells by Ki-67 index to 5.28%. The tumors had solitary Bcl-2 positive cells.

Patients with activating mutations of the EGFR gene show sensitivity to, and clinical benefit from, treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKls). First generation reversible ATP-competitive EGFR-TKls, gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective as first, second-line or maintenance therapy. Despite initial benefit, most patients develop resistance within a year, 50-60% of cases being related to the appearance of a T790M gatekeeper mutation. Newer, irreversible EGFR-TKls - afatinib and dacomitinib - covalently bind to and inhibit multiple receptors in the ErbB family (EGFR, HER2 and HER4). These agents have been mainly evaluated for first-line treatment but also in the setting of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKls. Afatinib is the first ErbB family blocker approved for patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations; dacomitinib is in late stage clinical development. Mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors (AZD9291, CO-1686, HM61713) that specifically target the T790M resistance mutation are in early development. The EGFR-TKIs differ in their spectrum of target kinases, reversibility of binding to EGFR receptor, pharmacokinetics and potential for drug-drug interactions, as discussed in this review. For the clinician, these differences are relevant in the setting of polymedicated patients with NSCLC, as well as from the perspective of innovative anticancer drug combination strategies. ",

Overexpression of this oncogene is directly associated with malignant transformation of epithelial cells. The frequency of HER-2 overexpression varies among the different types of cancers, but universally represents a marker of poor prognosis. The critical role of HER-2 in epithelial oncogenesis as well as its selective overexpression on malignant tissues makes it an ideal target for immunotherapy. Antibodies and T cells reactive to HER-2 are known to naturally occur in patients with HER-2 positive tumors, confirming the immunogenicity of the molecule. Both antibodies as well as T cells reactive to HER-2 have been utilized for immunotherapy of HER-2 positive tumors. The \"humanized\" monoclonal antibody Herceptin has been tested in several clinical trials and found to be an effective adjuvant therapy for HER-2 positive breast and ovarian cancer patients. However, the frequency of patients responding to Herceptin is limited and a majority of patients initially responding to Herceptin develop resistance within a year of treatment. The use of vaccination strategies that generate T cell responses with or without accompanying antibody responses may serve to mitigate the problem. Various strategies for generating T cell-mediated responses against HER-2 are currently being examined in animal models or in clinical trials. The potential advantages of the various approaches to immunotherapy, their pitfalls, and the mechanisms by which HER-2 positive tumors can evade immune responses are discussed in this review.",

Slides were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest; DAKO) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; PathVysion; Vysis-Abbott) for HER-2 amplification and overexpression. Amplification was seen in 16/110 (15%) adenocarcinomas and in 7/145 (5%) squamous cell carcinomas. There was a strong association between HER-2 amplification and overexpression, especially in adenocarcinomas (P<0.0001, log rank). There was a 100% concordance of the HER-2 results in primary tumor and corresponding metastases in 84 analyzed pairs. Amplification was typically high-level with more than 10-15 HER-2 copies per tumor cell. Amplification was unrelated to survival, grading, pT, pN, pM or UICC stage.

Future preclinical developments will include the discovery of novel oncoantigens in HER-2-negative mammary carcinoma and the targeting of activated HER-2 molecular variants.

HercepTest results classified semi-quantitatively as 2+ and 3+ were evaluated using a computer image analyzer and the p185 index was calculated. HER-2 amplification was carried out with FISH using a unique probe (HER-2) with a satellite probe (CEP17). The FISH reaction was assessed routinely by counting red fluorescence signals emitted by the HER-2 gene and additionally with AnalySIS software (AS). The latter method showed that the mean HER-2 amplification index in carcinomas determined as 2+ was significantly lower as compared to carcinomas defined as 3+ (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the mean amplification indices of carcinomas classified as 3+ and of 2+ cancers which manifested HER-2 amplification did not differ significantly. High HER-2 amplification values (HER-2/CEP17 > 5) were noted in a similar percentage of carcinomas classified by IHC as 2+ (45.5%) or 3+ (55.5%).

        "Doc_abstract":"The successful treatment of breast cancer is dependent upon a number of complex factors. Her-2/neu gene amplification is known to be one of the most common genetic alterations associated with breast cancer and its accurate determination has become necessary for the selection of patients for trastuzumab therapy. The aim of this study was to prove the consistency of chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) technique after analyzing the overexpression of the Her-2/neu proto-oncogene in 100 invasive breast carcinomas and by comparing CISH results with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Moreover, it was done to evaluate the possible correlation of estrogen (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs), the proliferation marker Ki67 and the tumour suppressor gene p53 with HER-2/neu status of these breast carcinomas. Of the 100 breast carcinomas that were analysed, 22 cases showed HER-2/neu amplification, 66 cases showed no amplification, whereas 12 cases were non-interpretable in both assays (FISH and CISH). Consequently, the overall concordance between FISH and CISH was 100%. Additionally, it was observed that when HER-2/neu gene was overexpressed, there was an association with negative PRs and ERs status, negative p53 protein expression and high Ki67 labelling index. It is concluded that patients with tumours scoring 2+ with the CBE356 antibody (borderline immunohistochemistry-tested cases) would also benefit from CISH as it is shown to be highly accurate, practical and can be easily integrated into routine testing in any histopathology laboratory. Finally, CISH represents an important addition to the HER2 testing algorithm.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism in the regulation of cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation; this metabolic process is modulated by the opposing activities of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). While the role of protein tyrosine kinases has been examined extensively in human breast tumorigenesis, the role of PTPases in this process is virtually unknown. To address this issue, an activated neu oncogene was introduced into an immortalized nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line (184B5). This resulted in a substantial increase in P185neu expression, which led to the formation of progressively growing carcinomas after such cells were inoculated into athymic nude mice. Importantly, a striking increase in the expression of specific PTPases, LAR and PTP1B, was observed in 3 independently neu transformed cell lines and their derived tumors. This elevation was verified at both the mRNA and protein levels. TC-PTP PTPase expression was only slightly increased in these neu transformed cells, and no expression of CD45 PTPase was observed. The level of neu expression, as well as the differential expression between P185neu and LAR/PTP1B, directly correlated with tumorigenicity. Furthermore, rat mammary carcinomas with elevated neu expression (neu-induced) also had sharply elevated LAR-PTPase expression when compared to rat mammary carcinomas with little or no neu expression (7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene induced); the level of expression of LAR PTPase was directly correlated with the level of neu expression. Thus, our results provide the first evidence that, in human breast carcinoma cells and in rat mammary carcinomas that have an induced increase in neu expression, a consistent and substantial increase in the expression of specific PTPases occurs. The relationship between P185neu-protein tyrosine kinase expression and specific PTPase expression may play a critical role in human breast tumorigenesis.",

Several EGFR-targeted agents produce objective responses in a minority of unselected patients, but a majority of those with EGFR-activating mutations; however, all responders eventually develop resistance. The modest activity of agents that target only EGFR may be due, in part, to the complexity and interdependency of HER family signaling. The interdependent signaling that occurs between EGFR and HER2 provides a rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of these receptors with reversible and irreversible inhibitors. Several agents with activity against both EGFR and HER2 are currently under development. Irreversible EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (e.g., BIBW 2992, HKI-272) and pan-HER TKIs (e.g., PF00299804) comprise a novel class of agents in clinical development that may prevent and overcome inherent and acquired resistance to first-generation reversible EGFR TKIs. Other agents in development include the monoclonal antibody pertuzumab, and XL-647, which inhibits EGFR and HER2, as well as multiple vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family members. Here we briefly review the currently available EGFR-targeted agents, discuss the rationale for extending inhibition to other HER family members, weigh the merits of irreversible HER family inhibition, and summarize preclinical and clinical data with EGFR/HER2 and pan-HER inhibitors under clinical development.",

Little is known about the starting point of amplification of Her-2/neu and how it progresses from benign to malignant breast lesions. We attempted to address these questions by evaluating amplification of Her-2/neu in benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Twenty-six patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing invasive ductal carcinomas (as judged by strong immunoreactivity with Her-2/neu antibody) and coexisting lesions of ductal hyperplasia (DH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the vicinity of the invasive tumor (as judged by review of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections), as well as metastatic carcinoma in axillary lymph nodes (mets) were selected for this study. In the primary carcinomas, a close relationship was present between overexpression as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and amplification as demonstrated by FISH (85% concordance). Among these patients, amplification of Her-2/neu in ADH was demonstrated in 7 of 13 cases with ADH, and in DCIS, in 21 of 22 cases with DCIS. There was no amplification in DH or normal ductal epithelium. Significantly, in all 12 patients with synchronous positive axillary lymph nodes, there was concordant amplification of Her-2/neu in the primary and metastatic carcinoma. Amplification was consistent in multifocal metastases, despite morphological heterogeneity in some patients. Amplification ratios increased from ADH to DCIS to invasive carcinoma (P <.01, ADH versus DCIS; P <.05, DCIS versus invasive cancer), but there was no difference in amplification ratios between primary cancers and synchronous axillary metastases (P >.05). We also evaluated Her-2/neu amplification in 21 patients without Her-2/neu overexpression in their primary carcinomas (as judged by absent immunoreactivity with Her-2/neu antibody). Three showed amplification in both primary and metastatic lesions, with a low amplification ratio (approximately 2). One patient had amplification in the primary tumor but not in an axillary metastasis. Two patients exhibited slight amplification in the metastatic carcinoma (ratios 1.6 and 2), but not in their primary cancers. This FISH study indicates that amplification of Her-2/neu can emerge de novo in any stage of the disease process, from ADH to metastatic lesions, but most often appears first in ADH or DCIS. The degree of Her-2/neu amplification increases with progression to invasive carcinoma, there being no further increase in synchronous metastasis. Our data suggest that amplification of Her-2/neu appears to be mainly involved in initiation of breast oncogenesis and that its role in progression of breast cancers is uncertain.",

Depletion of T regulatory cells from PBMC enabled the rapid expansion of HLA-A2.1/HER-2(10(85))pentamer+/CD8+ cells (PENT+/CD8+), whereas significantly lower numbers of CTL could be generated from unfractionated PBMC. HER-2(10(85))-specific human CTL recognized the HER-2/neu+ HLA-A2.1+ tumor cell line SKBR3.A2, as determined by IFN-gamma intracellular staining and in the high sensitivity CD107alpha degranulation assay. Finally, HER-2(10(85)) significantly prolonged the survival of HHD mice inoculated with the transplantable ALC.A2.1.HER tumor both in prophylactic and therapeutic settings. These data demonstrate that HER-2(10(85)) is an immunogenic peptide, capable of eliciting CD8-mediated responses in vitro and in vivo, providing the platform for further exploitation of HER-2(10(85)) as a possible target for anticancer immunotherapy.",

Elevated expression of HER-2/neu was found to correlate with overexpression of AKT2 protein and activation of AKT kinase. HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines were resistant to apoptosis induced by UV treatment and hypoxia, which was suppressed in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, indicating a link between AKT activation and stress resistance in HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. These observations suggest that AKT signaling augments resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells overexpressing HER-2/neu.",

Here, we examined the relationship between breast cancer-associated FAS hyperactivity and HER -2/ neu -induced breast cancer chemoresistance to taxanes. Co-administration of docetaxel (Taxotere) and the mycotoxin cerulenin, a potent and non-competitive inhibitor of FAS activity, demonstrated strong synergism in HER -2/ neu -overexpressing and docetaxel-resistant SK-Br3 cells, modest synergism in moderately HER -2/ neu -expressing MCF-7 cells, and it showed additive effects in low HER -2/ neu -expressing and docetaxel-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells. Sequential exposure to cerulenin followed by docetaxel again yielded strong synergism in SK-Br3 cells, whereas antagonistic and moderate synergistic interactions were observed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Importantly, inhibition of FAS activity dramatically decreased the expression of HER -2/ neu oncogene in SK-Br3 breast cancer cells.

Since heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) stabilizes various oncoproteins including EGFR and c-Met, the inhibition of Hsp90 activity appears as a rational strategy to develop anticancer drugs. Despite preclinical efficacy of geldanamycin-anasamycin (GA)-derivatives containing benzoquinone moiety as Hsp90 inhibitors, the hepatotoxicity of these GA-derivatives restricts their therapeutic benefit. We have prepared WK-88 series of GA-derivatives, which lack the benzoquinone moiety. In this study, we have examined the anticancer effects of WK88-1 in Met-amplified- and gefitinib-resistant (HCC827GR) NSCLC cells and its parental HCC827 cells. Treatment with WK88-1 reduced the cell viability in both HCC827 and HCC827GR cells, which was associated with marked decrease in the constitutive expression of Hsp90 client proteins, such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Met and Akt. Moreover, WK88-1 attenuated phosphorylation of these Hsp90 client proteins and reduced the anchorage-independent growth of HCC827GR cells. Administration of WK88-1 did not cause hepatotoxicity in animals and significantly reduced the growth of HCC827GR cells xenograft tumors in nude mice. Our study provides evidence that ErbB3 might be a client for Hsp90 in Met-amplified NSCLCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of Hsp90 dampens the activation of EGFR- or c-Met-mediated survival of Met-amplified NSCLCs and that WK88-1 as a Hsp90 inhibitor alleviates gefitinib resistance in HCC827GR cells.

Heterodimer interactions between HER-2 and HER-3 (erbB-3) are activated by neu differentiation factor/heregulin (HRG), and HER-2/HER-3 heterodimers are constitutively activated in breast cancer cells with HER-2 gene amplification. This indicates that inhibition of HER-2/HER-3 heterodimer function may be an especially effective and unique strategy for blocking the HER-2-mediated transformation of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we constructed a bicistronic retroviral expression vector (pCMV-dn3) containing a dominant negative form of HER-3 in which most of the cytoplasmic domain was removed for introduction into cells. By using a bicistronic retroviral vector in which the antibiotic resistance gene and the gene of interest are driven by a single promoter, we attained 100% coordinate coexpression of antibiotic resistance with the gene of interest in target cell populations. Breast carcinoma cells with HER-2 gene amplification (21 MT-1 cells) and normal mammary epithelial cells without HER-2 gene amplification from the same patient (H16N-2 cells) were infected with pCMV-dn3 and assessed for HER-2/ HER-3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, p85PI 3-kinase and SHC protein activation, growth factor-dependent and -independent proliferation, and transformed growth in culture. Dominant negative HER-3 inhibited the HRG-induced activation of HER-2/HER-3 and signaling in H16N-2 and 21 MT-1 cells as well as the constitutive activation of HER-2/HER-3 and signaling in 21 MT-1 cells. Responses to exogenous HRG were strongly inhibited by dominant negative HER-3. In contrast, the proliferation of cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor was not apparently affected by dominant negative HER-3. The growth factor-independent proliferation and transformed growth of 21 MT-1 cells were also strongly inhibited by dominant negative HER-3 in anchorage-dependent and independent growth assays in culture. Furthermore, the HRG-induced or growth factor-independent proliferation of 21 MT-1 cells was inhibited by dominant negative HER-3, whereas the epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation of these cells was not: this indicates that dominant negative HER-3 preferentially inhibits proliferation induced by HER-2/HER-3.",

The oncogenic potential of HER-2/neu, together with its elevated expression in tumors, cell surface localization, and immunogenicity in some patients, make this oncoprotein an ideal target for immunotherapeutic approaches. To test the efficacy of immune-based strategies in eliciting an antitumor response, we used the N#202 transgenic mouse model engineered to overexpress the rat neu proto-oncogene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter; females of this line develop spontaneous focal mammary tumors by 6 months of age. Transgenic mice immunized intramuscularly with a HER-2 cDNA ligated into the VR1012 (VICAL) expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter developed significantly fewer spontaneous tumors as compared with mice injected with the empty vector (P < 0.0001) or not injected (P = 0.0006). However, this protection was observed only when immunization was started in 3-month-old but not in 6-month-old mice. These data suggest that the xenogeneic HER-2 DNA sequence can break immune tolerance to rat neu in transgenic N#202 mice and induce protective immunity that impairs the neu oncogene-driven progression of mammary carcinogenesis.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the immunohistochemical staining patterns in cervical cancer and correlate with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: A total of 24 cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were evaluated. Cases were stained using the HercepTest kit according to protocol. Results were graded from 0 to 3+, using the standards set for breast lesions. RESULTS.: A total of 17 cases (70.8%) were negative, 3 cases (12.5%) showed 1+ staining, and 4 cases (16.7%) showed 2+ staining. No cases showed 3+ staining. Higher her-2 staining grade correlated strongly with vaginal margin status. A weak positive correlation was seen between her-2 staining and tumor stage. There was no correlation with tumor grade or histological lymph node status. CONCLUSIONS.: A subset of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix overexpress her-2 protein. Further studies are needed to correlate with clinical outcome and determine if overexpression of her-2 protein is a marker of cervical carcinoma aggressiveness.",

There are currently no effective therapies against metastatic TNBC. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population. In this review, we describe some of the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR inhibitor sensitivity and further discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important step in the progression of solid tumors to metastatic disease. We previously reported that IN-1130, a novel transforming growth factor-β type I receptor kinase (ALK5) inhibitor, suppressed renal fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy (Moon et al., 2006). Here, we show that IN-1130 suppressed EMT and the lung metastasis of mammary tumors in mouse models. Treating human and mouse cell lines with IN-1130 inhibited TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2, and TGF-β-induced-EMT, which induces morphological changes in epithelial cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that IN-1130 blocked TGF-β-induced 4T1 mammary cancer cell migration and invasion. The TGF-β-mediated increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression was restored by IN-1130 co-treatment with TGF-β in human epithelial cells and in 4T1 cells. Furthermore, we found that lung metastasis from primary breast cancer was inhibited by IN-1130 in both 4T1-xenografted BALB/c mice and MMTV/c-Neu transgenic mice without any change in primary tumor volume. IN-1130 prolonged the life span of tumor-bearing mice. In summary, this study indicated that IN-1130 has therapeutic potential for preventing breast cancer metastasis to the lung. ",

However, the role of gankyrin in breast cancer has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the expression of gankyrin in breast cancer and evaluated its effect on breast cancer. Representative cancer tissues including normal breasts from 60 patients with breast cancer were stained immunohistochemically for gankyrin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and ErbB2. We evaluated the relationship between gankyrin expression and clinicopathologic parameters or prognostic markers. We also attempted to clarify the mechanism of gankyrin involved in breast carcinogenesis by using MCF7 breast cancer cells. Gankyrin was weakly expressed in normal breast epithelial cells, however, tumor regions of 37/60 (61.7%) cases showed an overexpression of gankyrin. Gankyrin overexpression was associated with extensive intraductal carcinoma (p=0.014) and ErbB2 positivity (p=0.031) in invasive ductal carcinoma. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, downregulation of gankyrin was associated with a reduction of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. In conclusion, gankyrin was identified in normal breasts and overexpressed in invasive breast cancers.

Our data showed that (i) AdVHER2-infected DC(HER-2) expressed HER-2/neu by Western blot and flow cytometric analysis, and (ii) vaccination of mice with DC(HER-2) induced HER-2/neu-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, but protected only 25% of vaccinated mice from challenge of 3 x 10(5) MCA26/HER-2 tumor cells. Further, to enhance the efficacy of DC(HER-2) vaccine, we coinfected DCs with both AdVHER-2 and AdVTNF-alpha. The infected DCs (DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha)) displayed the expression of both HER-2/neu and TNF-alpha by flow cytometric and ELISA analysis. We next investigated whether DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha) could induce stronger HER-2/neu-specific immune responses. We found that DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha) displayed up-regulation of immunologically important CD40, CD86, and ICAM-I molecules compared with DC(HER-2), indicating that the former ones are more mature forms of DCs. Vaccination of DC(HER-2/TNF-alpha) induced stronger allogeneic T-cell proliferation and 36% enhanced HER-2/neu-specific T-cell responses in vitro than DC(HER-2) cells. More importantly, it stimulated the significant anti-HER-2/neu immunity in vivo, which protected 8/8 mice from challenge of 3 x 10(5) MCA26/HER-2 tumor cells. Therefore, DCs genetically engineered to express both the tumor antigen and cytokines such as TNF-alpha as an immunoadjuvant are likely to represent a new direction in DC vaccine of cancer.",

Mutations of EGFR (mEGFR) and copy number gains (CNGs) of EGFR (gEGFR) and HER2 (gHER2) have been reported to predict for TKI response. Mutations in KRAS (mKRAS) are associated with primary resistance to TKIs.;We investigated the relationship between mutations, CNGs and response to TKIs in a large panel of NSCLC cell lines. Genes studied were EGFR, HER2, HER3 HER4, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. Mutations were detected by sequencing, while CNGs were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). IC50 values for the TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were determined by MTS assay. For any of the seven genes tested, mutations (39/77, 50.6%), copy number gains (50/77, 64.9%) or either (65/77, 84.4%) were frequent in NSCLC lines. Mutations of EGFR (13%) and KRAS (24.7%) were frequent, while they were less frequent for the other genes. The three techniques for determining CNG were well correlated, and qPCR data were used for further analyses. CNGs were relatively frequent for EGFR and KRAS in adenocarcinomas. While mutations were largely mutually exclusive, CNGs were not. EGFR and KRAS mutant lines frequently demonstrated mutant allele specific imbalance i.e. the mutant form was usually in great excess compared to the wild type form. On a molar basis, sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib were highly correlated. Multivariate analyses led to the following results: 1. mEGFR and gEGFR and gHER2 were independent factors related to gefitinib sensitivity, in descending order of importance. 2. mKRAS was associated with increased in vitro resistance to gefitinib.;Our in vitro studies confirm and extend clinical observations and demonstrate the relative importance of both EGFR mutations and CNGs and HER2 CNGs in the sensitivity to TKIs.",

Combination of AIT with the depletion of MDSC, in vivo, resulted in the regression of neu positive primary tumors. Importantly, neu-specific antibody responses were restored only when AIT was combined with the depletion of MDSC.

        "Doc_abstract":"erbB2 gene plays an important role in carcinoma formation. erbB2 overexpression was observed in many types of tumours, including salivary carcinoma. However, a putative erbB2 and PTEN interaction remains largely unknown in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells. The purpose of this study was to silence erbB2 gene and investigate the functional relationship between erbB2 and PTEN in SACC-83 salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells. erbB2-specific siRNAs were transfected into SACC-83 cells using cationic liposome. RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were employed to detect erbB2 and PTEN expression. Compared with the control groups, erbB2 mRNA expression was decreased in the erbB2-siRNA transfection group, and immunocytochemistry and Western blotting indicated a concordant erbB2 protein reduction. The average optical density values for erbB2 proteins in erbB2-siRNA transfected group were significantly lower than that in the control groups (P<0.05). On the other hand, PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels were not significantly affected by erbB2 silencing (P>0.05). In conclusion, the data indicate that siRNA could effectively silence erbB2 gene expression in SACC-83 cells, but PTEN expression appeared unaltered following erbB2 silencing. PTEN expression might not be strictly associated with erbB2 amplification in SACC-83 cells. Future studies will more closely examine the molecular and biological relationships of erbB2 and PTEN in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.",

This report details another case, which shows further parallels to lobular carcinoma of the breast, and reviews the literature on this subject. A 73-year-old white female presented with diffuse induration of her left eyelids. Histopathology revealed a delicate infiltrate of epithelial cells scattered throughout the lid stroma in a non-destructive pattern. The cells were relatively monomorphous and showed only mild atypia and rare mitotic figures. Many had slightly granular amphophilic cytoplasms, others showed distinct signet ring cell morphology, and all were strongly positive for epithelial mucin. Immunomicroscopy showed strong reactivity for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), and was negative for Her-2/neu (erb-2) and cytokeratin 20. An extensive workup for other primary sites was negative. Orbital exenteration showed extensive involvement of both lids and soft tissue, including diffuse muscle and lacrimal gland infiltration. In the breast, signet ring cell carcinoma is considered a variant of lobular carcinoma. The delicate infiltrating pattern in our case and the ER+, PR+, GCDFP-15+, Her-2/neu-phenotype further strengthen this analogy. Together, these data also support apocrine differentiation of primary eyelid signet ring cell carcinoma.",

We report the case of a 63-year-old female with a clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis, who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in emergency. The gallbladder showed a nodule at the infundibulum, which was responsible for the gallbladder hydrops with macroscopic features of a cholangiocarcinoma. Histological examination disclosed a metastasis from a lobular breast carcinoma with positive hormone receptors, but no overexpression of the Neu oncogene. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin7 suggesting a lesion of breast origin. The absence of E-cadherin was consistent with lobular carcinoma while negative CA 19.9 excluded cholangiocarcinoma. The patient had received 15 years previously a right mastectomy with axillary dissection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast carcinoma of ductal type labeled SBR stage III, pT3N1 M0, showing hormone receptors but absent Neu oncogene. Proofreading of the mastectomy histological slide concluded that it was a lobular rather than a ductal type carcinoma, confirming the finding of a gallbladder metastasis 15 years after the mastectomy. The patient showed no local recurrence or contralateral lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The bone scan showed metastases in the skull, scapula, right rib cage, thoracolumbar spine and pelvis, also confirmed by MRI. A treatment with exemestane and zoledronic acid was introduced.

In addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical stain (HercepTest), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) has been shown to be a sensitive and specific method to determine the Her-2/neu status of surgical specimens. The effectiveness of CISH in detecting the Her-2/neu oncogene in cytologic specimens has not been well documented. Twenty-five cases of fine needle aspirate smears and touch imprints from infiltrating ductal carcinomas were examined. Both CISH and FISH were performed on each case using a digoxigenin-labeled Her-2 DNA probe for CISH (Zymed) and both Her-2 and chromosome 17 probes for FISH (Vysis). Sixty tumor cells were evaluated in each case. The scoring system and interpretation of CISH were as follows: (1) no amplification (<5 brown dots/nucleus), (2) amplification (>10 brown dots/nucleus), and (3) low-level amplification (5-9 brown dots/nucleus). Of the 25 cases analyzed, 23 (3 amplified and 20 nonamplified) showed similar results for both methods. Two cases were discordant. In these cases, low-level amplification was suggested by CISH but nonamplification by FISH. One of the cases can be explained by polysomy for chromosome 17 by FISH. In conclusion, our preliminary data suggest that CISH is a useful technique to determine Her-2/neu oncogene status in cytologic specimens. In a case of low-level amplification, a CISH chromosome 17 probe should be used, or FISH is recommended for confirmation.",

In contrast, activation of HER2 occurs mainly by overexpression, which leads to spontaneous homodimerization and activation of downstream signaling events in a ligand-independent manner. EGFR and HER2 have now been validated as a clinically relevant target, and several different types of agents inhibiting these receptors are currently in development. The EGFR inhibitors Erlotinib, Gefitinib, and Cetuximab have undergone extensive clinical testing and have established clinical activity in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLS) and other types of solid tumors. Several of the other erbB inhibitors are also undergoing advanced clinical testing, either alone or in combination with other agents.

Towards this goal, we have developed a computational model implementing commonly accepted principles governing ErbB receptor interaction, trafficking, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Using this model, we are able to investigate several hypotheses regarding the compartmental localisation of dephosphorylation. Model results applied to experimental data on ErbB 1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylation in H292 human lung carcinoma cells support a hypothesis that key dephosphorylation activity for these receptors occurs largely in an intracellular, endosomal compartment rather than at the cell surface plasma membrane. Thus, the endocytic trafficking-related compartmentalisation of dephosphorylation may define a critical aspect of the ErbB signalling response to ligand.",

We evaluated HER-2/neu protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative PCR in paraffin-embedded samples of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma obtained from 36 patients. Polysomy 17 was also assessed by FISH. Immunohistochemically, HER-2/neu protein overexpression was observed in 22 (61.1%) tumors (ten tumors with score 3+ and 12 with score 2+). Fourteen of 36 tumors (38.9%) were evaluated as negative (score 0 or 1+). Complete concordance between FISH and the PCR was seen in all of the samples scored as 0 and 1+ by IHC.

We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 110 consecutive NSCLC specimens for which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation testing was performed between November 2011 and December 2011 using Sanger sequencing. Using the Snapshot assay, mutation statuses were detected for EGFR, Kirsten rate sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), v-ras neuroblastoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), dual specificity mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in patient specimens and cell line DNA. Snapshot data were compared to Sanger sequencing data. Of the 110 samples, 51 (46.4%) harbored at least one mutation.

The whole analysis was performed by means of tissue microarrays in mammary Paget's disease and in the underlying breast carcinoma(s).

A similar distribution of molecular subtypes was identified in the underlying in situ breast carcinomas (HER2 subtype, 82%; luminal A, 6%; luminal B, 6%; basal-like, 6% of cases) and in the invasive component (HER2 subtype, 84%; luminal A, 8%; luminal B, 8%; basal-like, 0% of cases).;  HER2 molecular subtype is the dominant, but not the sole subtype seen in Paget's cells of the nipple.

To facilitate genotyping, we developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay using a desktop sequencer to detect actionable mutations and rearrangements in cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA).;An NGS panel was developed targeting 11 driver oncogenes found in NSCLC. Targeted NGS was performed using a novel methodology that maximizes on-target reads, and minimizes artifact, and was validated on DNA dilutions derived from cell lines. Plasma NGS was then blindly performed on 48 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known tumor genotype, and explored in two patients with incomplete tumor genotyping.;NGS could identify mutations present in DNA dilutions at ≥ 0.4% allelic frequency with 100% sensitivity/specificity. Plasma NGS detected a broad range of driver and resistance mutations, including ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements, HER2 insertions, and MET amplification, with 100% specificity. Sensitivity was 77% across 62 known driver and resistance mutations from the 48 cases; in 29 cases with common EGFR and KRAS mutations, sensitivity was similar to droplet digital PCR. In two cases with incomplete tumor genotyping, plasma NGS rapidly identified a novel EGFR exon 19 deletion and a missed case of MET amplification.;Blinded to tumor genotype, this plasma NGS approach detected a broad range of targetable genomic alterations in NSCLC with no false positives including complex mutations like rearrangements and unexpected resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S. Through use of widely available vacutainers and a desktop sequencing platform, this assay has the potential to be implemented broadly for patient care and translational research.",

However, the mechanisms underlying E1A-mediated chemosensitization are still not fully understood. Recent studies demonstrate that E1A-mediated sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis can occur via multiple pathways; some of which depend on the expression of functional p53 and/or p19ARF proteins, while some are not. In human breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu overexpression, which usually are more resistance to anti-cancer drugs than cells without Her-2/ neu overexpression, may be sensitized through E1A-mediated downregulation of Her-2/neu. Alternatively, E1A can induce sensitization to anticancer drugs in cancer cells or normal diploid fibroblast cells through upregulating the expression of caspase proenzymes, or downregulating the activity of a critical survival factor Akt and/or upregulating the activities of a pro-apoptotic kinase p38 and a protein phosphatase PP2A, etc. This review summarizes these progresses and proposes a plausible feed-forward model for E1A-mediated chemosensitization in human breast cancer cells.",

We initially analyzed expression and phosphorylation of ERBB family receptors and their major downstream proteins, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3, in a series of lung cancer cell lines with or without EGFR mutation. The expression levels of EGFR as well as of ERBB2 and ERBB3 proteins in cells with EGFR mutation tended to be higher than those in cells with wild type EGFR. There was no difference in stability between mutant and wild type EGFR proteins. EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 to various extents, but the level of induction was not associated with the existence of EGFR mutation. These results implied that the activation of AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 signaling transmitted by EGFR would be critical for the growth and survival of lung cancer cells, but specific features of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells was not discriminated by these approaches. We therefore performed transfection studies using PC-13 cells with no detectable endogenous EGFR expression. Exogenous expression of wild type and mutant EGFR (delE746-A750) in the cells revealed that only in the mutant EGFR transfected cells, EGFR itself as well as AKT and STAT3 were highly phosphorylated after 24h of serum deprivation. The survival time of mutant EGFR transfected cells was prolonged under serum-free culture conditions, but not under standard culture conditions with 10% serum. These results suggest that cells with a mutant EGFR survive through the activation of the AKT and/or STAT3 pathways, even in low EGF microenvironments. This specific property due to EGFR mutation could be an important step of multistage lung cancer progression.",

While plant-based formulations have been used to treat cancer for centuries, current treatments usually involve poisonous mustard gas, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. While traditional plant-derived medicines are safe, what are the active principles in them and how do they mediate their effects against cancer is perhaps best illustrated by curcumin, a derivative of turmeric used for centuries to treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane derived from the Indian spice, turmeric (popularly called \"curry powder\") that has been shown to interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), apoptosis (activation of caspases and down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene products), proliferation (HER-2, EGFR, and AP-1), survival (PI3K/AKT pathway), invasion (MMP-9 and adhesion molecules), angiogenesis (VEGF), metastasis (CXCR-4) and inflammation (NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-6, IL-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX). The activity of curcumin reported against leukemia and lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, genitourinary cancers, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, melanoma, neurological cancers, and sarcoma reflects its ability to affect multiple targets.

The model manifests wide-spread dissemination of tumor cells leading to osteolytic bone lesions and liver metastases, common sites of clinical metastases. The maximum tolerated dose was 120 muCi of (213)Bi-7.16.4. The kinetics of marrow suppression and subsequent recovery were determined. Three days after left cardiac ventricular injection of 10(5) rat HER-2/neu--expressing syngeneic tumor cells, neu-N mice were treated with (a) 120 muCi (213)Bi-7.16.4, (b) 90 muCi (213)Bi-7.16.4, (c) 120 muCi (213)Bi-Rituximab (unreactive control), and (d) unlabeled 7.16.4. Treatment with 120 muCi (213)Bi-7.16.4 increased median survival time to 41 days compared with 28 days for the untreated controls (P < 0.0001); corresponding median survival times for groups b, c, and d were 36 (P < 0.001), 31 (P < 0.01), and 33 (P = 0.05) days, respectively.

We proposed that neuregulin-1 affects fetal lung maturation through a similar mechanism. Immunostaining showed neuregulin-1 in fetal lung that increased in fibroblasts at the onset of surfactant synthesis. Neuregulin-1 beta was found to be secreted by the fetal lung fibroblast and stimulated type II cell surfactant synthesis. Both fetal lung fibroblast-conditioned media and neuregulin-1 stimulated erbB2 receptor phosphorylation in type II cells. The effects of neuregulin-1 and of fibroblast-conditioned media on both surfactant synthesis and type II cell erbB2 phosphorylation were specifically blocked by antibody to neuregulin-1.

To overcome immune tolerance to HER-2, we formulated DNA vaccines that express both human HER-2 and heterologous rat Neu sequences in separate plasmids or as single hybrid constructs that encode HER-2/Neu fusion proteins. Candidate vaccines were tested in Her-2 transgenic (Tg) mice of BALB/c (BALB), BALB/cxC57BL/6 F1 (F1), or C57BL/6 (B6) background, which exhibit decreasing immune responsiveness to HER-2. Analysis of various cocktails or hybrid vaccines defined a requirement for particular combination of HER/2/Neu sequences to effectively prime immune effector cells in HER-2 Tg mice. In B6 HER-2 Tg mice, rejection of HER-2-positive tumors protected mice from HER-2-negative tumors, providing evidence of epitope spreading. Our findings show that a strategy of combining heterologous antigen with self-antigens could produce a potent DNA vaccine that may be applicable to other tumor-associated antigens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To evaluate the predictive factors for radiation response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the role of such factors in guiding high dose radiation therapy.;The first International Workshop on Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Lung Cancer was organized by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group and held in Athens, Greece under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Presentations at this meeting provided the outline of this report, which has also been supplemented with available data from the current literature.;The predictive factors for both the natural history and the therapy outcome of NSCLC are grouped as follows: (1) tumor related factors (anatomic factors); the extent of tumor (tumor stage) is one of most important prognostic factors affecting the therapy outcome. Tumor size (T stage), anatomical structures involved (T4 vs. T3 lesion), and the presence of regional lymph node metastasis have a significant impact on both prognosis and response to appropriate therapy; (2) host-related factors (clinical factors) that are important in therapy response include performance status, weight loss of more than 10% of body weight in the previous 6 months, and associated co-morbidities, i.e. pulmonary and cardiac diseases; (3) technical factors of radiation therapy which play a decisive role in successful outcome. The target volume should be defined accurately using modern imaging studies. The radiation dose fractionation schedule, in terms of the dose intensity and total dose, should be high enough to provide local tumor control in the majority of patients. Three-dimensional (3-D) conformal planning is an essential tool in dose escalation studies to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation; (4) biological/radiobiological/metabolic factors. Biologic markers resulting from genetic lesions in lung cancer are grouped as follows: (a) oncogene amplification and overexpression (aberrant gene expression) and mutated tumor suppressor genes -- ras gene, myc gene, HER-2/neu and survivin gene, p53 and mutated beta-tubulin gene; (b) tumor biologic/radiobiologic factors -- tumor cell proliferation kinetics, hypoxia, intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity, gamma factor, and DNA content; (c) enzymes and hormones: neuron-specific enolase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and enhanced glucose metabolic rate supported by increased glucose transporter protein. The surviving fraction of tumor cells at 2.0 Gy of radiation (SF2) as a measure of intrinsic tumor cell radiosensitivity, potential doubling time (T(Pot)) as a measure of the rate of tumor cell proliferation and gamma factor representing the slope of the survival curve at 50% survival rate are being investigated as potential predictors for therapy response. Enhanced glucose utilization, a hallmark of malignant transformation, is being studied as a potential monitor for therapy response by using PET-FDG.;Current data indicate that there is a dose-response relationship between radiation dose and local tumor control, and also between local tumor control and survival in stage III NSCLC. Therapeutic factors, i.e. total radiation dose, fractionation schedule and dose intensity, and use of 3-D conformal radiation to secure the optimum therapeutic ratio are important for improved local tumor control and survival. Future research should be directed towards radiation dose escalation using 3-D conformal therapy to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation in chemo-radiotherapy, and the use of this MTD for improved local tumor control and survival. Radiobiological, molecular, and metabolic markers may have potential for monitoring tumor response and optimizing radiation therapy.",

The untransfected SKOV3 cell line served as the blank control (CON) group. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of HER2 in the three different cell types, which were subsequently examined for growth inhibition using a cell counting kit-8 assay. The CON and KD cell strains were utilized to establish xenograft models in nude mice, primarily to detect the expression of the HER2 protein, and additionally to observe tumor size changes under the treatment of cisplatin (DDP) chemotherapy. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the levels of HER2 mRNA and protein in the KD cells. The suppression of HER2 expression resulted in an increase of chemotherapy sensitivity in the SKOV3 cells. HER2 protein expression decreased significantly following transduction with specific HER2-shRNA. Additionally, growth slowed significantly under treatment with DDP in ovarian cancer transplantation tumors. In conclusion, lentivirus-mediated HER2-shRNA effectively inhibits the expression of the HER2 gene, and increases the chemosensitivity to DDP in ovarian carcinoma.",

Our results suggest that CI-1033 effectively inhibits the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which co-expresses both EGFR and HER2 with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT.

We have also determined that hyaluronic acid stimulates CD44s-associated p185(HER2) tyrosine kinase activity, leading to an increase in the ovarian carcinoma cell growth. After transfection of the ovarian carcinoma cell line with the adenovirus 5 E1A gene, which is known to repress p185(HER2) expression, we observed that both surface CD44s expression and CD44s-mediated cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid are significantly reduced in the transfectant cells compared with the control cells.

Rats are tolerant to rat neu. Vaccination with this 'self' protein elicits no detectable immune response. The current studies evaluated whether tolerance to rat neu can be circumvented by immunizing with the highly homologous foreign human HER-2/neu protein. Rats were immunized with human HER-2/neu intracellular domain (hICD) protein that is 92% homologous to rat neu ICD. Animals immunized with hICD developed significant antibody and T-cell responses that were specific for both human HER-2/neu and rat neu. Neu-specific antibodies were present in titres of greater than 1:200,000. Analysis of the specificity of the antibody response using synthetic peptides demonstrated substantial reactivity to an epitope with 100% homology between rat and human protein. Significant T-cell responses (stimulation index > 10) to hICD and rat neu protein (stimulation index > 4) were detected. The T cells also responded to both human and rat ICD.

Unexpectedly, we found that only a limited effect on metastasis in MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mice compared with MMTV-neu;Nedd9(+/+) mice, but instead a dramatic reduction in tumor incidence (18 versus 80%), and a significantly increased latency until tumor appearance. Orthotopic reinjection and tail-vein injection of cells arising from tumors, coupled with in vivo analysis, indicated tumors arising in MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mice had undergone mutational selection that overcame the initial requirement for Nedd9. To better understand the defects in early tumor growth, we compared mammary progenitor cell pools from MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) versus MMTV-neu;Nedd9(+/+) mice. The MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) genotype selectively reduced both the number and colony-forming potential of mammary luminal epithelial progenitor cells, while not affecting basal epithelial progenitors. MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mammospheres had striking defects in morphology and cell polarity. All of these defects were seen predominantly in the context of the HER2/neu oncogene, and were not associated with randomization of the plane of mitotic division, but rather with depressed expression the cell attachment protein FAK, accompanied by increased sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors of FAK and SRC. Surprisingly, in spite of these significant differences, only minimal changes were observed in the gene expression profile of Nedd9(-/-) mice, indicating critical Nedd9-dependent differences in cell growth properties were mediated via post-transcriptional regulation of cell signaling. Coupled with emerging data indicating a role for NEDD9 in progenitor cell populations during the morphogenesis of other tissues, these results indicate a functional requirement for NEDD9 in the growth of mammary cancer progenitor cells.

Thirty-three cases of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma were tested for approximately 2800 mutations in 50 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, including EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, BRAF, ERBB2, JAK3, AKT1, ATM, MET, KIT, and PIK3CA. ALK immunostaining was performed, and ALK FISH was performed on cases with any degree of staining. Twenty-four of the 33 cases (72%) had at least one genetic abnormality: 19 cases (58%) had TP53 mutations; 10 cases (30%) had KRAS mutations; AKT1, JAK3, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations were observed in 1 case each (3%). Six of the 19 cases (32%) with a mutation in TP53 had simultaneous mutations in KRAS (18%). The cases with alterations in JAK3, BRAF, and NRAS also had mutations in TP53. The case showing a mutation in PIK3CA had a mutation in KRAS. No EGFR mutations were observed. One case had ALK gene rearrangement. ALK rearrangement was observed in a single case of sarcomatoid carcinoma (3%), which has currently available targeted therapy. Four tumors had mutations in genes with experimental molecular-based therapy, including BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1. Testing for targetable mutations should be considered for patients with pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, as a subset may benefit from currently approved drugs or clinical trials of novel therapeutic options available for other types of lung cancer.

BALB-neuT mice were vaccinated one, two and three times by subcutaneous (s.c.) and intramammary gland (im.g.) injection with rV-neuT or V-wt (wild-type vaccinia virus) starting at the stage in which mouse mammary gland displays atypical hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma. We demonstrated that vaccination using rV-neuT was more effective when started at an earlier stage of mammary carcinogenesis and after three vaccinations. The im.g. vaccination was more effective than the s.c. vaccination in inhibiting mammary carcinogenesis, eliciting anti-Neu antibodies, increasing anti-Neu IgG2a/G3 isotypes and inducing antibodies able to trigger mammary tumor cells apoptosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The better protective ability of rV-neuT im.g. vaccination was associated with its capacity to induce a superior degree of in vivo mammary cancer cells apoptosis.

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression. Combination of honokiol with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin presented synergistic effects on induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells.

Overall, 33 RTKs were expressed in at least 25% of the patients. Several RTKs were significantly expressed higher in tumors that ultimately metastasized. The hazard risk for metastasis development in stage I/II disease was increased at least 3-fold for tumors with high expression levels of insulin receptor, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1, epidermal growth factor receptor, ERBB2, ERBB3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, or leukocyte tyrosine kinase. Relative risks were reduced 3-fold by expression of EPHB6 or DKFZ1. Three members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family were associated with a high risk of metastasis, emphasizing the validity of our data.

One hundred and two patients with tongue SCC treated from 1990 to 1995 were studied. Clinical and treatment data were obtained from the medical records and histopathological features revised.

The intracytoplasmatic expression of ErbB2 as well as Ki-67 nuclear staining were significantly associated with a high risk of recurrence by predicting both disease free survival (log-rank test, p=0.0096 and p=0.0047, respectively) and overall survival (log-rank test, p=0.0029 and p=0.0001, respectively).

We also analyzed the relationships between the expression levels of these molecules and the recurrence-free survival.;The E-cadherin expression was higher in the central area than in the peripheral area and metastatic lymph nodes (median staining score: 60 vs. 50, 30); the CD44 expression was higher in the central area than in the metastatic lymph nodes (117 vs. 90); and the EGFR expression was higher in the central area than in the peripheral area and metastatic lymph nodes (163 vs. 130, 110). Low CD44 expression in the central area, low EGFR expression in the peripheral area and high SOX2 expression in the metastatic lymph nodes were associated with a shorter recurrence-free survival (p < 0.01, p = 0.02, p = 0.03, respectively).;Our findings confirmed that some molecular markers exhibited different expression levels in anatomically different areas and suggested that area-by-area immunohistochemical analysis for biomarkers may provide useful information for more precise prediction of the recurrence.",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining were performed on 72 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endometrial carcinoma specimens. Vysis combination HER-2/neu and centromere 17 probe mixture was applied to isolated tumor cell nuclei. A minimum of 200 nuclei were scored for each specimen using standard signal enumeration criteria. A specimen was considered amplified with 5% or greater amplified nuclei. Tissue sections were immunostained with polyclonal antibody against p185erb-2 transmembrane glycoprotein. Immunohistochemical reactivity was scored on a three-tiered scale. HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein overexpression were detected in 15 of 72 (21%) and 12 of 72 (17%) of the specimens, respectively, with 2 cases of normal copy overexpression and 5 cases of amplification without overexpression. Both amplification and overexpression were associated with higher grade tumors. Amplification was associated with clear cell and serous subtypes (p = 0.002), and overexpression with only clear cell type (p = 0.006). Using the proportional hazards model of survival, amplification was found to have significant negative predictive value beyond stage, grade, and cell type (p = 0.002).

Administration of BITC at 1 and 3 mmol/kg diet for 25 weeks markedly suppressed the incidence and/or burden of mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma in female MMTV-neu mice without causing weight loss or affecting neu protein level. For example, cumulative incidence of hyperplasia/carcinoma was significantly lower in mice fed BITC-supplemented diets compared with control mice (P = 0.01 by Fisher's test). The BITC-mediated prevention of mammary carcinogenesis correlated with suppression of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The average number of Ki-67-positive cells in the carcinoma lesions of 3 mmol BITC group was lower by approximately 21% (P < 0.05) compared with tumors from control mice. Apoptotic bodies in the mammary tumor were higher by about 2- to 2.5-fold in the 1 and 3 mmol BITC treatment groups (P < 0.05) compared with control group. The BITC administration also resulted in overexpression of E-cadherin and infiltration of CD3(+) T-cells in the tumor. Although BITC treatment increased cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro, dietary feeding of BITC failed to augment NK cell lytic activity in an ex vivo assay.

Synergistic interaction was observed in 2D and in 3D cultures conditions, both in fully epithelial cells expressing all ErbB receptors, and in cells that had undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition and expressed low levels of ErbB3. We provided evidences suggesting that differential modulation of ErbB receptors by vorinostat or VPA, also at low doses corresponding to plasma levels easily reached in treated patients, is responsible for the observed synergism. In details, we showed in epithelial cells that both vorinostat and VPA induced time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of all three ErbB receptors and of downstream signaling. On the contrary, in A3-resistant mesenchymal cells, we observed time- and dose-dependent increase of mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of ErbB3, paralleled by down-regulation of EGFR and ErbB2. Our results suggest that the combination of a HDACi plus an anti-ErbB3 MoAb represents a viable strategy that warrants further evaluation for the treatment of NSCLC patients. ",

We found HER2 mutations in 9 (2.2%) cases. Seven (78%) of the mutations were in frame duplications/insertions at codons 776-779 (YVMA), the other 2 were base substitutions resulting in aminoacid changes. The hotspot mutation at bases 776-779 was previously found to be the most frequent HER2 mutation in Asiatic patients. The distribution of mutations was significantly different between conventional lung adenocarcinomas (CLAs) and lung adenocarcinomas with bronchioloalveolar features (ABAFs).

Thus, differentiating a primary cutaneous process from a metastatic breast carcinoma can be nearly impossible. In all, 10-34% of breast carcinomas overexpress HER-2 protein, a membrane-associated protein that functions in cell differentiation, adhesion and motility. As expression of this gene in cutaneous neoplasms has not been well characterized, we sought to determine HER-2 expression in a sample of benign and malignant cutaneous eccrine and apocrine neoplasms and to determine if there is value in using this protein expression in differentiating primary cutaneous from metastatic breast lesions. Totally, 85 primary cutaneous neoplasms and 11 cutaneous metastases from HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were retrieved from archived material at our institute. All cases were evaluated for HER-2 protein expression using the Dako Hercept Test kit. Membranous HER-2 staining was noted in three of the 85 cutaneous adnexal neoplasms: one hidrocystoma and two nodular hidradenomas. Seven of the 11 cutaneous metastases from HER-2-positive breast carcinomas maintained moderate-to-strong HER-2 expression. In conclusion, while 10-34% of breast carcinomas overexpress the HER-2 protein, only 3.5% of cutaneous apocrine and eccrine neoplasms in this study stained with the HER-2 antibody. These HER-2-positive cutaneous neoplasms typically do not pose a diagnostic dilemma in the setting of differentiation from breast metastasis. Additionally, although histologically these breast and cutaneous lesions may have morphologic similarities, the relative lack of HER-2 overexpression suggests that they are different nosologically. Finally, this study suggests that HER-2 protein expression can be a useful tool in differentiating a primary cutaneous appendageal neoplasm from HER-2 expressing metastatic breast carcinoma.",

RHuT encodes a protein in which the 410 NH(2)-terminal residues are from the neu extracellular domain and the remaining residues from Her-2. Almost symmetrically, HuRT encodes for a protein in which the 390 NH(2)-terminal residues are from Her-2 and the remainder from neu. The ability of RHuT and HuRT to elicit a protective response to neu and Her-2 in wild-type mice and in transgenic mice tolerant to neu and Her-2 proteins was compared with that of plasmids coding for the fully rat or fully human extracellular and transmembrane domains of the Erbb-2 receptor. In most cases, RHuT and HuRT elicited a stronger response, although this chimeric benefit is markedly modulated by the location of the heterologous moiety in the protein coded by the plasmid, the immune tolerance of the responding mouse, and the kind of Erbb-2 orthologue on the targeted tumor.",

The high incidence of HER2 overexpression in breast and ovary carcinomas prompted us to synthesize protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostins) which selectively inhibit the HER2 kinase activity. Two groups of tyrphostins were developed: one highly selective in inhibiting HER1 as opposed to HER2, the other highly selective in inhibiting HER2. Both the HER1 and the HER2 selective blockers were competitive with ATP binding. This suggests that even though the kinase domains of the respective receptors show an 80% degree of homology it is possible to design small molecules capable of discriminating between them. These results also show that the two kinases differ in their ATP binding sites. Mitogenic signaling induced by EGF in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing either HER1 or HER1-2 (possessing the HER2 kinase domain) was blocked identically by the agents that discriminate between the two in vitro. This paradox was further explored and elucidated. We propose that high intracellular ATP levels prevent inhibitor binding to the receptor. The antiproliferative action of the two distinct selective tyrphostins observed may result from the inhibition of a downstream element, presumably a tyrosine kinase, which mediates mitogenic signaling.",

The injection of GI101A breast cancer cells into the mammary fatpad (mfp) produced lung metastases in 25% of tumor-bearing mice. Selecting cells from the lung metastases and recycling in vivo resulted in the isolation of a series of variant cell lines. These cell lines were tested for tumorigenicity and metastasis in nude mice following mfp injection compared with the original cell line, and in vitro expression of factors associated with the metastatic phenotype measured. The in vivo selected cell lines were more aggressive, with higher tumor take, faster local growth rate and increased incidence (> or = 85%) and extent of lung metastasis. However, the metastasis-selected variants showed no increases in expression of the growth factor receptors EGFR or HER-2, and the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF-A and IL-8. Immunohistochemistry of mfp tumors revealed no differences in microvessel density (counting CD-31 positive structures) and cell proliferation (PCNA-positive cells) comparing the GI101A line with selected variants. No TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the tumors of the metastasis-derived variant, with a small number of cells undergoing apoptosis detected in sections of GI101A tumors. In vitro, the metastasis-derived variants were found to have a more robust expression of phosphorylated PKB/Akt, with or without EGF or serum stimulation, suggesting an association between Akt activation and metastatic ability.

Furthermore, when the drug was given early in tumorigenesis, it did not reduce the progression of preinvasive to invasive tumors nor prevent lung metastasis. Reduction of prostaglandin levels was, however, achieved in mammary tumors of treated mice.

Cell viability, colony formation, DCFH-DA fluorescence microscopy, western blotting, HER-2/neu immunofluorescence imaging, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assays were carried out to determine the anti-cancer effects of AC.;MTT and colony formation assays showed that AC induced a dose-dependent reduction in SKOV-3 cell growth. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that HER-2/neu activity and tyrosine phosphorylation were significantly inhibited by AC. Furthermore, AC treatment significantly inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt and their downstream effector β-catenin. We also observed that AC caused G2/M arrest mediated by down-regulation of cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin B1, and Cdk1 and increased p27 expression. Notably, AC induced apoptosis, which was associated with DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release, caspase-9/-3 activation, PARP degradation, and Bcl-2/Bax dysregulation. An increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in AC-treated cells, whereas the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented AC-induced cell death, HER-2/neu depletion, PI3K/Akt inactivation, and Bcl-2/Bax dysregulation, indicating that AC-induced cell death was mediated by ROS generation.;These results suggest that AC may exert anti-tumor activity against human ovarian carcinoma by suppressing HER-2/neu signaling pathways.",

Novel therapeutic options are needed for metastasized adrenocortical cancer. Therefore, we studied expression of the HER-2/neu cell surface receptor protein using three different antibodies in 12 adrenal adenomas, 17 adrenocortical carcinomas and 5 pheochromocytomas. Normal adrenals (n = 5) served as controls. One adenoma showed very weak membranous immunostaining with the Dako antibody, two others showed a nonspecific cytoplasmic staining pattern. A nonspecific reaction in the cytoplasm was demonstrable in seven carcinomas with the Novocastra antibody. In all pheochromocytomas, a granular intracytoplasmic and, rarely, slightly membranous immunostaining with the Dako antibody was found. From our data we conclude that specific and significant membranous immunostaining indicating strong overexpression (grade 3) of HER-2/neu protein is not present in adrenocortical tumors. The granular cytoplasmic immunostaining of the medulla may be helpful for differentiation of adrenocortical tumors from pheochromocytomas.",

In an effort to find effective irreversible inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase family (mainly HER2), two series of HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors with thieno[3,2-d]pyridine and thieno[2,3-d]pyridine as central part and with a basic α,β-unsaturated amide side chain were developed. The α,β-unsaturated amide side chain (the Michael acceptor) at the 6-position, which forms a covalent bond to Cys773 located in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR enzyme, is a major factor in the generation of irreversible inhibition. In our study, thienopyrimidine instead of quinazoline was used as the central structure, and different substituents were introduced at the 4-position to investigate the structure-activity relationships. The thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 16a-d showed potent HER2 enzyme inhibition and anti-proliferative activity against SK-BR-3 cells.

To identify the molecular events responsible for effective tumor prevention and to define the tumor gene expression signature, we used microarrays to analyze the expression profile of mammary tissue of untreated transgenic mice and of vaccine-treated, tumor-free mice at different time points. Mammary tissue from vaccinated mice displayed a gene expression profile different from that of untreated, tumor-bearing mice but similar to that of normal/hyperplastic mammary gland. Comparison of treated and untreated mice at 15 weeks of age revealed up-regulation of genes encoding antibodies, chemokines, gamma-interferon-induced genes and inflammatory molecules, and down-regulation of early genes induced by tumor development. The gene expression signature of HER-2/neu-transformed tumor cells showed modulation of genes promoting proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and metastasis and inhibiting apoptosis and immune response. Meta-analysis of microarray data on human breast cancer showed that the signature of tumors arising in murine HER-2/neu transgenic model correctly classified human HER-2/neu-expressing tumors and normal breast tissue. Moreover murine and human HER-2/neu-positive tumors share the signature of basal-like breast cancers.

However, mRNA-based methods are not appropriate for use in clinical practices. In this study, we examined MGB1 protein expression in 480 tumors from various organs using immunohistochemical detection and a tissue microarray technique. Breast cancers expressing MGB1 were also analyzed clinicopathologically to determine whether these cancers constitute a characteristic subset. Immunohistochemically, MGB1 was expressed specifically in breast cancers. Of the other cancers examined, including 29 of the head and neck, eight of the thyroid, 106 of the lung, 35 of the gastrointestinal tract, three of the pancreas, 14 of the uterine cervix and 13 of the ovary, none were positive for MGB1 except a proportion of salivary gland tumors (6/11, 55%) and endometrial cancers (3/23, 13%). Among the 238 breast cancers, MGB1 was expressed in 114 (48%), most of which were classified histologically as invasive duct or lobular carcinomas. Clinicopathologically, MGB1 expression was associated with positive expression of estrogen receptors and negative expression of CK5, but not with pathological stage, HER2 gene amplification or p53 immunoreactivity. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed prolonged disease-free survival in patients with MGB1-positive breast cancers (log rank test, P=0.016), but the Cox proportional hazard model failed to confirm that MGB1 was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio 1.77, P=0.1755). In terms of practical diagnosis, MGB1 immunohistochemistry can serve as a differential marker of breast cancer metastasis from primary lung cancer for two reasons. Firstly, HER2-positive breast cancer frequently lacks estrogen receptor expression, but MGB1 is expressed in about half of this subtype. Secondly, as primary lung adenocarcinomas may express estrogen receptors, MGB1 expression provides further discrimination of the origin of breast cancers.",

In this article, the role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in detecting companion biomarkers is reviewed. The hormone receptor (HR) is a companion bi- omarker for hormonal therapy in breast cancers, and IHC is the standard assay for detecting HR expression. The overexpression/amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is predictive of a favorable response to anti-HER2 agents such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pertuzumab. IHC and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are used to determine the HER2 status. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Recently, mutated EGFRs have been detected by IHC with mutation-specific antibodies, although it shows a lower sensitivity and specificity than DNA sequencing. In addition, NSCLCs with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene are highly responsive to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. Companion diagnostic assays for crizotinib are IHC, FISH, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor a mutations, related to the effectiveness of imatinib. Thus, definite pathologic diagnosis using IHC is necessary for the appropriate treatment of GISTs. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, improves the treatment outcome for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the field, confirmation of CD20 expression by IHC is necessary for application of the drug. Finally, the author discusses the possibility of being able to predict the response to cytotoxic agents using IHC of solute carrier transporters.",

In addition, we report GATA3 expression in matched primary and metastatic breast carcinomas in 30 patients with known estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her-2 status, including 5 with ER and/or PR loss from primary to metastasis. Tissue microarrays containing 5 to 10 cores per tumor were stained for GATA3, scored as follows: 0 (0-5%), 1+ (6%-25%), 2+ (26%-50%), 3+ (51%-75%), and 4+ (>75%). GATA3 labeling was seen in 67% (66/99) of primary ductal carcinomas including 43% of triple-negative and 54% of metaplastic carcinomas. In contrast, stromal GATA3 labeling was seen in only 1 fibroepithelial neoplasm. GATA3 labeling was seen in 90% (27/30) of primary breast carcinomas in the paired cohort, including 67% of triple-negative carcinomas. GATA3 labeling was overwhelmingly maintained in paired metastases. Notably, GATA3 was maintained in all \"luminal loss\" metastases, which showed ER and/or PR loss. In conclusion, GATA3 expression is maintained between matched primary and metastatic carcinomas including ER-negative cases. GATA3 can be particularly useful as a marker for metastatic breast carcinoma, especially triple-negative and metaplastic carcinomas, which lack specific markers of mammary origin.

According to this new biological classification, the objectives of our study were to assess the clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in order to classify this subtype of breast carcinoma. A total of 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified from the Institut Curie files. Clinical information was available for 16 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. Morphologically, all tumors were graded according to the system defined by Kleer and Oberman (histologic and nuclear grade). Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, HER-2, KIT, basal (CK5/6) and luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. One out of 18 tumors was nuclear grade 1 (16%), nine were nuclear grade 2 (50%) and eight were nuclear grade 3 (44%). All cases were estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 negative. Epithelial cells were strongly positive around glandular lumina with one or both cytokeratins, identifying the coexistence of CK5/6+ cells, CK5/6 and CK8/18+ cells, CK8/18+ cells and p63+ cells. All cases (100%) were also KIT positive. In all, 15 patients were treated by surgery. Nine of them received adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 patients. In all, 14 patients were alive. Two of them, initially treated by surgery only, presented a local recurrence. Two patients died (one of them treated by radiation therapy only died from her disease). Our study shows that adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a special, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 negative and highly KIT-positive, basal-like breast carcinoma, associated with an excellent prognosis.

Three patented mAbs are currently approved in clinical cancer treatment: Trastuzumab (Herceptin) directed against HER2 and used to treat breast cancer, Cetuximab and Panitumumab which are anti-EGFR antibodies approved for colorectal cancer treatment. Unfortunately, these mAbs are facing cancer resistance mediated by paracrine activation of other ErbB members or compensatory ErbB signalling factors. In parallel, three TKIs have been approved to treat cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa), Erlotinib (Tarceva) inhibiting specifically EGFR and approved to treat non small cell lung cancer and Lapatinib (Tykerb) which has the dual specificity EGFR/HER2 and recently approved to treat metastatic breast cancer.

A PRL receptor (PRLR) antagonist, G129R, has been developed, which indirectly inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 (p-HER2) in human breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigate the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) upon this molecular cross-talk using tumor cells and CAFs derived from spontaneous mammary tumors of female MMTV-neu transgenic mice. Tumors were resected and cultured as small tumor chunks (~3 mm3) or were cultured in monolayer. G129R reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu (p-Neu) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50~10 μg/ml) in tumor chunks, but had no effect on primary tumor epithelial cells grown in monolayer. Direct co-culture of mouse or human tumor epithelial cell lines with CAFs restored the epithelial cells' response to G129R, similar to that observed in mouse tumor chunks. The addition of PRL, as expected, induced p-Neu in both the tumor chunk and co-culture models. The inhibitory effect of G129R was absent when CAFs were physically separated from mouse tumor epithelial cells using a transwell system, or when CAFs were replaced with normal fibroblasts in direct co-culture with human or mouse tumor epithelial cells. In vivo, G129R reduced p-Neu levels in primary mammary tumors of mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CAFs play a critical role in bridging the cross-talk between PRL and HER2/Neu in both mouse and human models of breast cancer. The inhibitory effects of G129R on p-Neu and on tumor growth are dependent upon interactions of tumor epithelial cells with CAFs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase HER-2/neu is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast and ovarian cancer. Recent excitement has surrounded the therapeutic effects of HER-2-blocking therapy strategies and has rekindled interest on the molecular mechanisms of HER-2/neu in tumor biology. To study the role of HER-2/neu overexpression in vivo, we used a murine fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3-her2) conditionally expressing human HER-2/neu under control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. Expression of HER-2 could be down-regulated below detection limit (>625-fold dilution) by exposure of NIH3T3-her2 cells to anhydrotetracycline (ATc). Subcutaneous injection of NIH3T3-her2 cells into nude mice resulted in rapid tumor growth. Mice with mean tumor volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9, and 14.9 cm(3) were treated daily with 10 mg/kg ATc to switch off HER-2/neu expression, producing reductions in tumor size of 100, 98.1, 81.4, and 74.2%, respectively, by 7 days after onset of ATc administration (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test). Different long-term effects of HER-2 down-regulation were observed when mice with small (0.2 cm(3); n = 7), intermediate (0.8-1.2 cm(3); n = 10) and large (> or =1.9 cm(3); n = 11) tumors received ATc for up to 40 days. Complete remission was observed for 100, 40, and 18% of the small-, intermediate-, and large-sized tumors, respectively (P = 0.003). However, after 20-45 days of ATc administration, recurrent tumor growth was observed for all mice, even in those with previous complete remissions. The time periods for which mean tumor volume could be suppressed to volumes <0.1 cm(3) under ATc administration were 34, 22, 8, and 0 days for tumors with initial volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9 and 14.9 cm(3), respectively (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test). Interestingly, HER-2 remained below the detection limit in recurrent tumor tissue, suggesting that initially HER-2-dependent tumors switched to HER-2 independence. The \"second hits\" leading to HER-2-independent tumor growth have not yet been identified. The rapid regression of tumors after down-regulation of HER-2 was explained by two independent mechanisms: (a) a block in cell cycle progression, as evidenced by a decrease in Ki-67 antigen expression from 40% before ATc treatment to 8.3% after 7 days of ATc treatment; and (b) induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by caspase-3 activation and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Tdt)-mediated nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). In conclusion, we have shown that switching off HER-2 may disturb the sensitive balance between cell proliferation and cell death, leading to apoptosis and tumor remission. Tumor remission was dependent on the volume of the tumors before down-regulation of HER-2/neu.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The transition from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer (IBC) is a crucial step in breast cancer progression. The specific alterations that govern this transition have not been elucidated. HER2/neu is frequently overexpressed in DCIS but is less common in IBC, thereby suggesting additional requirements for transformation. To identify genes capable of cooperating with HER2/neu to fully transform mammary epithelial cells, we used an insertional mutagenesis screen on cells isolated from wild-type neu expressing mice and identified the E3 ligase HACE1 as HER2 cooperative tumor suppressor gene. Loss of HACE1 expression is commonly seen in clinical breast cancer data sets. HACE1 downregulation in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) results in the accumulation of the activated GTP-bound Rac1 partially transforming these cells. Overexpression of HER2 activates Rac1, which further accumulates upon HACE1 loss resulting in Rac1 hyperactivation. Although the knockdown of HACE1 or overexpression of HER2 alone in HMECs is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, HER2 overexpression combined with HACE1 downregulation fully transforms HMECs resulting in robust tumor formation. The pharmaceutical interference of Rac function abrogates the effects of HACE1 loss both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in marked reduction in tumor burden. Our work supports a critical role for HACE1 in breast cancer progression and identifies patients that may benefit from Rac-targeted therapies. ",

Five ductal carcinomas in situ overexpressed ERBB2 and showed preserved E-CD expression. Forty-four of 226 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (19.47%) showed ERBB2 overexpression, and a statistically significant relationship was found between ERBB2 overexpression and high histological grade. E-CD expression was preserved in 111 cases (49.1%) and correlated with the histological grade. However, no significant relationship was found between ERBB2 and E-CD expression. None of the 16 infiltrating lobular carcinomas expressed ERBB2 or E-CD.

We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu (and hence signaling activity) is highly variable among mammary carcinomas.

Using a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, we investigated the role of HER-2/neu overexpression on resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel treatment. A control vector transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line (MCF/neo) and a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 line (MCF/18) were treated with various concentrations of docetaxel or paclitaxel. Cell number was assessed using the MTT tetrazolium dye assay. In the control vector transfected MCF/neo cell line, paclitaxel and docetaxel gave similar dose-dependent growth inhibition ( p = 0.175). In HER-2/neu transfected MCF/18 cells, docetaxel treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition similar to that seen in MCF/neo cells. Paclitaxel, however, gave significantly less growth inhibition than docetaxel in the HER-2/neu overexpressing MCF/18 cells (p = 0.0003). These data suggest that HER-2/neu overexpression may contribute to paclitaxel resistance.

Although specific ErbB2-targeted therapies have been designed, only a small percentage of patients respond to these treatments and most of them eventually relapse. The existence of this population of particularly aggressive and non-responding or relapsing patients urges the search for novel therapies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cannabinoids might constitute a new therapeutic tool for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast tumors. We analyzed their antitumor potential in a well established and clinically relevant model of ErbB2-driven metastatic breast cancer: the MMTV-neu mouse. We also analyzed the expression of cannabinoid targets in a series of 87 human breast tumors.;Our results show that both Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the most abundant and potent cannabinoid in marijuana, and JWH-133, a non-psychotropic CB2 receptor-selective agonist, reduce tumor growth, tumor number, and the amount/severity of lung metastases in MMTV-neu mice. Histological analyses of the tumors revealed that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce cancer cell apoptosis, and impair tumor angiogenesis. Cannabinoid antitumoral action relies, at least partially, on the inhibition of the pro-tumorigenic Akt pathway. We also found that 91% of ErbB2-positive tumors express the non-psychotropic cannabinoid receptor CB2.;Taken together, these results provide a strong preclinical evidence for the use of cannabinoid-based therapies for the management of ErbB2-positive breast cancer.",

Because natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is thought to contribute to the therapeutic effects of trastuzumab, we have established a cell culture system to select for ADCC-resistant SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer and MCF7 mammary carcinoma cells. Ovarian cancer cells down-regulated HER2 expression, resulting in a more resistant phenotype. MCF7 breast cancer cells, however, failed to develop resistance in vitro. Instead, treatment with trastuzumab and polyclonal NK cells resulted in the preferential survival of individual sphere-forming cells that displayed a CD44(high)CD24(low) \"cancer stem cell-like\" phenotype and expressed significantly less HER2 compared with non-stem cells. Likewise, the CD44(high)CD24(low) population was also found to be more immunoresistant in SK-BR3, MDA-MB231, and BT474 breast cancer cell lines. When immunoselected MCF7 cells were then re-expanded, they mostly lost the observed phenotype to regenerate a tumor cell culture that displayed the initial HER2 surface expression and ADCC-susceptibility, but was enriched in CD44(high)CD24(low) cancer stem cells. This translated into increased clonogenicity in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Thus, we provide evidence that the induction of ADCC by trastuzumab and NK cells may spare the actual tumor-initiating cells, which could explain clinical relapse and progress. Moreover, our observation that the \"relapsed\" in vitro cultures show practically identical HER2 surface expression and susceptibility toward ADCC suggests that the administration of trastuzumab beyond relapse might be considered, especially when combined with an immune-stimulatory treatment that targets the escape variants.",

We have designed several peptidomimetics to block the HER2-mediated dimerization, resulting in antiproliferative activity for cancer cells. In this work, we have investigated the structure-activity relationships of peptidomimetic analogs of Compound 5. Compound 5 was conformationally constrained by N- and C-terminal modification and cyclization as well as by substitution with d-amino acids at the N-and C-termini. Among the compounds studied in this work, a peptidomimetic Compound 21 with d-amino acid substitution and its N- and C-termini capped with acetyl and amide functional groups and a reversed sequence compared to that of Compound 5 exhibited better antiproliferative activity in HER2-overexpressed breast, ovarian, and lung cancer cell lines. Compound 21 was further evaluated for its protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibition ability using enzyme fragment complementation assay, proximity ligation assay, and Western blot analysis. Results suggested that Compound 21 is able to block HER2:HER3 interaction and inhibit phosphorylation of the kinase domain of HER2.

Previously, we reported that HER-2 synthetic small interfering RNA (HER-2 siRNA) could suppress the growth of human nasopharyngeal KB tumor xenografts by intratumoral injection with lipid-based nanoparticles; however, complete regression of the tumor was not achieved. In this study, we investigated antitumor activity by RNA interference in combination with paclitaxel (PTX) for KB cells using HER-2 siRNA and HER-2 short hairpin RNA-expressing plasmid DNA (HER-2 shRNA pDNA). Suppression of HER-2 expression by siRNA or shRNA pDNA caused significant reduction of proliferation by inducing apoptosis and enhancing the sensitivity for PTX in HER-2 positive KB cells. Interestingly, an HER-2 antibody trastuzumab could not increase the antitumor effect by PTX in KB xenografts. Combination therapy by intratumoral injection of HER-2 siRNA or HER-2 shRNA pDNA with PTX significantly inhibited the tumor growth of xenografts compared with each therapy used individually. In particular, HER-2 shRNA pDNA plus PTX largely extended the mean survival days compared with HER-2 siRNA plus PTX. Collectively, these findings suggest that HER-2 shRNA-based combined therapy with PTX could be a novel strategy to inhibit the progression of HER-2-positive cancer.",

Detectable cell division cycle 7 expression was found in 1088 (57%) of breast cancer specimens and 228 (11.9%) exhibited a moderate or strong expression. High levels of cell division cycle 7 expression were significantly related to medullary histotype (P < .0001); high tumor grade (P < .0001); negative estrogen receptor status (P < .0001); high Ki67 expression level (P < .0001); p53 and p16 overexpression (P < .0001); and amplification of HER2 (P < .0001), c-myc (P < .0001), MDM2 (P = .043), CCND1 (P = .0084), and ESR1 (P = .0012) as well as with the number of amplified genes (P < .0001). There was also a tendency towards worse prognosis in cell division cycle 7 positive as compared to negative breast cancers. The relationship between cell division cycle 7 and number of amplifications was independent from tumor proliferation raising the possibility of a direct influence of cell division cycle 7 expression for amplification development.

However, besides its cytotoxic effects on malignant cells it might also affect the biology of surviving cells. Since overexpression of HER-2 receptors on malignant cells is a prerequisite for the therapeutic efficacy of Herceptin, it seems important to know whether previous irradiation changes their overexpression. The experiments performed in this work were aimed to determine whether X-ray irradiation of MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cell lines, besides its cytotoxic action, affects the overexpression of HER-2 protein. Determination of the cytotoxic effect of X-ray irradiation was done using trypan blue test. The breast carcinoma cell responsiveness to herceptin treatment in the presence of 10% fresh human serum (from healthy volunteer's) in the presence or absence of 25 microg/ml of herceptin, in vitro before and after cell-irradiation, was evaluated by MTT test. The degree of HER-2 overexpression was determined by immunocytochemistry, using DAKO HercepTest. Preliminary results obtained in this work showed that X-ray irradiation, besides its cytotoxic effect on malignant cells, could lead to overexpression of HER-2 receptors on (initially by immunocytochemistry, HER-2 negative) tumor cells, indicating change in biology of treated tumor cells. Further investigation in this direction will probably be helpful to elucidate this task in order to improve the selection of irradiated patients for Herceptin therapy.",

Although these problems are partly alleviated by the use of validated, standardised 'kits', there may be considerable cost involved in their use. Prior to testing it may therefore be an advantage to be able to predict from basic pathology data whether a cancer is likely to overexpress HER2. In this study, we have correlated pathology features of cancers with the frequency of HER2 overexpression assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using HercepTest (Dako). In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) has been used to re-test the equivocal cancers and interobserver variation in assessing HER2 overexpression has been examined by a slide circulation scheme. Of the 1536 cancers, 1144 (74.5%) did not overexpress HER2. Unequivocal overexpression (3+ by IHC) was seen in 186 cancers (12%) and an equivocal result (2+ by IHC ) was seen in 206 cancers (13%). Of the 156 IHC 3+ cancers for which complete data was available, 149 (95.5%) were ductal NST and 152 (97%) were histological grade 2 or 3. Only 1 of 124 infiltrating lobular carcinomas (0.8%) showed HER2 overexpression. None of the 49 'special types' of carcinoma showed HER2 overexpression. Re-testing by FISH of a proportion of the IHC 2+ cancers showed that only 25 (23%) of those assessable exhibited HER2 gene amplification, but 46 of the 47 IHC 3+ cancers (98%) were confirmed as showing gene amplification. Circulating slides for the assessment of HER2 score showed a moderate level of agreement between pathologists (kappa 0.4). As a result of this study we would advocate consideration of a triage approach to HER2 testing. Infiltrating lobular and special types of carcinoma may not need to be routinely tested at presentation nor may grade 1 NST carcinomas in which only 1.4% have been shown to overexpress HER2. Testing of these carcinomas may be performed when HER2 status is required to assist in therapeutic or other clinical/prognostic decision-making. The highest yield of HER2 overexpressing carcinomas is seen in the grade 3 NST subgroup in which 24% are positive by IHC.",

Here a cohort of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of the major (parotid and submandibular) salivary glands are analyzed for a molecular genetic alteration, HER-2/neu gene amplification, and gene amplification and expression results are compared with long-term clinical follow-up information. Archival tissues resected from 58 patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma of salivary glands were evaluated for HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and for gene expression by immunohistochemistry in a blinded fashion. Clinical follow-up information was compared with the results of these analyses to determine whether there were significant associations. Overexpression, identified as membrane immunostaining by immunohistochemistry, was observed in 22 of 58 (38%) mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Gene amplification, characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization, was observed in 12 (21%) cases. Eleven of the 12 cases with gene amplification were also immunostained for HER-2/neu. Both gene amplification (P = 0.0001, P < 0.0001) and immunostaining (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001) were correlated with shorter disease-free interval and poorer overall patient survival, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that HER-2/neu immunostaining and amplification were markers of poor prognosis independent of histopathological grade, tumor size, and involvement of regional lymph nodes. HER-2/neu is amplified and/or overexpressed in approximately one-third of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of salivary glands. Amplification and/or overexpression appears to be an independent marker of poor prognosis in mucoepidermoid carcinomas of the salivary glands as it is in carcinomas of the breast, ovary, and endometrium.",

EGFR was expressed in non-neoplastic mucosa, adenomas and carcinomas with a statistically significant increase in expression in adenomas compared with non-neoplastic mucosa (p < 0.001). There was also a statistically significant increase in nuclear staining intensity for pERK (p < 0.001) and pMEK (p < 0.001) in adenomas compared to non-neoplastic mucosa.;This is the first study investigating the expression of these receptors in non-neoplastic mucosa, adenomas and carcinomas from FAP patients. HER2 is not upregulated in the tumours of FAP patients, while EGFR appears to be upregulated in most adenomas and carcinomas, with associated upregulation of pERK and pMEK.

Its relevance as a novel biomarker in lung, pancreatic, renal, and cervical adenocarcinoma was recently revealed. However, its role in breast carcinogenesis and tumor progression is not yet established. Basal-like carcinoma was initially identified by gene expression profiling. It accounts for 15% to 30% of all breast cancers. These tumors express basal epithelial markers including cytokeratin 5 but lack expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), therefore, are often referred to as triple negative breast cancer. They have been found to be associated with a worse overall and disease-free survival. In this retrospective study, we examined the IMP3 expression in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and correlated its expression with morphological and biologic prognostic factors. The study group comprised 138 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma retrieved from the surgical pathologic files for a 10-year period from 1997 to 2006. Survival data and clinical stage were available on all 138 patients. Tumor characteristics including size, grade, lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status were obtained from pathologic reports. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using mouse monoclonal antibody against IMP3 and CK5/6. Of the 138 breast cancer cases, IMP3 expression was seen in 45 (33%). Twenty-five of the IMP3+ cases were triple negative. We found significant correlation between IMP3 expression and higher grade (P = .001), necrosis (P< .0001) triple negative, and CK5/6 expression (P < .0001 for each). Cox multivariate analysis showed a hazard ratio of IMP3 expression at 3.14 (P = .05).

Microscopic glass slides from biopsies and immunohistochemical test results were also analyzed. Biomarkers studied included cytokeratin 7, nuclear estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2, and E-cadherin.;All orbital metastatic lesions were lobular (nonductal) carcinomas that could arise as late as 24 years after the diagnosis of the primary breast tumors. The average age of patients at the time or orbital presentation was 64 years. Metastases were composed of small tumor cells with round, orthochromatic nuclei, and a small amount of cytoplasm. The cells were disposed in a variably fibrotic tumor-associated stroma. Two lesions were variants of lobular carcinoma-namely, alveolar and pleomorphic (the latter displaying cellular crowding, with some degree of nuclear atypia and less stroma). Three of the 9 orbital metastases presented with enophthalmos and 2 displayed euphthalmos despite variably sized orbital masses. In 2 cases, synchronous bilateral orbital metastases prevented any relative difference in globe position. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were usually detectable whereas E-cadherin could not be demonstrated.;Breast pathologists no longer refer to primary breast carcinomas and their orbital metastases as \"scirrhous.\" It has been determined that the majority of orbital breast metastases are lobular carcinomas. This may be due to their lack of intercellular cohesiveness and the absence of E-cadherin which normally is expressed in many neoplastic cell types including ductal breast carcinomas, limiting their dispersion. In contrast, the majority of primary breast carcinomas are ductal. The ubiquitous collagenous matrix in breast metastases retracts, partially accounting for enophthalmos. The presence of euphthalmos despite an orbital mass additionally suggests some retraction of fibrous tissue (with or without fat atrophy) that suppresses relative proptosis. Metastatic lobular breast carcinoma is further implicated if there is a concomitant limitation in extraocular motility or vision decline.",

Randomized trials also have demonstrated that anthracycline-containing combinations were more effective than combinations without anthracyclines. The development of several new cytotoxic agents and novel antitumor strategies prompted this review.;The author conducted a computerized literature search of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT and also reviewed the abstracts of major oncology meetings (ASCO, American Association for Cancer Research, ESMO, and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium) over the past 10 years.;Effective new cytotoxic drugs include the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and capecitabine. The identification of specific molecular abnormalities (HER-2/neu or epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] overexpression) led to the development of targeted therapeutic intervention (monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the HER-2/neu oncoprotein, produced objective regression in 15-20% of patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast carcinoma and improved the efficacy of paclitaxel.

Understanding the underlying molecular events that promote breast cancer progression is necessary to improve treatment and prognostication. TGF-β receptor III (TBR3) is a member of the TGF-β signaling pathway, with functions in cell proliferation and migration in malignancies, including breast cancer. Recent studies propose that TBR3 may function as a tumor suppressor and that its loss may correlate with disease progression. However, there are limited data on the expression of TBR3 in breast cancer in relationship to tumor type, hormonal receptor status and HER-2/neu, and patient outcome. In this study, we investigated the expression of TBR3 in a cohort of 205 primary invasive breast carcinomas in tissue microarrays (TMAs), with comprehensive clinical, pathological and follow- up information. Sections were stained for TBR3 and evaluated for intensity of reactivity based on a 4-tiered scoring system (1 to 4; TBR3 low = scores 1-2; TBR3 high = scores 3-4). Of the 205 invasive carcinomas, 123 were luminal type (95 type A, 28 type B), 8 were HER-2 type, and 62 were triple negative (TN). TBR3 was high in 112 (55 %) and low in 93 (45 %) cases. Low TBR3 was associated with higher histological grade and worse disease free and overall survival, all features of biologically aggressive breast carcinomas. TBR3 was significantly associated with the subtype of breast cancer, as low TBR3 was detected in 95 % of TN compared to 22 % of luminal tumors (p < 0.0001). We discovered a significant association between low TBR3 protein expression, TN breast cancer phenotype, and disease progression. These data suggest that TBR3 loss might be linked to the development of TN breast cancers and pave the way to investigating whether restoring TBR3 function may be a therapeutic strategy against TN breast carcinomas.

Using immunoperoxidase histochemical methods, we examined 37 squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) samples from cervix, lung, esophagus and other origins, and 12 normal squamous epithelia of the cervix and esophagus for their reactivity with MAb K1. Of the SqCC specimens, 81% showed K1 reactivity with variable intensity, but none of 12 normal tissue samples of squamous epithelia did so. Two patterns of CAK1 expression in tumor samples were found, i.e., a heterogeneous pattern with strong intensity, and a homogeneous pattern with weak intensity. Three carcinomas in situ of the larynx, vulva and esophagus were moderately positive with K1, suggesting that CAK1 antigen may occur in the early stage of carcinogenesis of SqCC. The expression of CAK1 was also compared with expression of CA125, HER-2/neu, p53 and P-glycoprotein, and MAb K1 was found to react most consistently with SqCC.

Her2 is a client protein of molecular chaperones, e.g. heat shock protein (HSP) 90, rendering targeted therapies against Her2/HSP90 an interesting approach. This study aimed to investigate the role and relationship of Her2 and HSP90 in gastric and gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas.;Immunohistochemical determination of HSP90 and Her2 expression was performed on 347 primary resected tumors. Her2 amplification was additionally determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization for all cases. Expression and amplification results were correlated with pathologic parameters (UICC pTNM category, tumor grading) and survival.;Elevated Her2 copy numbers were observed in 87 tumors, 21 of them showing amplification. 174 tumors showed Her2 immunoreactivity/expression. HSP 90 immunoreactivity was found in 125 tumors. There was no difference between gastric carcinomas and carcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction regarding Her2 or HSP90. Both high HSP90 and Her2 expression/amplification were associated with earlier tumor stages (p<0.01), absence of lymph node metastases (p<0.02) and Laurens intestinal type (p<0.001). HSP90 correlated with Her2 expression and amplification (p<0.001 each). Expressions of HSP90 and Her2, but not Her2 amplification were associated with better prognosis (p=0.02; p=0.004; p=0.802). Moreover, Her2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in the subgroup of gastric carcinoma patients (p=0.014) besides pT category, pN category and distant metastases.;Her2 expression and gene amplification occurred in a significant subset of cases. Our results suggest a favorable prognostic impact of Her2 expression. This warrants further investigations regarding the significance of Her2 non-amplified tumors showing Her2 immunoreactivity and the definition of Her2 status in gastric cancers. Moreover, the correlation of Her2 expression with the expression of Her2 chaperoning HSP90 may indicate a synergistic regulation. Targeting HSP90 with or without Her2 may offer additional therapeutic options for gastric carcinoma treatment.",

To date there are several methods to assess the amplification/over-expression of HER-2/neu with each having advantages and disadvantages. We have studied amplification and over-expression of HER-2/neu in 250 consecutive cases of breast cancer (220 invasive and 30 in situ carcinomas) presenting to the Department of Pathology at Women's College Campus of Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Center. Thirty percent of the invasive carcinomas were node positive. HER-2/neu protein over-expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IH) using antibody CB11 and amplification of the gene by differential PCR. The percentage of tumor cells showing CB11 staining was determined and the most significant cut off point for positivity was > or =10% moderate or strong complete membranous staining. The gene was considered amplified if the density score of the product was > or =2. There was 94% concordance between the two methods (P value.0001). Both methods were positive in 16% of cases and negative in 78% of cases. Discrepant cases were examined by FISH which confirmed the IH results in 9/11 invasive carcinomas. These results show that there is excellent concordance between IH and PCR. However, immunohistochemistry is easier to perform and cheaper than PCR and could be used in routine assessment of HER-2/neu in breast cancer patients.",

A number of potential biological markers are under active investigation in the hope that it will be possible to identify markers that assist in patient selection for specific therapies. Distinguishing prognostic from predictive makers is crucial to the development of customized drug therapy. Some markers, such as mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are prognostic; patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC have prolonged survival compared with those with wild-type disease, regardless of the treatment received. Although EGFR mutations are predictive of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, they do not appear to be predictive of a differential effect on survival. Other EGFR markers, such as protein expression or gene amplification, may be better predictors of a survival benefit from EGFR TKI. HER2 expression status and K-ras mutations provide additional information that may be useful in evaluating a patient for EGFR TKI therapy. Biological markers for chemosensitivity and resistance are also emerging. Patients with an elevated DNA repair capacity, evidenced by increased tumor expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 or ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 messenger RNA, may benefit less from cisplatin and gemcitabine, respectively, than from other agents. Increased levels of class III beta-tubulin are associated with taxane-resistance, and K-ras mutations have been associated with a lack of survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC. It is likely that in the future, clinicians will evaluate a panel of biological markers in order to customize therapy for individual patients with NSCLC.",

Here we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of HER-2 is cleaved by caspases at Asp(1016)/Asp(1019) to release a approximately 47-kDa product, which is subsequently proteolyzed by caspases at Asp(1125) into an unstable 22-kDa fragment that is degraded by the proteasome and a predicted 25-kDa product. Both the 47- and 25-kDa products translocate to mitochondria, release cytochrome c by a Bcl-x(L)-suppressible mechanism, and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. The 47- and 25-kDa HER-2 cleavage products share a functional BH3-like domain, which is required for cytochrome c release in cells and isolated mitochondria and for apoptosis induction. Caspase-cleaved HER-2 binds Bcl-x(L) and acts synergistically with truncated Bid to induce apoptosis, mimicking the actions of the BH3-only protein Bad. Moreover, the HER-2 cleavage products cooperate with Noxa to induce apoptosis in cells expressing both Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, confirming their Bad-like function. Collectively, our results indicate that caspases activate a previously unrecognized proapoptotic function of HER-2 by releasing a Bad-like cell death effector.",

In the present study, we described a Phase-1 vaccination trial in gastric cancer patients using dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with the immunodominant HER-2/neu(p369) peptides.;Nine enrolled patients, who had HER-2/neu-overexpressing tumors and who were HLA-A2 positive, received four vaccinations by DCs pulsed with HER-2(p369) peptide at 2-week intervals intradermally.;There were no serious adverse effects noted in the immunized patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, preimmunization and after the fourth immunization, were cultured with autologous, HER-2(p369)-pulsed antigen-presenting cells for 12 days. Thereafter, peptide specificity was evaluated by IFN-gamma secretion assay from cultured T cells against T2 cells pulsed with HER-2(p369) peptide. HER-2/neu peptide-specific recognition could be demonstrated in six of nine patients after immunization, whereas there was no HER-2/neu peptide-specific recognition before immunization. The peptide-specific CTL lines isolated from two of the patients could also lyse a HER2/neu-transfected cell line. Furthermore, a peptide-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response occurred in three of nine patients. One of the patients underwent a partial clinical response concurrent with a decrease of tumor marker. Another patient demonstrated a stabilization of disease status for a period of 3 months.;Taken together, tumor vaccination therapy with DCs pulsed with HER-2/neu-peptides may be a potential candidate for the novel treatment of gastric cancer patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is an important disease site for chemopreventive intervention. The current in vivo rodent models for breast cancer do not adequately approximate the human disease. Thus, we developed a new series of models based on the direct introduction of activated oncogenes into in situ mammary ductal cells in the rat. So far we have introduced both activated ras and neu into the mammary parenchyma of the rat. Both oncogenes cause the development of mammary carcinomas without any additional exogenous intervention. The activated neu gene is, however, 200 times more penetrant than the activated ras gene. The carcinomas induced by both genes are more aggressive than those induced by chemical carcinogens. They are more often transplantable, locally invasive, and metastatic. Tumors arising from the introduction of the neu oncogene have a greater histopathological resemblance to human breast cancers than those associated with ras insertion. For example, within a week post-introduction of neu, lesions resembling ductal carcinomas in situ are observed in the rat mammary gland. These do not occur following ras introduction or exposure to chemical carcinogens. These models are helping to better define the cellular and molecular events associated with the multistage progression of breast cancer. They are also being used to develop models to evaluate chemopreventive approaches for breast cancer. For example, in the area of cancer prevention we have shown that hormonal intervention is more effective in preventing neu-initiated breast cancers than ras-initiated breast cancers. We have also shown that the chemopreventive monoterpene, d-limonene, can prevent ras-induced mammary tumors in this model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

PKI-402 inhibited growth of human tumor cell lines derived from breast, brain (glioma), pancreas, and non-small cell lung cancer tissue and suppressed phosphorylation of PI3K and mTOR effector proteins (e.g., Akt at T308) at concentrations that matched those that inhibited cell growth. In MDA-MB-361 [breast: Her2(+) and PIK3CA mutant (E545K)], 30 nmol/L PKI-402 induced cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a marker for apoptosis. In vivo, PKI-402 inhibited tumor growth in MDA-MB-361, glioma (U87MG), and lung (A549) xenograft models. In MDA-MB-361, PKI-402 at 100 mg/kg (daily for 5 days, one round) reduced initial tumor volume of 260 mm(3) to 129 mm(3) and prevented tumor regrowth for 70 days. In MDA-MB-361 tumors, PKI-402 (100 mg/kg, single dose) suppressed Akt phosphorylation (at T308) and induced cleaved PARP. Suppression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) was complete at 8 hours and still evident at 24 hours. Cleaved PARP was evident at 8 and 24 hours. In normal tissue (heart and lung), PKI-402 (100 mg/kg) had minimal effect on p-Akt, with no detectable cleaved PARP. Preferential accumulation of PKI-402 in tumor tissue was observed. Complete, sustained suppression of Akt phosphorylation may cause tumor regression in MDA-MB-361 and other xenograft models. We are testing whether dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors can durably suppress p-Akt, induce cleaved PARP, and cause tumor regression in a diverse set of human tumor xenograft models.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for ER, PR and Her2 biomarkers and FISH for those with Her2 2+. Median follow-up period was 30 months (2-65 months). We excluded from the study patients who did not have follow-up after initial diagnosis. Treatment methods were chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, target therapy and palliative care. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method (Prism 5).;The mean age at diagnosis was 49.2 ± 17 years (range, 24-85 years). Grade II was the most grade in MBC (65%). Fourteen patients (82%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, one (6%) had ductal carcinoma in situ and 2 (12%) had invasive papillary. ER, PR and Her2 were significantly positive in 14/17, 8/17 and 2/17 cases, respectively. The treatment included modified radical mastectomy for most patients. Chemotherapy with TAC and CEF regimens was delivered to 15/17 cases. Tamoxifen therapy was delivered to 14/17 cases. Three stage IV patients received Avestin and two with Her2 3+ were given Trastuzumab (Herceptin). Patients received adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery and chemotherapy. The site of metastasis was the bone in 2 cases, lung in 1 case and liver in 1 case. Zoledronic acid (Zometa) was prescribed for patients with bone metastasis. Five-year overall survival rate was 64%.;MBC is rare. Thus, we need larger studies are in collaboration with several research centers in the field of breast cancer.

Up to 40% of ER- breast cancers have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression (HER2+), suggesting HER2 signaling might be a good target for chemoprevention for certain ER- breast cancers. Here, we tested the feasibility of the HER2-targeting agent lapatinib in prevention and/or early intervention of an ER-/HER2+ early-stage breast disease model. We found that lapatinib treatment forestalled the progression of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)-like acini to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-like acini in ER-/HER2+ human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) in 3D culture. Mechanistically, we found that inhibition of HER2/Akt signaling by lapatinib led to downregulation of GLUT4 and a reduced glucose uptake in HER2-overexpressing cells, resulting in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of these cells in 3D culture. Additionally, our data suggest that HER2-driven glycolytic metabolic dysregulation in ER-/HER2+ HMECs might promote early-stage breast disease progression, which can be reversed by lapatinib treatment. Furthermore, low-dose lapatinib treatment, starting at the early stages of mammary grand transformation in the MMTV-neu* mouse model, significantly delayed mammary tumor initiation and progression, extended tumor-free survival, which corresponded to effective inhibition of HER2/Akt signaling and downregulation of GLUT4 in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that lapatinib, through its inhibition of key signaling pathways and tumor-promoting metabolic events, is a promising agent for the prevention/early intervention of ER-/HER2+ breast cancer progression.

Expression was determined by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to cytokeratins 5/6, 14, and 17, and the cases were divided into basal-like carcinoma and non basal-like carcinoma. These subgroups were compared in terms of biological markers (HER2, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki-67, P-53, and P-glycoprotein) and clinicopathological behavior. Of the 49 basal-like carcinoma cases, 25(51.0%) were P-53-positive, whereas 100 (35.9%) of the 278 non basal-like carcinoma cases were P-53-positive. A high ratio of nuclear Ki-67 expression was detected in 39 (79.6%) of 49 basal-like carcinoma cases and was significantly more common than in non basal-like carcinoma cases (81/278, 29.1%). P-glycoprotein expression was identified in 29 (59.2%) of 49 basal-like carcinomas but only 85 (30.6%) of 278 non basal-like carcinomas. We observed high levels of P-53, Ki-67, and P-glycoprotein, with the reduction or loss of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 being more obvious, in basal-like carcinomas than in non basal-like carcinomas.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the combined network of receptors and ligands from the EGF system is a prognostic marker.;Gene expression of the receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, and the ligands AREG, HB-EGF, EPI, TGF-α, and EGF was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in tumor samples from 100 NSCLC patients without EGFR activating mutations. Results were dichotomized into high or low levels of target expression. Coexpression of the ligands and receptors was observed, and a score was developed based on the summed effect of receptors and ligands. Akaike's information criteria selected the optimal score. Results were correlated with age, sex, stage, histology, performance status, and overall survival.;Patients were randomly split 1:1 to create test and validation cohorts. In multivariate analyses, the only individual prognostic marker was EPI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38 [0.20-0.72], P = .003). The optimal score in the test cohort was validated as a marker of inferior survival in the validation cohort and by bootstrapping. Multivariate analysis confirmed the combined score as a prognostic marker of inferior survival (HR 3.75 [2.17-6.47], P < .00001).;Our study has developed a model that takes the complexity of the EGF system into account and shows that this model is a strong prognostic marker in NSCLC patients.",

Because HPV E7 protein inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, diffuse p16 expression is a surrogate marker for these high-risk HPV-related carcinomas. HPV E6 protein also inactivates p53, further compromising the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint. The Rb/p16/p53 immunohistochemical profile of BLC of the breast has not been well characterized. Tissue microarrays containing 71 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) of the breast were immunolabeled for p16, Rb, p53, and Ki-67. The cases included 4 distinct groups of IDCs having surrogate immunohistochemical profiles corresponding to categories defined by gene expression profiling (17 luminal A, 7 luminal B, 14 HER-2+, and 21 BLC), along with 12 unclassifiable triple negative carcinomas (UTNCs). Twenty-five of the 71 IDC were Rb negative/p16 diffuse positive (Rb-/p16+). These included 15 of 21 BLC and 9 of 12 UTNC, but only 1 of 14 HER-2 positive cases and none of the 17 luminal A or 7 luminal B cases (P<0.01, BLC or UTNC vs. others). Six of the Rb-/p16+ IDC also had a significant ductal carcinoma in situ component. The ductal carcinoma in situ in 4 of these 6 cases showed the same Rb-/p16+ phenotype as the associated IDC. BLC and UTNC had the highest Ki-67 indices of the 5 groups, even when matched for grade. The Rb-/p16+ phenotype and the Rb-/p16+/p53 overexpressing phenotype correlated with increased proliferation within the BLC group. In conclusion, BLC and UTNC, but not HER-2, luminal A, or luminal B carcinomas, frequently demonstrate an Rb-/p16+ phenotype, similar to the HPV-related squamous cell carcinomas that BLC resemble morphologically.

Ectopic expression of mutated RIT1 induces cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, which can be reversed by combined PI3K and MEK inhibition.

Tumor genotype, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected and studied at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between age and mutation status, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for survival analysis.;The frequency of targetable genomic alterations by defined age categories as well as the association of these age groups with survival. Age categories used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older.;A cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC was studied. Of the 2237 participants, 1939 (87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, 269 (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 29 (1%) had squamous histologic findings; 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or IV cancers; and median (range) age was 62 (20-95) years. We found that gene mutations for EGFR (P = .02) and ALK (P < .001) were associated with cancer diagnosis at a younger age, and a similar trend existed for ERBB2 (P = .15) and ROS1 (P = .10) but not BRAF V600E (P = .43). Among patients tested for all 5 targetable genomic alterations (n = 1325), younger age was associated with an increased frequency of a targetable genotype (P < .001). Those diagnosed at 50 years or younger have a 59% increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype. While presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration treated with a targeted agent was associated with improved survival, the youngest and oldest age groups had similarly poor outcomes even when a targetable genotype was present.;Younger age is associated with an increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype and is an underappreciated clinical biomarker in NSCLC. The survival of young patients with NCSLC is unexpectedly poor compared with other age groups, suggesting more aggressive disease biology.

The 18 kDa propeptide domain of lysyl oxidase (LOX-PP) released from the secreted precursor protein (Pro-LOX) has been shown to inhibit RAS signaling and the transformed phenotype of breast, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer cells in culture, and formation of tumors by Her-2/neu-driven breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. Here, we tested the effects of LOX-PP on MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, driven by mutant RAS. In MIA PaCa-2 cells in culture, LOX-PP attenuated the ERK and AKT activities and decreased the levels of the NF-κB p65 and RelB subunits and cyclin D1, which are activated by RAS signaling. In mouse xenograft growth, LOX-PP reduced growth of tumors by these pancreatic cancer cells, and the nuclear levels of the p65 NF-κB subunit and cyclin D1 proteins. While biological agents attenuate tumor growth when used alone, often they have additive or synergistic effects when used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, we next tested the hypotheses that LOX-PP sensitizes pancreatic and breast cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Purified LOX-PP enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in pancreatic and breast cancer cells, as judged by ATP production, Cell Death ELISA assays, caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage, and Annexin V staining. Thus, LOX-PP potentiates the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin on breast and pancreatic cancer cells, warranting additional studies with a broader spectrum of current cancer treatment modalities.",

However, rapid locoregional progression, distant metastases occurrence and high local recurrence rate occurring despite radical surgical treatment, significantly affect the outcome. Malignant tumors of the salivary glands are characterized by low radiosensitivity and poor response to systemic therapy. Therefore there is a need for new targeted therapies which may improve the prognosis. In some aspects, malignant tumors of the salivary glands are similar to breast cancers. Efficacy of hormonal replacement therapy and the treatment with the monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) in the treatment of breast cancer is well known and confirmed. Criterion determining the qualification for treatment is the presence of hormone receptors and HER2 receptors in the tumor.;The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 in selected salivary gland malignancies.;Study group consisted of 51 patients with the salivary glands cancer. In the study group there were 42 tumors in the parotid gland, 7 tumors of the submandibular gland, 1 in the mucosa of the cheek and 1 tumor in the tongue. Histologically material comprised of muco-epidermoid carcinoma (10), adenoid-cystic carcinoma (8), salivary duct (7), adenocarcinoma (6), squamous cell carcinoma (6), mioepithelial carcinoma (5) and other (9). In all cases immunohistochemical analysis of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 receptor was performed.;The expression of the estrogen receptor was found in 18% of tumors (9 patients). The expression of the progesterone receptor was found in 20% (10 patients). HER2 expression was found in 10% of tumors and was related to only one histological type of tumor - salivary duct carcinoma.;HER2 expression in malignant tumors of the salivary glands, especially in salivary duct carcinoma may be of use in future implementation of new targeted therapies based on monoclonal antibodies.",

We aimed to describe the hormonal and genetic profile of lung cancer in both men and women to identify gender specificities. Primary lung-tumor tissues from surgically treated patients, (50 men, 50 women) were analyzed and compared for expression of estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, progesterone receptors (PR), epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), and HER2 (for EGFR and K-Ras mutations). These data were combined with clinical and outcome data. Fewer women with lung cancer were smokers (p=0.001) and they smoked fewer cigarettes (p=0.001). We observed a higher rate of EGFR mutations (p=0.02) and ERα expression (p=0.006) in women. ERβ and EGFR were also expressed more frequently in women (p=0.29 and p=0.16). HER2 was overexpressed regardless of gender in three men and two women. K-Ras was mutated in 16% of both men and women. Interestingly, there was a positive link between EGFR expression and expression of ERα (p=0.028) and ERβ (p=0.047) in both men and women. Expression of ERα was associated with improved disease-free survival (p=0.007). Our findings provide further evidence on the specificities of lung cancer in women.

We show here that K1 also inhibits human HER-2/neu promoter in human ovarian cancer cells. To investigate whether K1 can suppress HER-2/neu transformation and thus is a potential therapeutic agent, we used an orthotopic ovarian cancer model in which mice were injected intraperitoneally with HER-2/neu-overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells to induce tumor development. The tumor-bearing mice were then treated with K1-liposome complex weekly. We found that liposome-mediated K1 gene transfer decreased the p185 protein level by K1 expression in these cancer cells and significantly prolonged mice survival; about 40% of these treated mice were alive for more than 1 year without any tumor development. On the other hand, the animals from control groups that did not receive this gene therapy all developed tumors and died within 7 months.

HER2 is a ligand-less member of the HER family that functions as the preferred coreceptor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER3, and HER4.;An approach was developed to target HER2's role as a coreceptor using a monoclonal antibody, 2C4, which sterically hinders HER2's recruitment into a functional HER complex.;HER2 was robustly expressed in all eight ovarian carcinoma cell lines; expression of EGFR and HER3 was variable. Even though four of the eight cell lines responded to EGF, 2C4 antibody moderately inhibited in vitro proliferation of only two cell lines (OVCA433 and SK-OV-3). Furthermore, ligand-stimulated p-MAPK expression was inhibited by 2C4 only in these two cell lines after exposure to EGF. Immunoprecipitation and eTag analysis revealed that OVCA433 expressed heterodimers of EGFR/HER2, and these heterodimers were disrupted after treatment with 2C4, whereas OVCA432 cells did not have these heterodimers. In murine xenograft experiments, the in vivo growth of OVCA433, but not of OVCA432, ovarian carcinoma cells was significantly inhibited by 2C4 treatment of the mice.;2C4 is able to disrupt the HER signaling pathway and inhibit the in vitro and in vivo growth of ovarian carcinoma cell lines. The response appears limited to lines in which HER2 heterodimers were able to transduce proliferative signals.

SKOV-3 cells (10(3) per well) were infected once with 2 x 10(4) adenovirus. The cells were harvested and counted on different days for 7 days to generate the in vitro growth curve. Tumor-bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally with ovarian cancer cells and treated by intraperitoneal injection of 100 microl (2.5 x 10(8) PFU) viral solution containing either replication-deficient Ad.E1a(+); control virus Ad.E1a(-) which is the same adenovirus as Ad.E1a(+) except for E1a deletion, or just phosphate buffered solution. The transduction efficacy increased with higher MOI and reached a plateau at the 20:1 ratio. When Ad.E1a(+) was used to transduce the HER-2/neu overexpressing human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3, tumor cell growth in vitro was greatly inhibited by E1a transduction. Also, Ad.E1a+ greatly inhibited tumor growth of SKOV-3-bearing mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that Ad.E1a protein was expressed in tumor tissue and expression of HER-2/neu p185 protein was suppressed. Very strong beta-gal staining was detected in tumors, and beta-gal activity in small intestine, lung, heart, stomach, liver, and kidney was detected. No beta-gal activity was detected in the tumor and other organs in control mice injected with Ad.E1a(-) or PBS.

Since ErbBs are closely associated to Mucin 1 (MUC1), a glycoprotein component of airway mucus that is overexpressed in lung tumors, we have investigated the role of this signaling system in the survival response of airway epithelial cells against Ni(2+)-induced cell death. We found that A549 cells exposed to Ni(2+) do not show any significant increase of MUC1 levels. Conversely, Beas-2B cells exposed to equivalent concentrations of Ni(2+) showed increased expression of MUC1 levels and this correlated with increased phosphorylation of both EGFR and of the extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and increase resistance to apoptosis, as indicated by cell viability assessments and DNA damage. Interestingly, suppression of MUC1 by small interfering RNA inhibited the EGFR activation in Beas-2B cells, leading to a significant decrease of survival and enhancement of DNA fragmentation and cleaved Caspase-3 expression. These results strongly suggest a role for MUC1 in Ni(2+)-induced neoplastic transformation, which likely involves the activation of the EGFR-mediated cell survival pathway, highlighting new avenues in the molecular approach to lung cancer prevention.

The subjects were 44 breast cancer patients with asynchronous metastasis or recurrence. Synchronous metastases were excluded. HER2 overexpression and gene amplification were examined using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). P53 point mutation was examined by immunohistochemistry, laser-captured microdissection, PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism, and a direct sequencing method. Immunohistochemistry showed that, for HER2, p53, ER and PgR, discordance rates between primary and recurrent tumor were 2 (4.5%), 1 (2.3%), 7 (15.9%) and 10 (22.7%), respectively. Two primary tumors with discordant HER2 overexpression were composed of at least two populations of carcinoma cells, with and without HER2 gene amplification. Distribution of HER2 gene amplification was consistent with protein overexpression. Corresponding recurrent tumors consisted of carcinoma cells without HER2 gene amplification. Of 6 recurrent tumors in which the primary carcinoma had a p53 point mutation, 3 tumors had identical mutations, 1 tumor had a different point mutation, and 2 tumors had no mutation. It was suspected that the latter 3 recurrent tumors comprised a minor component of the primary tumor. In the present study, we examined a large series of asynchronous recurrent tumors. A limited number of these tumors showed discordance between primary and recurrent tumors. Detailed observations revealed that cell populations present in recurrent tumors were also present in the primary tumors, although they comprised a minor component of the primary tumor. Heterogeneity of the primary tumor apparently contributed to discordance.",

Overexpression of p53 (implying a mutation of the p53 gene), ERBB2, and EGFR was measured by immunohistochemistry, and gene amplification of ERBB2 and EGFR was measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In all cases of ACIS and the intramucosal adenocarcinomas, almost all cancer cells overexpressed p53, however the populations overexpressing ERBB2 and EGFR varied in different cases: in one ACIS, ERBB2 was coexpressed in all the cancer cells, in the other ACIS and one intramucosal adenocarcinoma, ERBB2 was overexpressed in about 50% and only 10% of the p53-positive cells respectively. EGFR was co-expressed in 20% in the other intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Protein overexpression of ERBB2 or EGFR corresponded to the amplification of their respective genes on a cell by cell basis. These gene amplifications, however, were not found in the seven invasive adenocarcinomas. Thus we speculate that the gene amplification occurred late in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence probably after the mutation of p53.

In these patients, there is often an initial dramatic response to treatment with the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib or gefitinib. A small number of patients with EGFR mutations have primary resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib, and most patients who initially respond to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib will develop resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs. The problems with both primary and acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib support the need for development of additional agents that inhibit EGFR signaling in such patients. This is an overview of three representative second-generation EGFR TKIs. HKI-272, a second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2, has completed accrual of a phase II trial in both untreated patients and patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. XL647 is a reversible inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and vascular epidermal growth factor receptor. Preclinical work shows that XL647 can inhibit cell lines bearing mutated forms of EGFR that have been associated with acquired resistance. BIBW2992 is an irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2 and vascular epidermal growth factor receptors. In vitro work shows that this compound inhibits wild-type EGFR, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R, and EGFR T790M, the mutation associated with acquired resistance. The preliminary results from phase I and phase II trials for BIBW-2992 and XL647 are discussed.",

We conducted this study to evaluate the expression level of RFP in breast carcinomas. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 133 cases of invasive breast carcinoma. Sections obtained from tissue arrays and whole sections from 10 non-neoplastic breast tissues were stained for ER, PR, ErbB2, and RFP using immunohistochemistry, and ErbB2 gene status was evaluated by FISH. The correlation between various immunohistochemical markers was determined. We found nuclear RFP expression in 41.4% of invasive carcinomas and in none of the non-neoplastic breast tissues. We also stained whole sections of 29 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, which included the TMA study, and 10 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by RFP. We observed that four (40%) of the DCIS cases were positive with RFP. In statistical analysis, there was a significant, positive association between RFP and ErbB2 status at the protein level (p=0.002) and the gene level (p=0.049). There was no statistically significant association between the expression of RFP and tumor size, LN status, ER, PR, and grade (p>0.05). However, we found a significant association between age and RFP expression. RFP expression was stronger in patients 50 years or older (p=0.048). In our study, the expression of RFP correlated strongly with ErbB2 status. Our study is the first in the literature to show expression of RFP in patients with breast carcinoma.

The S-phase kinase-associated protein Skp2 is required for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the cdk-inhibitor p27 and is a bona fide proto-oncoprotein. Using microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry, we determined that higher levels of Skp2 are present more frequently in ER-negative tumors than in ER-positive cases. Interestingly, the subset of ER-negative breast carcinomas overexpressing Skp2 are also characterized by high tumor grade, negativity for Her-2, basal-like phenotype, high expression of certain cell cycle regulatory genes, and low levels of p27 protein. We also found that Skp2 expression is cell adhesion-dependent in normal human mammary epithelial cells but not in breast cancer cells and that an inhibition of Skp2 induces a decrease of adhesion-independent growth in both ER-positive and ER-negative cancer cells. Finally, forced expression of Skp2 abolished effects of antiestrogens, suggesting that deregulated Skp2 expression might play a role in the development of resistance to antiestrogens. We conclude that Skp2 has oncogenic potential in breast epithelial cells and is overexpressed in a subset of breast carcinomas (ER- and Her-2 negative) for which Skp2 inhibitors may represent a valid therapeutic option.",

However, soluble human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)/neu protein as a vaccine has not been immunogenic. When protein is directly targeted to antigen uptake receptors, such as DEC205 (DEC), efficient processing and presentation of antigen take place. The aim of this study was to determine the immunogenicity of a HER2 protein vaccine that directly targets to DEC+ dendritic cells (DCs) in a mouse breast cancer model.;We genetically engineered the HER2 extracellular domain into a monoclonal antibody specific for DEC (DEC-HER2). Mice of various genetic backgrounds were immunized with DEC-HER2 in combination with DC maturation stimuli (poly IC ± CD40 Ab). Vaccine-induced T cell immunity was determined by analyzing the ability of CD4+/CD8+ T cell to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma and proliferate upon antigen rechallenge. Sera were assessed for the presence of antigen specific antibody (Ab). For vaccine efficacy, FVB/N mice were immunized with DEC-HER2 in combination with poly IC and protection against neu-expressing mammary tumors was assessed. Protection mechanisms and tumor-specific T cell responses were also evaluated.;We demonstrate that DEC-HER2 fusion mAb, but not Ctrl Ig-HER2, elicits strong, broad and multifunctional CD4+ T cell immunity, CD8+ T cell responses, and humoral immunity specific for HER2 antigen. Cross-reactivity to rat neu protein was also observed. Importantly, mice xeno-primed with DEC-HER2 were protected from a neu-expressing mammary tumor challenge. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediated the tumor protection. Robust anti-tumor T cell immunity was detected in tumor protected mice.;Immunization of mice with HER2 protein vaccine targeting DEC+ DCs in vivo induced high levels of T- and B-cell immunity. Non-targeted HER2 protein was poorly immunogenic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This vaccination approach provided long-term survival benefit for mice challenged with neu-expressing tumor following as little as 2.7 μg of HER2 protein incorporated in the vaccine. Vaccine-induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were both essential for tumor protection. This immunization strategy demonstrates great potential towards the development of vaccines for breast cancer patients.",

Characterization of H2NTF shows that it is devoid of the tyrosine kinase domain but it readily interacts with full-length HER2 and other HER receptors. As a consequence, H2NTF acts as a dominant-negative, attenuating the signaling triggered by full-length HER receptors. Expression of H2NTF results in resistance to the treatment with low concentrations of trastuzumab in vitro.

Given the low metastatic rate in pT1a carcinomas, we aimed to investigate the effect of this phenomenon on staging.;Using morphology and immunohistochemistry, we classified the epithelial cells in the SLN in 39 cases of pT1a carcinoma as positive for carcinoma in six, negative in 26 and undetermined in seven. Comparative morphology and immunohistochemistry (using oestrogen receptor, ER) showed complete concordance between the primary carcinoma and SLN in the positive cases, and discordance in the negative cases. The primary tumours in the negative cases were ER-positive except one, in contrast to the SLN cytokeratin-positive (CK(+) ) cells, which were ER-negative. The exception was a case with a Her2-positive primary, in which the SLN CK(+) cells did not stain for Her2. In these cases considered SLN-negative, either displacement (19 cases) or an intraductal papilloma (20 cases) was identified. Two cases showed displacement of benign and malignant cells in the biopsy. Seven cases were indeterminate due to the small number of SLN CK(+) cells, precluding comparison with the primary.;Given the low rate of metastases in pT1a carcinomas, the significance of SLN CK(+) cells should be resolved by comparative morphology and immunohistochemistry to prevent erroneous upstaging.",

To assess and compare the ability of these short CUX1 isoforms in driving mammary tumor development, we used site-specific transgenesis into the Hprt locus to generate transgenic mice expressing p75 or p110 CUX1 under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat. We report that mammary tumors developed after a long latency period, and although various histopathologies were observed, the proportion of adenosquamous carcinomas was significantly higher in p75 CUX1 than in p110 CUX1 transgenic mice. Metastasis to the lung was observed in three p75 CUX1 transgenic mice. Comparisons between tumors and adjacent normal mammary glands revealed that transgenes were overexpressed in most but not all tumors, yet in all cases tested, CUX1 DNA binding was increased, suggesting that both higher expression and changes in post-translational modifications can contribute to stimulate transgene activity. Interestingly, higher expression of erbB2 mRNA was seen in most tumors, not only solid carcinomas but also adenosquamous carcinomas, whereas higher expression of various Wnt genes and activation of the beta-catenin pathway was observed primarily in adenosquamous carcinomas. Activation of erbB2 expression appeared to represent a cooperating event that occurred independently of CUX1. In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, and reporter assays established that CUX1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several Wnt genes. Together, these results support the notion that oncogenic activity of CUX1 can facilitate the establishment of a Wnt/beta-catenin autocrine loop.",

Neu female mice were fed for 20 wk a soy- and isoflavone-free diet (IFD), 4RF21 laboratory mouse diet, soy-based, thus isoflavone-rich (STD), or AIN-76-based semisynthetic diets with a soy protein isolate (SPI) or an isoflavone-poor soy protein concentrate (IPSP) as protein source. Mice were then sacrificed and tumors removed. Mammary tumor weights were not different in SPI versus IFD and STD fed mice. In contrast, mice fed IPSP showed reduced tumor progression versus IFD and STD groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, IPSP fed mice showed lower bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into breast tumor cells compared to STD and SPI fed animals (p < 0.02). Lung metastases were detected in 80% of IFD fed mice, in 70% of mice fed STD and SPI, and only in 50% of the IPSP fed animals.

Luminal A-type tumours were characterised by lower grade and proliferation rate, whereas basal-type tumours were mostly high grade, high proliferative and positive for cytokeratin 5, p63 and P-cadherin.

This study included 40 patients who were examined at Aichi Medical University Hospital and were pathologically diagnosed with invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (pT2 to pT4). Immunohistochemical staining using a Hercep test kit was performed to detect HER-2 expression, which was classified into four levels from 0 to 3+ by two experienced pathologists, with 2+ and 3+ determined as positive. HER-2 staining in the primary tumor was determined as 0 in 9 (22.5%) patients, 1+ in 14 (35%), 2+ in 10 (25%), and 3+ in 7 (17.5%), resulting in 17 (17/40, 42.5%) HER-2-positive patients.

In April 2004, the patient was referred to our department by a local physician with the diagnosis of carcinoma of the cervical esophagus. In September 2004, the patient underwent resection of the cervical esophagus and partial resection of the gastric tube combined with cervical lymph node dissection under a diagnosis of double cancer (i.e., metachronous cervical esophageal carcinoma and carcinoma of the gastric tube). Esophagogastric continuity was restored by transplantation of a free jejunal graft with vascular anastomosis. Pathological examination showed squamous cell carcinoma on the esophageal side of the esophagogastric anastomosis and columnar epithelium with a tongue-shaped extension across the anastomotic line that included Barrett's epithelium, as well as adenocarcinoma, on the gastric tube side. The squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were contiguous, but there was a distinct border between them and no morphological transition. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for p53 in the squamous carcinoma cells, while it was negative in the adenocarcinoma cells. In contrast, HER2 (c-erb-2) was strongly positive in the adenocarcinoma cells, but negative in the squamous carcinoma. Based on these findings, it was concluded that two separate carcinomas had arisen at different sites and grown independently until they collided and merged to form a collision carcinoma.",

It is downregulated in most normal cells, except in lipogenic tissues such as liver, lactating breast, fetal lung, and adipose tissue. Conversely, several human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), overexpress FASN, which has been associated with poor prognosis and recently suggested as a metabolic oncoprotein. Orlistat is an irreversible inhibitor of FASN activity with cytotoxic properties on several cancer cell lines that inhibits tumor progression and metastasis in prostate cancer xenografts and experimental melanomas, respectively. To explore whether the inhibition of FASN could impact oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) metastatic spread, an orthotopic model was developed by the implantation of SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells into the tongue of BALB/c nude mice. These cells were isolated through in vivo selection, show a more invasive behavior in vitro than the parental cells, and generate orthotopic tumors that spontaneously metastasize to cervical lymph nodes in 10 to 15 days only. SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells also exhibit enhanced production of MMP-2, ERBB2, and CDH2. The treatment with orlistat reduced proliferation and migration, promoted apoptosis, and stimulated the secretion of VEGFA165b by SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells. In vivo, the drug was able to decrease both the volume and proliferation indexes of the tongue orthotopic tumors and, importantly, reduced the number of metastatic cervical lymph nodes by 43%. These results suggest that FASN is a potential molecular target for the chemotherapy of patients with OTSCC.",

This alternative transcript specifies 340 residues identical to subdomains I and II from the extracellular domain of p185HER-2 followed by a unique C-terminal sequence of 79 aa encoded by intron 8. The recombinant product of the alternative transcript specifically binds to HER-2-transfected cells with a K(D) of approximately 14 nM and was chemically crosslinked to p185HER-2, whereas the intron encoded sequence alone also binds with high affinity to transfected cells and associates with p185 solubilized from cell extracts. The herstatin mRNA is expressed in normal human fetal kidney and liver, but is at reduced levels relative to p185HER-2 mRNA in carcinoma cells that contain an amplified HER-2 gene.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human solid tumors develop multiple genetic abnormalities that accumulate progressively in individual cells during the course of tumor evolution. We sought to determine whether there are specific sequences of occurrence of these progressive evolutionary changes in human breast cancers by performing correlated cell-by-cell measurements of cell DNA content, p53 protein, Her-2/neu protein, and ras protein by multiparameter flow cytometry in 56 primary tumor samples obtained at surgery. In addition, p53 allelic loss and Her-2/neu gene amplification were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in cells from the same samples. We reasoned that if there is a specific order in which genetic changes occur, the same early changes would be found consistently in the cells with the fewest abnormalities. We reasoned further that late-developing abnormalities would not occur alone in individual cells but would almost always be found together with the early changes inherited by the same cells. By these criteria, abnormalities involving p53 generally occurred early in the course of development of invasive breast cancers, whereas ras protein overexpression was found to be a late-occurring phenomenon. Within individual tumors, cellular p53 overexpression was often observed alone in individual cells, whereas ras protein overexpression was rarely observed in the absence of p53 overexpression and/or Her-2/neu overexpression in the same cells. Furthermore, the intracellular level of each abnormally expressed protein was found to increase progressively as new abnormalities were acquired. Infiltrating ductal carcinomas exhibited characteristic phenotypic patterns in which p53 allelic loss and/or p53 protein overexpression, Her-2/neu amplification and/or overexpression, aneuploidy, and ras overexpression accumulated within individual cells. However, this pattern was not a prominent feature of lobular breast cancers. All six lobular breast cancers studied were diploid. p53 allelic loss and/or early p53 overexpression, and late ras cooverexpression in the same cells were less common in lobular breast cancers than in infiltrating ductal carcinomas. Although Her-21neu overexpression was a common finding in lobular breast cancers, Her-2/neu amplification was not observed in these tumors.",

Prior reports of HER2/neu (c-erbB-2 or HER2) expression in bladder carcinoma have been mixed; therefore, its value in predicting metastasis or response to therapy has not been established in this tumor type. Thus, the authors evaluated a possible correlation between HER2 expression in patients with high-grade, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and outcome in patients who received paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.;Archival tumor tissues from patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who were enrolled on two clinical trials of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy regimens were analyzed for HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The authors correlated HER2 expression by IHC with clinical outcomes, such as response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival, using univariate analysis.;Thirty-nine tumor specimens were assessed for HER2 expression, most of which (70%) were collected from patients with metastatic disease. All were high-grade urothelial carcinomas (transitional cell carcinomas, Grade 3). Strong HER2 expression (2+/3+) was seen in 28 patients (71%). Patients with responding disease had an HER2 expression rate of 78%, similar to the rate seen in patients with stable disease (75%). In contrast, patients with progressive disease had an HER2 expression rate of 50%, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. However, univariate analysis showed that increased HER2 expression predicted an improvement in progression free and overall survival. When HER2 status was used as a dichotomous variable, tumors with positive HER2 expression did not have any association with response or with progression free survival; however, positive HER2 status was associated significantly with a decreased risk of death (P = 0.03).;This study of HER2 expression in bladder carcinoma focused on patients who were treated prospectively in a standardized fashion, unlike prior studies that have evaluated banked, archival specimens. The authors confirmed the findings of others that high-grade, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder has a significant rate of HER2 expression (71%). However, contrary to other reports, the current study found that HER2 expression in the context of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy decreased the risk of death significantly. Further research is warranted on the possible association of HER2 expression with chemosensitivitiy in urothelial carcinoma as well as the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies (such as trastuzumab) for patients with high-grade, muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.",

This study was conducted to assess the expression profile of MMP-13 protein in invasive breast carcinomas to determine its diagnostic and prognostic significance, as well as its correlation with other biomarkers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Her-2/neu, MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 and -2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2).;Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue microarray containing specimens from 263 breast carcinomas. The intensity and the extent of IHC were scored by pathologists in blind fashion. The correlation of the gene expression profiles with patients' clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes were analyzed for statistical significance.;MMP-13 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells and the peritumoral stromal cells. MMP-13 expression by tumor cells (p < 0.001) and stromal fibroblasts (p <0.001) both correlated with carcinoma infiltration of lymph nodes. MMP-13 also correlated with the expression of Her-2/neu (p = 0.015) and TIMP-1 (p < 0.010), respectively in tumor cells.

Here, we first investigated the unique histogenesis of the basal/HER2+ phenotype in breast carcinomas. The presence of basal CK5/CK6 cytokeratin expression in HER2+ tumors revealed a significant overlap in the histological features of HER2+/CK5/6+ and basal-like breast carcinomas. Basal/HER2+ tumors were typically poorly differentiated, high-grade invasive ductal carcinomas with large geographic necrosis, pushing margins of invasion, syncytial arrangement of tumor cells, ribbon- or festoon-like architecture, squamous metaplasia, stromal lymphocytic infiltrates, high mitotic index and strong p53 positivity. Secondly, we performed low-scale proteomic approaches in JIMT-1 cells, a unique model of HER2-gene amplified trastuzumab-resistant breast carcinoma with a basal-like phenotype, to develop biomarker signatures that may differentiate trastuzumab-responsive from non-responsive tumors. When applying antibody-based array technology to the extracellular milieu of trastuzumab-refractory JIMT-1 and trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cell cultures, JIMT-1 cells were found to secrete higher amounts of several growth factors including amphiregulin, EGF, IGFBP-6, PDGF-AA, neurotrophins, TGFbeta and VEGF. Semi-quantitative signaling node multi-target sandwich ELISAs revealed that JIMT-1 cells drastically overactivate RelA, the prosurvival subunit of NF-kappaB as compared to trastuzumab-sensitive luminal/HER2+ SKBR3 cells. When simultaneously assessing the activation status of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) using a human phospho-RTK array, JIMT-1 cells were found to constitutively display hyperactivation of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R). High-content immunofluorescence imaging revealed that activated IGF-1R mainly localized at focal adhesion-like structures in JIMT-1 cells. In vitro wound healing assays suggested that this functional reorganization of the JIMT-1 cytoskeletal reorganization may account for an exacerbated trastuzumab-refractory 'migratogenic' phenotype. Forthcoming studies should validate the notion that identification of basal-like immunophenotypes and/or basal-like molecular signatures within HER2+ breast carcinomas may provide rapid means to define subgroups of breast cancer patients likely to display resistance to trastuzumab ab initio.",

In this study, localization and expression of HAS1-3 were evaluated immunohistochemically in 278 cases of human breast cancer, and correlated with prognostic factors and patient outcome. Both carcinoma cells and stromal cells were HAS-positive. In carcinoma cells, HAS1 and HA stainings correlated with each other, and HAS1 associated with estrogen receptor negativity, HER2 positivity, high relapse rate, and short overall survival. In stromal cells, the staining levels of all HAS isoforms correlated with the stromal HA staining, stromal cell CD44, high relapse rate, and short overall survival of the patients. In addition, expression levels of stromal HAS1 and HAS2 were related to obesity, large tumor size, lymph node positivity, and estrogen receptor negativity. Thus, stromal HAS1 and HAS3 were independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. The data suggest that increased levels of HAS enzymes contribute to the accumulation of HA in breast cancer, and that HA is synthesized in carcinoma cells and stromal cells.

Transfection of NbE-1.4 cells with the activated neu oncogene expression vector, pSV-neu-T (neu-T), resulted in an altered cell morphology, an increase in soft agar colony-forming efficiency, and conversion to a tumorigenic phenotype. Although the parental NbE-1.4 cells expressed endogenous c-neu mRNA, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay determined that the neu-T-transfected clones expressed only the point-mutated neu-T mRNA. The suppression of the c-neu transcripts occurred regardless of the neu-T mRNA level expressed in these cell clones. These data provide evidence to show that low-level expression of an activated neu oncogene alone was insufficient to transform rat prostate epithelial cells.

The efficacy of lapatinib as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, however, is limited by the development of therapeutic resistance that typically occurs within 12 months of starting therapy. In contrast to small molecule inhibitors targeting other receptor tyrosine kinases where resistance has been attributed to mutations within the targeted receptor, ErbB2 mutations have not been commonly found in breast tumors. Instead, acquired resistance to lapatinib seems to be mediated by redundant survival pathways that are activated as a consequence of marked inhibition of ErbB2 kinase activity. For example, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol3 kinase-Akt in lapatinib-treated cells leads to derepression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor that up-regulates estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, resulting in a switch in the regulation of survival factors (e.g., survivin) and cell survival from ErbB2 alone to ER and ErbB2 in resistant cells. In this review, we discuss the effects of lapatinib on signaling networks in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to elucidate potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and strategies to overcome or prevent its development.",

An exception to this was suggested for neu transformation of mammary cells in a transgenic model (Muller et al., 1988); however, this interpretation is controversial (Bouchard et al., 1989). In order to better define neu mammary transformation in vivo, we directly measured the genetic penetrance of the neu oncogene. Mammary cells in situ were infected with replication-defective retroviral vectors carrying the activated neu oncogene (pJRneu). A limiting dilution in vivo transplantation assay was used to measure the percentage of mammary clonogenic (stem-like) cells that stably and functionally integrated this vector. Based on this, the percentage of clonogens integrating and expressing neu that could progress to mammary carcinomas was quantified to estimate the penetrance of this gene in mammary carcinogenesis. The genetic penetrance of neu was 3.6% (95% confidence interval 2.2%-5.8%). This high degree of genetic penetrance is compatible with the observations that certain neu-transgenic mice develop a very great number of mammary carcinomas (Muller et al., 1988). However, whether these data are compatible with a single-step transformation model (100% penetrance) is uncertain and is discussed.",

In order to identify mechanisms through which these receptor tyrosine kinases accelerate tumor progression, the regulation of metalloprotease expression by EGFR family members was investigated in 11 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines. HER2 expression was significantly correlated with ADAM12 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 12) expression in these cell lines and was co-expressed in human head and neck cancers. Inhibition of HER2 or EGFR decreased ADAM12 transcripts whereas HER2 transfection upregulated ADAM12 expression. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HER2 regulation of ADAM12, we investigated the signaling pathways directing ADAM12 production in SCC cells. Inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase or mammalian target of rapamycin decreased ADAM12 transcripts in HER2-expressing SCC cells, whereas transfection with AKT increased ADAM12 mRNA. Experiments utilizing ADAM12 transfection or siRNA targeting of ADAM12 revealed that the protease increased both the migration and invasiveness of oral SCC cells. Surprisingly, ADAM12 also increased HER2 message, protein levels and activity through an Ets1-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these results reveal a novel positive activation loop between ADAM12 and HER2 that may contribute to HNSCC progression.",

Overexpression of the COX-2 gene in mammary glands of transgenic mice was sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. We analyzed COX-2 expression in human breast cancers (and breast cancer cell lines) and adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as well as its association with HER2/neu and clinicopathological variables. Archival primary breast carcinomas (n = 57), adjacent DCIS (n = 14) and DCIS alone (n = 2) were analyzed for COX-2 and HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal antibodies. An immunohistochemical scoring system was used. HER2 gene amplification had been analyzed previously by fluorescence in situ hybridization (n = 20). Histology of carcinomas included infiltrating ductal (n = 44), lobular (n = 2), and other (n = 7). Frozen breast cancers and adjacent normal tissue pairs (n = 9) were analyzed for COX-2 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. COX-2 and HER2 expression were also analyzed in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231) by immunoblotting. Cytoplasmic COX-2 expression was detected at an intermediate or high level in epithelial cells in 18 of 42 (43%) invasive breast cancers and in 10 of 16 (63%) cases of DCIS. Normal-appearing breast epithelia adjacent to cancer expressed COX-2 in 81% of cases and was generally focal and of similar or decreased intensity relative to adjacent neoplastic epithelia. COX-2 mRNA was detected in all samples analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and was increased in eight of nine breast cancers relative to paired normal tissue. In archival tumors, no significant correlation was found between COX-2 and HER2 expression/amplification and clinicopathological variables. COX-2 expression was induced in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with HER2, in contrast to parental MCF-7 cells, and was detected in MDA-MB-231, but not SK-BR-3 cells. COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in invasive breast cancers and in adjacent DCIS and, thus, may be an early event in mammary tumorigenesis. Forced HER2 expression in MCF-7 cells was shown to up-regulate COX-2, although no association was found in human tumors. Our results suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of human breast cancer.",

Histologically, the high-grade component was composed of polymorphic cells with a high mitotic rate arranged in glandular and solid growth patterns with comedonecrosis. The MIB-1 labeling indices were elevated in the high-grade component, as compared with the low grade conventional AciCC. The high-grade component of AciCC was characterized by strong membrane staining for CK18 and beta-catenin, and nuclear staining for cyclin-D1. HER-2/neu, androgen receptor, C-kit, and epidermal growth factor receptor were absent from both low-grade and high-grade components. In contrast, S-100 protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and lysozyme were lost only in high-grade foci of transformed AciCC. The median age was 61 years (with range from 43 to 76 y).

Multifocal invasive breast carcinomas are relatively common, and given the aggressive inherent biology of HER2 positive disease, identification of even small tumours with HER2 positive status may be of importance for treatment planning. There are currently no clear guidelines as to whether all of these foci should be tested for HER2 status. We reviewed the results of 172 patients in whom HER2 in situ hybridisation (ISH) testing was performed on at least two ipsilateral synchronous invasive carcinomas. Discordant results in different invasive foci were relatively uncommon and occurred in only eight (5%) of the 172 patients. This showed a statistically significant correlation with similarly discordant oestrogen receptor (ER) results. In addition HER2 discordance was more likely amongst different tumour foci if these arose in distinct and separate areas of DCIS. An algorithm based on a combination of College of American Pathologists (CAP) recommendation for HER2 testing, differing ER status and background DCIS profile may be useful in detecting these discordant cases.

A tissue microarray was constructed from 3992 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, and P-cadherin expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Median follow-up was 12.5 years. The immunohistochemistry-based definitions of cancer subtypes were luminal (ER+ or PR+/HER2-), luminal/HER2+ (ER+ or PR+/HER2+), HER2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+), and basal (ER-/PR-/HER2-/CK5/6+ or EGFR+). Clinical covariate and biomarker associations were assessed using contingency tables, and Pearson's χ(2) or Fisher's exact test. Survival associations were assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots, logrank and Breslow tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. P-cadherin was expressed in 34.8% (1290/3710, 50% cut point) of cases. P-cadherin staining was strongly associated with HER2+ and basal carcinoma subtypes (P<0.0005). P-cadherin-positive patients showed significantly poorer short-term (0-10 years) overall survival, disease-specific survival, distant relapse-free interval, and locoregional relapse-free interval in univariable models (P<0.05). In multivariable Cox models containing standard clinical covariates and cancer subtypes, P-cadherin did not show independent prognostic value. P-cadherin expression was positively associated with histological grade, chemotherapy, Ki-67, EGFR, CK5/6, p53, YB-1, and HER2 expression (P<0.002), and negatively associated with age at diagnosis, ER, PR, and Bcl-2 expression (P<0.0005). This study shows the value of P-cadherin as a marker of poor prognosis. The large sample size of this series clarifies contradictory findings of many smaller studies. P-cadherin positivity is associated with high-grade tumor subtypes and well-established markers of poor prognosis, and may represent a promising antibody therapeutic target.",

This study examines the relationship between NGAL expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. Using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, NGAL was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. NGAL expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, HER-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high Ki-67 proliferation index. In univariate survival analysis, NGAL expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis, NGAL remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. In a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, NGAL was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival.

HER2 gene status determines the eligibility of breast cancer patients for trastuzumab therapy and a large fraction (41-56%) of these patients respond to targeted therapy. Several studies have related the increased expression of HER2 to an increased copy number of chromosome 17, rather than amplification of the HER2 gene. We compared the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in both invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinomas, to determine the frequency of chromosome 17 aneuploidy associated with discordant results. In total, 390 invasive ductal carcinomas and 180 invasive lobular carcinomas diagnosed from January 2000 to December 2005 were included in the study only if results were available for immunohistochemistry (HercepTest; DAKO, Carpinteria, California) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit; Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, Illinois). Tumors classified as invasive ductal carcinomas were graded according to the Bloom-Richardson grading system. Correlation between the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed for all categories. Among invasive ductal carcinomas, 29% (115/390) showed chromosome 17 aneuploidy, mostly associated with grade 3/HER2 2+ (45%) or grade 2/HER2 3+ (55%) that were not amplified. Also, 34% (12/35) of invasive lobular carcinomas showed chromosome 17 aneuploidy; approximately one-third of these cases were HER2 2+ (33%) and HER2 3+ (37%) that were not amplified. Discordance between the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in both ductal and lobular carcinomas is largely associated with chromosome 17 aneuploidy. ",

Despite the importance of cancer metastasis in the pathogenesis of cancers, data on the ERBB2 kinase domain mutation in cancer metastasis are lacking. In this study, to explore the possibility that ERBB2 mutation is involved in the metastasis mechanism, we analyzed the kinase domain of ERBB2 for the detection of somatic mutations in 58 gastric adenocarcinomas with lymph node metastasis. We found one ERBB2 mutation, which was detected in the lymph node metastasis, but not in the primary tumor of the same patient. The ERBB2 mutation was a missense mutation which substituted an amino acid in exon 21 (V832I). We simultaneously analyzed the somatic mutations of EGFR, K-RAS, PIK3CA and BRAF genes in the sample with the ERBB2 mutation, and found that this metastatic carcinoma did not harbor any of the mutations.

Based on this concept, targeted anti-cancer strategies have been designed to selectively eradicate erbB2 overexpressing tumor cells. These strategies have employed either monoclonal antibodies or antibody toxin molecules with specificity for the cell surface erbB2 protein. As an alternative strategy, anti-erbB2 single-chain immunoglobulin (sFv) genes were constructed to direct expression of intracellular anti-erbB2 antibodies. Expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form of the anti-erbB2 sFv resulted in a profound down-regulation of cell surface erbB2 in an erbB2 overexpressing ovarian carcinoma cell line. In addition, expression of the intracellular antibody resulted in marked inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Whereas stable transfectants expressing the anti-erbB2 sFv could be dervied from non-erbB2 overexpressing cancer cell lines, expression of the intracellular antibody was incompatible with long-term survival of the erbB2 overpressing tumor cells. The ability to selectively 'knock-out' erbB2 demonstrates that cell surface localization of erbB2 is essential to its ability to induce aberrant cellular proliferation in tumor cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Doc_abstract":"Amplification for the ERBB2 oncogene encoding the HER2/neu protein (HER2) is of predictive and prognostic importance in breast carcinoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely accepted method for determining HER2 amplification status. A HER2-amplified tumor is defined as having a ratio of HER2 signals to chromosome 17 centromeric probe signals (HER2/CEP17 ratio) exceeding 2.2. However, the presence of scattered cells demonstrating HER2 amplification is of unclear significance. A 2009 panel guideline defined a tumor with 'genetic heterogeneity' as having at least 5% but fewer than 50% of (non-clustered) tumor nuclei with a ratio >2.2. The study objective was to examine the statistical distribution of breast tumors tested by FISH for HER2 amplification, after implementation of this 2009 guideline. We identified 2522 consecutive breast carcinoma cases (2009-2011) tested for HER2 amplification. All cases were tested by FISH using a standard clinical protocol, adhering to established guidelines. For each case, data on cell counts were retrieved electronically. Each tumor was compared with a theoretical normal distribution by quantile-quantile analysis. Of 2522 FISH tests for HER2, 1900 (75%) were non-amplified, 394 (16%) were amplified, and 228 (9%) were HER2-equivocal. A total of 666 (26%) had 'genetic heterogeneity.' Among these 'genetically heterogeneous' cases, the ratio was non-amplified in 430 (64.5%), amplified in 24 (4%), and equivocal in 212 (31.5%). The amplified subpopulation in 'genetically heterogeneous' tumors was larger if the overall ratio was close to 2.2. However, the percentage of nuclei >2.2 in a 'genetically heterogeneous' tumor was not informative of the underlying tumor-cell distribution. We conclude that the proportion of HER2-amplified nuclei within a tumor does not contribute information independent of the actual HER2/CEP17 ratio. Reassessment of the definition of 'genetic heterogeneity' in HER2 testing is warranted.",

This has led to renewed interest in the use of active immunization as a modality for the treatment of cancer. HER-2/neu is a 185-KDa receptor-like glycoprotein that is overexpressed by a variety of tumors including breast, ovarian, lung, prostate and colorectal carcinomata. Several immunogenic HER-2/neu peptides recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) or helper T lymphocytes (TH) have been identified thus far. Patients with HER-2/neu over-expressing cancers exhibit increased frequencies of peripheral blood T cells recognizing immunogenic HER-2/neu peptides. Various protocols for generating T cell-mediated immune responses specific for HER-2/neu peptides have been examined in pre-clinical models or in clinical trials. Vaccination studies in animals utilizing HER-2/neu peptides have been successful in eliminating tumor growth. In humans, however, although immunological responses have been detected against the peptides used for vaccination, no clinical responses have been described. Because HER-2/neu is a self-antigen, functional immune responses against it may be limited through tolerance mechanisms. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether abrogation of tolerance to HER-2/neu using appropriate adjuvants and/or peptide analogs may lead to the development of immune responses to HER-2/neu epitopes that can be of relevance to cancer immunotherapy. Vaccine preparations containing mixtures of HER-2/neu peptides and peptide from other tumor-related antigens might also enhance efficacy of therapeutic vaccination.",

In this study, we aimed at delineating the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of HNCE diagnosed on the basis of the World Health Organization criteria for pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas. We identified 42 (3.8%) consecutive resection cases of HNCE among 1105 esophageal cancers over a 7-year period. Patients' mean age was 62 years (range, 47 to 79 y) with a male to female ratio of 3.7. Dysphagia was present in 79% of patients and tobacco abuse in 50%. Most tumors were centered in the middle (52%) or lower (36%) esophagus; 48% were ulcerated and 31% exophytic. All tumors were sharply demarcated with a pushing border in either solid sheet (83%) or nodular (17%) growth patterns. Pure HNCE was found in 57%, and the remainder also exhibited small components of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) or glandular, signet ring cell differentiations. SqCC in situ was present in 50%. Most tumors (88%) were the small cell type with pure oat-like cells in 52%, and the larger spindled, anaplastic, and giant cells were common. Tumor crush artifact (98%) and the Azzopardi effect (88%) were widespread. Extensive lymphovascular (50%) and perineural (33%) invasion and metastasis to regional (48%) and abdominal celiac lymph nodes (29%) were observed. Neoplastic cells were immunoreactive to synaptophysin (100%), CD56 (93%), chromogranin A (67%), p63 (55%), TTF-1 (71%), CK8/18 (90%), CD117 (86%), HER2 (16%), and p16 (84%) antibodies. The 5-year survival rate was 25%, similar to that of SqCC. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion was associated with a worse prognosis.",

Histological examination showed invasive ductal carcinoma (scirrhous carcinoma) that was positive for hormonal receptor but negative for HER2 expression, and the nuclear grade was 1. She first received chemotherapy to decrease the tumor volume followed by hormonal therapy. After progression, imaging studies showed increased multiple lung and liver metastases and pleural effusion. Subsequently, treatment with combination of Bev and PTX was started from July 2014. After 4 courses of the combination therapy, multiple liver metastases were unchanged, but her liver function was impaired. Hence, she received capecitabine monotherapy (1,800 mg bis in die [BID]; 2-week administration followed by a week of rest). Her liver function improved early, and a partial response (PR) in the multiple liver metastases was achieved 3 months after initiation of therapy. Furthermore, the metastatic lesions were well controlled 4 months later. These findings suggest that the sensitivity to an anticancer agent greatly varies among patients.",

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Trastuzumab in patient-derived esophageal squamous cell carcinoma xenograft (PDECX) mouse models.;PDECX models were established by implanting patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues into immunodeficient (SCID/nude) mice. HER-2 gene copy number (GCN) and protein expression were determined in xenograft tissues and corresponding patient EC samples by FISH and IHC analysis. Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated within these PDECX models (n = 8 animals/group). Furthermore, hotspot mutations of EGFR, K-ras, B-raf and PIK3CA genes were screened for in the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues. Similarity between the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissue was confirmed by histology, morphology, HER-2 GCN and mutation.;None of the PDECX models (or their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues) harbored HER-2 gene amplification. IHC staining showed HER-2 positivity (IHC 2+) in 2 PDECX models and negativity in 3 PDECX models. Significant tumor regression was observed in the Trastuzumab-treated EC044 HER-2 positive model (IHC 2+). A second HER-2 positive (IHC 2+) model, EC039, harbored a known PIK3CA mutation and showed strong activation of the AKT signaling pathway and was insensitive to Trastuzumab treatment, but could be resensitised using a combination of Trastuzumab and AKT inhibitor AZD5363. In summary, we established 5 PDECX mouse models and demonstrated tumor regression in response to Trastuzumab treatment in a HER-2 IHC 2+ model, but resistance in a HER-2 IHC 2+/PIK3CA mutated model.;This study demonstrates Trastuzumab-induced tumor regressions in HER-2 positive tumors, and highlights PIK3CA mutation as a potential resistance mechanism to Trastuzumab treatment in pre-clinical patient-derived EC xenograft models.",

CCNE1 amplification and CCNE1 or F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7) expression in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma was assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. CCNE1 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to assess the CCNE1 function. The results showed that CCNE1 amplification was present in 9 (8.3%) of 108 endometrial carcinomas. CCNE1 amplification was correlated with high histological grade (Grade 3; p=0.0087) and lymphovascular space invasion (p=0.0258). No significant association was observed between CCNE1 amplification and FIGO stage (p=0.851), lymph node metastasis (p=0.078), body mass index (p=0.265), deep myometrial invasion (p=0.256), menopausal status (p=0.289) or patient age (p=0.0817). CCNE1 amplification was significantly correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival (p=0.0081 and 0.0073, respectively). CCNE1 protein expression or loss of FBXW7 expression in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma tended to be correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that CCNE1 amplification was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival but not for progression-free survival (P=0.0454 and 0.2175, respectively). Profound growth inhibition was observed in siRNA-transfected cancer cells with endogenous CCNE1 overexpression compared with that in cancer cells having low CCNE1 expression. CCNE1 amplification was independent of p53, HER2, MLH1 and ARID1A expression but dependent on PTEN expression in endometrial carcinomas. These findings indicated that CCNE1 amplification was critical for the survival of endometrial endometrioid carcinomas. Furthermore, the effects of CCNE1 knockdown were dependent on the CCNE1 expression status, suggesting that CCNE1-targeted therapy may be beneficial for patients with endometrial endometrioid carcinoma having CCNE1 amplification.",

Using HER-2/neu transgenic mice (oncomice), we investigated whether, and if so how, anti-HER-2/neu immune responses are induced and modulated in these oncomice from birth to tumor initiation. Female oncomice carrying the activated HER-2/neu oncogene displayed apparent hyperplasia in mammary glands at 10 weeks of age and developed mammary carcinomas around an average age of 26 weeks. Unfractionated spleen cells from 10- to 15-week-old oncomice that were cultured without any exogenous stimuli exhibited cytotoxicity against the F31 tumor cell line established from an HER-2/neu-induced mammary carcinoma mass. The final antitumor effectors were a macrophage lineage of cells. However, this effector population was activated, depending on the stimulation of oncomouse CD4(+) T cells with oncomouse-derived antigen-presenting cell (APC) alone or with wild-type mouse APC in the presence of F31 membrane fractions, suggesting the presence of HER-2/neu-primed CD4(+) T cells and HER-2/neu-presenting APC in 10- to 15-week-old oncomice. These antitumor cytotoxic responses were detected at approximately 5 weeks of age and peaked at age 10 to 15 weeks. However, the responses then declined at tumor-bearing stages in which the expression of target proteins could progressively increase. This resulted from the dysfunction of CD4(+) T cells but not of APC or effector macrophages.

We evaluated the antitumor             effects of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits             EGFR and HER2, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer             cells. The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib, 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu             was measured by MTT assay and the combination index (CI) values were calculated.             Additionally, cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with             5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide             stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with             either agent alone or in combination. The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways             were monitored by western blotting. The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically             inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on             esophageal cancer cells. The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated             with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western             blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced             the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and inhibited the activation of downstream             signaling molecules, such as AKT and ERK. A significant G1 arrest was also observed             in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib, however, combination             with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest.

We contacted 53 of 57 patients with overexpression and 121 of 136 patients without HER-2/neu overexpression to ascertain a history of pesticide exposure. Forty-one of 53 (77.4%) patients with HER-2/neu overexpression and 47 of the 121 patients without overexpression (38.8%) were exposed to pesticides. We found that patients with history of pesticide exposure had a higher risk of having HER-2/neu overexpression (odds ratio, 5.38; P < 0.01, 95% confidence interval, 2.5-11.2);HER-2/neu is overexpressed in approximately 30% patients with ESSCLC and is associated with decreased survival. Also, pesticide exposure seems to be related to HER-2/neu overexpression seen in our patient population. Future studies are needed to validate our findings and also to determine which pesticide(s)/pesticide components are actually responsible for HER-2/neu overexpression seen in ESSCLC.",

Although response to antiestrogen therapy has been poor, there is a distinct subset of patients that respond. Strategies for treatment of ovarian cancer would be improved by identification of patients likely to respond to hormonal therapy. Cell culture models that are responsive or resistant to estrogen and antiestrogen may be of value in finding markers that predict responsiveness to hormonal therapy. Several model cell lines have been generated that express ER and proliferate in response to estrogen in vitro. Further studies are needed to better characterize the response of these ER positive cells lines to estrogen in vivo in mouse xenograft models. Expression of many of the same genes are regulated by estrogen in breast and in ovarian cancer cell lines. One exception may be the HER-2/neu oncogene product, which is down-regulated by estrogen in responsive breast carcinoma cells but not in two ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Initial analyses of several estrogen responsive and one resistant cell model suggests the potential value of progesterone receptor presence and low levels of HER-2/neu expression for predicting responsiveness to hormonal therapy. Additional cell models need to be investigated to determine the frequency with which these markers are associated with antiestrogen resistance.",

Clinical toxicities were also compared.;The survival benefit with CAB in advanced prostate cancer appears to be approximately 3 months. The survival benefit with the addition of vinorelbine to cisplatin for the treatment of advanced NSCLC is approximately 2 months, and the survival benefit with the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil (and leucovorin) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is approximately 2 to 3 months. The survival benefit with anastrozole or exemestane in advanced breast cancer, or with the addition of trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is approximately 4 to 5 months. The calculated cost per month of survival benefit with bicalutamide in CAB for prostate cancer is 437 US dollars to 1107 US dollars. The cost per month of survival benefit with vinorelbine for NSCLC is 1241 US dollars and with irinotecan for colorectal cancer is 6812 to 11,214 US dollars.

Five-year survival rates of about 0.4% are the norm, and little has changed in the last 70 years. Important etiological factors are age, sex, diet, tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse, occupation and chemical exposure, hereditary chronic pancreatitis, and previous surgery (cholecystectomy and gastrectomy). The majority of exocrine tumours of the pancreas are malignant and 80-90% of them comprise ductal adenocarcinomas. The development and growth of pancreatic carcinoma appears to be caused by a progressive accumulation of multiple genetic abnormalities. This includes oncogene (K-ras) activation, loss of tumour-suppressor p53 gene function and overexpression of growth factors and their ligands. The morphological background for the development of pancreatic carcinoma is ductal epithelial hyperplasia. Current molecular studies have resulted in the identification of cell clones exhibiting the same genetic alterations (K-ras and p53 mutations) as in infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is only partially defined. The purpose of our study was to evaluate Ki-67 proliferative index and HER-2/neu gene expression in pancreatic intraepithelial proliferative lesions as a sign of increasing epithelial proliferation and dysplasia. Additionally we made an attempt to apply morphometry in demarcating between intraepithelial proliferations of \"reactive\" type and proliferations with tendency towards progression to cancer. Another aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of bcl-2 and p53 genes in various types of pancreatic intraepithelial proliferations and in pancreatic cancer and to answer the question whether they interact in the process of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. We have also undertaken investigations aiming at determination of the CD44s gene and its v6 isoform expression in intraductal and invasive pancreatic carcinoma, attempting to correlate this expression with the p53 gene mutations. The results of our study indicate that intraductal pancreatic proliferations form a group of heterogeneous lesions possessing different proliferative activity of cells, karyometric features and HER-2/neu, bcl-2 and p53 genes expression. The precancerous lesion in the pancreas may be atypical papillary hyperplasia, which is similar to intraductal carcinoma with respect to the proliferative activity of cells and HER-2/neu, bcl-2 and p53 expression. Pancreatic carcinoma is characterised by high p53, CD44s and CD44v6 expression and low bcl-2 expression. CD44 and p53 genes expression is independent and between bcl-2 and p53 expression there is an inverse correlation. The p53 and CD44v6 expression is the higher the lower is the histological grade of the pancreatic carcinoma.",

We hypothesized that ErbB receptors show cell-specific and stimuli-specific activation, heterodimerization, and cellular localization patterns in fetal lung. We investigated this using immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy in primary isolated E19 fetal rat lung fibroblasts and epithelial type II cells, stimulated with epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, neuregulin 1beta, or treated with conditioned medium (CM) from the respective other cell type. Fetal type II cells expressed significantly more ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 protein than fibroblasts. ErbB4 was consistently identified by co-immunoprecipitation of all other ErbB receptors in both cell types independent of the treatments. Downregulation of ErbB4 in fibroblasts initiated cell-cell communication that stimulated surfactant phospholipid synthesis in type II cells. Confocal microscopy in type II cells revealed nuclear localization of all receptors, most prominently for ErbB4. Neuregulin treatment resulted in relocation to the extra-nuclear cytoplasmic region, which was distinct from fibroblast CM treatment which led to nuclear localization of ErbB4 and ErbB2, inducing co-localization of both receptors.

T regulatory cell (Treg) suppression of tumor-specific T cells is one barrier to effective immunization. A second mechanism is the deletion of high avidity tumor-specific T cells, which leaves a less effective low avidity tumor specific T cell repertoire available for activation by vaccines. Treg depleting agents including low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) and antibodies that deplete CD25-expressing Tregs have been used with limited success to enhance the potency of tumor-specific vaccines. In addition, few studies have evaluated mechanisms that activate low avidity cancer antigen-specific T cells. Therefore, we developed high and low avidity HER-2/neu-specific TCR transgenic mouse colonies specific for the same HER-2/neu epitope to define the tolerance mechanisms that specifically affect high versus low avidity tumor-specific T cells.;High and low avidity CD8(+) T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice specific for the breast cancer antigen HER-2/neu (neu) were developed to provide a purified source of naïve, tumor-specific T cells that can be used to study tolerance mechanisms. Adoptive transfer studies into tolerant FVB/N-derived HER-2/neu transgenic (neu-N) mice demonstrated that high avidity, but not low avidity, neu-specific T cells are inhibited by Tregs as the dominant tolerizing mechanism. High avidity T cells persisted, produced IFNγ, trafficked into tumors, and lysed tumors after adoptive transfer into mice treated with a neu-specific vaccine and low dose Cy to deplete Tregs. Analysis of Treg subsets revealed a Cy-sensitive CD4(+)Foxp3(+)CD25(low) tumor-seeking migratory phenotype, characteristic of effector/memory Tregs, and capable of high avidity T cell suppression.;Depletion of CD25(low) Tregs allows activation of tumor-clearing high avidity T cells. Thus, the development of agents that specifically deplete Treg subsets should translate into more effective immunotherapies while avoiding autoimmunity.",

S100A4 mRNA is present in some cell lines derived from malignant breast cancers, but is not detectable in cells derived from benign breast tumours.

Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from lung cancer cell lines detected amplification of both the topoisomerase II alpha and ERBB2 genes in the adenocarcinoma line Calu3. These results indicate that topoisomerase II alpha and ERBB2 may be closely linked on chromosome 17 and coamplified during adenocarcinoma progression.

Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that gene amplification may result in protein overexpression and that amplification of the therapeutics' target gene can serve as an excellent predictive marker (i.e. HER2 and trastuzumab). However the impact of VEGFA gene amplification has been only recently assessed for some cancer types such as osteosarcoma, colorectal, breast and liver cancer.;This study aimed to assess VEGFA gene amplification status using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in a large cohort of different tumour entities. Thus, we investigated the incidence of VEGFA amplification using a multi-tumour tissue microarray (TMA) containing 2,837 evaluable specimens from 80 different tumour entities and 31 normal tissue types. Moreover, we validated FISH analysis as reference method to evaluate VEGFA gene status by comparing it to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).;We observed that VEGFA locus amplification and/or polysomy represented a small but regularly detected population in several tumour entities while was not present in normal tissues. VEGFA gene alterations were predominantly observed in hepatocarcinomas, adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and intestine, large cell carcinoma of the lung and in endometrium serous carcinoma. Furthermore our data demonstrated that VEGFA detection by FISH provided highly comparable results to those generated by CGH.;Albeit with low percentage, VEGFA amplification is commonly observed across several tumour entities.

Interestingly, cyclin E over-expression has been associated with trastuzumab resistance. We studied cyclin E over-expression, CCNE1 amplification, and relapse-free survival in HER-2-positive primary breast cancers treated with and without trastuzumab therapy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 202 HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were studied. Expression levels of cyclin E and proliferation marker Ki-67 were determined using immunohistochemistry. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) with a gene-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe was used to analyze presence of CCNE1 amplification. Majority of HER-2-positive breast carcinomas exhibited nuclear staining for cyclin E protein. Cyclin E was highly expressed (≥50 % cells) in 37 % of cases. Incidence of CCNE1 amplification (≥6 gene copies/cell or clusters) was 8 %. Cyclin E amplification and over-expression were strongly associated with each other, grade, hormone receptors, and Ki-67. Neither high cyclin E expression nor CCNE1 amplification was associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) irrespective of short-term (9-week regimen) adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. These results confirm cyclin E and HER-2 gene co-amplification in a fraction of HER-2-positive breast cancers.

Treatment-induced drug resistance was associated with increased chromosomal aberrations as shown by spectral karyotyping analysis, suggesting changes beyond neu signaling pathways. When mice were immunized with pneuTM encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of neu, antibody and T-cell responses were induced, and both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumor cells were rejected. In T-cell-depleted mice, drug-sensitive tumors were still rejected by vaccination, but drug-refractory tumors survived in some mice, indicating their resistance to anti-neu antibodies. To further test if T cells alone can mediate tumor rejection, mice were immunized with pcytneu encoding full-length cytoplasmic neu that is rapidly degraded by the proteasome to activate CD8 T cells without inducing antibody response. All test tumors were rejected in pcytneu-immunized mice, regardless of their sensitivity to gefitinib or antibody.

To reduce the incidence of complications there has been a movement toward individualised therapy and less radical surgery. Associated with this, new tumour markers that could serve as prognostic indicators would be of considerable value to guide treatment decision. In this review, a brief update of molecular pathological markers of vulvar carcinomas is provided, and their impact as prognostic markers is addressed. p16, p21, p14, p27, cyclin A, cyclin D1, p53, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor alpha, HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been found to be important in the pathogenesis and/or progression of vulvar carcinomas.

However, due to the relative small number of studies reported for each molecular pathological marker, and the relative small number of vulvar carcinomas included and the lack of multivariate analysis in the majority of these studies, no conclusion regarding the prognostic value of these markers can be drawn.

In the present study, we have evaluated the expression of versican and decorin in non-palpable breast carcinomas and their association with high risk mammographic findings and tumor characteristics.;Three hundred and ten patients with non-palpable suspicious breast lesions, detected during screening mammography, were studied. Histological examination was carried out and the expression of decorin, versican, estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR) and c-erbB2 (HER-2/neu) was assessed by immunohistochemistry.;Histological examination showed 83 out of 310 (26.8%) carcinomas of various subtypes. Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 62/83 carcinomas. Decorin was accumulated in breast tissues with MD and MAMCs independently of the presence of malignancy. In contrast, versican was significantly increased only in carcinomas with MAMCs (median ± SE: 42.0 ± 9.1) and MD (22.5 ± 10.1) as compared to normal breast tissue with MAMCs (14.0 ± 5.8), MD (11.0 ± 4.4) and normal breast tissue without mammographic findings (10.0 ± 2.0). Elevated levels of versican were correlated with higher tumor grade and invasiveness in carcinomas with MD and MAMCs, whereas increased amounts of decorin were associated with in situ carcinomas in MAMCs. Stromal deposition of both proteoglycans was related to higher expression of ERα and PR in tumor cells only in MAMCs.;The specific accumulation of versican in breast tissue with high MD and MAMCs only in the presence of malignant transformation and its association with the aggressiveness of the tumor suggests its possible use as molecular marker in non-palpable breast carcinomas.",

The safety of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for these patients is unknown but interest in BCS has recently resurfaced as a result of the detection of occult second malignancies by breast magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). We report a small number of patients who chose to undergo \"double lumpectomies,\" defined as two separate segmental mastectomies for primary cancers in different quadrants of the same breast. Patients with multicentric breast cancer surgically managed with  double lumpectomies at our institute were identified retrospectively. Clinicopathologic features are described and outcomes reported. Seven patients underwent double lumpectomies for multicentric carcinoma. Median age was 69 years (range, 61 to 80 years). In five patients, MRI identified ipsilateral  second malignancies. All patients had two foci of invasive carcinoma, all tumors expressed estrogen receptor, and none showed HER-2 overexpression. Tumor sizes ranged from 0.7 to 2.9 cm. Six patients had histologically distinct tumors in the same breast: five had one invasive lobular carcinoma  (ILC) and one invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and one had classic ILC in one quadrant and pleomorphic ILC in another. One patient had two foci of IDC in separate quadrants. All patients had sentinel lymph node biopsies and none had nodal metastasis. Median follow-up was 26 months (range,  18 to 85 months). No patient developed locoregional recurrence. This small series suggests that \"double lumpectomy\" may be considered for multicentric invasive breast carcinoma in carefully selected patients with favorable tumors who desire breast conservation.",

Unfortunately, they are relatively nonspecific and thus have a tendency to affect other rapidly growing normal cells in a deleterious manner. Triplex-forming oligodeoxyribonucleotides (TFOs) promise to be a new class of sequence-specific DNA-binding drugs which will target malignancies at the transcriptional level. The formation of an intermolecular triplex (triple helix) has been shown to block the binding of transcription factors and repress transcription in genes such as c-myc and that encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. The rat neu oncogene promoter contain promoter-enhancer elements which are purine/pyrimidine rich. These enhancer elements are amenable to targeting by TFOs. the human counterpart of rat neu, HER2, is often found to be amplified or overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, such as those of the breast, lungs, ovary, colon and stomach. TFOs may proved to be the basis of effective chemotherapy drugs for these cancers. TFO binding at the \"GTG\" element (5'GGTGGGGGGG) and at the 'GA' element (5'GGAGGAGGAGGG) has been characterized by gel mobility shift analysis and DNase 1 footprinting. Binding has been shown to occur at a Kd as low as 10(-8) M and has been shown to be sequence specific.",

This marker is also considered a powerful prognostic factor in BC, with similar data emerging in other solid tumours such as bladder, ovarian, endometrial, gastro-oesophageal and non-small cell lung cancer. Her2 amplification and/or overexpression are highly predictive of response to HER2-targeted compounds such as trastuzumab and lapatinib but have been inconsistent predictors of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is also evidence that these tumours are relatively resistant to anti-oestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) but not to oestrogen deprivation (e.g. with aromatase inhibitors). T2A aberrations are uncommon events in solid tumours, with an overall prevalence of approximately 10%. T2A amplification has shown inconsistent correlation with T2A protein expression in preclinical and clinical studies, mainly because non-genetic events such as proliferation rate can also affect protein expression. Expression of T2A protein has not been shown to reliably predict response to T2A inhibitors, despite the fact that this enzyme is the direct target for these compounds. In BC, T2A amplification appears to be a good predictor of response to anthracyclines, but these data are still in the process of validation.

There is no robust marker capable of identifying invasive carcinomas that despite their small size have a high metastatic potential, and that would benefit from more aggressive treatment. RhoC-GTPase is a member of the Ras-superfamily and is involved in cell polarity and motility. We hypothesized that RhoC expression would be a good marker to identify breast cancer patients with high risk of developing metastases, and that it would be a prognostic marker useful in the clinic. We developed a specific anti-RhoC antibody and studied archival breast tissues that comprise a broad spectrum of breast disease. One hundred eighty-two specimens from 164 patients were used. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed tissues. Staining intensity was graded 0 to 3+ (0 to 1+ was considered negative and 2 to 3+ was considered positive). RhoC was not expressed in any of the normal, fibrocystic changes, atypical hyperplasia, or ductal carcinoma in situ, but was expressed in 36 of 118 invasive carcinomas and strongly correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.01). RhoC had high specificity (88%) in detecting invasive carcinomas with metastatic potential. Of the invasive carcinomas smaller than 1 cm, RhoC was highly specific in detecting tumors that developed metastases. RhoC expression was associated with negative progesterone receptor and HER-2/neu overexpression. We characterized RhoC expression in human breast tissues. RhoC is specifically expressed in invasive breast carcinomas capable of metastasizing, and it may be clinically useful in patients with tumors smaller than 1 cm to guide treatment.",

Discovering the molecular genetic basis of tumor subtypes may provide new opportunities for therapy. To identify the driver oncogene on 10p associated with basal-like tumors, we analyzed genomic profiles of 172 breast carcinomas. The smallest shared region of gain spanned just seven genes at 10p13, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID (CAMK1D), functioning in intracellular signaling but not previously linked to cancer. By microarray, CAMK1D was overexpressed when amplified, and by immunohistochemistry exhibited elevated expression in invasive carcinomas compared to carcinoma in situ. Engineered overexpression of CAMK1D in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells led to increased cell proliferation, and molecular and phenotypic alterations indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including loss of cell-cell adhesions and increased cell migration and invasion. Our findings identify CAMK1D as a novel amplified oncogene linked to EMT in breast cancer, and as a potential therapeutic target with particular relevance to clinically unfavorable basal-like tumors.",

A need exists to identify the underlying biological subsets of morphologically similar carcinomas in order to develop customized therapies for patients who require chemotherapy.

Humanized monoclonal antibody therapy (Herceptin; Genentech Co.) appears to benefit this subset of patients by improving their response rate and survival following anthracycline- or taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Both HER-2 gene amplification and protein overexpression correlate with clinical outcomes, and screening for HER-2 gene amplification appears to be the more informative test.

A synergistic interaction between trastuzumab in combination with CDDP (paclitaxel or vincristine) was obtained in MCF-7/HRG cells. Trastuzumab prevented activation of the antiapoptotic and proliferative cascades and inhibited HRG-induced Her-2/3 phosphorylation. CDDP efficacy was enhanced by trastuzumab in cells expressing endogenously high levels of HRG. Conversely, trastuzumab coexposure was ineffective in enhancing chemotherapy efficacy in cells that did not secrete HRG, such as MCF-7 cells overexpressing a structural mutated HRG isoform. Therefore, trastuzumab-induced REC, in the absence of Her-2 overexpression, occurs through the kinase activity of Her-2/3. Interestingly, HRG expression in tumor biopsies from invasive breast carcinomas (n = 189) revealed that, whereas the minority (12%) of Her-2 positive tumors (n = 60; 32%) demonstrated Her-2 phosphorylation, the majority (67%) of HRG-overexpressing and Her-2 tumors (n = 57; 30%) were in active Her-2 status.;We demonstrate that assessment of HRG expression and Her-2 activation define a particular breast cancer patient population for which trastuzumab plus CDDP or taxol are extremely efficient without Her-2 overexpression.",

A high tumour-to-background (T/B) ratio is crucial for successful imaging, which strongly depends on tumour-specific probes that rapidly accumulate in the tumour, while non-bound probes are rapidly cleared. Here, using pre-invasive breast cancer as a model, we investigate whether the use of combinations of probes with different target specificities results in higher T/B ratios and whether dual-spectral imaging leads to improvements in tumour characterization.;We performed optical molecular imaging of an orthotopic breast cancer model mimicking ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A combination of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific variable domains of the heavy chain from heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) was conjugated either to the same fluorophore (IRDye800CW) to evaluate T/B ratios or to different fluorophores (IRDye800CW, IRDye680RD or IRDye700DX) to analyse the expression of CAIX and HER2 simultaneously through dual-fluorescence detection. These experiments were performed non-invasively in vivo, in a mimicked intra-operative setting, and ex vivo on tumour sections.;Application of the CAIX- and HER2-specific VHH combination resulted in an increase of the T/B ratio, as compared to T/B ratios obtained from each of these single VHHs together with an irrelevant VHH. This dual tumour marker-specific VHH combination also enabled the detection of small metastases in the lung. Furthermore, dual-spectral imaging enabled the assessment of the expression status of both CAIX and HER2 in a mimicked intra-operative setting, as well as on tumour sections, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.;These results establish the feasibility of the use of VHH 'cocktails' to increase T/B ratios and improve early detection of heterogeneous tumours and the use of multispectral molecular imaging to facilitate the assessment of the target expression status of tumours and metastases, both invasive or non-invasively.",

To identify candidate therapeutic targets and innovative treatment options for these carcinomas, we examined epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR), HER2, and phosphorylated forms of Akt (p-Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) in 47 salivary gland tumors using immunohistochemistry. EGFR overexpression was found in 51 % of the tumors (24/47); in particular, EGFR overexpression occurred in mucoepidermoid (seven out of seven) and salivary duct carcinomas (9/12). Although EGFR amplification was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, increased copy number due to polysomy of chromosome 7, which houses EGFR, was observed in 4 of the 24 tumors with EGFR overexpression; this polysomy occurred most frequently in salivary duct carcinomas (three out of nine). HER2 overexpression was observed in 21 % (10/47) of all tumors; in these 10 tumors, HER2 gene amplification was found in seven cases. p-Akt was found in 51 % (24/47) of all tumors, most frequently in mucoepidermoid carcinomas (six out of seven). p-mTOR was found in 57 % of the latter (four out of seven). Consequently, different signaling cascades were found activated: (1) an EGFR/HER2(-Akt)-mTOR-dependent axis, with gene gains of HER2 and/or EGFR, activated in salivary duct carcinoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma; (2) an EGFR(-Akt)-mTOR-dependent pathway activated in mucoepidermoid carcinoma or acinic cell carcinoma, without HER2 or EGFR gene alterations; and (3) an Akt-dependent pathway without EGFR/HER2 activation in other types. These findings indicate that phosphoprotein mapping of components in the EGFR/HER2-Akt-mTOR pathways may be a useful guide to select appropriate targeting regimens.",

A prior NIST workshop addressed this need by reaching a consensus to create cell lines as reference materials for HER2 testing.;Breast carcinoma cell lines SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 were characterized quantitatively by IHC with chicken anti-HER2 IgY antibody and by FISH with biotinylated bacterial artificial chromosome DNA probes; both assays used quantum dots as detectors. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell blocks were prepared and tested for suitability as candidate reference materials by IHC and FISH with commercially available reagents. IHC and FISH results were also compared with those obtained by laser-scanning cytometry and real-time PCR, respectively.;MCF-7 cells had typical numbers of gene copies and very low production of HER2 protein, whereas SK-BR-3 cells contained approximately 10-fold more copies of the gene and exhibited approximately 15-fold higher amounts of HER2 protein than MCF-7 cells. FFPE SK-BR-3 cells showed results similar to those for fresh SK-BR-3 cells.;SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 are suitable as candidate reference materials in QC of HER2 testing.

Although amplification of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 has been reported in breast cancers, their role in the progression of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma is unclear. To investigate this question we compared the amplification frequencies of these genes in pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma.;We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization of the selected genes on tissue microarrays composed of 179 pure DCIS and 438 invasive carcinomas. Two hundred and sixteen of the latter had DCIS components, and in those cases we compared gene amplification in the intraductal and invasive components of each carcinoma.;The rate of amplification of FGFR1 was higher in invasive carcinomas than in the pure DCIS, but the opposite was true for HER2 amplification. These findings applied consistently to high-grade tumors, but not to low/intermediate-grade tumors. The amplification status of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 was generally similar in the matched invasive and DCIS components of the same tumors. However, FGFR1 amplification was more common in the invasive components than in the DCIS components. In survival analyses, FGFR1 amplification was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-free survival for all patients with invasive carcinoma and for the hormone receptor-positive subgroup.;Amplification of HER2, C-MYC and CCND1 seems to play a role in the early development of breast cancer, but not in its progression. However, the increased frequency of FGFR1 amplification in invasive carcinomas compared with pure DCIS and in the invasive components of individual tumors, and its association with decreased disease-free survival, suggests a role for FGFR1 amplification in the progression of breast cancer including in situ-to-invasive transition, as well as initiation.",

These molecules mimic the activity of IL-2 and assist in activating and expanding antitumor effector cells. To enhance the cytolytic activity of CTL specific for peptide epitopes of the Her-2/neu tumor Ag presented by HLA-A*0201 molecules, a fusion protein was constructed consisting of a single chain Ab specific for Her-2/neu, linked to IL-2 (neu-Ab-IL-2). When added to a mixture of tumor cells and Her-2/neu-specific CTL, the protein was found to augment lysis of tumor cells. In addition, the hybrid molecule also promoted lysis of Her-2/neu expressing tumors by non-tumor-specific cloned T cell lines, including Th1 CD4 cells. Analysis of the mechanism of cytotoxicity revealed that the fusion protein mediates the formation of stable conjugates between T cells expressing IL-2R and tumor cells expressing Her-2/neu, resulting in lysis through the Fas-Fas ligand pathway. Lysis induction was independent of specific engagement by the TCR. When tested for its ability to enhance tumor cell eradication by Her-2/neu-specific CD8+ T cells in an adoptive transfer model in SCID mice, neu-Ab-IL-2 facilitated the elimination of tumor cells in vivo. Surprisingly, the combination of non-tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and fusion protein also induced a significant delay of tumor growth. This represents a novel approach for redirecting non-tumor-specific T cells to eliminate tumors.",

A majority of clinically HER2-positive tumors were scored as FASN overexpressors in a series of almost 200 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Re-classification of HER2-positive breast tumors based on FASN gene expression predicted a significantly inferior relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival in HER2+/FASN+ patients. Notably, non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells engineered to overexpress HER2 upregulated FASN gene expression, and the FASN inhibitor C75 abolished HER2-induced anchorage-independent growth and survival. Furthermore, in the presence of high concentrations of C75, HER2-negative MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 (MCF-7/HER2) had significantly higher levels of apoptosis than HER2-negative cells. Finally, C75 at non-cytotoxic concentrations significantly reduced the capacity of MCF-7/HER2 cells to form mammospheres, an in vitro indicator of cancer stem-like cells.

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

A new paradigm of targeted therapies holds the most promise for the future, making identification of tumor-specific therapeutic targets of prime importance. ERBB2/HER2, best known for its role in breast cancer tumorigenesis, can be targeted by two types of pharmacological manipulation: antibody therapy against the extracellular receptor domain and small molecule compounds against the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Aberrant activation of ERBB2 by gene amplification has been shown to participate in the pathophysiology of breast, ovarian, gastric, colorectal, lung, brain, and head and neck tumors. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled efficient identification of activating molecular alterations of ERBB2. In this review, we will focus on the functional role of these somatic mutations that cause ERBB2 receptor activation. We will additionally discuss the current preclinical and clinical therapeutic strategies for targeting mutationally activated ERBB2.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor Her-2/neu (erbB-2) that has shown therapeutic efficacy against Her-2/neu-overexpressing breast tumors. However, less than 35% of patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer respond to trastuzumab as a single agent, whereas the remaining cases do not demonstrate tumor regression. Furthermore, the majority of patients who achieve an initial response generally acquire resistance within one year. Therefore, the identification of the potential mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab can be very helpful for the development of new compounds, which might overcome that resistance and/or have additive/synergistic antitumor effect when given in association with trastuzumab. Recent studies in breast cancer cells have revealed a bi-directional connection between Her-2/neu and fatty acid synthase (FAS), a major lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids from the 2-carbon donors malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Her-2/neu overexpression stimulates the FAS promoter and ultimately mediates increased endogenous fatty synthesis, and this Her-2/neu-mediated induction of breast cancer-associated FAS is inhibitable by trastuzumab. On the other hand, chemical FAS inhibitors as well as RNA interference-mediated silencing of FAS gene repress Her-2/neu gene expression at the transcriptional level. Moreover, specific FAS blockade synergistically sensitizes breast cancer cells carrying Her-2/neu-oncogene amplification and/or overexpression to trastuzumab-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Strikingly, FAS inhibition synergistically interacts with trastuzumab in Her-2/neu-negative breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress Her-2/neu, thus suggesting that the molecular linkage between FAS activity and functioning of Her-2/neu cannot be explained only on the basis of a transcriptional repression of Her-2/neu gene promoter. Interestingly, while in liver and adipose tissue FAS produces fat from excess carbon consumed as carbohydrates, which is ultimately stored as triglycerides, in epithelial cancer cells, FAS activity is mainly involved in the production of phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid raft-aggregates), which point to an active role of FAS in the deregulation of membrane functioning in tumor cells. Importantly, clusters of Her-2/neu and EGFR (erbB-1) co-localize with lipid rafts and the lipid environment in the cell membrane of breast cancer cells profoundly influences their association properties and biological functions. We hypothesize that pharmacological or small interference RNA-induced inhibition of breast cancer-associated FAS will result in major changes in the synthesis of phospholipids which, in turn, should impair a correct cellular localization of Her-2/neu at the cellular membrane of breast cancer cells. In this working model, FAS inhibition could induce a shift in the equilibrium between transport of Her-2/neu to and from the membrane favoring an increased Her-2/neu internalization followed by intracellular degradation, thus enhancing the mechanism of action of the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab. Moreover, the inhibition of FAS-driven lipid rafts will also negatively affect EGFR-Her-2/neu cross-talk, an important mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. In summary, the specific blockade of a novel molecular linkage between FAS-regulated membrane composition and functioning of transmembrane growth factor receptors EGFR and Her-2/neu may represent a previously unrecognized therapeutic approach circumventing trastuzumab resistance in breast carcinomas.",

The goal of the study was to evaluate WWOX protein expression in epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues to determine whether they correlated with clincopathologic parameters. We performed WWOX expression analyses by means of immunohistochemistry on 112 epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues, and ovarian carcinoma-derived SKOV3, 3AO cells. The basic significant level was fixed at P<0.05. Loss of WWOX expression was observed in 32 (28.6%) of 112 ovarian carcinoma samples and was positively correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) (P<0.001) and negative progesterone receptor (PR) (P=0.001). A statistically significant correlation was observed between the lack of WWOX expression and the advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages (P=0.02). Furthermore, negative WWOX staining was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.013), whereas no significant differences were found between WWOX and HER-2/neu staining (P=0.79). WWOX protein expression was moderately detectable in SKOV3 cells but not in 3AO cells. Our results indicate that loss of WWOX expression in epithelial ovarian carcinomas correlates with negative ER, negative PR, advanced FIGO stages, and lymph node metastases.",

As a result of its potential role in the selection of therapy, HER-2/neu testing has reached near-standard-of-practice status in breast cancer. There is considerable interest in HER-2/neu as a prognostic factor and target of therapy in tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In this review of HER-2/neu expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, and colon, a wide range of expression of HER-2/neu from 0 to 83% likely reflects both differences in methods and reagents, as well as study bias associated with patient selection (i.e., early versus advanced disease). For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, little information exists as to the prognostic significance of HER-2/neu expression. In adenocarcinoma associated with Barrett's esophagus there is contradictory data. However, most of the information available indicates that this marker has significant prognostic value. In gastric adenocarcinoma, the wide expression range may truly reflect patient selection because HER-2/neu positivity appears linked to advanced rather than early disease with limited invasion. The majority of studies favor a significant prognostic value of HER-2/neu status for this tumor. Finally, in colorectal cancer HER-2/neu overexpression also appears to be a significant adverse outcome indicator as judged by the current published literature. In conclusion, given that either HER-2/neu protein overexpression or gene amplification is associated with approximately one-fourth of all gastrointestinal tract malignancies, strategies designed to employ the marker in therapy selection appear warranted. During the next several years it will not be surprising to see these tumors treated with antiHER-2/neu modalities such as Herceptin, likely in combination with other agents initially for patients with advanced disease, and possibly for individuals with high-risk lesions in an adjuvant setting.",

The functional role of p130Cas in ErbB2-dependent breast tumorigenesis was assessed by its silencing in breast cancer cells derived from mouse mammary tumors overexpressing ErbB2 (N202-1A cells), and by its reexpression in ErbB2-transformed p130Cas-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We demonstrate that p130Cas is necessary for ErbB2-dependent foci formation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo growth of orthotopic N202-1A tumors. Moreover, intranipple injection of p130Cas-stabilized siRNAs in the mammary gland of Balbc-NeuT mice decreases the growth of spontaneous tumors. In ErbB2-transformed cells, p130Cas is a crucial component of a functional molecular complex consisting of ErbB2, c-Src, and Fak. In human mammary cells, MCF10A.B2, the concomitant activation of ErbB2, and p130Cas overexpression sustain and strengthen signaling, leading to Rac1 activation and MMP9 secretion, thus providing invasive properties. Consistently, p130Cas drives N202-1A cell in vivo lung metastases colonization.

Involvement of this drug in pulmonary carcinogenesis has been poorly investigated. We used murine models suitable to evaluate cigarette smoke-related molecular and histopathological alterations. A total of 481 Swiss H mice were used. The mice were exposed to mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS) during the first four months of life. After 10 weeks, MCS caused an elevation of bulky DNA adducts, oxidative DNA damage and an extensive downregulation of microRNAs in lung. After four months, an increase in micronucleus frequency was observed in peripheral blood erythrocytes. After 7.5 months, histopathological alterations were detected in the lung, also including benign tumors and malignant tumors, and in the urinary tract. A subchronic toxicity study assessed the non-toxic doses of lapatinib, administered daily with the diet after weaning. After 10 weeks, lapatinib significantly attenuated the MCS-related nucleotide changes and upregulated several low-intensity microRNAs in lung. The drug poorly affected the MCS systemic genotoxicity and had modest protective effects on MCS-induced preneoplastic lesions in lung and kidney, when administered under conditions that temporarily mimicked interventions either in current smokers or ex-smokers. On the other hand, it caused some toxicity to the liver. Thus, on the whole, lapatinib appears to have a low impact in the smoke-related lung carcinogenesis models used, especially in terms of tumorigenic response. ",

The histologic distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas may be challenging, especially in cases showing atypical features and in small or partial biopsies. We studied multiple oncogenic and therapeutic related proteins by immunohistochemistry to identify differences in expression between benign and malignant sebaceous proliferations. A total of 27 cases, including 9 sebaceous adenomas, 4 sebaceomas, 8 sebaceous carcinomas, and 6 cases of sebaceous hyperplasia, were examined by immunohistochemistry, with antibodies directed against Ki-67 (MIB-1), bcl-2, p53, p21WAF1, p27Kip1, c-erbB-2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, CD99, MLH-1, and MSH-2. We found that sebaceous adenomas and sebaceomas stained like sebaceous hyperplasia did, whereas carcinomas had statistically significantly increased levels of p53 (50% versus 11%, respectively) and Ki-67 (30% versus 10%). The carcinomas also had significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7% versus 56%, respectively) and p21 (16% versus 34%) compared to the adenomas. Thus, a combination of several of these markers may be diagnostically useful in challenging cases. In addition, we found little or no Her-2/neu and CD117 staining, indicating that immunotherapy with Herceptin or Gleevac would likely not be useful for sebaceous carcinomas.

We examined the incidence of lymph node metastasis in patients with microinvasive carcinoma who underwent surgery at our institution. Retrospective review of our pathology database was performed (1994-2012). Of 7000 patients surgically treated for invasive breast carcinoma, 99 (1%) were classified as microinvasive carcinoma. Axillary staging was performed in 81 patients (64, sentinel lymph node biopsy; 17, axillary lymph node excision). Seven cases (9%) showed isolated tumor/epithelial cells in sentinel nodes. Three of these seven cases showed reactive changes in lymph nodes, papillary lesions in the breast with or without displaced epithelial cells within biopsy site tract, or immunohistochemical (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2) discordance between the primary tumor in the breast and epithelial cells in the lymph node, consistent with iatrogenically transported epithelial cells rather than true metastasis. The remaining four cases included two cases, each with a single cytokeratin-positive cell in the subcapsular sinus detected by immunohistochemistry only, and two cases with isolated tumor cells singly and in small clusters (<20 cells per cross-section) by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry. The exact nature of cytokeratin-positive cells in the former two cases could not be determined and might still have represented iatrogenically displaced cells. In the final analysis, only two cases (3%) had isolated tumor cells. Three of these four cases had additional axillary lymph nodes excised, which were all negative for tumor cells. At a median follow-up of 37 months (range 6-199 months), none of these patients had axillary recurrences. Our results show very low incidence of sentinel lymph node involvement (3%), only as isolated tumor cells, in microinvasive carcinoma patients. None of our cases showed micrometastases or macrometastasis. We recommend reassessment of the routine practice of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with microinvasive carcinoma. ",

Performance of both techniques in a combined/hybrid protocol resulted in HER2 protein expression and gene signals identical to those produced by the individual techniques performed alone. Prospective validation of these dual staining protocols in 31 cases of breast carcinoma resulted in 100% concordance with results of CISH when performed alone, but was still associated with a reduced immunohistochemical signal in some cases.

Thirty-eight cases (35%) showed HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification, 20 of which (53%) had significant heterogeneity of protein expression by immunohistochemistry.

Five of the HER2-positive cases (13%) demonstrated discrepant immunohistochemical scores when using the FDA versus ASCO/CAP scoring system. The overall concordance rate between HER2 immunohistochemistry and FISH was 75% (39/52) when using the FDA criteria, compared with 81% (42/52) by the ASCO/CAP scoring system. In conclusion, in this largest comprehensive study, 35% of endometrial serous carcinoma harbors HER2 protein overexpression and/or gene amplification, over half of which demonstrate significant heterogeneity of protein expression. The current breast ASCO/CAP scoring criteria provide the highest concordance between immunohistochemistry and FISH. Assessment of HER2 immunohistochemistry on multiple tumor sections or sections with large tumor areas is recommended, due to the significant heterogeneity of HER2 protein expression.",

Various laboratory methods have been used for this purpose. The aim of the present work was to analyse the results obtained in the routine practice by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in determination of HER-2 status. Five hundred and three cases of breast invasive ductal carcinoma were selected to analyse the HER-2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest, Dako). HercepTest 2+ equivocal cases (60) were studied by FISH (PathVysion, Vysis) to determine HER-2 gene amplification. HER-2 overexpression determined by Herceptest was shown in 97/503 cases (19%). FISH performed on equivocal cases demonstrated HER-2 amplification in 11/60 tumours (18%). IHC and FISH together showed HER-2 overexpression/gene amplification in 21% of breast invasive carcinomas. Immunohistochemical determination of HER-2 status represents an easy and standardized method that (in contrast to FISH) can be performed in all pathology laboratories without need of any special microscope and enabling to check the morphologic features of the cells analysed. However, in order to assure the reliability of the results, standardization of fixation protocols, automation of the immunohistochemical procedure, and training of pathologists in the interpretation of the results (scoring criteria) should be a priority. Equivocal HercepTest cases must be analysed by FISH preferably in a reference laboratory.",

Two main pathways are involved in transmitting the proliferative signal from the membrane receptors to the nucleus: phosphatydil-inositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin and RAS-RAF-ERK pathways. A final effector of these signaling cascades is the cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation complex, which is negatively regulated by 4E-BP1. The aim of our work was to study the relative importance of the factors involved in these pathways and to see their correlation with the clinicopathologic features of the tumors and their prognosis. We studied 120 endometrial carcinomas, including 93 type I and 27 type II carcinomas, and 18 control cases. Tissue microarrays were constructed and immunohistochemistry was performed for HER2, p53, and the phosphorylated forms of protein kinase B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and 4E-BP1. HER2 was overexpressed in 11% of carcinomas but not in control cases, and 30% of carcinomas showed activation of protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, mostly in type II carcinomas. The phosphorylated form of 4E-BP1 was found to be cytoplasmic in 31% of cases, and in 63% of cases it showed nuclear expression; the latter was only found in carcinomas. p53 positivity was found in type II and in grade 3 type I carcinomas. This nuclear expression of phospho-4E-BP1 and HER2 overexpression were the only characteristics with prognostic significance. The activation of the signaling pathways that control cell growth is a common event in endometrial carcinomas. 4E-BP1 is a downstream effector of these pathways whose activation status correlates with aggressive phenotypes and prognosis. This factor can reflect the activity of these pathways, regardless of the upstream molecular alterations, and, therefore, it can be a hallmark of the transmission of the oncogenic signal to the nucleus.",

The comparative incidence and significance of HER-2/neu gene amplification for lobular and ductal breast cancer have not been previously characterized.;Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancer tissue sections from 71 women diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma were tested for HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method using the Ventana unique sequence probe (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). A series of 106 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma was similarly processed and tested. Lymph node status was available for 155 (88%) of the 177 cases and 82 (46%) were lymph node-negative (LN-) and 73 (41%) were lymph node-positive (LN+). Patients were treated for a mean of 65 months (range 1-169 months).;9 of 71 (13%) cases of lobular cancer featured HER-2/neu gene amplification, whereas 51 (48%) of 106 cases of ductal cancer showed amplification (P < 0.0001). On univariate analysis of combined lobular and ductal cases, HER-2/neu gene amplification detected by FISH predicted disease-related death (P < 0.0001).

Multivariate analysis of the lobular group alone revealed that LN+ status (P = 0.015) and stage (P = 0.01) were independent predictors of disease-related death, and HER-2/neu gene amplification reached near significance (P = 0.086). In the ductal carcinoma group alone, HER-2/neu gene amplification (P = 0.03), lymph node status (P = 0.0001), tumor stage (P = 0.0001), and tumor grade (P = 0.044) were independent predictors of overall disease survival.;HER-2/neu gene amplification detected by FISH was identified at a significantly lower rate in lobular compared with ductal breast cancer.

Our study addressed the role of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression and dimerization in esophageal cancers in situ and in vitro in the context of therapeutic EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. In archival pretreatment biopsies of esophageal carcinomas (n = 110), EGFR was preferentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) (22.4%; p = 0.088) and HER2 (34.4%; p < 0.001) with HER3 (91.5%; p < 0.001) in esophageal (Barrett's) adenocarcinomas (EACs). In situ proximity ligation assays revealed mainly EGFR and HER2 homodimers in ESCC and EAC cases, respectively. However, EAC cases also exhibited HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In vitro ESCC (OE21) cells displayed a significant response to erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib, with loss of AKT phosphorylation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. In EAC cells (OE19, OE33 and SK-GT-4), lapatinib was similarly effective in strongly HER2-positive (mainly HER2 homodimers and some HER2/EGFR heterodimers) OE19 and OE33 cells. The HER2-targeting antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) given alone were largely ineffective in ESCC and EAC cells. However, both antibodies significantly induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in EAC (OE19 and OE33) cells upon co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study reveals that overexpression of EGFR and HER2 predominantly results in homodimers in ESCCs and EACs, respectively. Still, some EACs also show HER2 dimerization plasticity, e.g., with HER3. Such RTK dimerization patterns affect responses to EGFR and HER2 targeting inhibitors in ESCC and EAC cells in vitro and hence may influence future prediction for particularly HER2-targeting inhibitors in EACs.",

Gene amplification was defined by a HER2:CHR17 ratio of ≥2.2; low and high levels of amplification were further defined as <2.5 and ≥2.5, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine HER2 protein expression using the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists Guidelines of HER2 staining. Protein expression, gene amplification, and chromosome 17 aneusomy were compared by Jonchkeere-Terpstra and Cochran-Armitage trend tests. In all, 19 of the 20 micropapillary carcinoma samples yielded usable dual-color in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results for evaluation. Overall, 68% (n=13) demonstrated HER2 protein expression of 2+ to 3+ staining. Gene amplification was present in 42% of samples (n=8), with 100% correlation with 2+ and 3+ protein expression. Gene amplification and protein expression were significantly associated (P=0.01). Overall, 53% of samples (n=10) had aneusomy of chromosome 17. Chromosome 17 aneusomy was present in approximately half of the samples evaluated, suggesting inherent genomic instability in this variant of urothelial carcinoma.

The debate is the benefit of an adjuvant treatment of HER2-neu (namely HER-2)-positive subcentimetric carcinoma with trastuzumab. Current guidelines do not suggest, with the highest level of evidence, whether trastuzumab should be administered after adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of high-risk pT1a/bN0M0 breast cancer. The major phase III trials that confirmed the benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy did not include small (<1 cm diameter) node-negative breast cancer. Several retrospective case series of HER-2-positive pT1a/bN0M0 carcinoma seem to demonstrate that they have a higher risk of relapse compared to the HER-2-negative counterpart. HER-2 also seems to confer an independent risk of recurrence and/or death in a multivariate analysis within large node-negative breast cancer populations. In particular, the best way to select higher-risk tumours that may achieve the best results from a trastuzumab-based therapy appears to be the in situ hybridization, which should follow the new recommended algorithm of the ASCO/CAP guidelines in case of doubtful results. According to the evidence that the survival of HER-2-positive BC can be improved with the introduction of trastuzumab respect to the HER-2-negative counterpart, there is today less uncertainty about the curative role of anti-HER-2 therapy in very early disease.",

Stimulation of these cell lines with either EGF (0.1-30 nM) or TGF-alpha (0.1-30 nM) led to a significant reduction in p185HER-2 expression. The effect was more pronounced in cells with normal HER-2 expression. A reduction of mRNA levels for p185HER-2 by EGF was observed in OVCAR-3 cells but not in the over-expressing lines HTB-77 and SKBR-3.

However, their role in the carcinogenesis of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) remains to be elucidated. In order to further define the role of these RTKs, 56 human skin tissue samples of normal skin, BCC and SCC were studied by conventional and differential and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). EGFR and HER3 were predominantly expressed in the BCCs and SCCs, while HER2 was ubiquitously expressed. HER4 was not expressed in any sample. Since in vitro studies have provided compelling evidence that heterodimer formation of these receptors are associated with different signal transduction processes, coexpression patterns might be decisive for the induction and maintenance of a malignant phenotype. These results confirm this concept: isolated HER2 expression and EGFR/HER2 were predominantly found in normal skin, while HER2/HER3 and the triple expression of EGFR/HER2/HER3 were seen more frequently in the BCCs and SCCs compared with normal skin (50% and 40% compared with 26%, respectively). The activation of HER3, in addition to EGFR and HER2, might therefore be associated with the malignant phenotype. However, due to the small numbers in this study, further confirmation of the patterns is needed.",

We evaluated various fixation protocols for optimal receptor testing by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) of human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ER/PR positive) and SKBR-3 (overexpressing HER-2). The cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin or Saccomanno Fixative (SF) for various time points, and either embedded in paraffin as cell blocks or prepared as cytospins. ER and PR slides were assigned a proportion score (PS; 0-5), an intensity score (IS; 0-3) and a total score (TS = PS + IS). Standard DAKO scoring system ranging from 0 to 3+ was used for the evaluation of HER-2 staining. Human breast cancer cells stained successfully for ER, PR and HER-2 when fixed in formalin and prepared as cell blocks. The optimal fixation time for formalin-fixed cells ranged from 2 to 96 hours. Cells fixed in SF from 2 to 96 hours also stained well for ER and PR. However, SF produced variable results for HER-2 staining; particularly, SF fixation beyond 24 hours caused false negative results. The interpretation of HER-2 staining on cytospins was not feasible irrespective of the fixative and fixation time.

In this review, we summarize the recent findings about how mutations of the EGFR and related genes affect sensitivity to EFGR-TKIs. We also discuss molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs that is almost inevitable in EGFR-TKI therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"HER2 is overexpressed in 15-20% of breast cancers. HER2 overexpression is known to reduce apoptosis but the underlying mechanisms for this association remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms for HER2-mediated survival, we investigated the relationship between HER2 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), a potent apoptosis inducer. Our results showed that HER2 interacts with PUMA, which was independent of HER2 activation. In addition, we observed that HER2 interacted with PUMA in both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial compartments. We next examined whether HER2 phosphorylates PUMA. Notably, PUMA tyrosine phosphorylation has never been reported. Using an intracellular assay, we found PUMA to be phosphorylated in breast cancer cells with activated HER2. Via cell-free HER2 kinase assay, we observed that PUMA was directly phosphorylated by HER2. Activation of HER2 decreased PUMA protein half-life. To identify which of the three tyrosines within PUMA are targeted by HER2, we generated three PUMA non-phosphorylation mutants each with a single Tyr→Phe substitution. Results indicated that each PUMA single mutant had lost some, but not all phosphorylation by HER2 indicating that HER2 targets all three tyrosines. Consequently, we created an additional PUMA mutant with all three tyrosines mutated (TM-PUMA) that could not be phosphorylated by HER2. Importantly, TM-PUMA was found to have a longer half-life than PUMA. An inverse association was observed between HER2 and PUMA in 93 invasive breast carcinoma samples. We further found that TM-PUMA suppressed growth of breast cancer cells to a greater degree than PUMA. Also, TM-PUMA had a stronger propensity to induce apoptosis than PUMA. Together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that PUMA can be tyrosine phosphorylated and that HER2-mediated phosphorylation destabilizes PUMA protein. The HER2-PUMA interplay represents a novel mechanism by which PUMA is regulated and a new molecular basis for HER2-mediated growth and survival of cancer cells. ",

The recently isolated lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1), the most important enzyme in membrane biogenesis, has been currently implicated in cancer development and progression. The published literature lacks comprehensive reports on LPCAT1 expression in breast cancer and its impact on patients' outcome. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of LPCAT1 in 80 primary breast carcinomas, 24 metastatic lymph nodes, and 30 non-neoplastic breast tissue specimens and statistically analyzed the association between LPCAT1 expression and clinicopathological variables and patients' outcome. LPCAT1 protein was significantly upregulated in primary breast carcinoma and showed a significant ascending pattern being the lowest in normal breast tissues, relatively increased in fibrocystic disease, and the highest in primary carcinoma. LPCAT1 expression was significantly higher at tumor's advancing edge and correlated positively with tumor's grade and TNM stage. Compared to primary tumor, LPCAT1 expression was significantly lower in ductal carcinoma in situ and significantly higher in metastatic lymph nodes. LPCAT1 overexpression was significantly associated with increased proliferative activity, negative estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, as well as triple-negative and HER2 disease molecular subtypes. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced stage, high grade, and LPCAT1 overexpression were independent predictors of early tumor recurrence. We conclude that LPCAT1 is implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis, evolution, and progression and appears to play a potentially crucial role as a determinant of local invasiveness and metastasis. LPCAT1 is an independent predictor of early tumor recurrence of breast carcinoma and represents a novel prognostic biomarker that reflects underlying biological alterations and thus constitutes a potentially promising target for new therapeutic strategies.",

Because expression of the neu gene in the mammary epithelium precedes the occurrence of tumors, it appears that another genetic event in addition to neu transgene expression is required for tumorigenesis. We have investigated the expression of PEA3, a new member of the ets oncogene family of transcriptional regulatory factors, in neu-induced mammary tumors to learn whether PEA3 plays a role in tumor progression in this organ. We observed high levels of PEA3 RNA in neu-induced tumors, but little, if any, PEA3 RNA in the surrounding mammary epithelium. Moreover, mammary tumors that had metastasized to the lung also overexpressed the PEA3 gene, whereas normal lung tissue did not. Similar results were obtained after analyses of other transgenic mouse lines bearing metastatic mammary tumors induced by polyomavirus middle T antigen. These findings suggest that enhanced expression of PEA3 may be required to facilitate mammary tumor progression and metastasis.",

Development of new therapeutic agents for inhibiting breast cancer metastasis is therefore an urgent need. We previously demonstrated that recombinant DNA-derived viral capsid protein VP1 (rVP1) of foot-and-mouth disease virus-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro. Here, we investigated whether rVP1 exhibits any inhibitory effects on migration/metastasis and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), a well-known biomarker for poor prognosis of breast cancer. The effects of rVP1 on cancer cell migration/invasion and metastasis were evaluated using Transwell migration assay and animal cancer models of metastasis. Western blotting, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining techniques were used to investigate the effects of rVP1 on HER-2 and signal transduction mediators. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of rVP1-induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition and significantly suppressed AP-2α and HER-2 expression as well as the migration and invasion of a variety of breast cancer cell lines in a β1-integrin-dependent manner in vitro. Gross and histopathologic examinations showed that rVP1 also suppressed metastasis of several breast cancer cell lines, including HER-2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells to lung, liver, or peripheral lymph node in orthotopic allograft/xenograft murine models. In addition, rVP1 significantly prolonged survival in breast cancer-bearing mice. Notably, no apparent side effects of rVP1 were detected, as shown by normal complete blood count levels and serum biochemistry profiles, including AST, ALT, BUN, and creatine. This study demonstrates that rVP1 suppresses the migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells via binding to β1 integrin receptor and down-regulation of AP-2α and HER-2 expression. The effectiveness of rVP1 on inhibiting migration/metastasis of breast cancer and HER-2 expression suggests that it may be suitable for serving as potential therapeutics for metastatic breast cancer particularly HER-2-overexpressing cancer.",

The feasibility of molecular analysis of CTCs after laser microdissection of filters used in ISET was illustrated, referring to HER-2 amplification. Blood samples drawn from 44 patients with breast cancer were preoperatively analyzed by ISET. From the same samples, total RNA was extracted and submitted to quantitative real-time RT-PCR for the detection of CK-19 mRNA-positive cells using TaqMan technology. HER-2 amplification was measured by real-time RT-PCR on DNA extracted from cells recovered by laser microdissection from 7 selected ISET-positive filters. Of 44 samples, 12 (27%) showed the presence of epithelial cells on the filter (mean +/- SE: 8.5 +/- 2.4 cells per milliliter of blood). A statistically significant agreement (P = .001) was observed between real-time RT-PCR results and those obtained by ISET. With regard to HER-2 amplification, a good correspondence was found between the results obtained from microdissected CTCs and those obtained using DNA extracted from the primary tumor (R = 0.918; P < .01), as well as the immunohistochemistry results. The ISET method allows for the collection of breast carcinoma cells by filtration despite their smaller dimension relative to other carcinoma cell types. The sensitivity and specificity of the method is comparable with those obtained using the quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay for the evaluation of CK-19 mRNA expression. Moreover, the laser microdissection technique allows for the recovery of nucleic acids for further molecular analysis and CTC characterization.",

We sought confirmation that this tumor is a basal-like breast cancer, expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and stem cell factor receptor (KIT). EGFR activating mutations and high copy number (associated with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib) and KIT activating mutations (associated with imatinib sensitivity) were then investigated. Seventy-seven metaplastic cases were identified (1976-2006); 38 with tumor blocks available underwent pathologic confirmation before EGFR and KIT immunohistochemical analyses. A tissue microarray of malignant glandular and metaplastic elements was constructed and analyzed immunohistochemically for cytokeratin 5/6, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p63, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR and HER-2/neu. DNA isolated from individual elements was assessed for EGFR and KIT activating mutations. All assessable cases were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and (except one) HER2. The majority were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 (58%), p63 (59%), and EGFR overexpression (66%); 24% were KIT positive. No EGFR or KIT activating mutations were present; 26% of the primary metaplastic breast carcinomas were fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive, displaying high EGFR copy number secondary to aneusomy (22%) and amplification (4%). We report here that metaplastic breast carcinoma is a basal-like breast cancer lacking EGFR and KIT activating mutations but exhibiting high EGFR copy number (primarily via aneusomy), suggesting that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be evaluated in this molecular subset of breast carcinomas.",

Ten of 16 (63%) died of their disease within 3 years, compared to only 49 (20%) of the 246 PIDC patients whose tumors did not take in nude mice. This could not be attributed to later stage disease of the tumors that took, because only 15% of these patients had 4 or more positive axillary lymph nodes as opposed to 28% of the patients whose tumors did not take. Sixty-four percent of the breast carcinomas growing in nude mice exhibited amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene which is also correlated with poor prognosis in human breast cancer.

The tumor cells exhibited sharply defined borders, polygonal contours, a clear or finely granular cytoplasm, and moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor cells showed a positive reaction with periodic acid Schiff, eliminated by diastase digestion. The tumor was diagnosed as GRCC. There was no nodal metastasis. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, HER2, and p53, but negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Although the biological behavior of GRCC is difficult to predict in view of the very limited number of case reports, the prognosis of GRCC may be associated with not only histopathological subtype but also other clinicopathological factors, such as size, status of invasion, status of nodal metastasis, nuclear grade, ER, PR, HER-2, p53 and so on.

Amplification and/or over-expression of Her-2/neu occur in multiple human malignancies and are associated with poor prognosis. Her-2/neu proto-oncogene is a suitable target for cancer immunotherapy. We have developed and characterized a murine monoclonal anti-Id antibody, 6D12 that mimics a specific epitope of Her-2/neu and can be used as a surrogate antigen for Her-2/neu. In this study, the efficacy of 6D12 as a tumor vaccine was evaluated in a murine tumor model. Immunization of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with 6D12 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and mixed with Freund's adjuvant or 6D12 combined with the adjuvant QS21 induced anti-6D12 as well as anti-Her-2/neu immunity. Her-2/neu-positive human breast carcinoma cells, SK-BR-3 reacted with immunized mice sera as determined by ELISA and flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis also demonstrated strong reactivity of immunized mice sera with human Her-2/neu transfected EL4 cells (EL4-Her-2), but no reactivity with nontransfected parental EL4 cells. Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity against EL4-Her-2 cells was also observed in presence of immune sera. Mice immunized with 6D12 were protected against a challenge with lethal doses of EL4-Her-2 cells, whereas no protection was observed against parental EL4 cells or when mice were immunized with an unrelated anti-Id antibody and challenged with EL4-Her-2 cells. These data suggest that anti-Id 6D12 vaccine can induce protective Her-2/neu specific antitumor immunity and may serve as a potential network antigen for the treatment of patients with Her-2/neu-positive tumors.",

This study explored the feasibility of molecular profiling to determine the correlation between HER-2 expression, hormonal sensitivity, and the antitumor effects of trastuzumab and paclitaxel in patients with prostate carcinoma.;Patients with progressive androgen dependent (AD) and androgen independent (AI) prostate carcinoma were eligible to participate in the study. HER-2 expression was assessed on pretreatment tissue specimens, and patients were then assigned to one of four treatment groups: AD HER-2 positive, AD HER-2 negative, AI HER-2 positive, and AI HER-2 negative. They were treated with weekly trastuzumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) until they experienced disease progression, when weekly paclitaxel at 100 mg/m(2) was added.;The authors screened 130 patients for HER-2 expression. In total, 23 patients were treated. Six eligible patients had HER-2 positive disease; therefore, only the AI HER-2 negative arm accrued to completion. All patients (100%) experienced disease progression on trastuzumab alone at or before the first 12 weeks of treatment. Fifteen patients received combined therapy: Seven patients (47%) experienced disease progression, 5 patients (33%) had stable disease, and 3 patients (20%) had a decline > or = 50% in prostate specific antigen PSA level or in soft tissue disease. HER-2 overexpression was found in significant proportions only in AI metastatic tissue samples (42% HER-2 positive; 95% confidence interval, 14-60%). In three of nine matched pairs, the AD prostate biopsy was HER-2 negative, and the AI metastatic sample was HER-2 positive.;Trastuzumab is not effective as a single agent for the treatment of patients with AI HER-2 negative tumors. HER-2 expression varies by clinical state in patients with prostate carcinoma: Accurate HER-2 profiling requires sampling metastatic tissue in patients with metastatic disease. Further development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2 positive tumors.",

Here we report the construction of a recombinant λ phage that efficiently expresses specific nanobody towards third domain of HER-2 target on SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro. We constructed recombinant λ phage particles containing a mammalian expression cassette, C-Myc tagged, encoding VHH gene of camelid anti HER-2 third domain epitope using λ ZAP-cytomegalic virus (CMV) vector. The SKBR-3, MCF-7 and human endometrial stem cells were treated by the nanobody displayed recombinant λ phage. The cell growth inhibition assay was performed by MTT Cell Viability Assay Kit. After the fourth round of biopanning there was a significant enrichment in the phage specifically binding to the antigen. The ratio of targeted phage increased approximately 1,000-fold in the fifth round. The nanobody expressed by λ ZAP-CMV-VHH phagemid cloned in λ bioparticles significantly inhibited the proliferation of HER-2 positive SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cells.

Here, we redirected continuously expanding and clinically usable established human NK-92 cells to the tumor-associated ErbB2 (HER2) antigen. Following GMP-compliant procedures, we generated a stable clonal cell line expressing a humanized CAR based on ErbB2-specific antibody FRP5 harboring CD28 and CD3ζ signaling domains (CAR 5.28.z). These NK-92/5.28.z cells efficiently lysed ErbB2-expressing tumor cells in vitro and exhibited serial target cell killing. Specific recognition of tumor cells and antitumor activity were retained in vivo, resulting in selective enrichment of NK-92/5.28.z cells in orthotopic breast carcinoma xenografts, and reduction of pulmonary metastasis in a renal cell carcinoma model, respectively. γ-irradiation as a potential safety measure for clinical application prevented NK cell replication, while antitumor activity was preserved.

Malignant-appearing microcalcifications represent one of the earliest mammographic findings of non-palpable breast carcinomas. Many studies have attempted to correlate radiological and histological features of malignant-appearing microcalcifications. In the present study, we evaluated the association between mammographically detected malignant-appearing microcalcifications and the expression profile of selected biological markers in non-palpable breast carcinomas. Two hundred and eighty patients with non-palpable suspicious breast lesions that were detected during screening mammography were studied. All patients underwent mammographically-guided needle localization-excision breast biopsy. Histological examination showed 74 (26.4%) carcinomas of various subtypes. Immunohistochemistry was carried out in 58/74 carcinomas by using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2/neu, Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and DNA fragmentation factor (DFF). Malignant-appearing microcalcifications was the major mammographic finding in 45/58 (77%) patients. Nuclear ER positivity (65.5%) and PR positivity (46.5%) of non-palpable breast carcinomas were statistically correlated with malignant-appearing microcalcifications (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Statistically significant associations were also found between malignant-appearing microcalcifications and HER-2/neu positivity (p < 0.01), Bax positivity (p < 0.01), Fas positivity (p < 0.05) and DFF positivity (p < 0.01), whereas no statistical correlation was found with Bcl-2 positivity (p > 0.05). Malignant-appearing microcalcifications detected during screening mammography represent a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic challenge. The mammographic/biological associations and their potential implications in the management of women with non-palpable breast carcinomas are thoroughly discussed.",

We have investigated cell-mediated effector mechanisms of HER-2/neu antibodies against breast cancer cell lines. Compared to unfractionated control blood, whole blood from patients during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment exhibits significantly enhanced lysis (P < 0.001) of SK-BR-3 cells in the presence of HER-2/neu antibody 520C9. The extent of tumor cell killing correlated positively (r = 0.74) to polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) blood counts. Fractionation of whole blood into plasma, mononuclear cells, and PMNs showed major killing capacity to reside in the granulocyte fraction. PMNs were efficiently cytolytic with a panel of HER-2/neu antibodies and against various breast cancer cell lines. Experiments with blocking antibodies to Fc(gamma)R documented Fc(gamma)RII (CD32) as the major trigger molecule for monoclonal antibody 502C9-mediated cytotoxicity. Killing via 520C9 was significantly influenced by an allotypic polymorphism of Fc(gamma)RIIa, the CD32 molecule expressed on PMNs. In reverse antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity experiments with a panel of HER-2/neu-directed bispecific antibodies, Fc(gamma)RIII (CD16) proved to be an efficient trigger molecule in blood from healthy volunteers. During G-CSF treatment, however, Fc(gamma)RI (CD64)-expressed on monocytes and G-CSF primed, but not on healthy donor PMNs-became the predominant cytotoxic trigger molecule. Thus, G-CSF application increased effector cell numbers for HER-2/neu-directed immunotherapy, and G-CSF primed PMNs proved particularly effective with a [HER-2/neu x Fc(gamma)RI] bispecific antibody. These findings support clinical trials with HER-2/neu-directed antibodies in combination with G-CSF in breast cancer patients overexpressing HER-2/neu.",

These are characterized by a specific pattern of expression, being estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 negative, and frequently expressing at least one basal marker such as basal cytokeratins or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Previously, our group characterized basal-like tumours in a series of invasive breast carcinomas using P-cadherin (P-CD), p63 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5). Based on that study, we hypothesized that those high-grade basal-like invasive carcinomas might have a pre-invasive counterpart, which could be identified using the same approach. A series of 79 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) were classified into distinct subgroups according to their ER, HER2 and basal markers expression. Luminal DCIS expressed ER and constituted 64.6% of the series; the HER2 overexpressing tumours did not express ER and represented 25.3% of the cases, whereas 10.1% lack the expression of ER and HER2 and expressed at least one basal marker (P-CD, CK5, CK14, p63, vimentin and/or EGFR). These basal-like DCIS were mostly high-grade, with comedo-type necrosis, and consistently showed expression of P-CD and CK5. In conclusion, DCIS with a basal-like phenotype represent a small percentage in our series, being P-CD and CK5, the most useful adjunct markers to distinguish this subset of carcinomas in situ of the breast.",

There has been a sharp increase in the detection of breast carcinoma, although mortality is still unvaried. In the last ten years the incidence of breast cancer measuring less than 1 cm, corresponding to pT1a, pT1b in TNM stadiation, has greatly increased. The present study describes the biologic characterisation of small breast carcinomas. The Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Study stated that tumour size is a significant, independent factor for breast cancer prognosis. Cases were selected among formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 360 ductal breast cancers. In one-half of cases, the tumour was less than 1 cm in diameter, pT1a- pT1b; in the other half the tumour size was greater than 1 cm, but less than 2 cm, pT1c. Histological grading was assessed with the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson method, without Nottingham grade. Immunohistochemical determinations for ER, PgR, Ki-67, Her-2/Neu, CD34, p53, EGFR were done with an automated method. From the above analyses, it was demonstrated that the tumour size is indeed an important prognostic factor, particularly in cases without lymph node metastasis (N0). In particular, we observed significant differences between pT1a-b and pT1c cases, confirming that tumour size is an important criterion for prognostic valuation in ductal breast cancer without lymph node metastasis.",

One recommended approach is to assess immunohistochemical staining and then perform in situ hybridisation on those tumours with a borderline (2+) immunohistochemical result. This audit aimed to assess the value of the percentage of immunohistochemical staining in 2+ tumours in selecting tumours for in-situ hybridisation.;HER2 immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation was performed according to UK guidelines. The percentage of complete membrane staining of invasive carcinoma cells for HER2 was recorded as part of routine reporting.;191 (11%) of 1735 invasive carcinomas were scored as 3+. 419 (24%) were scored as 2+. 57 of 413 2+ carcinomas (14%) were amplified (ratio of HER2 to chromosome 17 ≥ 2.0). The frequency of amplification was related to the percentage of complete membrane staining: eight of 149 (5%) with 10-19% membrane staining, 11 of 93 (12%) with 20-29% staining, 26 of 150 (17%) with 30-79% staining and 12 of 21 (57%) with 80-100% staining.;This audit suggests that increasing the threshold for 2+ from 10% to 20% complete membrane staining would reduce the number of in-situ hybridisation tests by 36%, but reduce the detection of amplified tumours by 14%.",

This treatment recommendation is based on clinical trials that are mostly populated with women with high-grade serous carcinomas. Patients with mucinous or clear cell carcinomas of the ovary tend to present with earlier-stage disease, and may not require adjuvant chemotherapy; those with advanced-stage disease tend to have carboplatin-resistant disease. Patients with mucinous ovarian carcinoma have presentations and tumor biology that are similar to colorectal carcinomas and may benefit from colorectal regimens containing fluorouracil (FU) and oxaliplatin. Their tumors may also be KRAS wild-type or have HER2 amplification, and could benefit from drugs like cetuximab or trastuzumab. Patients with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary often harbor AIRD1a mutations, an early event in oncogenesis that is not a currently drugable target. Anecdotal cases and our biologic understanding of these malignancies suggest they might be preferentially sensitive to antiangiogenesis inhibitors. Focused international trials will be needed in both of these rare epithelial ovarian cancers to better define optimal treatment regimens. ",

Our studies were designed to evaluate the effect of ERBB inhibition on tumor cell motility and intravasation in vivo using clinically relevant small-molecule inhibitors.;Using in vivo mouse models of breast cancer, we test the effects of ERBB1 and ERBB2 inhibitors AC480 and lapatinib, ERBB1 inhibitor gefitinib, and ERBB2 inhibitor AG825 on in vivo tumor cell invasive properties in mammary fat pad tumors.;ERBB1 and ERBB2 inhibition rapidly (within 3 h) inhibits both tumor cell motility and intravasation. Using gefitinib, ERBB1 inhibition rapidly inhibits tumor cell motility and invasion but not intravasation, whereas ERBB2 inhibition by AG825 rapidly blocks intravasation.;ERBB1 and ERBB2 inhibition can rapidly block tumor cell invasive properties. In addition, we differentiate for the first time the contributions of ERBB1 and ERBB2 to the key metastatic properties of in vivo tumor cell invasion and intravasation. These experiments temporally and molecularly separate two key stages in tumor cell entry into blood vessels: invasion and intravasation.

Vaccine strategies directed against HER-2/neu and other self tumor antigens require development of methods to overcome immune tolerance to self-proteins. In rats, rat neu peptide vaccines have been shown to be an effective way of circumventing tolerance to rat neu protein and generating rat neu-specific immunity. The present report validates that a similar peptide-based vaccine formulation is effective for inducing T-cell immunity to HER-2/neu protein in humans with breast and ovarian cancer. The vaccine formulation included groups of peptides derived from the HER-2/neu extracellular domain (ECD) or intracellular domain (ICD) mixed with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor as an adjuvant. These peptides were 15-18 amino acids in length and designed to elicit a CD4 T helper-specific immune response. Patients underwent intradermal immunization once a month for a total of two to six immunizations. To date, all of the patients immunized with HER-2/neu peptides developed HER-2/neu peptide-specific T-cell responses. The majority of patients (six of eight) also developed HER-2/neu protein-specific responses. Responses to HER-2/neu protein occurred with epitope spreading. Immune T cells elicited by vaccination were shown to migrate outside the peripheral circulation by virtue of generating delayed type hypersensitivity responses distant from the vaccine site, which indicated the potential ability to traffic to the site of tumor. The use of peptide-based vaccines may be a simple, yet effective, vaccine strategy for immunizing humans to oncogenic self-proteins.",

In contrast to some well-documented genomic amplifications, molecular mechanisms leading to ERBB2 transcriptional overexpression remain poorly characterized. Gene expression analyses of breast cancer have characterized distinct transcriptional signatures allowing a molecular classification of breast carcinoma. Coexpression of the ERBB2 and GATA4 genes was originally observed in tumors. Both genes are essential for cardiovascular development and GATA4 has been proposed to control the transcription of critical genes for the differentiation and the function of myocardium. We determined that ERBB2-targeted small interfering RNA repressed both ERBB2 and GATA4 genes, whereas GATA4-targeted small interfering RNA repressed GATA4 and activated ERBB2 transcription. Transfected GATA4-expressing construct repressed ERBB2 promoter. Phylogenetic foot printing revealed multiple putative GATA4 binding sites conserved in mammals within the ERBB2 promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that GATA4 binds specifically to several ERBB2 gene noncoding regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed GATA4 binding to a well-conserved consensus motif. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of this new regulatory element for the activity of the ERBB2 gene enhancer. In agreement with a repressor role of GATA4 on ERBB2 gene expression balanced by ERBB2 activation of the GATA4 gene, a negative correlation between the relative levels of ERBB2 and GATA4 mRNA was observed in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples. We propose that the negative feedback loop linking ERBB2 and GATA4 plays a role in the transcriptional dysregulation of ERBB2 gene expression in breast cancer.",

HER-2/neu protein overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in several subsets of patients. The protein may also be related to cancer formation, with overexpression being detectable in 50-60% of ductal carcinomas in situ. It has been suggested that it might be possible to develop specific T-cell therapy directed against proteins involved in malignant transformation. One question is whether normal proteins that are overexpressed are appropriate targets for therapeutic immune attack. This report demonstrates that some patients with HER-2/neu-positive breast cancers have both existent CD4+ helper/inducer T-cell immunity and antibody-mediated immunity to HER-2/neu protein. Initial studies performed on 20 premenopausal breast cancer patients identified antibodies to HER-2/neu in 11 individuals. Similar antibody responses have been found in some normal individuals. The patient with the greatest antibody response was studied in detail. In addition to a humoral immune response this patient had evidence of a significant proliferative T-cell response to the HER-2/neu protein and peptides. Similar T-cell responses have been detected in additional patients. It has been assumed that patients would be immunologically tolerant to HER-2/neu as a self-protein and that immunity might be difficult to generate. If immunity could be generated, the result might be destructive autoimmunity.

The cytoplasmic presence of low molecular weight cytokeratin and the absence of high molecular weight cytokeratin in all cases confirmed the glandular origin of the Paget cells. Membrane over-expression of the neu-protein was established in 96% of cases. It was hypothesized that epidermal keratinocytes release a chemotactic factor which attracts neu-over-expressing breast carcinoma cells by chemotaxis into the epidermis. The biological assays showed that normal keratinocytes release one or more chemotactic factor(s) into their conditioned medium, which induced spreading and motility of neu-over-expressing SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells. The conditioned medium of keratinocytes also attracted the SK-BR-3 cells by chemotaxis in a modified Boyden chamber. Furthermore, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, which do not over-express the neu-protein, were not attracted by chemotaxis of conditioned medium of human keratinocytes. The involvement of the neu-protein in spreading, motility and chemotaxis is further indicated by the inhibition of these processes by monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of the neu-protein. We conclude, therefore, that the Paget cells spread through the epidermis due to the motility induced by a chemotactic factor, which is released by epidermal keratinocytes and whose influence is mediated by the neu-protein.",

Corresponding paraffin sections were examined by IHC and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Thereby, different IHC and FISH procedures were compared. Using microwave epitope retrieval, all 32 cases scored 3+ on IHC, whereas only 28 out of 32 cases scored IHC 3+ using water bath epitope retrieval. All of these 28 cases showed increased levels of HER-2/neu mRNA. Dual-colour FISH analysis showed corresponding gene amplification in all 28 cases, with two cases showing a peculiar amplification pattern. In the remaining four cases, scoring IHC 2+ using water bath epitope retrieval, mRNA levels were not elevated. Three cases did not have gene amplification and one case showed low-level HER-2/neu gene amplification. All four carcinomas showed chromosome 17 polysomy.;Real-time RT-PCR is accurate in selecting breast carcinoma cases scoring 3+ by IHC with high-level gene amplification. Results obtained by dual-colour FISH suggest that mechanisms leading to HER-2/neu receptor overexpression may be different between carcinomas scoring 2+ and 3+ on IHC, with polysomy 17 found in the former and gene amplification in the latter.",

The metastatic lesion decreased in size and finally appeared to be only cicatricial. Twenty-one months after the initial administration of trastuzumab, the pulmonary lesion was excised.

IGF-1R expression and clinicopathological correlations were analyzed with a tissue microarray containing 234 esophageal cancer specimens (133 adenocarcinomas and 101 squamous cell carcinomas). Proliferation changes associated with Herceptin and alpha-IR3 blockage were evaluated with the unique human esophageal cancer cell lines Pt1590 and LN1590. IGF-1R and HER2 expression levels, activation and phosphorylation status of downstream signaling proteins involved in the activation pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. IGF-1R overexpression was detected in 121 (52%) of the 234 esophageal tumors examined. In the subgroup of 87 HER2-positive tumors, 93.1% showed concordant overexpression for IGF-1R. IGF-1R was identified as a variable associated with reduced overall survival for adenocarcinoma (p = 0.05), but not for squamous cell carcinoma. The combination of Herceptin and alpha-IR3 was more effective in inhibiting in vitro proliferation than treatment with either agent alone (p < 0.01). This was associated with a decrease in HER2 and IGF-1R protein levels and suppression of Akt- and MAP kinase phosphorylation.

Molecular subtype classification was done based on immunohistochemical surrogates for ER, PR, and Her-2/neu status obtained from Howard University tumor registry for each patient. The molecular subtypes were defined as: luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-), and Her-2/neu (ER-, PR-, and HER2+).;We analyzed the prevalence of molecular breast cancer subtypes in a population of African-American women and determined their associations with patient demographics and clinicopathologic variables: node status, tumor size, histological grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival.;The luminal A subtype was the most prevalent in our study sample (55.4%) compared with (11.8%) luminal B, (21.2%) basal cell-like, and (11.6%) Her-2/neu subtypes. The molecular subtypes did not differ by menopausal status. However, when stratified into age-specific groups, the basal cell-like subtype (57.1%) was the most prevalent in the age group <35 y compared with luminal A, luminal B, and Her-2/neu subtypes at 25.0%, 14.3%, and 3.6%, respectively. The basal cell-like subtype also showed an age-specific bimodal distribution with a peak in the <35 y and 51 to 65 y age groups. The basal cell-like and the Her-2/neu subtypes showed an increased association with clinicopathologic variables portending a more aggressive clinical course when compared with luminal A subtype. A paradoxical inverse relationship between the expression of p53 and Bcl-2 protooncoprotein was noted in the molecular subtypes.

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous heregulin, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",

Here, we show that angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) expression correlates with HER2 activity in human breast cancer cell lines. Inhibiting HER2 activity with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) or HER2 short interfering RNA in tumor cells down-regulates Ang-2 expression. Consistent with the important roles of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase in the HER2 signaling pathway, AKT and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase activity is necessary for Ang-2 up-regulation by HER2. Moreover, overexpression of HER2 protein up-regulates Ang-2 expression. Heregulin-beta1-induced Ang-2 up-regulation is abrogated when AKT and ERK kinase activity are blocked. Immunohistochemical analysis of HER2 and Ang-2 proteins in human breast carcinomas shows that Ang-2 expression in breast cancer correlates with HER2 expression. These studies provide evidence that the Ang-2 gene is regulated by HER2 activity in breast cancer, and propose an additional mechanism for HER2 contributing to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.",

The status of the ERBB2 overexpression or gene amplification is an important predictive marker in gastric cancer. However, it is controversial whether the primary tumor is representative of distant metastases in terms of ERBB2 status. Quadruplicated tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 498 advanced primary gastric carcinomas and 97 matched metastatic lymph nodes were investigated by immunohistochemistry with HercepTest and silver in situ hybridization. For further comparison, another set of 41 paired primary and distant metastatic gastric carcinomas were also tested. Intratumoral heterogeneity was defined as different results between tissue microarray cores. ERBB2-positivity was observed in 52 gastric carcinomas (10%) and was not associated with recurrence of disease or survival of patients. In ERBB2-positive primary gastric carcinomas, heterogeneous ERBB2 overexpression was observed in 21/63 (33%) gastric carcinomas and heterogeneous ERBB2 gene amplification in 14/62 (23%) cases. Repeated immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization in representative paraffin tumor blocks confirmed focal ERBB2 overexpression and ERBB2 gene amplification and did not change the final results. Discrepancies in ERBB2 results between primary and paired metastatic lymph nodes were observed in 11% of cases by immunohistochemistry and 7% by silver in situ hybridization. Out of the 41 paired primary and distant metastases, 5 (12%) cases were ERBB2-positive, and discrepancy was observed in one case. Intratumoral heterogeneity and discrepant ERBB2 results in primary and metastatic tumor are not uncommon in gastric carcinoma. Results of silver in situ hybridization showed less frequent heterogeneity compared with immunohistochemistry. Wherever possible, ERBB2 immunohistochemistry testing should be performed in both primary and distant metastatic sites.",

Three of these four either showed borderline negative amplification in the core biopsy or were heterogeneous. None of the 55 grade 1 carcinomas were HER2-positive. Review of repeat testing of HER2 in routine practice suggested that it may also be of value for multifocal tumours and if recommended by the person assessing the in-situ hybridization.;Mandatory repeat HER2 testing of grade 3 HER2-negative carcinomas is not appropriate.

It has been suggested that overexpression and even amplification of ERBB2 may play a role in the development of prostate cancer. Here, we have analyzed gene copy number and expression of the ERBB2 gene in both androgen-dependent primary and metastatic tumors, as well as recurrent hormone-refractory tumors. The expression levels were compared to the expression of ERBB2 in breast cancers with or without ERBB2 gene amplification. Of 126 prostate tumors, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) revealed only 1 case containing borderline (six to eight copies) amplifications of ERBB2. This hormone-refractory tumor, however, did not express ERBB2 protein. Immunohistochemical staining of ERBB2 protein was negative (0 or 1+ intensity) in all prostate samples (n = 124) analyzed. To quantitate the level of ERBB2 mRNA expression in prostate tumors (n = 34) and cell lines (n = 3), as well as in breast tumors (n = 30) and cell lines (n = 16), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler) methodology was used. The expression level was similar in all prostate tumor types and corresponded to the level of expression in breast carcinomas without ERBB2 amplification. Breast tumors with ERBB2 amplification expressed, on average, approximately 20 times (P < 0.001) higher mRNA levels than prostate tumors or breast carcinomas without the gene amplification. In conclusion, the expression of ERBB2 in prostate cancer is relatively low, and is not altered during disease progression. Thus, it is unlikely that treatment modalities relying on the overexpression of ERBB2 gene will be useful in treating prostate cancer.",

We reasoned that the simultaneous modulation of multiple radioresponse regulators by selenium should increase radiosensitivity if selenium is combined with radiation in cancer therapy. Therefore, we explored the possibility of whether we could obtain an enhancement of radiosensitivity by the combination of selenium and ionizing radiation. We used two human lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H460 and H1299, as well as a human diploid lung fibroblast, WI-38, as the normal cell counterpart. The combined treatment of the cancer cell lines with Seleno-methionine and ionizing radiation resulted in increased cell killing as assessed by clonogenic survival assay whereas it had little effect on the normal diploid WI-38 cells. The increased radiosensitivity in the cancer cells was correlated with the attenuation of the key proteins involved in either cell survival signaling [Akt, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ErbB2 and Raf1] or DNA damage response (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, Ku80, 53BP1 and DNAPK). The attenuation of the proteins by the selenium compound was possibly caused by the effect on transcription and on protein stability since selenium treatment decreased both the RNA transcript and the protein stability of EGFR and DNAPK. By contrast, Seleno-L-methionine had no effect on the protein profile of a normal diploid fibroblast which is consistent with an intact radiosensitivity. These data provide possible clinical applications, as selenium selectively enhanced the radiosensitivity of the tumor cells whereas that of the normal cells was unaffected. Moreover, the selective decrease of cell proliferation signaling in tumor cells but not in normal cells should facilitate the repopulation of normal cells required for healing during radiation therapy. On the whole, the results suggest that the cancer preventive activity of selenium can be combined with ionizing radiation to improve the control of lung cancer.",

We have recently discovered compound with anticancer activity, Curaxin-137, which modulates several important signaling pathways involved in even the very early stages of cancer. In tumor cells, Curaxin-137 inhibits NF-κB- and HSF1-dependent transcription (prosurvival pathways) and activates p53 (a proapoptotic pathway) without inducing DNA damage. These effects result from chromatin trapping and inhibition of activity of the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex by Curaxin-137. FACT has not been previously implicated in cancer, but we found that its subunits are overexpressed in breast cancer. On the basis of this background, we tested whether Curaxin-137 could suppress tumorigenesis in MMTV-neu transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop mammary carcinoma due to steroid receptor-regulated expression of the Her2 proto-oncogene. We found that chronic administration of Curaxin-137 in a preventive regimen to MMTV-neu mice did not cause any detectable changes in normal organs and tissues, yet inhibited tumor onset, delayed tumor progression, and prolonged survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner. Curaxin-137 induced changes in FACT, altered NF-κB localization, and activated p53 in tumor cells as expected from its defined mechanism of action. These results support further investigation of Curaxin-137 as a potential preventive and/or early-stage therapeutic agent for breast cancer.",

The results were assessed according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) 2007 and 2013 guidelines for dual- and single-signal in situ hybridization (ISH) assays. A subgroup of 112 cases was subjected to MLPA.;HER2 amplification varied from 15% (ASCO/CAP 2007 HER2/CEP17 ratio) to 29.5% (FDA/EMA HER2 copy number). According to the ASCO/CAP 2013 interpretation of the dual-signal HER2 assay, ISH-positive carcinomas accounted for 19.7%. In contrast with the ASCO/CAP 2007 ratio, this approach labeled as positive all 32 cases (3.34%) with a HER2/CEP17 ratio <2 and an average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals per cell. In contrast, only one case showing a HER2 copy number <4 but a ratio ≥2 was diagnosed as positive. MLPA data correlated poorly with FISH results because of the presence of heterogeneous HER2 amplification in 33.9% of all amplified carcinomas; however, MLPA ruled out HER2 amplification in 75% of ISH-evaluated HER2-equivocal carcinomas.;The ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines seem to improve the identification of HER2-positive carcinomas.

Here, we examined the status of known driver mutations specifically in female never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma.;Tumors were genotyped for mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, HER2, and BRAF. Data on age, stage, tumor differentiation, histologic subtypes, and molecular alterations were recorded from 349 resected lung adenocarcinomas from female never-smokers. We further compared the clinicopathologic parameters according to mutational status of these genes.;Two hundred and sixty-six (76.2%) tumors harbored EGFR mutations, 16 (4.6%) HER2 mutations, 15 (4.3%) EML4-ALK fusions, seven (2.0%) KRAS mutations, and two (0.6%) BRAF mutations. In univariate analysis, patients harboring EGFR mutations were significantly older (P < 0.001), whereas patients harboring HER2 mutations were significantly younger (P = 0.036). Higher prevalence of KRAS (P = 0.028) and HER2 (P = 0.021) mutations was found in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA). The frequency of EGFR mutations was positively correlated with acinar predominant tumors (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that older age at diagnosis (P = 0.013) and acinar predominant subtype (P = 0.005) were independent predictors of EGFR mutations. Independent predictors of HER2 mutations included younger age (P = 0.030) and IMA (P = 0.017). IMA (P = 0.006) and poor differentiation (P = 0.028) were independently associated with KRAS mutations.;The frequency of driver mutations in never-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma varies with histologic subtypes and age at diagnosis.

Controversy exists as to the best method for its determination caused primarily by the variable sensitivities of the different antibodies and interobserver differences, particularly in the group of breast cancers with borderline levels of expression of the protein product. This study was therefore designed to determine the status of the HER2 gene amplification in a group of breast carcinomas with low levels of overexpression. After an initial validation of our procedures, a series of 52 consecutive cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers with low levels of overexpression and a series of 22 cases with no expression by immunohistochemistry were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the results correlated statistically. Amplification of the HER2 gene was observed in 16% of equivocal to weakly positive cases. Those that were amplified showed low levels of amplification with ratios less than 4.5 and a characteristic scattered pattern of distribution of HER2 signals in the FISH assay. In addition, heterogeneity was noted in two cases in the amplification of the HER2 gene within the same tumor samples with pockets of amplified tumor cells amidst nonamplified tumor cells. In cases without amplification, a statistically significant number showed chromosome 17 polysomy. In conclusion, equivocal to low levels of HER2 overexpression in breast cancers are associated, in the majority of cases, with chromosome 17 polysomy and a corresponding increase in the HER2 gene numbers. True gene amplification is present in only a minority of cases. FISH analysis should be used for confirmation of gene amplification. Prior screening and selection of appropriate immunohistochemistry-positive areas for FISH analysis may prove beneficial.",

We have previously found that EGFR stability plays a key role in cell survival after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is known to stabilize mutant EGFR and ErbB2, but its role in cancers with wild-type (WT) WT-EGFR is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that fully mature, membrane-bound WT-EGFR interacts with HSP90 independent of ErbB2. Further, the HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin (GA) and AT13387 cause a decrease in WT-EGFR in cultured head and neck cancer cells. This decrease results from a significantly reduced half-life of WT-EGFR. WT-EGFR was also lost in head and neck xenograft specimens after treatment with AT13387 under conditions that inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice. Our findings demonstrate that WT-EGFR is a client protein of HSP90 and that their interaction is critical for maintaining both the stability of the receptor as well as the growth of EGFR-dependent cancers. Furthermore, these findings support the search for specific agents that disrupt HSP90's ability to act as an EGFR chaperone.",

IL-15 is trans-presented to effector cells by its receptor, IL-15Ralpha, expressed on dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes. We examined the antitumor effect of adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha to augment a DC vaccine directed against the NEU (ErbB2) oncoprotein. Transgenic BALB-neuT mice vaccinated in late-stage tumor development with a DC vaccine expressing a truncated NEU antigen, IL-I5, and its receptor (DC(Ad.Neu+Ad_mIL-15+Ad.mlL-15Ralpha)) were protected from mammary carcinomas, with 70% of animals tumor-free at 30 weeks compared with none of the animals vaccinated with NEU alone (DC(Ad.Neu)). The combination of neu, IL-15, and IL-15Ralpha gene transfer leads to a significaintly greater anti-NEU antibody response compared with mice treated with DC(Ad.Neu) or DC(Ad.Neu) combined with either IL-15 (DC(Ad.Neu+Ad.mlL-15)) or lL-15Ralpha (DC(Ad.Neu+Ad.mlL-15Ralpha)). The antitumor effect was antibody mediated and involved modulation of NEU expression and signaIing. Depletion of CD4(+) cells did not abrogate the antitumor effect of the vaccine, nor did it inhibit the induction of anti-NEU aritibodies.

Oncogenic regulation of let-7 miRNAs has been demonstrated in several human malignancies but their correlation with LIN28 has not been studied in breast cancer. We therefore explored a possible mechanism of tumorigenesis in breast carcinoma tissue via an alternation of let-7 miRNA precursor processing by LIN28 in this study. A total of 26 breast cancer surgical pathology specimens were evaluated for LIN28 and LIN28B expression using immunohistochemistry. We then isolated carcinoma cells in 21 cases using laser capture microdissection, and the miRNAs from these samples were profiled using PCR array analysis. LIN28 status was positively correlated with ERα, PR, and Ki-67 status and inversely correlated with HER2 status. These results suggest the possible involvement of LIN28 in regulation of sex steroid dependent cell proliferation of breast carcinoma cells. We further demonstrated that expression of let-7a, let-7c, let-7d (P=0.026) and let-7f (P=0.016) were inversely correlated with those of LIN28.

To understand the potential role of neu in human prostatic cancer progression, we used a transfer procedure to determine whether neu amplification/overexpression leads to increased tumor growth and metastasis. We chose an androgen-independent human prostatic epithelial cell line, PC-3, as the target for gene transfer. PC-3 cells were cotransfected with pSVneu-T (a point-mutated rat neu oncogene construct) and pSV2neo, and single-cell cloned. Fifty cell clones were isolated and characterized, of which two neu-transfected clones (N17 and N35) and a neo control clone (C32) were studied extensively with respect to neu gene integration, levels of neu mRNA and protein expression, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Results showed that: 1) Clone N35 contained 70 copies of the neu oncogene and a high level of neu mRNA transcripts. It acquired increased anchorage-independent growth potential in vitro and increased tumorigenicity in vivo. 2) Clone N17 contained 10 copies of the neu oncogene and a low level of neu mRNA transcripts. It did not acquire additional capability for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenic potential as compared to the controls. 3) Despite an increased level of neu mRNA transcripts present in clone N35, there was no corresponding increase of the steady-state levels of neu protein in this particular clone. 4) When administered subcutaneously, none of the cell clones tested, including the control neomycin-resistant clone, acquired metastatic potential. However, clone N35 exhibited marked metastatic potential when administered orthotopically; this cell clone was found to disseminate widely to the lymph nodes, kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, liver, and bone. 5) When neu-transfected cell subclones from N35-induced primary and metastatic lymph node, kidney, and bone tumors were analyzed for cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion protein expression, the bone metastatic subclone exhibited increased levels of vimentin and collagen IV and decreased levels of cytokeratin and ICAM-1.

We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between FAS and the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because Her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that FAS gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a Her-2/neu-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of FAS gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, FAS- and Her-2/neu-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a FAS promoter-reporter construct (FAS-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (VP-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of FAS promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of TOP2A inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of FAS gene expression were not significantly decreased when the FAS promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding site. Considering that FAS inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between TOP2A and FAS could exhibit a Her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. TOP2A protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, FAS promoter activity and FAS protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of TOP2A protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding FAS inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in TOP2A expression was observed. Although FAS gene is not physically located in the Her-2/neu-TOP2A amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.",

Twenty-one patients (34 %) had EGFR T790M mutation. Using our tumor genotyping panel, MET gene copy number gain was observed in two of 27 (7 %) samples. Twenty patients received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs even after disease progression, and 11 of these patients had T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples.

Neu receptor protein showed increased expression in malignant astrocytomas (including glioblastomas) and severe reactive gliosis.;Upregulation of tyrosyl protein phosphorylation enables differentiation of neoplastic from nonneoplastic astrocytic proliferative states. Inhibition of this phosphorylation impairs growth of cells. Increased Neu receptor protein expression can distinguish malignant from low grade astrocytomas.

To investigate such applications, we constructed a recombinant adenoviral vaccine expressing a kinase-inactive mutant form of human HER2 and introduced this into BALB/c wild-type (WT) or HER2 transgenic mice. Here, we report contributions by antibody responses and natural killer (NK) cells in tumor protection in this model. One i.p. vaccination protected WT mice from the HER2-expressing mouse carcinoma D2F2/E2. Half of the HER2 transgenic mice were protected fully and long term after preventive vaccination. Tumor growth in mice that eventually developed neoplastic lesions was delayed. Protection in WT and HER2 transgenic mice was associated with high or low levels of IgG2a antibodies, respectively, whereas CTLs were observed in WT but not in HER2 transgenic mice. Depleting CD4(+) or CD8(+) cells in vaccinated WT mice had limited effects, suggesting that protection was largely independent of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, antibody-mediated tumor rejection seemed to contribute significantly based on a loss of protection in mice deficient for Fc-γ RI/III or B cells. Further, a role for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by NK cells was indicated by evidence that vaccine protection could be abolished by in vivo depletion of NK cells. Lastly, NK cells and immune sera purified from WT or HER2 transgenic mice exhibited efficient ADCC of HER2-expressing tumor cells in vitro.

Overexpression of the HER-2/neu proto-oncogene occurs in 20-30% of ovarian epithelial cancers, in which it may be of prognostic significance. Oncogene overexpression is traditionally studied using immunohistochemistry. In this study we used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine HER-2/neu amplification in ovarian papillary serous carcinoma and compared the frequency of amplification in two stages of the disease. Archival tissues from 23 cases of papillary serous ovarian carcinoma (9 cases of stage I and 14 cases of stage III) were analyzed by FISH using a HER-2/neu probe and a chromosome 17 centromere control probe. Determination of the level of amplification was performed according to the standard protocols of the Cytogenetics Laboratory at Rhode Island Hospital. Of the 23 cases successfully analyzed, the frequency of amplification among stage I tumors was 22% (2/9) and the frequency of amplification among stage III tumors was 71% (10/14). These results are significant (P = 0.036). The frequency of stage I tumors among amplified cases was 17% (27/12) and the frequency of stage III tumors among amplified cases was 83% (10/12). This study not only confirms the presence of a subset of ovarian papillary serous carcinoma with HER-2/neu gene amplification, but it also indicates that HER-2/neu oncogene amplification is more likely to be associated with a more advanced stage. Thus, the present data are consistent with the hypothesis that HER-2/neu amplification, similar to HER-2/neu protein over expression, is a prognostic marker of poor outcome.",

We investigated the incidence of Akt activation in invasive ductal carcinoma and its correlation with other clinicopathological variables. Using tissue microarray technology, immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) at Ser-473 was evaluated in 127 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas, together with hormone receptors, HER2, p53, Ki-67 and other clinicopathological variables. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression was noted for pAkt, with 46 cases (36.2%) showing high cytoplasmic pAkt expression and 37 cases (29.1%) showing high nuclear pAkt expression. There was a significant association between both high cytoplasmic and nuclear pAkt expression with HER2 overexpression (both p<0.0001). There was also a positive correlation between high nuclear pAkt expression with both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status (p=0.042 and p=0.015, respectively). High cytoplasmic pAkt expression was associated with high Ki-67 expression (p=0.052), however, there was no association between pAkt and p53 expression. In the present study, activation of the Akt pathway shows strong association with HER2 overexpression, which is consistent with many in vitro studies. Our study also showed a positive correlation between pAkt and hormone receptors, which suggested the possible mechanism of endocrine resistance in ER-positive breast cancer.

To test the contribution of N-cadherin and HER2 in mammary tumor metastasis, we targeted N-cadherin expression in the mammary epithelium of the MMTV-Neu mouse. In the context of ErbB2/Neu, N-cadherin stimulated carcinoma cell invasion, proliferation and metastasis. N-cadherin caused fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) upmodulation, resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem/progenitor like properties, involving Snail and Slug upregulation, mammosphere formation and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. N-cadherin potentiation of the FGFR stimulated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation resulting in differential effects on metastasis. Although ERK inhibition suppressed cyclin D1 expression, cell proliferation and stem/progenitor cell properties, it did not affect invasion or EMT. Conversely, AKT inhibition suppressed invasion through Akt 2 attenuation, and EMT through Snail inhibition, but had no effect on cyclin D1 expression, cell proliferation or mammosphere formation. These findings suggest N-cadherin/FGFR has a pivotal role in promoting metastasis through differential regulation of ERK and AKT, and underscore the potential for targeting the FGFR in advanced ErbB2-amplified breast tumors.

The OR of Val/Val genotype then revealed a significantly enhanced risk of 3.25 (95% CI 1.09-9.70) compared to Ile/Ile genotype; heterozygous Ile/Val genotype showed an intermediate risk of 1.97 (1.27-3.06). In patients, carcinomas of advanced stage were significantly more frequent in patients with Ile/Val or Val/Val genotype than those with Ile/Ile genotype (p < 0.001). The logistic regression analysis for tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis revealed that lymph node metastasis was most closely associated with the HER-2 genotype. These results suggest that this nucleotide polymorphism in the transmembrane domain-coding region of HER-2 could be associated with development of gastric carcinoma and may serve as a predictor of risk for a malignant phenotype of gastric cancer. The association of HER-2 genotype with clinicopathologic characteristics of gastric cancer was also suggested, which has to be confirmed with a larger sample size.",

However, the utility of these drugs has been limited by their hepatotoxicity, poor solubility, and poorly tolerated formulations.;We determined the pharmacodynamic and antitumor properties of a novel, synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor, SNX-2112, in cell culture and xenograft models of HER kinase-dependent cancers.;We show in a panel of tumor cell lines that SNX-2112 and its prodrug SNX-5542 are Hsp90 inhibitors with properties and potency similar to that of 17-AAG, including: degradation of HER2, mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, and other client proteins, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt activation, and induction of a Rb-dependent G(1) arrest with subsequent apoptosis. SNX-5542 can be administered to mice orally on a daily schedule. Following oral administration, SNX-5542 is rapidly converted to SNX-2112, which accumulates in tumors relative to normal tissues. A single dose of SNX-5542 causes HER2 degradation and inhibits its downstream signaling for up to 24 h, and daily dosing results in regression of HER2-dependent xenografts. SNX-5542 also shows greater activity than 17-AAG in a non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model expressing mutant EGFR.;These results suggest that Hsp90 inhibition with SNX-2112 (delivered as a prodrug) may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors whose growth and survival is dependent on Hsp90 clients.",

Mounting evidence suggests the importance of CITED in the progression of human malignancies, but the significance of CITED2 protein has not yet been examined in breast carcinoma. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the clinical significance and the biological functions of CITED2 in breast carcinoma by immunohistochemistry and in vitro study. CITED2 immunoreactivity was detected in breast carcinoma tissues, and it was significantly higher compared to those in morphologically normal mammary glands. CITED2 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with stage, pathological T factor, lymph node metastasis, histological grade, HER2 and Ki-67, and inversely correlated with estrogen receptor. Moreover, the immunohistochemical CITED2 status was significantly associated with increased incidence of recurrence and breast cancer-specific death of the breast cancer patients, and multivariate analyses demonstrated CITED2 status as an independent worse prognostic factor for disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that CITED2 expression significantly increased proliferation activity and migration property in MCF-7and S KBR-3 breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, CITED2 caused chemoresistance to epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil, but not paclitaxel, in these cells, and it inhibited p53 accumulation after 5-fluorouracil treatment in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that CITED2 plays important roles in the progression and chemoresistance of breast carcinoma and that CITED2 status is a potent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients.",

CCR4, an important chemokine receptor for regulating immune homeostasis, is thought to be involved in hematologic malignancies and has also recently implicated in some solid tumors, such as gastric cancer. The possible role of CCR4 in breast cancer has not been well elucidated. In this study, we show that CCR4 is differentially expressed in human breast cancer cell lines. Specifically, we find that CCR4 is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential. More importantly, we used a combination of overexpression and RNA interference to demonstrate that CCR4 promotes breast tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice. Furthermore, we find that microvessel density is significantly increased in tumors formed by CCR4-overexpressing cells and decreased in those formed by CCR4-knockdown cells. We find that overexpression of CCR4 can enhance the chemotactic response of breast cancer cells to CCL17. However, the expression of CCR4 does not affect the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we show that CCR4 expression is positively correlated with HER2 expression, tumor recurrence and lymph node, lung and bone metastasis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that CCR4 expression is a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.036) but not for disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer (P = 0.071).

Its prognostic value in node-negative cases and its predictive value for response to chemotherapy remain controversial. This may be related to the use of molecular methods, which are sensitive to dilution of tumor material by normal cells, or the use of nonstandardized immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures, for the determination of the ERBB2 gene status. In addition, new therapeutic approaches that target the cells overexpressing ERBB2 are under development. These perspectives necessitate a reliable evaluation of the status of ERBB2 in individual tumors before the application of specific therapeutic strategies. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and IHC allow the evaluation of the ERBB2 status specifically in tumor cells on archival material. We have analyzed a series of 100 invasive ductal breast carcinomas without lymph node invasion both by IHC, using the CB11 monoclonal antibody and a sensitive Auidin Biotin Complex (ABC) immunodetection system, and by FISH, using the Oncor Inform HER-21neu (ERBB2) gene amplification detection system as reference technique. Complete concordance between the results of FISH and IHC was seen in 98% of the cases. ERBB2 amplification (more than four signals per nucleus) was observed in 12 of the 100 cases, and all but one showed an overexpression of the protein (membrane staining) by IHC. Conversely, ERBB2 expression was present in one case without gene amplification. In conclusion, ERBB2 overexpression detected by IHC is highly correlated to gene amplification detected by FISH. Thus, under standardized conditions, IHC is a reliable and economical test to assess the ERBB2 status in tumors. The use of FISH could be limited to the verification of the status of tumors displaying a weak membrane immunostaining.",

The results were correlated with patient and tumor characteristics.;In situ HER-2/neu DNA probe hybridization was performed on 61 cytology specimens and on 47 corresponding frozen sections of breast carcinomas. Tumors were classified by visual evaluation as unamplified, moderately amplified, or highly amplified. Multiparametric image analysis was performed using the Discovery automated image analyzer (Becton Dickinson, Leiden, Netherlands). The integrated fluorescence ratio (IFR) was calculated for each sample as the integrated FISH fluorescence of the tumor cells divided by the integrated FISH fluorescence of internal control cells containing two spots. The percentage positive nuclear area (PPN), calculated as the area of FISH fluorescence divided by the area of nuclear DNA fluorescence, and the PPR, ratio of the PPN of the tumor cells divided by the control cells, were also calculated for each sample.;Visual analysis yielded 46 unamplified and 15 (24.6%) amplified (seven moderately amplified and eight highly-amplified) tumors.

Basal-like breast carcinoma (BBC) is a molecular subtype that constitutes 15-20% of breast cancers, shares histological similarities and basal cell markers with ACC, lacks expression of ER (oestrogen receptor), PR (progesterone receptor), and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and, similar to ACC, metastasises predominantly to the lung and brain. Both cancers lack targeted therapies owing to poor understanding of their molecular drivers.;Gene expression profiling, immunohistochemical staining, western blot, RT-PCR, and in silico analysis of massive cancer data sets were used to identify novel markers and potential therapeutic targets for ACC and BBC. For the detection and comparison of gene signatures, we performed co-expression analysis using a recently developed web-based multi-experiment matrix tool for visualisation and rank aggregation.;In ACC and BBC we identified characteristic and overlapping SOX10 gene signatures that contained a large set of novel potential molecular markers. SOX10 was validated as a sensitive diagnostic marker for both cancers and its expression was linked to normal and malignant myoepithelial/basal cells. In ACC, BBC, and melanoma (MEL), SOX10 expression strongly co-segregated with the expression of ROPN1B, GPM6B, COL9A3, and MIA. In ACC and breast cancers, SOX10 expression negatively correlated with FOXA1, a cell identity marker and major regulator of the luminal breast subtype. Diagnostic significance of several conserved elements of the SOX10 signature (MIA, TRIM2, ROPN1, and ROPN1B) was validated on BBC cell lines.;SOX10 expression in ACC and BBC appears to be a part of a highly coordinated transcriptional programme characteristic for cancers with basal/myoepithelial features. Comparison between ACC/BBC and other cancers, such as neuroblastomaand MEL, reveals potential molecular markers specific for these cancers that are likely linked to their cell identity. SOX10 as a novel diagnostic marker for ACC and BBC provides important molecular insight into their molecular aetiology and cell origin. Given that SOX10 was recently described as a principal driver of MEL, identification of conserved elements of the SOX10 signatures may help in better understanding of SOX10-related signalling and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools.",

Interactions and effects of ErbB3 were studied in detail in adenocarcinoma lines H441 and H1373.

An ErbB3-specific antisense oligonucleotide reduced amounts of ErbB3 protein and p85 complex in both cell lines, and significantly suppressed cell proliferation.

Here we propose a simple cell by cell correction for autofluorescence that is suitable for multiparameter laser scanning cytometry (LSC) studies in human solid tumors that relies on the ratio of mean autofluorescence to mean total cell fluorescence (mean Flauto/mean Fltotal). This approach assumes a correlation between the autofluorescence component and the total signal in individual cells. This correction does not require specialized instrumentation, and does not sacrifice a data channel in multiparameter studies. A potential disadvantage is that errors may be introduced by the assumption of a correlation between the two components of the total fluorescence signal in individual cells in samples in which no such correlation exists.;Distributions of cell autofluorescence and total Her-2/neu cell fluorescence were obtained separately by LSC in three human breast cancer cell lines and in three samples of primary human lung cancer. In the breast cancer cell lines, autofluorescence measurements and Her-2/neu measurements were also obtained on the same cells.;We show that there is a partial correlation between autofluorescence and total Her-2/neu/FITC fluorescence in individual cells in the three breast cancer cell lines. We also show that the results of a ratio-based autofluorescence correction agree with those based on a true cell by cell correction. Computer simulation studies suggest that in samples with no correlation between the autofluorescence component and the true probe/dye fluorescence component, the ratio correction produces robust estimates of the mean true fluorescence signal, with relatively small but systematic underestimates of the coefficient of variation of such measurements under conditions commonly encountered in the measurement of human solid tumors.;A simple cell by cell correction for autofluorescence based on the ratio of mean Flauto to mean Fltotal can be applied in cell samples in which there is a correlation between cell autofluorescence and true probe/dye fluorescence in individual cells. In cell samples that lack this correlation, or in which it is not known whether such a correlation exists, this correction can be used with the reservation that there is a systematic but relatively small underestimation of the degree of variability of the measurements.",

Two new cell lines were established from a mammary tumor that arose in a female MMTV/neu transgenic mouse. One of these lines, mammary carcinoma from Neu transgenic mouse A (MCNeuA), has an epithelial morphology, is cytokeratin positive, and expresses high levels of the neu transgene. Karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization analyses demonstrated genomic alterations in the MCNeuA cell line. The other line, N202Fb3, has a fibroblast morphology, is cytokeratin negative, and expresses the neu transgene at a very low level. This cell line also expresses smooth muscle alpha-actin, suggesting that it is a myofibroblast line. The MCNeuA cell line is tumorigenic when injected into syngeneic MMTV/neu transgenic mice, with an in vivo doubling time of about 14 d. The rationale for establishing this tumor cell line was to provide a tumor transplantation system for rapidly assessing immunotherapeutic interventions before testing in the more cumbersome model of spontaneous tumor development in the MMTV/neu transgenic mice. Mice immunized with a Neu extracellular domain protein vaccine were protected against a subsequent inoculation of MCNeuA cells, indicating that this cell line will be useful for evaluating cancer vaccine strategies. This tumor cell line may also prove useful in studying the biological properties of the neu oncogene and its role in the malignant process. In addition, the tumor-derived fibroblast line may be useful for studying tumor-stromal cell interactions.",

We constructed rat HER-2 DNA and protein vaccines containing potent Th cell epitopes derived from tetanus toxin and studied their potency in two strains of mice transgenic for the rat HER-2 molecule. Vaccination with HER-2 DNA protected nontransgenic mice from tumor challenge, but induced only moderate protection in one of the tumor models. However, vaccination with the modified HER-2 protein resulted in almost complete protection from tumor challenge in both tumor models. This protection could be mediated by Abs alone. In addition, protein vaccination efficiently eliminated pre-established tumors in both models, even when vaccination occurred 9 days after tumor implantation.

For lung cancer, MET gene amplification is reported to occur in a subset of adenocarcinomas. Although somatic mutations of MET in lung adenocarcinomas are rare, all but one of those reported so far entail a splice mutation deleting the juxtamembrane domain for binding the c-Cbl E3-ligase; normally such binding leads to ubiquitination and receptor degradation, and loss of this domain leads to MET activation. The purpose of this study was to clarify in the role of MET activation in lung carcinogenesis.;MET gene copy number was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 187 of the patients with lung cancer and the MET gene splice mutation deleting the juxtamembrane domain was examined by direct sequencing in 262. The results were correlated with various clinical and pathologic features including mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor, KRAS, and HER2 genes.;All the instances of MET activation occurred in patients with adenocarcinomas. The prevalences of MET gene amplification and splice mutations were 1.4% (2 of 148) and 3.3% (7 of 211), respectively. We identified four different intronic mutations that disrupted a splice consensus sequence in genomic DNA. Activation of MET and mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor, KRAS, and HER2 genes had strict mutual exclusionary relationships.;About 5% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas in this cohort of Japanese patients were driven by activated MET by gene amplification or splice mutations. Such patients would be candidates for targeted therapy against MET.",

We here investigated the anti-HER2 effects of phenolic fractions directly extracted from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) in cultured human breast cancer cell lines.;Solid phase extraction followed by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to isolate phenolic fractions from commercial EVOO. Analytical capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry was performed to check for the composition and to confirm the identity of the isolated fractions. EVOO polyphenolic fractions were tested on their tumoricidal ability against HER2-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer in vitro models using MTT, crystal violet staining, and Cell Death ELISA assays. The effects of EVOO polyphenolic fractions on the expression and activation status of HER2 oncoprotein were evaluated using HER2-specific ELISAs and immunoblotting procedures, respectively.;Among the fractions mainly containing the single phenols hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, the polyphenol acid elenolic acid, the lignans (+)-pinoresinol and 1-(+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and the secoiridoids deacetoxy oleuropein aglycone, ligstroside aglycone, and oleuropein aglycone, all the major EVOO polyphenols (i.e. secoiridoids and lignans) were found to induce strong tumoricidal effects within a micromolar range by selectively triggering high levels of apoptotic cell death in HER2-overexpressors. Small interfering RNA-induced depletion of HER2 protein and lapatinib-induced blockade of HER2 tyrosine kinase activity both significantly prevented EVOO polyphenols-induced cytotoxicity. EVOO polyphenols drastically depleted HER2 protein and reduced HER2 tyrosine autophosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. EVOO polyphenols-induced HER2 downregulation occurred regardless the molecular mechanism contributing to HER2 overexpression (i.e. naturally by gene amplification and ectopically driven by a viral promoter). Pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented EVOO polyphenols-induced HER2 depletion.;The ability of EVOO-derived polyphenols to inhibit HER2 activity by promoting the proteasomal degradation of the HER2 protein itself, together with the fact that humans have safely been ingesting secoiridoids and lignans as long as they have been consuming olives and OO, support the notion that the stereochemistry of these phytochemicals might provide an excellent and safe platform for the design of new HER2-targeting agents.",

Present studies demonstrate that exposure to a novel hydroxamic acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitor, LAQ824, induced p21WAF1 and p27KIP1 and caused growth arrest and apoptosis of human breast cancer SKBR-3 and BT-474 cells that possess amplification and overexpression of Her-2/neu. Treatment with LAQ824 depleted the mRNA and protein levels of Her-2/neu-encoded Her-2, which was associated with attenuation of pAKT, c-Raf-1, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase levels. LAQ824 also induced the acetylation of heat shock protein (hsp) 90, resulting in inhibition of its binding to ATP, which has been shown to impair the chaperone association of hsp 90 with its client proteins, Her-2, AKT, and c-Raf-1. Consistent with this, treatment with LAQ824 shifted the binding of Her-2 from hsp 90 to hsp 70, promoting proteasomal degradation of Her-2. Thus, LAQ824 depletes Her-2 through two mechanisms: attenuation of its mRNA levels and promotion of its degradation by the proteasome. Following LAQ824 treatment, the cell membrane association, autotyrosine phosphorylation, and colocalization of Her-2 with HER-3 also declined. Cotreatment with LAQ824 significantly increased trastuzumab-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. This was associated with greater attenuation of Her-2, c-Raf-1, and pAKT levels. LAQ824 also enhanced taxotere-induced, epothilone B-induced, and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. These findings suggest that LAQ824 is active against human breast cancer cells and has the potential to improve the efficacy of trastuzumab, taxotere, gemcitabine, and epothilone B against breast cancer with Her-2/neuamplification.",

In this study, the binding capability of LDP to human breast cancer tissues was detected with tissue microarray. The correlation study of LDP binding capability to human breast tumor tissues and relevant therapeutic targets was performed on breast cancer tissue microarrays. Immunocytochemical examination was used to detect the binding capability of LDP to human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. As a result, tissue microarray showed that LDP staining of 73.2% (30/41) of breast cancer tissues was positive, whereas that of 48.3% (15/31) of the adjacent normal breast specimens was positive. The difference between the tumor and normal samples was significant (Chi2 = 4.63, P < 0.05). LDP immunoreactivity in breast cancer correlated significantly with the overexpression of VEGF and HER2 (P < 0.001 and < 0.01, r = 0.389 and 0.287, respectively). Determined with confocal immunofluorescent analysis, LDP showed the binding capability to mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. It is demonstrated that LDP can bind to human breast cancer tissues and there is significant difference between the breast cancer tissues and the corresponding normal tissues. Notably, the binding reactivity shows positive correlation with the expression of VEGF and HER2 in breast carcinoma tissues. The results imply that LDP may have a potential use as targeting drug carrier in the research and development of new anticancer therapeutics.

Strikingly, the mice invariably developed multifocal lung adenocarcinomas of varying sizes at between 5 and 6 weeks of age, and they died from tumor progression approximately 2 months later if left untreated. Daily oral administration of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (5 mg/kg/day) reduced the total and phosphorylation levels of EGFR to those in wild-type mouse lung tissue; in addition, it abrogated tumor growth within 1 week and prolonged survival to >30 weeks. Interestingly, phosphorylated ErbB2, ErbB3, and thyroid transcriptional factor-1 increased in the transgenic mice compared with those in wild-type mice.

Second, the CellSearch system identified 15% of patients (n = 48) as CTC positive whereas a multiplex RT-PCR for PIK3CA, AKT2, TWIST, and ALDH1 following EGFR, HER2 and EpCAM based enrichment detected CTCs in 29% of the patients. Interestingly, 86% of CTC positive patients were found to express ALDH1. Only 11% of the patients were CTC-positive by both techniques. CTC positivity was associated with patient disease state when assessed by the multiplex RT-PCR assay (p = 0.015). Patients harbouring tumours with an altered EGFR genotype were more frequently CTC-positive compared to patients with EGFR wildtype tumours. In subsets of patients, CTCs were found to express genes involved in resistance to therapy such as HER3 and MET. In conclusion, using multiple targets for CTC capture and identification increases the sensitivity of CTC detection in NSCLC patients, which can be explained by the presence of different CTC subtypes with distinct molecular features.

The primary lesion and metastatic lesion were confirmed to have partially regressed. After 4 courses of chemotherapy, an open total gastrectomy, D2 dissection, pancreatosplenectomy, and posterior segmental hepatectomy were performed. Her postoperative course was uneventful. On histopathology, cancer cells were found in the resected stomach and resected liver. However, the HER2 statuses of the resected specimens were negative. After discharge, she received S-1 therapy for 1 year. Upon evaluation 1 year and 1 month postoperatively, the tumor marker CA19-9 was elevated. An enhanced CT scan showed multiple lung metastases and lymph node metastases in the pancreatic tail. Three courses of XELOX therapy(capecitabine and oxaliplatin)were administered. However, tumor marker levels continued to increase, and the metastasis continued to enlarge. Although the HER2 status of the resected site was negative, the HER2 status of the biopsy specimen before chemotherapy was positive on FISH. Therefore, weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab therapy was initiated and repeated for 6 courses, after which an enhanced CT showed significant reduction(nearly CR)of multiple lung metastases and lymph node metastases. This suggests that HER2-negative conversion had occurred at the resected site. However, the HER2 status of the metastatic sites was considered positive.",

Tumors were classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma. Invasive carcinomas were further characterized according to the subtype: hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and HR-/HER2-. BCs after HL were compared with four age-matched sporadic, non-breast cancer (BRCA) I or II mutated BCs.;One hundred forty-seven HL patients who were treated with RT between 1966 and 1999 and subsequently developed BCs were identified. Of these, 65 patients with 71 BCs had complete pathologic information. The median age at HL diagnosis was 23 (range, 10-48). The median age at BC diagnosis was 44 (range, 28-66). The median time to developing BC was 20 years. Twenty cancers (28%) were DCIS and 51 (72%) were invasive. Of the 51 invasive cancers, 24 (47%) were HR+/HER2-, 2 (4%) were HR+/HER2+, 5 (10%) were HR-/HER2+, and 20 (39%) were HR-/HER2-. There were no differences in BC histologic subtype according to the age at which patients were exposed to RT, the use of chemotherapy for HL treatment, or the time from RT exposure to the development of BC. In a 4 : 1 age-matched comparison to sporadic BCs, BCs after HL were more likely to be HR-/HER2- (39% versus 14%) and less likely to be HR+/HER2- (47% versus 61%) or HR+/HER2+ (4% versus 14%) (P = 0.0003).;BCs arising in previously irradiated breast tissue were more likely to be triple negative compared with age-matched sporadic invasive cancers and less likely to be HR positive.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

Metastasis requires escape of the tumor cell from the vasculature into subjacent tissue, a transmigration event across an endothelial cell (EC) monolayer. EC retraction has been reported to precede transmigration in several tumor metastatic models. Using intact human iliac vein EC monolayers, we tested the abilities of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HER cells, a transfected MCF-7 line over-expressing HER2, to induce EC retraction. We further analyzed whether HER2 signaling influenced cancer cell-induced EC retraction. MCF-7 or HER cells were co-cultured onto mature EC monolayers. More HER than MCF-7 cells induced EC retraction (76 +/- 19% vs. 17 +/- 12%, p < 0.001) with resultant exposure of subendothelial matrix (6.80 +/- 2.86% vs. 0.85 +/- 0.39%, p < 0.001). Blockade of HER2 signaling using Herceptin nearly eliminated EC retraction (p < 0.01), while stimulation of HER2 using heregulin-beta1-augmented EC retraction (p < 0.05). Further, there was no difference between cell lines in either the number of cells adhered or the strength of adherence to EC under shear stress. These data suggest that HER2 signaling enhances metastasis in breast cancer cells by inducing EC retraction, a process that appears to precede endothelial transmigration.",

Our knowledge of PCA growth regulation lags behind that of other cancers, such as breast and colon carcinomas. Among receptor tyrosine kinases, the ErbB family is most frequently implicated in neoplasia. We report here the expression of ErbB family kinases and their ligands in PCA cell lines and a xenograft. While ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2/NEU, and ErbB3 were always observed in a distinct pattern, ErbB4 was not observed. Interestingly, while TGF-alpha was expressed in the majority of PCA lines, the ligand Neu Differentiation Factor/Heregulin (NDF) was expressed only in an immortalized, non-transformed prostate epithelial line. Concomitantly, there was a significant difference in biological response to these ligands. NDF inhibited LNCaP growth and induced an epithelial-like morphological change, in contrast to TGF-alpha, which accelerated cell growth. We also performed the first comprehensive analysis of NDF signaling in a prostate line. LNCaP stimulated with NDF demonstrated crosstalk between ErbB3 and ErbB2 which did not involve ErbB1. NDF also turned on several cascades, including those of PI3-K, ERK/MAPK, mHOG/p38 and JNK/SAPK, but not those of PLCgamma or the STAT family. This signaling pattern is distinct from that of TGF-alpha. The activation of mHOG by ErbB2 or ErbB3 has not been reported, and may contribute to the unusual phenotype. PI3-K activation is characterized by the formation of a striking 'activation complex' with multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated species, including ErbB3.

To determine the role of growth factor receptors in the biologic stratification of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, we studied the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and HER-2 receptor in a large cohort of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas by immunohistochemical techniques. The percentage of positive cells, staining intensity and localization of staining in the anaplastic component, and coexisting well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma and adjacent nonneoplastic thyroid were evaluated for these markers. EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and HER-2 were overexpressed in 58%, 16%, and 16% of anaplastic carcinomas, respectively. In tumors with adjacent normal thyroid parenchyma and/or differentiated carcinoma components, overexpression of all 3 markers was noted exclusively in the anaplastic component. Mutational analysis of exons 18, 19, and 21 of the EGFR gene showed no mutations in all anaplastic carcinomas.

Maintenance of bronchial epithelial integrity is central for airway health, and defective epithelial barrier function contributes to the pathogenesis of CS-mediated diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although CS has been shown to increase epithelial permeability, current understanding of the mechanisms involved in CS-induced epithelial barrier disruption remains incomplete. We have previously identified that the receptor tyrosine kinase human epidermal receptor (HER) 2 growth factor is activated by the ligand neuregulin-1 and increases epithelial permeability in models of inflammatory acute lung injury. We hypothesized that CS activates HER2 and that CS-mediated changes in barrier function would be HER2 dependent in airway epithelial cells. We determined that HER2 was activated in whole lung, as well as isolated epithelial cells, from smokers, and that acute CS exposure resulted in HER2 activation in cultured bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistic studies determined that CS-mediated HER2 activation is independent of neuregulin-1 but required upstream activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 was required for CS-induced epithelial permeability as knockdown of HER2 blocked increases in permeability after CS. CS caused an increase in IL-6 production by epithelial cells that was dependent on HER2-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) activation. Finally, blockade of IL-6 attenuated CS-induced epithelial permeability. Our data indicate that CS activates pulmonary epithelial HER2 and that HER2 is a central mediator of CS-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction. ",

Overexpression of this receptor, p185HER-2/neu, is associated with poor outcome and may predict clinical response to chemotherapy. Antibodies to HER-2/neu receptor have a cytostatic effect in suppressing growth of cells with overexpression of p185HER-2/neu. To elicit a cytocidal effect, therapy with antireceptor antibody was used in combination with the DNA-damaging drug, cisplatin, and this combined treatment produced a synergistic decrease in cell growth. In addition, antibody mediated an increased sensitivity to cisplatin in drug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells containing multiple copies of HER-2/neu gene. To evaluate the mechanism for this synergy, unscheduled DNA synthesis was measured in cancer cells using incorporation of [3H]thymidine and autoradiography, and formation and repair of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts was also measured. Treatment with cisplatin led to a marked, dose-dependent increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis which was significantly reduced by combined treatment with antireceptor antibody in HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. Therapy with antibody to HER-2/neu receptor also led to a 35-40% reduction in repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts after cisplatin exposure and, as a result, promoted drug-induced killing in target cells.

In contrast to HER2+ carcinomas, no targeted therapy is currently available for the treatment of patients with BLCs. In order to discover potential therapeutic targets, we aimed to discover deregulated signalling pathways in human BLCs.;In this study, we focused on the oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in 13 BLCs, and compared it with a control series of 11 hormonal receptor negative- and grade III-matched HER2+ carcinomas. The two tumour populations were first characterised by immunohistochemistry and gene expression. The PI3K pathway was then investigated by gene copy-number analysis, gene expression profiling and at a proteomic level using reverse-phase protein array technology and tissue microarray. The effects of the PI3K inhibition pathway on proliferation and apoptosis was further analysed in three human basal-like cell lines.;The PI3K pathway was found to be activated in BLCs and up-regulated compared with HER2+ tumours as shown by a significantly increased activation of the downstream targets Akt and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). BLCs expressed significantly lower levels of the tumour suppressor PTEN and PTEN levels were significantly negatively correlated with Akt activity within that population. PTEN protein expression correlated significantly with PTEN DNA copy number and more importantly, reduced PTEN DNA copy numbers were observed specifically in BLCs. Similar to human samples, basal-like cell lines exhibited an activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and low/lack PTEN expression. Both PI3K and mTOR inhibitors led to basal-like cell growth arrest. However, apoptosis was specifically observed after PI3K inhibition.;These data provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of BLCs and implicate the PTEN-dependent activated Akt signalling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for the management of patients with poor prognosis BLCs.",

Although these recurrences occurred in the same quadrant as the primary DCIS, they may be considered as second primary tumours. Only 4 patients developed poorly differentiated DCIS or grade III invasive carcinoma after well differentiated DCIS.

Furthermore, CREB overexpression was found in tumors of distinct origin and evidence suggests an association with tumorigenicity. To establish a mechanistic link between HER-2/neu-mediated transformation and CREB protein expression and function, in vitro models of HER-2/neu-overexpressing and HER-2/neu-negative/silenced counterparts as well as human mammary carcinoma lesions with defined HER-2/neu status were used. HER-2/neu overexpression resulted in the induction and activation of CREB protein in vitro and in vivo, whereas short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of HER-2/neu correlated with downregulated CREB activity. CREB activation in HER-2/neu-transformed cells enhanced distinct signal transduction pathways, whereas their inhibition negatively interfered with CREB expression and/or activation. CREB downregulation in HER-2/neu-transformed cells by shRNA and by the inhibitors KG-501 and lapatinib caused morphologic changes, reduced cell proliferation with G0-G1 cell-cycle arrest, which was rescued by CREB expression. This was accompanied by reduced cell migration, wound healing, an increased fibronectin adherence, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase expression. In vivo shCREB-HER-2/neu(+) cells, but not control cells, exerted a significantly decreased tumorgenicity that was associated with decreased proliferative capacity, enhanced apoptosis, and increased frequency of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

In this study none of the carcinomas exhibited greater than 5 percent nuclear immunoreactivity for estrogen or progesterone receptors, and as a result they were classified as negative for these receptors. Reactivity for cathepsin D was found in 39 percent of the tumors, largely limited to areas of epidermoid differentiation. Membrane immunoreactivity for HER-2/neu oncogenes was present in glandular components of 46 percent of the carcinomas. Immunoreactivity for p53 (greater than 10 percent of nuclei) was present in 13 percent of the tumors, also in glandular elements. Six different patterns of coexpression of p53, HER-2/neu and cathepsin D were found, the most frequent being the following: HER-2/neu(+), p53(-), cathepsin D(-) (9 cases, 39%); cathepsin D(+), p53(-), HER-2/neu(-) (5 cases, 22%); and the three markers negative (5 cases, 22 percent). Coexpression of the two oncogenes was found in only one tumor which was also positive for cathepsin D. These results indicate that the expression of various immunohistochemical prognostic markers may be heterogeneous and that there may not be a specific pattern of marker coexpression within a carefully defined histologic subtype of mammary carcinoma. Furthermore, characteristics reported to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis (negative hormone receptors, presence of cathepsin D, and expression of oncogenes such as HER-2/neu) may be found in a substantial proportion of tumors that comprise this clinically and histologically low-grade variant of mammary carcinoma. This disassociation between expected prognosis based on expression of current prognostic markers and observed prognosis occurs in other forms of mammary carcinoma. Medullary carcinoma, when diagnosed on the basis of rigorously defined criteria, has an excellent prognosis despite the fact that these tumors are characterized by absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and a high proliferative rate.

In addition, the aptamer was found to preferentially bind to HER2-positive but not HER2-negative breast cancer cells. An aptamer-doxorubicin complex (Apt-Dox) was formulated by intercalating Dox into the DNA structure of HB5.

The apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 were assessed by immunohistochemistry.;We found that treatment of ChA21 caused a dose-dependent decrease of cell proliferation in vitro and a significant inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. ChA21 therapy led to a significant increase in the induction of apoptosis, and up-regulated the expression of Bax, while the expression of Bcl-2 was down-regulated.;These data suggest that ChA21 inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis of SK-OV-3 via regulating the balance between Bax and Bcl-2.",

Breast cancer (BC) fast diagnosis, prognosis and medication management necessitate, these days, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment of hormone receptors and HER2 expression profile. The present report defines the IHC profile of ER, PR and HER2 in Saudi female breast neoplasms of ductal and lobular types and associations ER, PR and HER2 expression patterns with various clinicopathological factors (age, type of tumor, size, laterality, histological grade, and involvement of axillaries lymph nodes). Ninety nine cases of breast tumors were recruited from the pathology department archive of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ER, PR and HER2 expression was assessed using IHC staining. Ductal carcinomas with a variety of histological grades constituted 88 (88.8%) of total cases. Seventy four (77.8%), 59 (62.1%), and 35 (36.8%) of ductal carcinomas showed positive staining for ER, PR and HER2, in that order. Remaining breast cancer cases were four (4%) lobular carcinomas and two (2%) mixed form of ductal and lobular types, which were ER+, PR+, and HER2-. Breast cancer expression pattern of ER, PR and HER2 in Saudi female is different from that of Tunisian and Jordanian female populations and closer to the expression pattern of Egyptian, Lebanese, Iraqi and western country females. Furthermore, the present study found two IHC patterns of breast cancer ER+/PR-/HER2+ (5%) and ER+/PR-/HER2- (11.1%), which had not been reported in other Arabic studies. Thus the rates of IHC expression patterns in breast cancer show some variation among Arabic female populations. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Accurate assessment of HER-2/neu status is crucial for proper prognostic information and to offer direct appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients. Next to immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate HER2 protein overexpression, a second line gene amplification test is generally deemed necessary for cases with equivocal protein expression. Recently, a new PCR based test, called Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), was introduced as a simple and quick method to assess HER-2/neu gene amplification status in invasive breast cancer. MLPA was previously shown to correlate well with IHC and in situ hybridization (ISH), but a low tumor percentage in the tissue tested could negatively affect the accuracy of MLPA results.;To examine this, MLPA was repeated in 42 patients after serial H&E section guided manual dissection with a scalpel and after laser microdissection of the tumor.;Both dissection techniques led to higher HER2 gene copy number ratios and thereby made MLPA more quantitative. Concordance between MLPA and ISH improved from 61% to 84% after manual microdissection and to 90% after laser microdissection.;Manual and laser microdissection similarly increase the dynamic range of MLPA copy number ratios which is a technical advantage. As clinically a dichotomization between normal and amplified suffices and MLPA is relatively unsensitive to tumor content, microdissection before MLPA may not be routinely necessary but may be advisable in case of very low tumor content (<or=30%), when MLPA results are equivocal, or when extensive ductal carcinoma in situ is present. Since differences between manual and laser microdissection were small, less time consuming manual microdissection appears to be sufficient.",

The present study investigated 31 breast carcinomas and their corresponding lymph node and distant metastases for HER-2/neu status by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (PathVysion). In 14 cases, serum HER-2/neu (SHER-2) was measured sequentially using the Bayer Immuno 1 HER-2/neu assay. Comparing HER-2/neu immunohistochemistry of primary tumours and distant metastases case by case, increased HER-2/neu expression was found in the distant metastases in 15 cases (48.4%), three (9.7%) of which showed an increase from score 0 to score 3+. In contrast, lymph node metastases showed the same HER-2/neu expression as the primary tumours, confirmed by FISH. Two cases, which showed HER-2/neu score 3+ and HER-2/neu amplification in the primary tumours, revealed increased SHER-2 levels above 50 ng/ml at the first measurement. Five of the 14 cases (36%) showed an increase of SHER-2 above 50 ng/ml towards the end of the patients' life. On the basis of these results, there is evidence that in a subset of breast carcinomas, HER-2/neu amplification and overexpression occur de novo in distant metastases at a late disease stage.",

First, breast cancers express multiple putative tumor-associated antigens, such as HER-2 and MUC-1, which have been the successful focus of vaccine development over the past decade, translating into tumor-specific immune responses and, in some cases, clinical benefit. Second, passive immune strategies with anti-HER-2 antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, have led to survival benefits in breast cancer. Finally, the successes observed with novel immunotherapeutic strategies, such as immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell therapies in other malignancies, combined with a growing body of literature that supports an interplay between solid tumors and the immune system, indicate that these strategies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of breast cancer.

The neoplasms included pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; n = 59) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC; n = 649). The latter were all node negative and stratified into IDC combined (n = 237) or not combined (n = 412) with a \"significant amount\" of DCIS (defined as DCIS greater than or equal to 10% of total tumor cellularity). Overexpression of HER-2/neu was not observed in any of the hyperplastic or dysplastic lesions. In contrast, it was present in 56% of pure DCIS and in 77% of the comedo subtype of this group. Only 15% of IDC overexpressed HER-2/neu. However, the rate of overexpression was significantly higher in the subset of IDC combined with DCIS compared with the subset of IDC not combined with DCIS (22% v 11%, respectively; P less than .0001). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HER-2/neu plays a more important role in initiation than in progression of ductal carcinomas. They also suggest that overexpression decreases within individual tumors as they evolve from in situ to increasingly invasive lesions or, alternatively, that many invasive carcinomas arise de novo (ie, without progressing through a significant in situ stage) by mechanisms not involving HER-2/neu. In addition, overexpression of HER-2/neu was associated with several poor prognostic features (younger patient age, premenopause, negative estrogen receptor status, negative progesterone receptor status, and high nuclear grade) in the subset of IDC combined with DCIS. With one exception (negative estrogen receptor status) these associations were lost in IDC not combined with DCIS, also suggesting that the role of HER-2/neu changes during the progression of human breast cancer.",

Id factors are involved in numerous cell processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. We assessed the expression of Id4 messenger RNA (mRNA) in invasive mammary carcinoma from 31 patients, as well as in 21 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, in 9 lymph node metastases, and in the morphologically normal epithelium adjacent to the carcinoma from the same subjects. In addition, we evaluated Id4 mRNA in atypical ductal hyperplasia from 5 other women and in normal breast tissue from yet another 5 women with no history of breast malignancy or atypia. The distribution of Id4 signal was assessed in relation to that of estrogen receptor (ER) in all samples and correlated with the Her-2 status of the carcinomas. Id4 mRNA was present in the normal ER-negative mammary epithelium in all cases; in contrast, the ER-positive cells present in the normal breast were Id4 negative. Id4 mRNA was not detected in atypical ductal hyperplasia, in 22 of the 23 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, and in 27 of the 31 invasive carcinomas (P = .0008), all of which were ER positive. Conversely, 3 of the 31 invasive carcinomas were Id4 positive and ER negative. Only 1 ER-positive invasive carcinoma showed focal reactivity for Id4. The expression of Id4 in metastatic carcinoma paralleled that of the primary tumor. No correlation was apparent between Id4 and Her-2. Our data show that Id4 is constitutively expressed in the normal human mammary epithelium but is suppressed in ER-positive breast carcinomas and preneoplastic lesions. In contrast, ER-negative carcinomas appear to be Id4 positive. These results support a possible role of Id4 as a tumor suppressor factor in the human breast and suggest that the expression of Id4 in the mammary ductal epithelium may be regulated by estrogen.

Four of the 12 cases (33%) were associated with a malignancy (two cutaneous adenocarcinomas, two colorectal carcinomas). The two cases of cutaneous adenocarcinoma occurred in the cutaneous group (2/10 [20%]), while the two cases of rectal carcinoma (one invasive, one in situ) occurred in the endodermal group (2/2 [100%]).

Such information may be of importance to therapy, as amplification of TOP2A has been associated with dose-dependent sensitivity to anthracycline therapy in breast cancer. We examined 40 breast carcinomas from BRCA1 mutation carriers and 40 sporadic breast carcinomas matched for age, tumour diameter and histological grade for HER-2 and TOP2A amplification status using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Co-amplification of TOP2A and HER-2 was found in four of the mutation carriers and in three of the controls. While six tumours in the control group harboured HER-2 amplifications with normal TOP2A, this occurred in three of the BRCA1 associated tumours only.

Therefore, agents that interfere with inflammatory signaling molecules or specific immune cell populations have been investigated as anticancer drugs. Corticosteroids are highly potent anti-inflammatory drugs, whose activity is intensified when targeted by nanocarrier systems. Liposome-targeted corticosteroids have been shown to inhibit tumor growth in different syngeneic murine tumor models as well as human xenograft mouse models, which is attributed to a switch in the tumor microenvironment from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. Despite the recognized value of implantation tumor models in preclinical research, the \"acute\" inflammation induced by inoculation of tumor cells together with the exponential tumor growth in a relatively short period of time does not resemble slow progressive human disease that develops in situ. Therefore, in this study, the antitumor effect of liposomal corticosteroids was investigated in a clinically more relevant setting of transgenic mice developing spontaneous breast carcinomas. Here we show that liposomal prednisolone phosphate inhibits the growth of spontaneous breast carcinoma. Interestingly, the liposomal prednisolone was significantly more active than free drug. At 72h after injection of the liposomal formulation, 3μg prednisolone per gram of tumor tissue was recovered whereas no drug could be recovered after injection of the free agent. This indicates that, despite etiological and morphological differences between implanted and spontaneous tumor models, EPR-mediated accumulation of drug occurs to similar extent in this spontaneous mammary carcinoma model as in the syngeneic tumor models. Finally, we analyzed miRNA profiles in the MMTV/neu model and showed that the top 10 of miRNAs in the MMTV/neu tumor consisted of miRNAs with a known involvement in breast carcinoma proliferation and metastasis. The only exception was the appearance of miR-146b, a known inflammation-regulating miRNA species, after liposomal prednisolone treatment.",

Although so far a number of studies have been reported on the development of third-generation EGFR inhibitors for overcoming the resistance issue, the design procedure largely depends on the intuition of medicinal chemists. Here we retrospectively make a detailed analysis of the 42 EGFR family protein crystal complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Based on the analysis of inhibitor binding modes in the kinase catalytic cleft, we identified a potent EGFR inhibitor (compound A-10) against drug-resistant EGFR through fragment-based drug design. This compound showed at least 30-fold more potency against EGFR T790M than the two control molecules erlotinib and gefitinib in vitro. Moreover, it could exhibit potent HER2 inhibitory activities as well as tumor growth inhibitory activity. Molecular docking studies revealed a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of this compound. Compound A-10 may be selected as a promising candidate in further preclinical studies. In addition, our findings could provide a powerful strategy to identify novel selective kinase inhibitors on the basis of detailed kinase-ligand interaction space in the PDB. ",

Shc proteins are important downstream signal transducers of receptor tyrosine kinases. We reported here a novel finding that p66Sch was absent or nearly absent in p185-overexpressing breast cancer cells. This inverse correlation of p185 overexpression and p66Shc expression is probably specific to breast cancer cells because this phenomenon was not observed in p185-overexpressing human ovarian, lung, or oral cancer cells, or mouse fibroblast cells. In contrast, the p52Shc and p46Shc isoforms were expressed at similar levels in both p185-overexpressing and p185 basal level breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of p52Shc and p46Shc and subsequent formation of Shc/Grb2 complex were detected in breast cancer cells in which the p185 tyrosine kinase is activated, indicating that p66Shc is not required for mediating the HER-2/neu signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.",

The Tri-DNA vaccine was at least as effective as the Triplex cell vaccine for cancer immunoprevention, giving a similar delay in the onset of mammary cancer and complete protection from salivary cancer. Both vaccines induced anti-Neu antibodies of the murine IgG2a isotype at similar levels. The Tri-DNA vaccine gave more restricted immunostimulation, consisting of a fully helper T cell type 1 (Th1)-polarized response, with effective production of interferon (IFN)-gamma in response to the vaccine but no spontaneous production, and no induction of anti-Neu IgG3 antibodies. On the other hand, the Triplex cell vaccine induced both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, a strong increase in spontaneous IFN-gamma production, and high levels of IgG3 antibodies recognizing Neu-positive syngeneic cells.

Salivary gland carcinomas overexpress ErbB2. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to ErbB2, was proposed for salivary gland tumors treatment. We explored the effectiveness of intratumoral vaccination with the recombinant vaccinia virus ErbB2/Neu (rV-neuT) vaccine in hampering the growth of transplanted Neu-overexpressing BALB-neuT salivary gland cancer cells (SALTO) in BALB-neuT mice.;BALB-neuT male mice were subcutaneously injected with SALTO tumor cells and intratumorally vaccinated twice with different doses of either rV-neuT or V-wt (wild-type). Tumors were measured weekly. The presence of anti-ErbB2/Neu antibodies was assayed by ELISA, immunoprecipitation or indirect immunofluorescence. Biological activity of immune sera was investigated by analyzing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), SALTO cells proliferation and apoptosis, ErbB2/Neu receptor down regulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Anti-Neu T cell immunity was investigated by determining the release of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in T cells supernatant. Survival curves were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Differences in tumor volumes, number of apoptotic cells, titer of the serum, percentage of ADCC were evaluated through a two-tailed Student's t-test.;rV-neuT intratumoral vaccination was able to inhibit the growth of SALTO cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-Neu serum titer paralleled in vivo antitumor activity of rV-neuT vaccinated mice. rV-neuT immune serum was able to mediate ADCC, inhibition of SALTO cells proliferation, down regulation of the ErbB2/Neu receptor, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis, thus suggesting potential mechanisms of in vivo tumor growth interference. In addition, spleen T cells of rV-neuT vaccinated mice released IFN-gamma and IL-2 upon in vitro stimulation with several Neu-specific peptides located in the extracellular domain of Neu sequence.;rV-neuT intratumoral vaccination could be employed to induce an efficient antitumor response and reject transplanted salivary gland tumors.

Phage-displayed peptides were evaluated for ERBB2 and cancer cell binding affinity and specificity in vitro, and one peptide was radiolabeled with (111)In-DOTA and biodistribution and SPECT imaging properties were compared to the first generation peptide, (111)In-DOTA-KCCYSL.;In vivo phage display selected two peptides, 1-D03 (MEGPSKCCYSLALSH) and 3-G03 (SGTKSKCCYSLRRSS), with higher breast carcinoma cell specificity and similar ErbB2 affinity (236 and 289 nM, respectively) to the first generation peptide. The corresponding radiolabeled probes bound with higher affinity to target cancer cells than (111)In-DOTA-KCCYSL; however, only (111)In-DOTA-1-D03 demonstrated higher specificity for MDA-MB-435 cells. Biodistribution analysis demonstrated that although (111)In-DOTA-1-D03 had slightly reduced tumor uptake (0.661 % ID/g) in comparison to (111)In-DOTA-KCCYSL (0.78 %/ID/g), its dramatic improvement in blood clearance led to a significantly higher tumor/blood ratio (6.02:1). Non-specific uptake was also reduced in most organs including heart, lung, muscle, bone, and kidneys. SPECT imaging revealed tumor-specific uptake of (111)In-DOTA-1-D03, which was confirmed by blocking with unlabeled 1-D03 peptide.;This is the first evidence that SPECT imaging peptides with improved tumor specificity and pharmacokinetics can be obtained by in vivo phage display affinity maturation.

Analysis of TICs in model systems of breast cancer would offer uniform and accessible source of tumor cells and the power of mouse genetics to dissect these rare cells. The HER2/Neu proto-oncogene is overexpressed in an aggressive form of human breast cancer. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu transgenic mice develop mammary tumors that mimic human HER2 subtype breast cancer. Here, we report on the functional identification of mouse HER2/Neu TICs that can induce tumors after transplantation into the mammary gland of recipient mice. Secondary tumors formed after injecting MMTV-Neu TICs resemble primary tumors in the original transgenic mice and are organized in a hierarchy containing TICs as well as their nontumorigenic descendants. To study MMTV-Neu TICs in vitro, we grew tumorspheres under nonadherent culture conditions. Tumorsphere forming units (TFU) capable of producing tumorspheres retained tumorigenic potential and were indistinguishable by several criteria from TICs. Interestingly, MMTV-Neu TICs and TFUs were committed to the luminal cell fate when induced to differentiate in vitro. Our data define reproducible characteristics of the MMTV-Neu TIC and TFU, which help to explain marker expression profiles of HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition, the similarity between TICs and TFUs in this system provides a rationale for TFU-based screens to target tumor-initiating cells in HER2(+) breast cancer.",

Currently, only human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy has been successful in significantly prolonging the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC). There is a need for the discovery of additional novel targets in GC.;Anti-ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to screen 495 GC samples and was followed by simultaneous ROS1 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses in IHC-positive samples. Fusion partners in ROS1-rearranged GC were determined by RT-PCR. In all 495 samples, HER2 amplification was identified with FISH, and MET expression was identified by IHC.;Twenty-three tumor samples were ROS1 IHC-positive.

ErbB2-siRNA and the anti-erbB2 antibody trastuzumab blocked IR-induced, but not EGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and impaired the repair of DNA-DSB. Likewise, IR but not EGF enhanced erbB1/erbB2 heterodimerization and resulted in the release of phosphorylated erbB2 cleavage products p135 and p95. Trastuzumab prevented radiation-induced formation of an active erbB1/erbB2 heterodimer and increased cellular radiation sensitivity. ErbB1- but not erbB2-TK inhibition stabilized erbB2 (p185) through preventing its cleavage.;The data indicates that ErbB2 through heterodimerization with erbB1 is necessary for the activation of Akt signaling following irradiation but not following EGF treatment.",

To date, the expression of EGFR and HER2 has not been evaluated in primary cutaneous spindle squamous cell carcinoma (SSC). In extracutaneous spindle squamous cell carcinoma, there is evidence implicating the expression of RTK as a strong, independent prognostic indicator of potentially poor outcome. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression of EGFR and HER2 in SSC, using immunohistochemical methods.;Thirteen cases of primary nonmetastatic cutaneous SSC archived at a large veterans' hospital and tertiary referral dermatopathology service were retrieved via a computer-assisted search. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the presence of EGFR and/or HER2 expression. All cases were confirmed before study by a single, board-certified dermatopathologist.;All 13 cases (100%) evaluated for the presence of HER2 were nonimmunoreactive for the receptor. Only one of the 13 cases (<8%) stained positive for EGFR.;In several malignancies, the overexpression EGFR and HER2 is associated with clinically aggressive behavior. Despite a limited sample size, EGFR and HER2 are not overexpressed in SSC; this is cognate with the current opinion that SSC possesses limited metastatic potential.

Bigenic (NT) and Neu-induced mammary tumors developed with a similar latency. The bigenic tumors and their metastases were less proliferative than those occurring in MMTV-Neu mice. However, NT tumors exhibited less apoptosis and were more locally invasive and of higher histological grade. NT mice exhibited more circulating tumor cells and lung metastases than Neu mice, while NT tumors contained higher levels of phosphorylated (active) Smad2, Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p38, as well as vimentin content and Rac1 activity in situ than tumors expressing Neu alone. Ex vivo, NT cells exhibited higher levels of P-Akt and P-MAPK than Neu cells. These were inhibited by the TGF-beta inhibitor-soluble TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII:Fc), suggesting they were activated by autocrine TGF-beta. TGF-beta stimulated migration of Neu cells into surrounding matrix, while the soluble TGF-beta inhibitor abrogated motility and invasiveness of NT cells.

In four of 43 oncogene-bearing glands, areas of ductal carcinoma in situ were found, an abnormality previously observed in transgenic neu-bearing mice. Six glands developed localized areas of dense stroma containing excess ductal structures comprised of mildly hyperplastic epithelium. These areas resembled the human breast lesion termed sclerosing adenosis. Other glands developed hyperplastic epithelium, sometimes with multilayering of the cells and/or atypical changes such as abnormally large nuclei. In human breasts such lesions would be termed mild or atypical hyperplasia. In all the abnormal areas examined, levels of neu protein above background level were detected by immunohistochemistry. Some staining was localized to membranes (as observed in ductal carcinoma in situ in humans) but cytoplasmic staining was also common in the lesions induced in mice by the neu oncogene.

In this study, we sought to determine if HPV infection is associated with CCCC and to elucidate the signaling pathways involved.;We collected samples from 13 CCCC patients and collated the relevant clinicopathologic data. We then evaluated the presence of HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58 by broad-spectrum amplification by polymerase chain reaction and HPV types 39, 45, 51, 56, 59, and 68 by nested polymerase chain reaction assay that combines degenerate E6/E7 consensus primers and type-specific primers from extracted genomic DNA. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), HER2, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), p16, and p53. EGFR and HER2 gene amplification was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;Patients with stage IB CCCC had a better 3-year overall survival rate compared with those with advanced-stage cancer (100% vs 44%; P = 0.014).

EGFR amplification could not be detected, but HER2 amplification was identified in 1 of (12.5%) 8 cases.;Patients with stage I CCCC demonstrated good overall survival and rare recurrence. Clear cell carcinoma of the cervix is unrelated to high-risk HPV infection; hence, current vaccines will not prevent the incidence of CCCC.

        "Doc_abstract":"Prevention of cancer through the activation of the immune system has been explored in recent years in preclinical systems thanks to the availability of several new transgenic mouse models that closely mimic the natural history of human tumors. The most thoroughly investigated model of cancer immunoprevention is the mammary carcinoma of HER-2/neu transgenic mouse. In this system it has clearly been shown that the activation of immune defences in healthy individuals can effectively prevent the subsequent onset of highly aggressive mammary carcinomas. A complete prevention was obtained using a combination of three signals (the so called \"triplex\" vaccine) that included the specific antigen (p185, the product of HER-2/neu) and nonspecific signals like allogeneic histocompatibility antigens and interleukin 12. The analysis of protective immune responses in models of cancer immunoprevention revealed some unexpected features, in particular the central role of antibodies in immunoprevention, at variance with conventional immuno-therapy which is firmly based on cytotoxic T cells. In the HER-2/neu system anti-p185 antibodies, in addition to immunological functions leading to tumor cell lysis, inhibit p185 dimerization and induce its internalization, resulting in the inhibition of mitogenic signaling. Most current tumor antigens appear to be unsuitable targets for cancer immunoprevention. An ideal antigen should have a crucial pathogenetic role in tumor growth to avoid the selection of antigen loss variants. Downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression during tumor progression frequently limits antigen recognition by MHC-restricted T cells. Thus an ideal antigen for cancer immunoprevention should be recognized both by T cells and by antibodies. Antibody binding to cell surface oncogenic determinants, in addition to complement- and cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, can block mitogenic signaling and induce internalization, resulting in tumor growth arrest. A search for new tumor antigens should be conducted among molecules that are directly involved in neoplastic transformation and are recognizable by the immune response also in MHC loss variants. Novel tumor antigens fulfilling both conditions will be crucial for the development of cancer immunoprevention and will provide new targets also for cancer immunotherapy.",

Thus, it is conceivable that combined therapy with anti-oestrogen and anti-HER2 antibody might be more effective. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combined treatment with a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, rhumAbHER2 (trastuzumab), and an anti-oestrogen, ICI 182,780, on the cell growth of three human breast cancer cell lines which respectively express different levels of ER and HER2. The combined treatment enhanced the growth inhibitory effect on ML-20 cells, which express a high level of ER and a moderate level of HER2, but showed no additive effect on either KPL-4 cells, which express no ER and a moderate level of HER2, or MDA-MB-231 cells, which express no ER and a low level of HER2.

Although the results showed overlapping of genomic alterations between the two subtypes, trends including more frequent KRAS alterations in pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma (61 vs 29%) and more frequent mutations in APC in intestinal-type ampullary carcinoma (43 vs 17%) were observed.

In the second phase of the study, we aimed at validating our observation on ERBB2 and assessed ERBB2 amplification and protein overexpression in a series of 100 ampullary carcinomas. We found that (1) gene amplification and immunohistochemical overexpression of ERBB2 occurred in 13% of all ampullary carcinomas, therefore providing a potential target for anti-HER2 therapy in these tumors; (2) amplification and immunohistochemical expression correlated in all cases, thus indicating that immunohistochemistry could be used to screen tumors; and (3) none of the 14 ERBB2-amplified tumors harbored any downstream driver mutations in KRAS/NRAS, whereas 56% of the cases negative for ERBB2 amplification did, an observation clinically pertinent as downstream mutations may cause primary resistance to inhibition of EGFR family members.

Here, we identify candidate tumor progression genes using gene array analysis of preinvasive and invasive tumors from mice, which were then evaluated in human cancers. Immediate early response protein IEX-1, small stress protein 1 (HSPB8), and tumor necrosis factor-associated factor-interacting protein mRNAs displayed higher expression levels in invasive lesions than in preinvasive lesions using samples obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from transgenic erbB2, ras, and cyclin D1 mice. LCM-isolated tissues from patient-matched normal, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma revealed similar increased expression in invasive human cancers compared with preinvasive and normal samples. These genes induced anchorage independence, increased cell proliferation, and protected against apoptosis, singly or in collaboration with erbB2. Surprisingly, they were all up-regulated by 17beta-estradiol and cyclin D1, and cyclin D1 overexpression increased p300/CBP binding to their promoters, supporting the model that cyclin D1-estrogen receptor (ER) coactivator interactions may be important to its role in ER-positive breast cancer. Additionally, an irreversible dual kinase inhibitor of ErbB signaling inhibited expression of the same genes. The up-regulation of genes contributing to increased invasiveness of ER-positive cancers offers a novel explanation for the contribution of cyclin D1 to a worse prognosis in ER-positive cancers. As targets of estrogen, cyclin D1, and erbB2 signaling, these candidates offer insights into the nature of the second events involved in breast cancer progression, regulatory events contributing to invasion, and potential targets of combined inhibition of hormone and growth factor signaling pathways.",

Growth of CSOC 882 was best modeled using the logistic growth equation revealing an average doubling time of 31 h. CSOC 882 cells expressed vimentin, cytokeratin, p53, BRCA1, EGF receptor, HER2, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, and progesterone receptor, while no evidence of estrogen receptor beta or factor VIII was observed. Some but not all CSOC 882 cells were positive for CA125 reflecting the primary tumor, which had patchy CA125 staining. Drug sensitivity assays demonstrated that CSOC 882 was more sensitive to cisplatin and carboplatin than SKOV3 and HCC1937 while CSOC 882 and SKOV3 were both sensitive to paclitaxel unlike HCC1937. CSOC 882 xenografts retained the original characteristics of vimentin, cytokeratin, and factor VIII labeling.;CSOC 882 is an immortalized cell line that has survived more than 130 passages in culture and retained molecular features of the primary tumor from which it was derived.

        "Doc_abstract":"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation causes multiple pathologic changes in the skin including inflammation, immune suppression, photoaging, and cancer. Effects of UV irradiation include the activation of numerous signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). These responses alter gene expression in a manner that resembles the response to growth factors known as the \"UV response\". The UV response alters the kinetics of cell division and cell death allowing the skin to recover from the DNA damage caused by UV exposure. UV irradiation also rapidly activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members, including Erbb2 (human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu), through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Erbb2, a protooncogene that is activated in many types of cancer and associated with aggressive and chemotherapeutic-resistant disease, is expressed in both follicular and epidermal keratinocytes within the skin. However, the physiological functions of Erbb2 in the skin and its role in the UV response are largely unknown. In this review, evidence that Erbb2 is influential in modulating the response of the skin to UV will be presented. Erbb2 alters the expression of regulatory genes controlling inflammation, angiogenesis, cell division, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and migration following UV irradiation. In addition, Erbb2 dampens UV-induced S-phase arrest, augments inflammation in response to UV irradiation, and suppresses UV-induced apoptosis. In summary, the evidence presented herein links UV-induced Erbb2 activation to many of the effects of UV and implicates Erbb2 in UV-induced carcinogenesis.",

As in invasive breast carcinomas Her-2 overexpression has been related to an increased number of chromosome 17 copies, a common chromosomal alteration in OSCC, we evaluated the association between polysomy 17 and Her-2 protein expression in a series of primary OSCC. Forty-one incisional biopsies of primary OSCC were included in the study. Protein expression was evaluated immunochistochemically with CB11 mouse monoclonal anti-human antibody. The reaction was arbitrarily characterized as absent, faint, moderate, and strong, and staining pattern as cytoplasmic and membranous. Positive cases were analyzed by chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) to access Her-2 status. The association between polysomy 17 and Her-2 expression was checked by Fisher's exact test. Four cases were negative and 37 cases were positive for Her-2. Staining was faint in 15 cases and moderate in 22 cases. CISH showed that all cases with faint staining were diploid, while from the cases with moderate staining 10 were diploid and 12 polysomic for chromosome 17. Thirteen cases showed purely cytoplasmic staining, while in 24 there were areas of both cytoplasmic and membranous staining. There was a statistically significant correlation between intensity of the reaction and polysomy 17 (P = 0.0036), in particular for cases with both cytoplasmic and membranous staining (P = 0.0128). In some OSCC Her-2 immunohistochemical expression may be associated with chromosome 17 polysomy and not Her-2 amplification.",

Such clones yielded specific proliferative and cytokine [gamma-interferon(IFN)-gamma] responses when challenged with autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with HER2(776-788). By performing blocking studies with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and by using DCs from allogeneic donors sharing certain HLA-DR alleles, we found that HER2(776-788) is a promiscuous peptide presented, at least, by DRB5*0101, DRB1*0701 and DRB1*0405 alleles. One TCRV beta 6.7+ clone recognized the HLA-DRB5*0101+ FM3 melanoma cell line transfected with a full length HER-2/neu cDNA. Moreover, this clone recognized the HER-2/neu+ SKBR3 breast cancer cell line induced to express HLA-DR, thus demonstrating that HER2(776-788) represents a naturally processed and presented epitope. Our data demonstrate that helper peptide HER2(776-788) represents a promiscuous epitope binding to at least three HLA-DR alleles, thus offering a broad population coverage.

Beside its important role in tumor induction, growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for new therapeutic approaches such as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through the HER-2 receptor. In addition to Herceptin, which is in a wide clinical use for HER-2 amplified breast cancer, a number of various HER-2 directed immunological and genetic strategies, either targeting the HER-2 receptor, its signaling pathways or both HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) simultaneously, have demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity in HER-2 amplified carcinomas. Moreover, the HER-2 amplicon is known to contain more than 30 genes with altered copy numbers that could be therapeutic targets for chemotherapy. The topoisomerase IIalpha gene, TOP2A, is located adjacent to the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome location 17q12-q21 and is either amplified or deleted (with equal frequency) in a great majority of HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors and also in tumors without HER-2 amplification. Recent experimental as well as numerous, large, multi-center trials suggest that amplification (and/or deletion) of TOP2A may account for both sensitivity or resistance to commonly used cytotoxic drugs, i.e. topoII-inhibitors (anthracyclines etc.), depending on the specific genetic defect at the TOP2A locus. The understanding of HER-2 amplification and its role in the pathogenesis of cancer is expanding, and a number of therapeutic strategies targeting either the HER-2 or its signaling pathways in cancer therapy are being investigated. Combining HER-2 targeting therapies with conventional forms of cytotoxic chemotherapy, where additional diagnostic tests such as those ascertaining TOP2A status, may be helpful for the ideal selection of patients for the combination therapy of an HER-2 targeting drug together with a cytotoxic drug such as topoII-inhibitor especially in the case of TOP2A amplification.",

Additional sources were identified from bibliographies in the articles and from Web sites and reports from the National Cancer Institute, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.;Progress in identifying the biochemical and molecular causes of cancer has led to discovery of abnormalities that characterize cancer cells and represent targets for development of drug therapies. TK receptors represent one such target when these are present in elevated quantities and/or aberrant forms. Abnormalities in these cell surface receptors have been correlated with development and progression of cancer, poor response to chemotherapeutic agents, and low survival rates. Several subtypes of TK receptors have been identified, and mutations in these have been associated with neoplasms of the breast, lung, colon, ovaries, and other organs. Approved agents, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin-Genentech) work by blocking a subtype of TK receptors that has been associated with breast cancer growth.

The aim of this study is to compare HER2 expression in biopsy and resection specimens of gastric carcinoma by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to find the ideal number of biopsy tumor fragments that can accurately predict HER2 overexpression in the corresponding surgically resected specimen. The HER2 IHC results of 702 paired biopsy and resection specimens of gastric cancer were compared.The mean number of biopsy fragments among all cases was 4.3 (range 1-11). HER2 was positive in 130 (18.5%) endoscopic biopsies and in 102 (14.5%) gastrectomy specimens. Intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 was found in 80 (61.5%) biopsies and 70 (68.6%) resection specimens. Out of the 70 surgical specimens with intratumoral heterogeneity, 24 (34.3%) of the corresponding biopsies were categorized as negative (positive conversion). In the 86 (12.3%) discrepant cases, negative conversion was observed in 57 (66.3%) cases and positive conversion in 29 (33.7%). The fragment numbers were significantly correlated with the discrepancy of results and positive predictability (P = 0.0315 and P = 0.0052). ROC curve analysis and positive predictability showed that 4 fragments should be obtained to minimize the differences in HER2 scores between biopsy and resection specimen.In gastric carcinomas with discrepant HER2 results between biopsy and surgical resection specimens, intratumoral heterogeneity is common with most of them showing positive conversion. To predict HER2 status precisely, at least 4 biopsy fragments containing tumor cells are required. ",

To identify the mechanism by which Src overexpression sustains this resistance, we tested a panel of breast cancer cell lines either sensitive or resistant to lapatinib.;To determine the role of Src in lapatinib resistance, we evaluated the effects of Src inhibition/silencing in vitro on survival, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. In vivo experiments were performed in JIMT-1 lapatinib-resistant cells orthotopically implanted in nude mice. We used artificial metastasis assays to evaluate the effect of Src inhibition on the invasiveness of lapatinib-resistant cells. Src-dependent signal transduction was investigated with Western blot and ELISA analyses.;Src activation was higher in lapatinib-resistant than in lapatinib-sensitive cells. The selective small-molecule Src inhibitor saracatinib combined with lapatinib synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lapatinib-resistant cells. Saracatinib combined with lapatinib significantly prolonged survival of JIMT-1-xenografted mice compared with saracatinib alone, and impaired the formation of lung metastases. Unexpectedly, in lapatinib-resistant cells, Src preferentially interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rather than with HER2. Moreover, EGFR targeting and lapatinib synergistically inhibited survival, migration, and invasion of resistant cells, thereby counteracting Src-mediated resistance. These findings demonstrate that Src activation in lapatinib-resistant cells depends on EGFR-dependent rather than on HER2-dependent signaling.;Complete pharmacologic EGFR/HER2 inhibition is required to reverse Src-dependent resistance to lapatinib in breast cancer.",

Despite improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease the prognosis remains poor, the overall 5-year survival being 4-14%. An increased understanding of the molecular biology of the disease may identify novel targets for drug development. We evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER-2/neu, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, p53 and bcl-2 expression and microvessel density (MVD) in patients who underwent surgery with curative intent in our department between 1991 and 1996. Co-expression of EGFR/MMP-9, MVD and bcl-2 were found to be independent prognostic variables, which allowed prediction of patient outcome independent of surgical stage. Other prognostic factors identified in our series were gender, surgical stage, platelet count, extent of necrosis, the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase-9 and beta-catenin. In collaboration with groups in Oxford and Greece, we were also able to establish the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor as prognostic variables. The inter-relationships between these factors are currently being examined in an expanded patient series. Through this work we hope to be able to construct an integrated biological prognostic model which can be tested in prospective studies.

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression and activation of HER-2/neu, a proto-oncogene, play a pivotal role in cancer formation. Strong expression of HER-2/neu in cancers has been associated with poor prognosis. Reduced expression of p27(Kip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, correlates with poor clinical outcome in many types of carcinomas. Because many cancers with the overexpression of HER-2/neu overlap with those affected by reduced p27 expression, we studied the link between HER-2/neu oncogenic signals and p27 regulation. We found that down-regulation of p27 correlates with HER-2/neu overexpression. To address the molecular mechanism of this inverse correlation, we found that reduction of p27 is caused by enhanced ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and the HER-2/Grb2/MAPK pathway is involved in the decrease of p27 stability. Also, HER-2/neu activity causes mislocation of p27 and Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1), an exporter of p27, into the cytoplasm, thereby facilitating p27 degradation. These results reveal that HER-2/neu signals reduce p27 stability and thus present potential points for therapeutic intervention in HER-2/neu-associated cancers.",

Also, narrative review of concordance of HER2 assays.;We abstracted data from: three articles plus one conference abstract on negative, equivocal, or discordant HER2 results; 26 studies on selection of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy; 15 studies on serum HER2; and 26 studies on ovarian, lung, prostate, or head and neck tumors. Foreign-language studies were included.;We sought randomized trials or single-arm series (prospective or retrospective) of identically treated patients that presented relevant outcome data associated with HER2 status.;HER2 assay results are influenced by multiple biologic, technical, and performance factors. Many aspects of HER2 assays were standardized only recently, so inconsistencies confound the literature comparing different methods. The evidence is weak on outcomes of trastuzumab added to chemotherapy for HER2-equivocal, -discordant, or -negative patients. Evidence comparing chemotherapy outcomes in HER2-positive and HER2-negative patient subgroups may generate hypotheses, but is too weak to test hypotheses. Only a rigorous test can resolve whether HER2-positive patients (but not HER2-negative patients) benefit from an anthracycline regimen. Evidence is available only from uncontrolled series on whether HER2 status predicts complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence also is weak regarding differences by HER2 status for outcomes of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease; with most studies lacking statistical power. Data from studies of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors suggest that future studies should examine whether HER2 status predicts response to specific hormonal therapies among estrogen-receptor-positive patients. The evidence is weak on whether serum HER2 predicts outcome after treatment with any regimens in any setting, as is the evidence on use of serum or tissue HER2 testing for malignancies of lung, ovary, head and neck, or prostate.;Overall, few studies directly investigated the key questions of this systematic review. Going forward, cancer therapy trial protocols should incorporate elements to facilitate robust analyses of the use of HER2 status and other biomarkers for managing treatment.",
