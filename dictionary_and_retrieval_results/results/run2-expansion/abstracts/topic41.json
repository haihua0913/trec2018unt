        "Doc_abstract":"Rearrangements of NTRK1 proto-oncogene were detected in 'spontaneous' papillary thyroid carcinomas with a frequency varying from 5 to 25% in different studies. These rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. To investigate if the NTRK1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of NTRK1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. These data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro culture cell lines derived from 'spontaneous' thyroid cancers. Our results concerning the radiation-associated tumours showed that only rearrangements between NTRK1 and TPM3 genes (TRK oncogene) were detected in 2/14 papillary carcinomas and in one lymph-node metastasis of one of these papillary thyroid carcinomas. All the radiation-associated adenomas were negative. In the 'spontaneous' tumours, only one of the 14 papillary carcinomas and one of the four in vitro culture cell lines, derived from a papillary carcinoma, presented a NTRK1 rearrangement also with the TPM3 gene. Twenty-five of this series of radiation-associated tumours were previously studied for the ras and RET/PTC oncogenes. In conclusion, our data: (a) show that the overall frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements is similar between radiation-associated (2/31: 6%) and 'spontaneous' epithelial thyroid tumours (2/32: 6%). The frequency, if we consider exclusively the papillary carcinomas, is in both cases 12%; (b) show that the TRK oncogene plays a role in the development of a minority of radiation-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas but not in adenomas; and (c) confirm that RET/PTC rearrangements are the major genetic alteration associated with ionizing radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

Both of them arise from the fusion of 3' terminal sequences of TK domain of RET or NTRK1 gene, respectively, with 5' terminal sequences of their activating genes. In case of NTRK1 oncogene, several rearrangement types are observed, characteristic for PTC: Trk (TMP3), Trk-T1, Trk-T2, Trk-T3 and Trk-2h, observed in human breast cancer cell line. Studies from different geographical regions, revealed significant population differences in the incidence of Trk rearrangements (0-50%), while within the same population, the frequency of Trk in spontaneous and radiation-associated PTCs is similar. The results of studies, focused on the correlation between tumour genotype and the histopathological type of tumour, involving cases of both RET/PTC and Trk rearrangements in PTC, are not unequivocal. In many studies, no correlation was observed between the presence of RET and/or NTRK1 rearrangement and such parameters, as patient's age at diagnosis, gender, histopathological type of tumour or clinical stage (TNM stage grouping), although the earliest clinical symptoms and the worst disease outcomes were observed for RET/NTRK1 rearrangement positive tumours. Differences in the rearrangement incidence between male and female patients were associated with the latency period of radiation-associated tumours, being significantly lower in women.

Oncogenic fusion of the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain with the amino-terminal part of the tropomyosin gene (TPM3/NTRK1, trk) was observed in 5 tumors. A single tumor exhibited a TPR/NTRK1 fusion (TRK-T2).

Oncogenic potential in thyrocytes results from replacing the 5' portion by regulatory parts of other genes, leading to constitutive TK expression. In Italy, human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) shows a frequent activation (50%) of the TK receptor genes NTRK1 and RET. Both genes undergo oncogenic rearrangements by the same mechanism. We previously reported high frequency (6/11) of rearrangement of the RET protooncogene in Chinese PTCs. Wide differences in the frequency (0-10.9%) of the NTRK1 rearrangement in PTCs have been reported in different populations. To investigate the frequency of TRK protooncogene rearrangement in Chinese thyroid tumors, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to amplify specific TRK rearrangement transcripts. We examined thyroid tumors of 40 patients, including 14 papillary carcinomas, 4 follicular carcinomas, 1 Hurthle cell carcinoma, 1 insular carcinoma, and 20 nodular goiters. NF874 NIH3T3, NF723 NIH3T3, NF861 NIH3T3, and NF881 NIH3T3 were used as controls for TRK-T3, TRK-T2, TRK-T1, and TRK, respectively. No known TRK protooncogene rearrangements were detected among the 40 thyroid tumors in our studies.

Like RET, NTRK1 is often activated by rearrangements that involve one of at least five other genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Because of similarities in involvement of the two tyrosine kinases RET (rearranged during transfection) and NTRK1 in the pathogenesis of PTC, the obvious parallels between RET and NTRK1 and between PTC and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), NTRK1 seemed to be an excellent candidate gene to play a role in the genesis of MTC. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of 16 exons of NTRK1, from 31 sporadic MTC, revealed variants in five exons (exons 4 and 14-17). Sequence analysis demonstrated one sequence variant each in exons 4, 14, 16, and 17, and four different variants in exon 15. Differential restriction enzyme digestion specific for each variant confirmed the sequencing results. All variants were also present in the corresponding germline DNA. Interestingly, the sequence variants at codon 604 (c1810C>T) and codon 613 (c1838G>T) ofexon 15 always occurred together and might represent linkage disequilibrium. The frequencies of the sequence variants in germline DNA from patients with sporadic MTC did not differ significantly from those in a race-matched control group. Although we did not find any somatic mutations of NTRK1 in sporadic MTC, the single-strand conformational polymorphism conditions reported here, together with the knowledge of the frequency of various sequence variants, may help in future mutation analyses of DNA from other neural and nonneural tissues.",

One of these rearrangements is a TPM3-NTRK1 fusion already observed in colon cancer, while the second one is a TPR-NTRK1 fusion never described in this type of cancer.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities.

In this study, we analysed mutations of BRAF in a cohort of PTCs.;To screen for BRAF mutations, the genomic DNA of 105 PTCs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers flanking exon 15 and PCR products were directly sequenced with an automatic sequencer. These results, together with data from our previous studies on RAS, RET rearrangements and NTRK1 rearrangements in the same tumours, were compared to determine their individual significance in the pathogenesis of PTCs in Taiwan.;BRAF mutations were detected in 49 of 105 (47%) tumour samples. All mutations involved a thymine-to-adenine transversion at nucleotide 1799 and were heterozygous. There was no overlap between papillary carcinomas harbouring RET rearrangements, NTRK1 rearrangements and BRAF mutations. In this cohort, correlation between BRAF mutations and various clinicopathological parameters in 101 papillary carcinomas did not reveal any association with age at diagnosis, sex, tumour size, histological variants of PTC, multicentricity, cervical lymph node metastases, extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases and clinical stage.;BRAFV600E mutation is the most prevalent oncogene in PTCs in Taiwan. Our data did not suggest that BRAFV600E mutation could be a potentially useful marker of prognosis in patients with papillary carcinomas in the population studied.",

However, the presence of different members of the Trk family of receptors in PNET/ES has not been specified. We have examined whether Trk A, B, and C receptors are specifically expressed in ES both with and without features of neural differentiation. Ten ES tumors (five primary tumors of bone and five extraosseous tumors transplanted into nude mice) were investigated for expression of Trk receptors by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. One primary ES and the five grafted ES tumors exhibited signs of neural differentiation; the remaining four primaries were undifferentiated ES. Other tumor types were analyzed as controls; they included three neuroblastomas (NB), two lymphomas, and single cases of pheochromocytoma (PHEO), schwannoma (SCHW), osteosarcoma, and carcinoma of breast, colon, and kidney. Trk receptors were detected in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections by means of a pan-Trk polyclonal antibody raised against the 14 carboxy-terminal residues of gp140trk, and trk A, B, and C transcripts were specifically detected by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification on cDNAs derived from tumor RNA with MuLV reverse transcriptase. Reactivity to the pan-Trk antibody was exhibited by six ES tumors, the three NBs, and the single PHEO and SCHW cases; immunoreactivity was restricted to differentiated tumors, in the case of ES. Tumor types positive for immunostaining were also distinguished by containing transcripts of TRK genes. However, the trk A, B, and C expression pattern of ES differed from that of NBs, PHEO, and SCHW. Transcripts of trk A, B, and C were detected in seven, four, and one case of ES, respectively, and in five, two, and five cases of NB, PHEO, and SCHW, respectively. Interestingly, all differentiated ES tumors contained trk A transcripts. Tumors of neuroectodermal phenotype and/or derivation were thus characterized by a distinct consensus expression pattern: trk A+/B-/C+ for differentiated ES and trk A+/B-/C+ for NB-PHEO-SCHW. These results indicate that the TRK gene family is frequently activated in ES; they also suggest that Trk A receptor is a feature of ES with neural differentiation, whereas Trk B and C receptors seem to be present in undifferentiated ES.",

Over the past 15 years, the application of molecular technologies to the study of these neoplasms has elucidated critical genetic pathways associated with the development of specific thyroid tumor types. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), genetic events involve RET and TRK (rearrangements) and BRAF and RAS (mutations), although RAS mutations are uncommon except in the follicular variant of PTC. These genetic alterations, which rarely overlap in the same tumor, result in signaling abnormalities in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, genetic alterations in follicular carcinomas include PAX8-PPARgamma translocations and RAS mutations while mutations of CTNNB1 and p53 have been implicated in the development and progression of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas. Germline mutations of RET are responsible for the development of heritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) while somatic mutations of this oncogene are found in a significant proportion of sporadic MTCs. The results of these studies not only have provided additional approaches to thyroid tumor classification, but also have stimulated the development of novel approaches to tumor diagnosis and additional parameters for prognostic assessment and potential biologic therapeutic strategies.",

Because the role of TrkA was not completely elucidated in thyroid cancer ethiopathogenesis, we decided to study the expression of active, phosphorylated TrkA and of its coreceptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR) in a series of 92 PTC (37 lesions of conventional PTC, 28 of follicular variant of PTC [FVPTC], and 27 of other variants of PTC) as well as in 21 samples of normal thyroid and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions used as a controls. We observed neoexpression of p75 NTR in PTC, particularly in conventional PTC and in other variants of PTC displaying a papillary growth pattern, rather than in FVPTC. No immunoexpression of p75 NTR was observed in normal thyroid nor in nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. The cellular localization of p75 NTR immunoexpression was also significantly associated with the growth pattern of PTC, being much more frequently detected in an apical localization in PTC with papillary architecture than in PTC with a follicular or solid growth pattern. This apical localization of p75 NTR was significantly associated with the presence of BRAF V600E. No significant differences were detected between normal thyroid, nonneoplastic lesions, and PTC (or any PTC variant) regarding expression/activation of TrkA, thus suggesting that by itself and in contrast to p75 NTR, TrkA is not altered during PTC development.",

The thyroid TRK oncogenes are activated by recombination with at least three different genes: the gene coding for tropomyosin and TPR, both on chromosome 1,and TFG on chromosome 3.

Structure guided drug design led to the identification of (R)-2-phenylpyrrolidine substituted imidazopyridazines as a series of potent, selective, orally bioavailable pan-TRK inhibitors achieving tumor regression in rats bearing KM12 xenografts. From this work the (R)-2-phenylpyrrolidine has emerged as an ideal moiety to incorporate in bicyclic TRK inhibitors by virtue of its shape complementarity to the hydrophobic pocket of TRKs. ",

However, the presence of mPTC in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter (MNG) and for Graves' disease (GD) has been found to be lower. Patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) association have been published as anecdotal case reports, as well as kindred with familial MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A with some members simultaneously affected by MTC and PTC. We studied the prevalence and the biological behavior of MTC associated with PTC, with particular attention to those cases in which a mPTC was incidentally found. Twenty-seven of 196 (13.8%) MTC cases showed an association with PTC and in particular 21 of 190 (11.05%) with an incidental mPTC. This percentage is higher than that reported in the literature on the association of mPTC with GD (2.8%-4.5%) and MNG (3%). Also the percentage of the more general association of MTC/PTC, not restricted to mPTC, found in our series (13.8%) is higher than that reported in studies that analyzed the prevalence of PTC (any size) in patients treated for MNG (7.5%). A similarly high percentage of MTC/PTC had not been reported before and in particular there are no reports on large series of MTC/PTC. We also analyzed the epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features of MTC associated and not associated with PTC without finding any difference. In particular the outcome of the MTC did not appear to be influenced by the presence of the PTC and the specific radioiodine treatments. Moreover, although we cannot completely exclude a shared pathogenic event as the cause of both MTC and PTC, the molecular analysis of RET gene alterations did not show any common mutation.",

PTC, the most frequent thyroid carcinoma histotype, is associated with gene rearrangements that generate RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes and with BRAF-V600E and RAS gene mutations. These last two genetic lesions are also present in a fraction of PDTCs. The ERK1/2 pathway, downstream of the known oncogenes activated in PTC, has a central role in thyroid carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the BRAF-V600E, RET/PTC, and TRK oncogenes upregulate the ERK1/2 pathway's attenuator cytoplasmic dual-phase phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3 in thyroid cells. We also show DUSP6 overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels in all the analysed PTC cell lines. Furthermore, DUSP6 mRNA was significantly higher in PTC and PDTC in comparison with normal thyroid tissues both in expression profile datasets and in patients' surgical samples analysed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed at the protein level in most PTC and PDTC surgical samples tested, but not in ATC, and revealed a positive correlation trend with ERK1/2 pathway activation. Finally, DUSP6 silencing reduced the neoplastic properties of four PTC cell lines, thus suggesting that DUSP6 may have a pro-tumorigenic role in thyroid carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To date more than twenty five different oncogenes have been identified in human neoplasias. One of these oncogenes is trk, a transforming gene originally isolated from a colon carcinoma biopsy by using gene transfer assays. This oncogene encodes a chimeric molecule that contains the 221 amino terminal residues of a non-muscle tropomyosin followed by the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the trk proto-oncogene product, a tyrosine protein kinase receptor. trk oncogenes have also been identified in a significant fraction of thyroid papillary carcinomas. Some of these trk oncogenes contain sequences derived from genes other than tropomyosin. One such gene is tpr, a gene first identified as a component of the human met oncogene. The trk proto-oncogene, non-muscle tropomyosin and tpr map in the long arm of chromosome 1. Therefore, trk oncogenes are likely to result from internal rearrangements or from unequal cross-overs between two chromosome 1s. Recent studies have demonstrated that the product of the trk proto-oncogene, gp140trk, is the functional receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF elicits the rapid phosphorylation of gp140trk on tyrosine residues. Moreover, addition of NGF to NIH3T3 cells expressing gp140trk induces the transient expression of c-Fos, DNA synthesis and morphologic transformation. Finally, transfection of the trk proto-oncogene into NGF non-responsive PC12 mutant cells restores NGF responsiveness. Two additional genes designated trkB and trkC have recently been isolated in our laboratory. These genes are highly related to the trk proto-oncogene and encode tyrosine protein kinases which serve as functional receptors for the NGF-related neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophic-3 (NT-3), respectively. Whether mutations in these novel members of the trk family of receptor genes are also implicated in human cancer remains to be determined.",

Now it is appreciated that Trks regulate important processes in nonneuronal cells and, in addition to their impact on tumors of neural origin, may contribute to the pathogenesis of carcinomas, myelomas, and prostate and lymphoid tumors. Although mutations and rearrangements of Trk are seen only sporadically in human cancers, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, a number of recent studies indicate that expression of TrkB contributes to tumor pathology. In neuroblastoma, TrkA expression marks good prognosis which TrkB and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression marks poor prognosis. Activation of the BDNF/TrkB signal transduction pathway also stimulates tumor cell survival and angiogenesis and contributes to resistance to cytotoxic drugs and anoikis, enabling cells to acquire many of the characteristic features required for tumorigenesis. Small molecule inhibitors, such as Cephalon's CEP-701, are in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, and a series of AstraZeneca Trk inhibitors are poised to enter the clinic.

        "Doc_abstract":"A combined cytogenetic and molecular analysis of thyroid tumours has indicated that these neoplasms might represent a significant model for analysing human epithelial cell multi-step cancerogenesis. Thyroid tumours comprise a broad spectrum of lesions with different phenotypes and variable biological and clinical behaviour. Molecular analysis has detected specific genetic alterations in these different tumour types. In particular, the well-differentiated carcinomas of the papillary type are characterised by the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) RET and NTRK1 proto-oncogenes. Cytogenetic analysis of these tumours has contributed to defining the chromosomal mechanisms leading to the TKRs' oncogenic activation. The results have shown that, in the majority of the cases, intra-chromosomal inversions of chromosome 10 and of chromosome 1 lead to the formation of RET-derived and NTRK1-derived oncogenes, respectively. Exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with papillary carcinomas, and RET activation has been suggested to be related to this event. All these findings are contributing to the definition of genetic and environmental factors relevant to the pathogenesis of thyroid tumours. Moreover, the molecular characterisation of specific genetic lesions could provide significant information about the association between ionising radiation and RET oncogene activation.",

Over the course of the last seven decades multiple molecular nuclear therapies have been tried to treat the various varieties of thyroid cancer. The sodium iodine symporter (NIS) substrate I-131 is a well known and extremely successful agent to treat DTC, but is not successful in treating other thyroid cancer varieties and some de-differentiated DTC tumors. An alternative to I-131 are radioactively labeled somatostatin analogues, which have predominantly been used to target MTC, but may also be effective in some DTC cases. In experimental preclinical studies the re-induction of NIS expression or transfection with recombinant NIS shows some promise for the treatment of ATC and dedifferentiated DTC. Furthermore, several other potential radioactive NIS substrates are developed.

In a papillary thyroid carcinoma, we identified a novel gene (ELKS), the 5' portion of which is fused to the RET gene by gene rearrangement due to the translocation t(10;12)(q11;p13). Subsequent cloning of the ELKS cDNA revealed that ELKS encodes a novel 948 amino acid peptide and is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues. The presence of multiple coiled-coil domains in the ELKS product suggests that the ELKS protein forms dimers. Since the tyrosine kinase of RET is activated by dimerization that occurs when its ligands bind to the receptor, fusion of RET with the 5' dimerization domains of ELKS would activate its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase constitutively in papillary thyroid carcinomas.",

Recently, we have characterized the novel tumor suppressor gene RASSF1 located in this locus. The RASSF1A isoform is epigenetically inactivated in a variety of human primary tumors. In this study, we investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1 gene in thyroid carcinoma. In nine thyroid cancer cell lines, the RASSF1A promoter CpG island was methylated completely, and expression was absent. Treatment of these cell lines with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was analyzed in 38 primary thyroid tumors, including 1 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 5 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 10 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 9 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC), and 13 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In 71% of thyroid carcinomas, the RASSF1A CpG island was hypermethylated. Methylation frequency was higher in the aggressive forms of thyroid carcinoma and was found in 80% of MTC, in 78% of UTC, and in 70% of FTC, compared with 62% in the more benign PTC. RASSF1A inactivation was detected in all stages of thyroid carcinoma scored by Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification. Additionally, we analyzed the methylation frequency of the CpG island of cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) in the same thyroid tumors. The p16 gene was inactivated in 56 and 25% of cell lines and primary tumors, respectively. p16 methylation was detected in 56% of UTC, 10% of FTC, and 25% of PTC but not in MTC. In UTC, which belongs to the most aggressive carcinomas in humans, the most common combined inactivation of RASSF1A and p16 was detected. In general, 90% of tumors with p16 inactivation were also silenced for RASSF1A expression. However, RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected three times more frequently in thyroid cancers. Thus, RASSF1A inactivation may play a crucial role in the malignancy of thyroid carcinoma.",

Approximately 94% of the malignancies is represented by well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma originating from follicular cells. These neoplasms are divided into two main categories, papillary thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma. Despite their origin from the same type of cells, the two neoplasias show different biological behavior and a different set of genetic features, including specific cytogenetic patterns. Thyroid adenoma is the benign counterpart of follicular carcinoma. No benign counterpart of papillary carcinoma has yet been identified. The chromosomes of thyroid nodules have been investigated since 1965, and different cytogenetic subgroups have been recognized, some of which show structural chromosomal rearrangements. These structural changes lead to the formation of fusion genes RET-PTC, TRK(-T), and BRAF-AKAP9, which originate as a result of intrachromosomal or interchromosomal rearrangements and are found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Fusion genes involving PPARγ are caused mainly by translocations and are characteristic of follicular neoplastic tissue.

Cytogenetic analyses of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a neoplasm which originates from thyrocytes, have revealed that somatic rearrangements of the RET gene are involved in the etiology of a significant proportion of this tumour. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) which arises from neural-crest derived C-cells is the cardinal disease feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome. Recent studies have provided evidence that germline mutations of the RET gene are the underlying genetic events responsible for MEN 2. This review focuses on the role of RET mutations in the pathogenesis of PTC and MTC and summarizes our present knowledge on the consequences of these alterations on the RET tyrosine kinase function. We further describe a transgenic mouse model for hereditary MTC. Mice carrying a MEN 2A allele of RET under the control of the CGRP/calcitonin promoter develop bilateral and multifocal MTC, morphologically and biologically similar to human MTC.",

Pathological diagnoses of 18 patients were confirmed as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) postoperatively. Eight patients were diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the final pathological diagnosis without evidence of minimal foci of MTC or C cell hyperplasia, and they showed elevated CT levels preoperatively.

Extrathyroidal CT-producing diseases were all neglected, and precise pathological examination showed negative evidence of minute MTC or C cell hyperplasia in these 8 patients. Serum CT levels were simultaneously determined by a different CT assay kit using the same blood samples in 7 of 8 patients. Serum CT levels were all within normal values in another CT kit applying a different polyclonal antibody, although elevated CT values continued in the routine CT kit. The recognition of polymeric or fragmented CT by polyclonal antibody was thought to be the causative factor for the hypercalcitoninemia after total thyroidectomy in the patients with PTC. Knowledge of the false positive CT determination makes it important to employ different CT assay kits, especially the new generation of two-site immunoassays using two monoclonal antibodies against distinct epitopes of human CT, although the new generation kits are not clinically available in Japan.",

The incidence, cell origin, histopathology features and prognosis of these two carcinomas are considered completely different. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe clinical, pathologic characteristics and the prevalence of diagnosing such patients in our clinic. Between October 2003 and December 2013, 1.420 consecutive patients diagnosed by histology as having differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and treated with radioactive iodide (RAI) were retrospectively investigated. Of these, 4 patients were diagnosed by histology as having simultaneous MTC and PTC. The clinical and pathology characteristics of these patients are described. The prevalence of simultaneous MTC and PTC of these 4 patients in our clinic was 0.28% of all patients with DTC. The age of the 4 patients ranged from 44 to 63 years and were three females and one male. These patients are currently alive without disease from either of the two types of cancer. In two of these patients, MTC was located in the left and PTC in the right thyroid lobe. One patient had MTC in the right lobe and PTC in both lobes. The remaining patient had both cancers in the left lobe as a mixed tumor. We are able to present the pathology of only 2 of these 4 patients. In these 2 patients MTC was located in the left and PTC in the right thyroid lobe, one of them was female and the other was male, aged 44 and 49, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggested that simultaneous occurrence of MTC and PTC had a prevalence in our clinic of 0.28% among 1420 consecutive patients with DTC or 0.14%, if only the 2 patients in whom we are able to present their pathology slides are considered.

In humans, indirect measurements based on age dependent tumor incidence predict that, on average, the accumulation of 5 to 6 different steps is needed to initiate tumor formation. These mutations do not appear to be random, in that certain neoplasms show prediction for structural aberrations in specific genes. In thyroid tumors, some of gene abnormalities were found. The point mutations of ras oncogenes, predominantly H-ras codon 12, are found in 20-25% of follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas. Recently, the gene rearrangements of the oncogenes trk and ret were identified in the DNA from papillary carcinomas. About 25% of papillary carcinomas contained an introchromosomal (10q) gene rearrangement involving the tyrosine kinase domain of the ret oncogene with an unknown amino-terminal sequence. The mutations of trk and/or ret were not observed in other thyroid neoplastic phenotypes. In medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is a tumor of the parafollicular, calcitonin-secreting C cell of the thyroid, approximately 20% of patients have autosomal dominant inherited forms. Germ line abnormalities on chromosome 10 are linked to at least one type of genetic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MEN type 2a). In the present time, the person who has the abnormality of gene causing MEN type 2a is able to detect by using DNA marker before the onset of tumor.",

To test this hypothesis, we examined thyroid tissue from 27 consecutive autopsy cases for the presence of CCH (defined as >50 C-cells/x100 magnification in three fields) and for AR expression in autopsy cases and in 43 medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs) from patients with sporadic and familial disease as well as two multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A patients with only CCH. CCH was present in 8 of 20 males (40%) and in 1 of 7 females (14%) at autopsy. AR protein was detected in most surgically resected thyroids with MTC and CCH (80%), but in only 25% of autopsy thyroids, probably reflecting postmortem degradation of the receptor protein. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of AR mRNA in MTC and in papillary thyroid carcinomas. These results support the observation that CCH is more common in postmortem thyroids of males and suggest that the presence of AR with higher circulating levels of androgens may contribute to the higher incidence of CCH in men.",

The 111In concentration ratio between tumor (T) and blood (B) in surgically excised lymph node metastases of MTC showed a large variation, with low values for microscopic and high values for macroscopic metastases in individual patients. Three cases of MTC, Hürthle cell adenoma and papillary thyroid cancer are reported with preoperative scintigraphy, T/B ratios and Northern analyses of the surgical biopsies. Visualization of tumors was possible in the absence of sstr2 (the high affinity receptor for octreotide) with the exception of microscopic tumor growth. T/B values in the patient with Hürthle cell adenoma were similar to those found in the contralateral thyroid lobe with goitre. The relatively high uptake of 111In in benign thyroid conditions probably limits the use of octreotide scintigraphy in the diagnosis of primary tumors. The technique has certain advantages over radioiodine scintigraphy after the surgical treatment of thyroid tumors: no need for withdrawal of thyroxin substitution; a possibility to diagnose metastases of tumors that do not concentrate radioiodine (MTC, Hürthle cell cancer); and complementary information about metastatic sites of non-medullary thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular tumors).",

TERT promoter mutations namely C228T and C250T that stimulate TERT transcription and telomerase activation have recently been identified in many human malignancies. We thus determined these mutations and their biological and clinical implications in thyroid carcinomas in the present study. The TERT promoter was sequenced in 10 thyroid cancer cell lines and 144 tumors from 20 patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 51 with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 36 with follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and 37 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We identified C228T or C250T mutation in 6/8 of ATC cell lines, as well as in tumor tissue from 10/20, 13/51, 8/36 and 0/37 patients with ATC, PTC, FTC and MTC, respectively. In PTC patients, these mutations were exclusively present in the group with age >45 years (P<0.0001), and highly correlated shorter telomeres (P<0.0001) and distant metastasis (P=0.028). The previous radioactivity exposure did not induce the mutation. The presence of C228T or C250T was an independent predictor associated with shorter disease-related survival (DRS) in the entire cohort (P<0.0001), as well as among patients >45 years (P=0.021). ATC patients carrying the mutation survived shorter than those without mutations, although not statistically significant (P=0.129). The TERT promoter mutation was associated with overall survival (P=0.038) and DRS (P=0.058) of FTC patients. Taken together, age- and shorter telomere-dependent TERT promoter mutations occur frequently in follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma (ATC, PTC and FTC) but not in parafollicular cell-originated MTC, and may serve as a marker for aggressive disease and poor outcome.

In the present work, we have studied the expression of TTF-1 and Pax-8 and their target genes in samples derived from thyroid neoplasms of follicular origin, as well as in medullary carcinoma (MTC), obtained from surgery or from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. The results show that TTF-1 and Pax-8 are expressed in well differentiated adenomas and that their expression decreases in less differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas and is lost in undifferentiated anaplastic carcinomas. Parallel levels of Tg, TPO and TSH-R expression were found in the same neoplasm samples. Interestingly TSH-R and TTF-1 gene expression was found in MTC samples. Furthermore, the expression of the thyroid-specific genes and their transcription factors is lost in thyroid cells derived from follicular, papillary and anaplastic human carcinomas. In these cells, Tg, TPO and TSH-R promoter activities were absent.

The role of ghrelin and obestatin in the thyroid gland appears very interesting due to their probable involvement in cell proliferation. Furthermore, since the thyroid gland is associated with the maintenance of energy balance, the relationship between ghrelin, obestatin and thyroid function is worthy of consideration. The aim of the study was to assess ghrelin and obestatin immunocytochemical expression in nodular goiter (NG), papillary cancer (PTC) and medullary cancer (MTC).;Analyzed samples included 9 cases of NG, 8 cases of PTC and 11 cases of MTC. The analysis of ghrelin and obestatin expression was performed by use of the immunohistochemical (IHC) EnVision system and evaluated with filter HSV software (quantitative morphometric analysis).;Quantitative ghrelin expression in MTC cells was higher than in NG (p = 0.013) and correlated negatively with the size of the tumor (r= -0.829, p < 0.05). We did not observe any differences in ghrelin expression neither between MTC and PTC nor between NG and PTC. Obestatin immunoexpression pattern in all analyzed specimens was irregular and poorly accented. The strongest immunoreactivity for obestatin was demonstrated in NG. In MTC obestatin expression was significantly weaker than in NG and PTC (p < 0.05 in both cases). In NG the intensity of obestatin immunostaining was significantly higher than that of ghrelin (p = 0.03). Conversely, ghrelin expression in MTC was definitely more evident than obestatin immunoreactivity (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between ghrelin and obestatin expression in PTC. No correlations were detected between reciprocal tissue expressions of ghrelin and obestatin in the analyzed specimens of NG, PTC or MTC.;The differences between ghrelin expression in NG and MTC suggest that ghrelin may be involved in thyroid cell proliferation. The differences between ghrelin and obestatin immunoreactivity in benign and malignant thyroid tumors could support the theory of alternative transcription of the preproghrelin gene and independent production of ghrelin and obestatin.",

The specificity of berberine was demonstrated by using the papillary thyroid carcinoma TPC1 cell line, which lacks the G-quadruplex forming sequence on the RET promoter region due to chromosomal rearrangement.;Berberine suppressed the RET expression by more than 90 % in MTC TT cells at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml with minimal effect on the TPC1 cells. Canadine, which is a structural analogue of berberine, showed little interaction with RET G-quadruplex and also had no effect on RET expression in MTC TT cells. The down-regulation of RET with berberine further inhibited the cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells, which was confirmed by a 2-fold increase in the caspase-3 activity and the down-regulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins.;Our data strongly suggest that the G-quadruplex forming region and the stabilization of this structure play a critical role in mediating the repressive effect of berberine on RET transcription.",

Histologically MTCs from the 10 surviving patients showed a classic type, while the one patient who died had a tubular variant MTC. Immunohistochemically, there were no significant correlations between the outcome of the patients and the expression of calcitonin (CT), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), or chromogranin A (CgA) in the primary tumors, and there were no differences in expression of these antigens between the primary and the recurrent tumors. Although only a small number of patients with MTC were studied here, it was suggested that the prognosis of MTC is worse than that of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma. The patients with lymph node involvement at the time of primary surgery showed a high risk of persistent or recurrent disease. The expressional level for the antigens did not influence the prognosis of MTC.",

Consequently, measurement of calcitonin (CT) levels is generally considered to be more accurate than cytology in diagnosing MTC. Here, we report on a patient with a multinodular goiter and significantly elevated basal CT levels; based on cytology examination and CT immunocytostains, neither MTC nor C-cell hyperplasia was detected upon final histopathological examination. CT testing has a high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value for detecting clinically relevant MTC. Judicious integration of cytological examination with immunocytochemical stains (when needed) may be useful for selecting the most appropriate therapy and avoiding overtreatment (i.e., central neck lymph node dissection in the present case). This case demonstrates that cytological examination with ancillary techniques is still valuable in patients with thyroid nodules and suspicious MTC.",

We recently identified TTF-1 mRNA expression in rat thyroid C cells. The current study was undertaken to elucidate how TTF-1 is expressed in human C cells and medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), and how this expression influences the functions and clinical behavior of these cells. By immunohistochemistry, the nuclei of normal and hyperplastic C cells distinctively reacted with antibody against TTF-1, whereas the immunostaining intensity in C cells was rather weak and heterogeneous in comparison with that in follicular cells. Identical TTF-1 immunoreactivity was observed in all 15 MTC specimens examined. The reaction intensity did not depend on tumor patterns or cell features. In nonisotopic in situ hybridization, an antisense riboprobe clearly hybridized the cytoplasms of C cells and MTC cells, which concurrently showed immunohistochemical positivity for calcitonin. Northern blot analysis indicated a marked hybridization with TTF-1 mRNA of approximately 2.3 kb in an MTC specimen. Furthermore, the presence of TTF-1 mRNA was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the human MTC cell line, TT. Our results suggest that human thyroid C cells and MTC cells express TTF-1 in connection with their functional ability. Therefore, TTF-1 expression can be a functional marker not only for follicular cells and follicular cell tumors but also for C cells and medullary C cell carcinomas.",

Because of the low prevalence of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a few papers analyzed US characteristics associated with this cancer in small series, with controversial results. Aim of this study was to evaluate in MTC the US risk factors of thyroid nodule. In this order, a series of nodules histologically proven as MTC and a group of nodules with histology of papillary cancer (PTC) were retrospectively compared with a control group of benign nodule. Fifty percent MTC were solid hypoechoic and 16% showed microcalcifications with significant difference with respect to the benign group (p<0.05 for both parameters), while no significant difference was recorded regarding margins nor nodular vascularization. The presence of at least one US risk feature was almost equal in MTC (58.3%) and controls (55.5%). On the contrary, at least one US risk factor was significantly (p<0.001) more frequent in PTC than in benign group or MTC series. This study showed low frequency of ultrasound features associated to PTC when analyzed in medullary cancer. Because of the poor literature focusing on this topic, and the herein used design, these data contribute to the knowledge about presentation of MTC at US.

The recent discovery that BSP can be detected in a variety of human cancers, particularly those that metastasize preferentially to the skeleton, shed light on potential new biological functions for this protein. The demonstration of a positive association between BSP expression in primary breast tumors and the development of bone metastases suggests that this glycoprotein could play a role in the selective implantation of breast cancer cells in bone. BSP is also expressed in most lung and prostate cancers as well as in multiple myeloma, three other osteotropic malignancies. Because thyroid carcinoma also metastasizes preferentially to the skeleton, we decided to look at the expression of BSP in a collection of 145 thyroid malignant lesions including 24 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), 55 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 19 medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), 23 anaplastic carcinomas (ACs), and 24 poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDCs). BSP expression was evaluated by immunoperoxidase technique using two specific polyclonal antibodies. Most of the thyroid carcinomas (72%) examined expressed high levels of BSP. Expression of BSP was significantly lower in FTCs and MTCs compared with PDCs, which are more aggressive (p = 0.0009 and 0.0003, respectively). Our study demonstrates for the first time that ectopic BSP expression is a common feature of thyroid cancer. The prognostic value of BSP detection in thyroid adenocarcinoma and the potential role of BSP in the propension of this type of cancer to metastasize to bone are currently under investigation.",

The primary genetic cause of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is germline mutation of the RET protooncogene. Somatic point mutations in RET also occur in sporadic MTC. Although RET mutation is likely sufficient to cause C-cell hyperplasia, the precursor lesion to MTC, tumor progression is thought to be due to clonal expansion caused by the accumulation of somatic events. Using the genome-scanning technique comparative genomic hybridization, we identified chromosomal imbalances that occur in MTC including deletions of chromosomes 1p, 3q26.3-q27, 4, 9q13-q22, 13q, and 22q and amplifications of chromosome 19. These regions house known tumor suppressor genes as well as genes encoding subunits of the multicomponent complex of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptors alpha-2-4) and their ligands glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, persephin, and artemin that facilitate RET dimerization and downstream signaling.

As controls, 40 normal subjects were also studied.;In all patients: (1) measurement of basal serum CT, free T4, total T3, TSH levels and serum TSH-receptor, peroxidase and thyroglobulin (Tg) antibody concentrations, (2) thyroid ultrasonography, (3) fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). In patients with increased basal CT levels: (1) measurement of serum CT levels during pentagastrin test prior to surgery, (2) histological examination and immunostaining with both anti-CT and anti-Tg antibodies of all the nodular thyroid tissue surgically removed, (3) measurement of basal and pentagastrin stimulated serum CT values after surgery.;All the patients with non-nodular thyroid disease had normal basal CT levels. Four patients (0.84%) with nodular thyroid disease (2 with uninodular and 2 with multinodular goitre) had both elevated basal and pentagastrin stimulated CT levels. In the two patients with uninodular goitre, FNAC was suggestive of MTC in 1 (nodular diameter 8.0 cm) and of follicular carcinoma in 1 (nodular diameter 2.5 cm). Histological examination of the nodules confirmed these histotypes. Immunostaining with anti-CT antibodies was positive in the former patient but also in the latter. FNAC was suggestive of benign adenomatous tissues in the two patients with multinodular goitre. Histological examination of all the thyroid nodules confirmed the cytological findings. However, serial sections through the gland in each of these two patients showed an occult follicular carcinoma which had, however, positive staining with anti-CT antibodies. Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Tg antibodies was negative in the patient with MTC but positive in the 3 patients with follicular carcinoma. Finally, both basal and pentagastrin stimulated CT levels remained elevated after total thyroidectomy only in the patient with FNAC suggesting MTC.;This study demonstrates a surprisingly high prevalence of sporadic forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma in patients with nodular thyroid disease. Such forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma seem to be unrelated to iodine intake and may be pure or mixed with a follicular carcinoma. In these mixed thyroid carcinomas, only the neoplastic follicular pattern was seen on both cytological and histological examination. Routine measurements of serum calcitonin levels should therefore be considered an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation of thyroid nodules. Indeed, increasing the accuracy of diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma encourages the surgeon to perform more radical treatment, thus achieving more frequent normalization of post-operative serum calcitonin levels.",

Therefore, controversy exists over the proper extent of thyroidectomy and regional lymph node dissection in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The modest disease-specific mortality makes it unlikely that the extent of surgery will ever be the subject of a prospective randomized trial. Although more extensive cervical surgery may have only a limited effect on the duration of survival in patients with DTC, it may significantly improve quality of life by minimizing cervical recurrence. The high rates of cervical recurrence in patients with DTC and MTC have alerted physicians to the importance of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasonography for the diagnosis, preoperative staging, and follow-up of thyroid cancer. In patients with MTC, death caused by disease is uncommon in the absence of radiographically evident distant metastasis at the time of thyroidectomy. Cervical recurrence is even more common with MTC, and the need for compartment-oriented lymphadenectomy is accepted as standard surgical treatment to minimize disease recurrence. Postoperatively, calcitonin (CT) levels can be used to guide clinical management, but basal CT levels should not be used to direct the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy in affected high-risk patients with familial MTC.",

To date, screening for MTC has been performed using the pentagastrin stimulation test, which is a provocative test for calcitonin release. Germline mutations in the RET protooncogene have been identified in families manifesting these syndromes and genetic screening of individuals at risk of one of these syndromes has become integral to their clinical management. The majority of the mutations associated with MEN 2A and FMTC are tightly clustered in a cysteine-rich region of the RET receptor. A single mutation associated with MEN 2B is in the the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET receptor. Somatic mutations have been identified in the tumor tissue of individuals with sporadic MTC and may prove to be helpful markers in discerning the hereditary or sporadic nature of the MTC. There is general agreement that the primary operation for MTC should include total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node clearance. The role of microdissection for recurrent disease awaits longitudinal evaluation. External radiotherapy, radionuclide therapy, and chemotherapy may have a role in palliation, but have not been proven to have a curative value. Prognostic factors are discussed.",

To determine if TRK-T1 expression can cause thyroid cancer in vivo, we developed transgenic mice that express the human TRK-T1 fusion protein in the thyroid.

This could be also the case for ret but only in radiation-associated tumours;--ras, ret, trk and probably gsp and met: starting from small papillary lesions ('spontaneous' or radiation-induced) and progressing to a clinically evident papillary carcinoma;--the p53 gene playing a role only in the final dedifferentiation process. Simultaneous alteration in the same sample of combinations of ras, gsp, ret, trk and TSHR was found in only a minority of the approximately 150 tumours studied. These data suggest an interchangeable role for these genes in the initiation of 'spontaneous' or radiation-associated epithelial thyroid tumorigenesis. The requirement of one of the genes cited above to interact with other genes must not be neglected. Ras is the most frequently altered gene in 'spontaneous' thyroid tumours and ret in radiation-associated thyroid tumours.",

Approximately 40 percent of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) typically have either intrachromosomal or extrachromosomal rearrangements that join the promoter and NH(2)-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the COOH-terminal fragment of RET. The RET point mutations associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, or the chromosomal breakpoints and translocations associated with PTC, typically activate the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET kinase inhibitors are likely to be beneficial for patients with hereditary MTC, where currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recently, the low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474 was found to block the enzymatic activity of RET-derived oncoproteins in cultured cell lines. We have developed a Drosophila model for MEN2A and MEN2B diseases by targeting oncogenic forms of RET to the developing Drosophila eye. Here we show that, when fed orally, ZD6474 suppressed RET-mediated phenotypes within the context of this in vivo model. Importantly, ZD6474 showed high efficacy and very low toxicity. This compound failed to significantly suppress an activated form of another RTK, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, nor did it suppress the activity of downstream components of the RET/Ras pathway. Our results support the view that targeting chemical kinase inhibitors such as ZD6474 to tissues with oncogenic forms of RET is a useful treatment strategy for RET-dependent carcinomas.",

Since the clinical manifestation of MTC is a thyroid nodule, either single or in the context of a multinodular goitre, the routine measurement of sCT in the evaluation of thyroid nodule(s) facilitates the diagnosis of MTC. sCT measurement is indeed more sensitive than cytology in finding MTC. There are two major benefits from this clinical practice: (a) the surgeon is alerted to the need to perform total thyroidectomy and central compartment lymphadenectomy, which is the minimal surgical treatment for MTC; and (b) the outcome of MTC is favourably affected because it is usually identified at a less advanced stage. However, other non-MTC causes of hypercalcitoninaemia and false sCT positivity do exist and must be recognized. The differential diagnosis is possible using previously validated assays against possible sources of interference, and performing stimulation tests with pentagastrin or, eventually, calcium infusion.",

The postoperative mCT concentration was measured in 214 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (MTC excepted; non-MTC patients) to determine a reference range of mCT in totally thyroidectomized patients. Monomeric CT was also determined with a two-site chemiluminescence immunoassay (Nichols) in 94 healthy subjects and in 68 MTC patients.

Basal and stimulated mCT values were also below the detection limit in 32 of the 68 MTC patients. The biochemical and imaging diagnosis of the latter patients did not give any indication of tumor recurrence. We conclude that completely thyroidectomized patients with non-MTC do not show any measurable mCT concentrations.

Other reported presentations include cystic neck mass, pulmonary mass (es), metastases in the skull or vertebral column.

Histologic variants include encapsulated and partially encapsulated papillary carcinoma, circumscribed microcarcinoma and occult sclerosing carcinoma. Younger age and size less than 10 mm (< 15 mm in other studies) are considered to be favorable prognostic factors. Size alone, however, cannot be regarded as a determinant of prognosis. Older age, larger tumor size, distant metastases, capsular invasion and multifocality indicate unfavorable prognosis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is an infrequent finding, since small deletions may be missed by southern blot analysis. Activation of oncogenes ret and trk have been reported in papillary carcinoma.

The majority of patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma of follicular cell origin are cured with adequate surgical management; however, some thyroid malignancies such as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas frequently metastasize, precluding patients from a curative resection. As such, novel palliative and therapeutic strategies are needed for this patient population. Here, we explore the current management of thyroid carcinoma, including surgical management of the primary tumor, lymph node disease, and locoregional recurrence. Likewise, we explore the application of current molecular techniques, reviewing nearly two decades of data that have begun to elucidate critical genetic pathways and therapeutic drug targets which may be important in specific thyroid tumor types.",

To understand the background of telomerase activation we quantified TERT copy numbers and TERT promoter methylation in 42 MTCs and normal thyroid references. Gain of TERT was demonstrated by quantitative PCR in 5/39 sporadic MTC. Increased methylation index (MetI) for CpG methylation at the TERT promoter was found in sporadic MTCs (P < 0.0001) and in MEN 2 associated MTCs (P = 0.011) vs. normal thyroid tissues. MetI correlated positively with TERT gene expression (r = 0.432, P = 0.006) and negatively with telomere length (r = -0.343, P = 0.032). MTC cases with MetI above the median of 52% had shorter survival as compared to cases with lower MetI (P = 0.005 for overall survival and P = 0.007 for disease-related survival).Protein expression profiles obtained by mass spectrometry were then studied in relation to telomerase activation in MTCs. Comparing protein levels between tumors defined by telomerase activity status, 240 proteins were associated with telomerase activity. Among telomerase activation positive cases a set of proteins was found to discriminate between MTCs with high and low TERT gene expression with enrichment for proteins involved in telomerase regulation. XRCC5 mRNA expression was found increased in MTCs vs. normal thyroid (P = 0.007). In conclusion the findings suggest a role for TERT copy number gain, TERT promoter methylation and XRCC5 expression in telomerase activation and telomere maintenance of MTC. ",

Light microscopy immunohistochemistry was carried out using polyclonal antibodies against Trks, and a monoclonal antibody against p75(LNGFR). General markers for epithelial and endocrine cells were assessed in parallel.;TrkA immunoreactivity (IR) was restricted to the basal epithelial cells in some acini (37%). This pattern remained unchanged or IR extended to the whole acini in BPH, and varied widely in prostate cancer. In normal tissue and BPH, TrkC IR was detected exclusively in the stroma. Nevertheless, it progressively increased in the epithelial cells of well-differentiated to moderately differentiated prostate carcinoma, whereas in stromal cells there were no substantial changes. TrkB IR was absent in all the samples. There was weak p75(LNGFR) IR in normal epithelial cells, which increased in prostate cancer and to a lesser extent in BPH. Androgen suppression was ineffective in reversing TrkA modifications, whereas it caused a decrease in the expression of TrkC and p75(LNGFR).;The abnormal growth of prostatic epithelium is accompanied by increased TrkA expression and the induction of TrkC expression in epithelial cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Since medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was first recognized as a distinct tumor in 1959, it became clear that MTC is more difficult to cure than papillary thyroid cancer and has higher rates of recurrence and mortality. MTC represents 5-8% of thyroid cancers. It derives from parafollicular cells of the ultimobranchial body derived from the neural crest. MTC secretes calcitonin and other hormonal peptides and is considered part of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxilation system. MTC may occur either as a hereditary or nonhereditary entity. Hereditary MTC can occur either alone as the familial MTC or as the thyroid manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN 2A MEN 2B). Activating point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of medullary thyroid cancer, both isolated familial MTC and associated with MEN 2A and 2B. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these are molecular diagnosis with genetic screening and mini-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. The history of thyroid surgery starts with Billroth, Kocher and Halsted, who developed the technique for thyroidectomy between 1873 and 1910. Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene has proven to be highly effective in curing those likely to experience the development of MTC. Video-assisted procedures with central compartment dissection have proved feasible for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene. This paper reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language on surgery of MTC in well-controlled trials. We discuss the particular ethical and legal issues that thyroid prophylactic surgery raises. Searches were last updated in February 2007.",

MTC may occur sporadically or be inherited. Hereditary MTC appears as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2A or 2B, or familial medullary thyroid cancer. Germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause hereditary forms of cancer, whereas somatic mutations can be present in sporadic forms of the disease. The RET gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration, and survival. Nowadays, early diagnosis of MTC followed by total thyroidectomy offers the only possibility of cure. Based on the knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of MTC, new drugs have been developed in an attempt to control metastatic disease. Of these, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent one of the most promising agents for MTC treatment, and clinical trials have shown encouraging results. Hopefully, the cumulative knowledge about the targets of action of these drugs and about the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-associated side effects will help in choosing the best therapeutic approach to enhance their benefits.",

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk proteins both normal and oncogenic is necessary for their binding to Shc. In addition, in cells containing either Ret or Trk oncoproteins, Shc proteins are constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and bound to Grb2. Only in in vitro experiments were Ret and Trk oncoproteins shown to bind the SH2 region of Grb2. Finally, when proto-Trk product is stimulated by NGF, Shc phosphorylation and association with Grb2 are induced.

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine malignancy. Radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer and some inherited conditions are the most important predisposing factors for the development of thyroid cancer. Three mitogenic signalling pathways have been described in the thyroid cell, which are influenced by various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters. Various proto-oncogenes and oncogenes like ras, braf, trk, met and RET also play a role in the signal transduction systems. Two theories have been described in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, the foetal cell carcinogenesis theory and the more common, multistep carcinogenesis theory. The multistep carcinogenesis theory is now the accepted model in many human cancers, including thyroid cancer. The early events of tumour formation are the consequence of activation of either various growth factors or the proto-oncogenes like ras, met or ret. This results in the formation of differentiated thyroid cancers like the papillary, follicular or Hurthle cell cancers. The later stages of tumour formation involve further activation of proto-oncogenes and loss or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes like p53. Based on this theory, follicular carcinomas are generated from follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas from precursor cells generated from thyrocytes. Anaplastic carcinoma may develop from papillary or follicular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. In this review article, we highlight the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumours.",

In the present study, we investigated the frequency of mtDNA mutations in 26 MTC tumour specimens (13 sporadic and 13 familial MTC) and their matched normal tissues by sequencing the entire coding regions of mitochondrial genome. Nonsynonymous mutations were detected in 20 MTC samples (76.9%): nine out of 13 sporadic MTC (69.2%) and 11 out of 13 (84.6%) familial MTC/MEN2. Both transition and transversion types of mutations were found in the samples. Interestingly, 76.2% (16/21) of transversion mutations were found in FMTC/MEN2 patients, whereas 66.7% (12/18) of transition mutations were in sporadic MTC. Synonymous mutations were found in 12 MTC samples. In total, we identified 27 transversion mutations (21 nonsynonymous and six synonymous) in MTC. Of them, 22 (81.5%) were from FMTC/MEN2, and five (18.5%) were from sporadic MTC. The association of transversion mutation with familial MTC/MEN2 was statistically significant (P = 0.0015, binomial test). Majority of the mutations were involved in the genes located in the complex I of the mitochondrial genome, and were often resulting in a change of a moderately or highly conserved amino acid of their corresponding protein. Mitochondrial respiratory function was also compromised in a TT cell line, which carries mtDNA mutation at nt 4917 and 11,720, and in peripheral lymphocytes of MTC patients with mtDNA mutations. These data suggest that mtDNA mutation may be involved in MTC tumourigenesis and progression. Given that mtDNA mutation spectra are different between sporadic and familial MTC, different mechanisms of oxidative DNA damage may occur in the disease process.",

Because of its unprecedented scale and its emotional implications, this finding has raised concern and called the attention of the scientific community to this major health problem. Although epidemiologically documented, a direct correlation between thyroid cancer and radiation exposure has not been definitely proven at the molecular level. On the assumption that ionizing radiation could cause specific and common cancer-associated genetic lesions, an analysis of oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor gene inactivation would help to define radiation-induced thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, we have analyzed by different molecular approaches, including Southern blotting, DNA transfection assay on NIH-3T3 cells, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis, six papillary carcinomas from children living in the region of Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident to identify tumor-specific gene rearrangements of the proto-oncogenes RET and TRK, previously found activated in a tumor type-specific manner in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Using Southern blot analysis in four cases, we could detect specific rearranged bands indicating an oncogenic activation of RET that in three cases resulted in rearranged sequences provided by the same activating gene. Moreover, the DNA of the last three cases showed a biological activity in transforming NIH-3T3 cells after the DNA-mediated transfection assay, and the respective NIH-3T3 transfectants were found to express the oncogenic fusion transcripts. These results support the possibility that RET oncogenic activation could represent a major genetic lesion associated with thyroid carcinoma in children exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident.",

Regional metastases to cervical lymph nodes occur early in the disease, whereas distant metastasis occurs late. Common metastatic sites include the liver, bone, brain, and adrenal medulla. We present a case of MTC metastatic to the breast. We report on this case for the following reasons: (1) metastasis to the breast is an extremely rare occurrence and could be easily confused clinically and pathologically with a primary breast neoplasm and (2) this is the first reported case of detection of breast metastasis by an MTC using FDG ((18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) positron emission tomography with an accompanying histologic description.",

A conditional MTC mouse model was generated and corroborated the role of aberrant Cdk5 activation in MTC. C cell-specific overexpression of p25 caused rapid C cell hyperplasia leading to lethal MTC, which was arrested by repressing p25 overexpression. A comparative phosphoproteomic screen between proliferating and arrested MTC identified the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) as a crucial Cdk5 downstream target. Prevention of Rb phosphorylation at Ser807/Ser811 attenuated MTC proliferation. These findings implicate Cdk5 signaling via Rb as critical to MTC tumorigenesis and progression. ",

Several TK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, but it is unknown which inhibitor is most effective and whether there is any specificity for particular RET mutations.;We aimed to compare the effect of four TK inhibitors (axitinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, and XL184) on cell proliferation, RET expression and autophosphorylation, and ERK activation in cell lines expressing a MEN2A (MTC-TT), a MEN2B (MZ-CRC-1) mutation, and a RET/PTC (TPC-1) rearrangement.;The three cell lines were cultured and treated with the four TK inhibitors. Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined.;XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation.;There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro.

The objective overall response rate was 0%. A stable disease was achieved in 35% (7/20), and progressive disease was found in 65% (13/20). The median time to progression was 8 months, with a median follow-up of 15 months. The treatment was very well tolerated. There were no grade III/IV haematological or renal toxicities.;Targeted radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTATOC is able to stop tumour progression in a small number of patients and therefore may be an alternative treatment option for resistant disease. More significant tumour responses in thyroid and medullary thyroid cancer may be obtained by using radiopeptides with pan-somatostatin characteristics.",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common. New efforts are made to find new more effective and safe compounds and to personalize the therapy in each TC patient. ",

Enlarged lymph nodes were dissected selectively. The main outcome measure was carcinoma-specific survival.;In sporadic MTC, ten-year carcinoma-specific survival was 57.9% (95% CI 39.1%-76.7%) and ten-year survival after reoperation due to lymphatic node recurrence was 51.4% (CI 18.7%-84.2%). The presence of distant metastases at diagnosis (p = 0.0001) and extrathyroidal growth of the primary tumor (p = 0.0008) were independent predictors of carcinoma-specific survival in the Cox model. The risk ratio of sporadic MTC to MTC in MEN2A was 5.40 (CI 0.67-43.2) after adjusting the survival time for the size of the primary tumor.;Distant metastases and the local extrathyroidal extent of the primary tumor have a significant effect on the prognosis of MTC, lymphatic node metastases and other clinical factors being less important.

In a pioneer study carried out in 1991, we demonstrated that routine measurement of serum calcitonin (CT) in nodular thyroid disease allowed the preoperative diagnosis of unsuspected sporadic MTC with better accuracy than routine fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). This finding has been confirmed in subsequent studies. In the present study we report the results of CT screening in 10,864 patients with thyroid nodular disease seen in the years 1991-1998 (group 1). We analyzed the prevalence of MTC and compared their outcomes with those of a historical group of patients (group 2) diagnosed before the introduction of CT screening (1970-1990). The prevalence of MTC found by CT screening in group 1 was 0.40% (44 patients). A positive CT test had a higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared with FNAC. CT screening allowed the diagnosis of MTC at an earlier stage compared with group 2 (P = 0.004). Normalization of serum CT levels (undetectable) after surgery was more frequently observed in group 1. At the end of follow-up, complete remission was observed in 59% of group 1 and in 2.7% of group 2 (P = 0.0001). Our study confirms that MTC is not an infrequent finding among patients with thyroid nodules (nearly 1 in 250 patients). In addition, screening thyroid nodules with serum CT measurement allows the diagnosis and treatment of MTC at an earlier stage, resulting in a better outcome compared with MTC not detected by serum CT measurement. One of the reasons for this finding is that increasing the preoperative diagnostic accuracy of MTC prompts the surgeon to perform a more radical and possibly curative treatment. On this basis, routine measurement of basal serum CT levels should be considered an integral part of the diagnostic evaluation of thyroid nodules.",

MTC can occur sporadically (75%) or as part of inherited cancer syndromes (25%).

A recent study reports that alterations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) D are responsible for familial non-RET CCH. First, we studied SDHD in two families with hereditary non-RET CCH and found no alterations related to the inheritance of this disease. Then, we investigated whether the H50R variant could be a risk factor in the sporadic development of MTC in both Spanish and English patients. We found no evidence that the presence of the H50R is strongly associated with the risk of sporadic MTC, although we did observe an association with age at diagnosis of MTC in Spanish H50R carriers that we did not find in English patients. Finally, we looked for evidence of CCH or any other thyroid disease in a panel of germ-line SDH (B or D) mutation carriers and found none.

The panel included representatives of 44 families carrying FMTC or MEN2, 22 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), and five MTCs without familial information. Mutations in nucleotide sequences encoding one of three specific cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the RET protein were found in 33 of the 34 MEN2A patients and in five of the six FMTC patients examined. A mutation at codon 918, causing the substitution of threonine for methionine in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, was found in germline DNAs of all four patients with MEN2B and in two of the 22 patients with sporadic MTCs; codon 918 was mutated somatically in tumor DNAs from three other sporadic cases. Germline mutations of codon 768, GAG to GAC (Glu to Asp), were detected in one FMTC, in one patient with sporadic MTC, and in one of the patients without familial information. Two somatic mutations, an Asp to Gly substitution at codon 631 and a Cys to Arg substitution at codon 634, had not been reported previously. Of five germline mutations found among the 22 sporadic cases, four were confirmed as de novo mutations since in each case neither parent carried the mutation.

        "Doc_abstract":"The histology and clinical behavior of thyroid cancer are highly diverse. Although most are indolent tumors with a very favorable outcome with the current standard of care therapy, a small subset of tumors may be among the most lethal malignancies known to man. While surgery and radioactive iodine are the standard of care for differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) and are effective in curing a majority of such patients, those with iodine-resistant cancers pose a great challenge for clinicians, as these patients have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has no effective systemic therapy despite the genetic and signaling defects that have been well characterized for the last two decades. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive solid tumors that remains fatal despite conventional multimodality therapy. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of DTC, as well as ATC, has led to the development of targeted therapies aimed at signaling pathways and angiogenesis that are critical to the development and/or progression of such tumors. Development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting known pathogenetic defects in MTC has led to testing of such agents in the clinic. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted over the last 5 years to examine the effects of these targeted molecular therapies on the outcomes of patients with iodine-refractory DTC, MTC and ATC. Conduction of such trials in the last few years represents a major breakthrough in the field of thyroid cancer. Several trials testing targeted therapies offer promise for setting new standards for the future of patients with progressive thyroid cancer. The purpose of this paper is to outline the recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer and to summarize the results of the clinical trials with these targeted therapies.",

We have recently reported a role for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in MTC pathogenesis. We have generated a mouse model, in which MTC proliferation is induced upon conditional overexpression of the CDK5 activator, p25, in C-cells, and arrested by interrupting p25 overexpression. Here, we identify genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in proliferating versus arrested benign mouse MTC. We find that downstream target genes of the tumor suppressor, retinoblastoma protein, including genes encoding cell cycle regulators such as CDKs, cyclins and CDK inhibitors, are significantly upregulated in malignant mouse tumors in a CDK5-dependent manner. Reducing CDK5 activity in human MTC cells down-regulated these cell cycle regulators suggesting that CDK5 activity is critical for cell cycle progression and MTC proliferation. Finally, the same set of cell cycle proteins was consistently overexpressed in human sporadic MTC but not in hereditary MTC. Together these findings suggest that aberrant CDK5 activity precedes cell cycle initiation and thus may function as a tumor-promoting factor facilitating cell cycle protein expression in MTC. Targeting aberrant CDK5 or its downstream effectors may be a strategy to halt MTC tumorigenesis. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are largely divided into medullary (MTC) and non-medullary (NMTC) cancers , depending on the cell type of origin. Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) comprises about 5-15% of NMTC and is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. Non-syndromic FNMTC tends to manifest papillary thyroid carcinoma , usually multifocal and bilateral . Several high-penetrance genes for FNMTC have been identified, but they are often confined to a few or single families, and other susceptibility loci appear to play a small part, conferring only small increments in risk. Familial susceptibility is likely to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. The current focus of research in FNMTC is to characterise the susceptibility genes and their role in carcinogenesis. FNMTC can also occur as a part of multitumour genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis , Cowden's disease , Werner's syndrome and Carney complex . These tend to present at an early age and are multicentric and bilateral with distinct pathology. The clinical evaluation of these patients is similar to that for most patients with a thyroid nodule. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which release calcitonin. The familial form of MTC accounts for 20-25% of cases and presents as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as a pure familial MTC (FMTC). They are caused by germline point mutations in the RET oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2.

Mice models and early evidence obtained in human samples suggest that other genes, including those encoding components of the RB1 (retinoblastoma) and TP53 tumour-suppressor pathways, may be involved in MTC formation. Here, we review the data on the involvement of genes acting in the RET and RB1/TP53 pathways in MTC. Understanding genetic lesions that occur in MTC is a prerequisite to identifying molecular therapeutic targets in MTC and in improving the efficacy of RET-targeted therapies.",

In essentially all of the hereditary cases and approximately 40% of the sporadic cases of MTC, the RET kinase is constitutively activated by mutation. This suggests that RET may be an effective therapeutic target for treatment of MTC. We show that the indolocarbazole derivatives, CEP-701 and CEP-751, inhibit RET in MTC cells. These compounds effectively inhibit RET phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations <100 nM in 0.5% serum and at somewhat higher concentrations in the presence of 16% serum. They also blocked the growth of these MTC cells in culture. CEP-751 and its prodrug, CEP-2563, also inhibited tumor growth in MTC cell xenografts.

Using a murine model of human MTC, we studied the relationships between CT biosynthesis, C cell proliferation, and the circulating CT level during MTC progression. Cell proliferation was revealed by autoradiography of radioactive thymidine incorporation in dividing nuclei, after CT or CT mRNA detection by immunocytochemistry (ICC) or in situ hybridization (ISH). All rat thyroids showed a severe hyperplasia of C cells containing significant amounts of CT and CT mRNA, and a very low mitotic index. Tumours were found in 68% of the thyroids. In the strongly immunoreactive small nodules (ICC+), many labelled nuclei were observed. Subsequently some nodular cells, still containing detectable CT mRNA (ISH+), were not detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC-) owing to a dramatic decrease in secretory granules. Their mitotic index increased, and a rise of the basal CT plasma level was noted. These ISH+, ICC- tumour MTC cells represent a modified aggressive tumour C cell population exhibiting an increased ability to proliferate and were detected by the rise in the basal circulating CT level.",

Lateral neck dissection may be best reserved for patients with positive preoperative imaging. Nevertheless MTC has a high rate of lymph node metastases that are sub optimally detected preoperatively in the central compartment by neck ultrasound or intra-operatively by the surgeon, and reoperation is associated with a higher rate of surgical complications.

Such features suggest the possibility of using specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block the Ret oncoproteins signaling. The present report summarizes the cellular effects of the arylidene 2-indolinone Ret inhibitor RPI-1 (formerly Cpd1) on the human PTC cell line TPC-1 which spontaneously harbors the RET/PTC1 oncogene. The results provide evidence that RPI-1 is able to inhibit cell growth and to interfere with Ret/ptc1-driven signaling.

As part of a cell-surface complex, RET binds glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands in conjunction with GDNF-family alpha co-receptors (GFRalpha). Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes. Also, recently developed molecular therapeutics that target the RET pathway have shown activity in clinical trials of patients with advanced MTC, a disease for which there has been no effective therapy.",

Within two years, 30 (mean age, 60 +/- 14 years) of 667 patients had a pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin level of more than 100 pg/mL. All 30 underwent total thyroidectomy and were tested for germ-line mutations of the ret protooncogene.

Nineteen patients (female/male = 14/5) had MTC, and 11 males but no females had CCH only. Six of 16 patients with sporadic MTC had concomitant CCH.

Peptides possess appropriate properties to serve as tumor-targeting agents. Thus, finding new cancer-selective peptides directing gene transfer to neoplastic cells by reducing transduction of normal cells is a central goal for molecular targeting. We have previously reported identification of a peptide (HTFEPGV) that selectively binds to human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)-derived TT cells in vitro and transplanted tumor xenografts in vivo, using phage display. In the present study, we have performed this approach in primary orthotopically growing murine MTCs of RET-C634R transgenic mice as a clinically relevant model for thyroid cancer by intravenous injection of a complex peptide library. Two rounds of screening on primary tumors yielded multiple copies of a phage that displays a cyclic 7-amino acid peptide, SRESPHP, with a 3000-fold increase in titer between rounds 1 and 2. The selected phage showed highly specific binding to the tumor after systemic administration, whereas binding to other organs such as lung, liver, kidney, and heart was reduced up to 90%. After tail vein injection, homing to the tumor was substantially reduced in the presence of synthetic SRESPHP peptide, indicating that tumor phage interaction strictly depends on the displayed peptide. Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin sections from mouse tissues revealed direct binding of the SRESPHP peptide to MTC tissue. Moreover, this peptide also mediates binding to human MTC cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting abundant expression of its cognate receptor in murine and human medullary thyroid carcinoma. Because the SRESPHP peptide is also efficiently internalized into MTC cells, it likely provides the basis for a new selective therapy of medullary thyroid carcinoma.",

In familial MTC the autosomal dominant type of heredity is involved. This variant is found frequently in association with other endocrine hyperplasias or tumours within the framework of the APUD system and is thus an indispensible condition of the MEN 2 syndrome, either MEN 2A (MTC and pheochromocytoma and/or hyperparathyroidism) or MEN 2B with the frequent concurrent presence of pheochromocytoma and a typical phenotype, in particular multiple neurofibromas on the lips and tongue. The type of MTC determines also to a certain extent the prognosis of the disease. MTC in the framework of MEN 2A are usually most benign, while the prognosis is poorest for MEN 2B. The sporadic variant has a poorer prognosis, as compared with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The only effective and rational treatment of MTC is radical surgery. In all instances where we confirm the diagnosis before surgery we indicate bilateral total thyroidectomy. In the familial variant where the tumour is usually multifocal and in both lobes this indication is absolute, in sporadic forms with possible early intrathyroid dissemination of the primary tumour also to the other side, bilateral surgery is also indicated. Moreover we know that a certain ratio of assumed sporadic forms are genetically conditioned tumours and thus are familial. The histological finding of hyperplasia of the C-cells suggests the familial variant even when tumourous transformation did not occur yet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Doc_abstract":"The study of thyroid tumor genetics has great relevance to surgeons and facilitates understanding tumor pathogenesis, prediction of tumor behavior, and management decisions. The genes implicated can be broadly categorized as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. The RET oncogene has well established roles in the development of both papillary (PTC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening for germline RET mutations in members of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN-II) families is now widely performed, and prophylactic thyroidectomy in gene carriers is advisable at an early age. Patients with apparently sporadic MTC can also be screened to rule out familial disease. The demonstration of a RET rearrangement in a patient's PTC may have prognostic significance, but as yet there are no management implications. The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) and Gsalpha become oncogenic through point mutation and are associated with the development of toxic thyroid adenomas. The ras oncogene is implicated in the early stages of development of several thyroid tumor types. Tumor-suppressor genes also have a role in thyroid tumor formation. The p53 gene appears to be involved in the process of transformation to the anaplastic phenotype and the PTEN gene in the development of follicular adenomas but not carcinomas. There is still limited evidence for the so called adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the thyroid follicular cell. Loss of heterozygosity studies have enabled identification of tumor-suppressor genes, and their findings suggests differences in the pathogenesis of PTCs compared with follicular cancers.

Upon the onset of puberty, the incidence of thyroid cancer increases in females only and declines again after menopause. Estrogen is a potent growth factor both for benign and malignant thyroid cells that may explain the sex difference in the prevalence of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. It exerts its growth-promoting effect through a classical genomic and a non-genomic pathway, mediated via a membrane-bound estrogen receptor. This receptor is linked to the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, these pathways may be activated either by a chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine receptor kinase TRKA, by RET/PTC genes, or by a BRAF mutation and, in addition, in females they may be stimulated by high levels of estrogen. Furthermore, estrogen is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis that are critical for the outcome of thyroid cancer.

Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene plays a crucial role in MTC development. Besides RET, other oncogenes commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers have also been investigated in MTC. The family of human RAS genes includes the highly homologous HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes that encode three distinct proteins. Activating mutations in specific hotspots of the RAS genes are found in about 30% of all human cancers. In thyroid neoplasias, RAS gene point mutations, mainly in NRAS, are detected in benign and malignant tumors arising from the follicular epithelium. However, recent reports have also described RAS mutations in MTC, namely in HRAS and KRAS. Overall, the prevalence of RAS mutations in sporadic MTC varies between 0-43.3%, occurring usually in tumors with WT RET and rarely in those harboring a RET mutation, suggesting that activation of these proto-oncogenes represents alternative genetic events in sporadic MTC tumorigenesis. Thus, the assessment of RAS mutation status can be useful to define therapeutic strategies in RET WT MTC. MTC patients with RAS mutations have an intermediate risk for aggressive cancer, between those with RET mutations in exons 15 and 16, which are associated with the worst prognosis, and cases with other RET mutations, which have the most indolent course of the disease. Recent results from exome sequencing indicate that, besides mutations in RET, HRAS, and KRAS, no other recurrent driver mutations are present in MTC. ",

More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

Her clinical course over that time showed a smoldering pattern in which she was symptom free until presentation even though her serum calcitonin and CEA concentrations were elevated for 17 years, and a small equivocal radiographic lesion in the liver was detected 10 years prior to presentation.

        "Doc_abstract":"The topology and trafficking of receptors play a key role in their signalling capability. Indeed, receptor function is related to the microenvironment inside the cell, where specific signalling molecules are compartmentalized. The response to NGF (nerve growth factor) is strongly dependent on the trafficking of its receptor, TrkA. However, information is still scarce about the role of the cellular localization of the TrkA co-receptor, p75NTR (where NTR is neurotrophin receptor), following stimulation by NGF. It has been shown that these two receptors play a key role in epithelial tissue and in epithelial-derived tumours, where the microenvironment at the plasma membrane is defined by the presence of tight junctions. Indeed, in thyroid carcinomas, rearrangements of TrkA are frequently found, which produce TrkA mutants that are localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. We used a thyroid cellular model in which it was possible to dissect the trafficking of the two NGF receptors upon neurotrophin stimulation. In FRT (Fischer rat thyroid) cells, endogenous TrkA is localized exclusively on the basolateral surface, while transfected p75NTR is selectively distributed on the apical membrane. This cellular system enabled us to selectively stimulate either p75NTR or TrkA and to analyse the role of receptor trafficking in their signalling capability. We found that, after binding to NGF, p75NTR was co-immunoprecipitated with TrkA and was transcytosed at the basolateral membrane. We showed that the TrkA-p75NTR interaction is necessary for this relocation of p75NTR to the basolateral side. Interestingly, TrkA-specific stimulation by basolateral NGF loading also induced the TrkA-p75NTR interaction and subsequent p75NTR transcytosis at the basolateral surface. Moreover, specific stimulation of p75NTR by NGF activated TrkA and the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Our data indicate that TrkA regulates the subcellular localization of p75NTR upon stimulation with neurotrophins, thus affecting the topology of the signal transduction molecules, driving the activation of a specific signal transduction pathway.",

Therefore, in a practical setting, it is difficult to diagnose whether synchronous nodules in both lung and thyroid are independent or have metastasized from one to the other. In the present study, we report a treatment approach in a patient with such nodules, using a molecular technique. A 68-year-old woman presented with synchronous solitary thyroid mass and a nodular lesion in the right lung. Both tumors, which were surgically resected, morphologically showed neuroendocrine differentiation, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. These features required differential diagnosis from possible (1) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with metastasis to the lung, (2) pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastasis to the thyroid, and (3) independent MTC and pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. Identical mutations of the p53 gene were detected in both the thyroid and lung tumors, indicating the same origin for both tumors. In addition, these mutations and a lack of calcitonin expression suggested a pulmonary origin of the tumors. Metastatic thyroid cancers are well known to cause miliary lesions in the lung, while lung cancers can metastasize to various tissues. Furthermore, pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma has been reported as having a tendency of metastasizing to the thyroid. Head and neck surgeons should be aware that a particular subset of lung cancers may develop a metastatic solitary nodule in the thyroid, as presented.

In this paper, we describe a rare Japanese kindred with familial non-MEN MTC, confirming the existence of this distinct clinical entity in Japan. A 42-year-old woman underwent a left hemithyroidectomy with modified neck dissection (MND) under a diagnosis of sporadic MTC at 28 years of age. She developed lymph node metastasis in the right neck region 7 years after the initial surgery, and underwent MND and right hemithyroidectomy.

Hereditary MTC was strongly suspected, but we could not confirm specific manifestations associated with MEN type 2 in any family members. However, 7 years later, a paternal aunt and cousin were diagnosed with MTC. Other family members were evaluated by ultrasonography and calcium-pentagastrin provocation testing, and three additional patients with MTC across two generations were found.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the signal transduction leading to Erk activation in PTC cells. In normal thyroid cells, CaMKII and Erk were in the inactive form in the absence of stimulation. In primary PTC cultures and in PTC cell lines harboring the oncogenes RET/PTC-1 or BRaf(V600E), CaMKII was active also in the absence of any stimulation. Inhibition of calmodulin or phospholipase C (PLC) attenuated the level of CaMKII activation. Expression of recombinant RET/PTC-3, BRaf(V600E), or Ras(V12) induced CaMKII activation. Inhibition of CaMKII attenuated Erk activation and DNA synthesis in thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC-1), a cell line harboring RET/PTC-1, suggesting that CaMKII is a component of the Erk signal cascade in this cell line. In conclusion, PTCs contain an active PLC/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signal inducing constitutive activation of CaMKII. This kinase is activated by BRaf(V600E), oncogenic Ras, and by RET/PTC. CaMKII participates to the activation of the Erk pathway by oncogenic Ras and RET/PTC and contributes to their signal output, thus modulating tumor cell proliferation.",

Neck nodal metastases were noted in 7 cases and all occurred in tumors larger than 3 cm. All cases received operation according to clinical stage. Six of 7 patients who had preoperative calcitonin data showed abnormal high values. After operation, there were 8 patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia.

We have illustrated two cases where serum calcitonin was used in the evaluation of thyroid nodule and rates proved to be high. A stimulation test was performed, using calcium as secretagogue, and calcitonin hyper-stimulation was confirmed, but anatomopathologic examination did not evidence medullar neoplasia. Anatomopathologic diagnosis detected Hashimoto thyroiditis in one case and adenomatous goiter plus an occult papillary thyroid carcinoma in the other one. Recommendation for routine use of serum calcitonin in the initial diagnostic evaluation of a thyroid nodule, followed by a confirming stimulation test if basal serum calcitonin is showed to be high, is the most currently recommended approach, but questions concerning cost-benefit and possibility of diagnosis error make the validity of this recommendation discussible.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6 rearrangement was performed in three, and the next-generation sequencing assay MSK-IMPACT™ (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) was performed in two cases. Primary MASC of the thyroid occurred in two women and one man, age 47-72 years. All patients presented with high T stage, infiltrative, locally aggressive tumors with extrathyroidal extension. Two cases were associated with well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. Histologically, they appeared as low-grade tumors, resembling MASC of the salivary glands and labeled positive for mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, p63, weakly positive for PAX8, and negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed ETV6 rearrangement in all cases. In two tested cases MSK-IMPACT™ confirmed the presence of ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. Two patients had at least two local recurrences, one was alive with disease, and one was alive and free of disease after 14 and 17 years, respectively. The third patient was alive and free of disease after 2 years. MASC of the thyroid is histologically, immunophenotypically, and genetically similar to its salivary gland counterpart. Thyroid MASC can be associated with a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma component, supporting follicular cell origin. Clinically, these carcinomas may show frequent recurrences but are associated with long-term survival. Patients with MASC of the thyroid may potentially benefit from Trk molecular-targeted therapy.

The therapy for sporadic or hereditary MTC is surgical resection and consists in total thyroidectomy associated with central compartment lymph nodal dissection; the radicality of this intervention is fundamental to obtain a definitive cure. Genetic screening in children of parents with MEN2 or FMTC has led to prophylactic total thyroidectomy. The type of prophylactic surgery required is focus of great attention, and it is reported that total thyroidectomy, central neck dissection associated with parathyroid autotransplantation is the proper management.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an uncommon thyroid tumor that has attracted a great deal of interest because of its frequent presentation as a familial tumor and its primary involvement in the type II multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN-IIA and MEN-IIB and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). The MTC tumor cells secrete the polypeptide hormone calcitonin, which serves as an excellent tumor marker, useful for defining the presence of disease, preoperatively or following thyroidectomy. The discovery that mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with MEN-II syndromes was highly significant in that it demonstrated a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype; and most importantly it provided a mechanism whereby family members at risk could be identified by direct DNA analysis. Virtually all patients with MEN-IIA, MEN-IIB, and FMTC develop MTC; therefore there is a clear rationale for performing thyroidectomy as soon as a RET mutation has been identified. Because MTC appears to be much more aggressive in patients with MEN-IIB, thyroidectomy is performed during the first year of life in this setting, whereas in patients with MEN-IIA, where the tumor appears to be more indolent, the procedure can be safety delayed until age 5 years. Reoperative neck exploration in patients with evidence of persistent or recurrent MTC has been effective in a significant number of patients, although the success of the operation requires careful patient selection and preoperative assessment. MTC, as expressed in the MEN-II syndromes, is an excellent model to evaluate the usefulness of interventional therapy in patients demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition for cancer.",

In the tested patients, there was neither a physiological (C cell) nor a pathological (MTC cell) secretion of monomeric CT.;A relevant ectopic monomeric CT production could be excluded because the patients were without detectable CT concentration. For this reason, postoperative CT concentrations of the monomeric form in MTC patients can be traced either to remaining C cells or to tumor cells.

Recently, germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been found in patients with these syndromes. Thus, with direct DNA testing, kindred members with MEN 2A, MEN 2B, or FMTC can be identified before clinical of biochemical evidence of MTC develops. It has been hypothesized that prophylactic thyroidectomy early in childhood, based on a positive genetic test, produces a better clinical outcome than thyroidectomy at the time MTC is diagnosed either clinically or biochemically. In the present report, the Washington University experience with MTC in children with MEN 2A and 2B is reviewed. Sixteen patients with MEN 2A who had thyroidectomy based on the biochemical diagnosis of MTC are compared with 14 children with MEN 2A who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy based on direct genetic testing. In addition, the clinical results of 11 patients with MEN 2B treated for MTC are reviewed. After 3 years of follow-up there has been no biochemical or clinical evidence of MTC among the 14 children who had prophylactic thyroidectomy. Among the 16 children with MEN 2A who had thyroidectomy because of elevated basal of stimulated calcitonin levels, four (25%) have persistent of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years. Of the 11 patients with MEN 2B who underwent thyroidectomy during childhood, one has died and seven (70%) of the remaining patients have recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up period of 11 years. The authors conclude that a significant number of children with MEN 2A or MEN 2B, who have clinical of biochemical evidence of MTC before thyroidectomy, have persistent or recurrent disease after long-term clinical follow-up. The diagnosis by direct DNA testing in patients with these syndromes allows prophylactic thyroidectomy before the development of extensive local or metastatic MTC.",

Likewise, calcitonin and CEA have a similar, homogeneous distribution among cells in gross medullary carcinoma confined to the thyroid region. In both primary and metastatic tumors from patients with virulent, disseminated disease there is an inverse relationship between calcitonin and CEA distribution such that CEA expression is retained and frequently present in the greatest amounts in cells which have poor or absent staining for calcitonin, and present in the least amounts where cellular staining for calcitonin is greatest.

Systematic measurement of thyrocalcitonin (CT) levels in thyroid nodules allows for early diagnosis of MTC. As central neck dissection (CND) is associated with high morbidity, the aim of this study was to investigate the necessity of this procedure in the treatment of sporadic medullary thyroid microcarcinoma (S-mMTC).;Prospective multicentric study including 43 patients with sporadic micro-MTC who underwent CND between January 1991 and August 2001.;26 women and 17 men with sporadic micro-MTC, aged 28-87 (mean age was 58 years), without family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, underwent surgery. Total thyroidectomy was performed in all patients and combined with 'picking' (n=7) or CND (n=36). Size of tumours ranged from 0.2 to 9mm (mean size was 4.1mm). Solitary (32/43 patients) and multiple S-mMTC lesions (11/43 patients) were seen. 601 lymph nodes from the 41 subclinical patients were analysed. Mean follow-up period for these patients was 32 months. No mutations in the RET oncogene were seen.;As lymph node involvement is uncommon in S-mMTC, systematic CND is of questionable value.",

Statistical tests were used to evaluate the relationship of OPN expression and the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of patients and tumours.;OPN expression was detected in 91 of 116 (78.4%) of the MTC. We also observed high OPN expression in C-cell hyperplasia as well as in C-cells scattered in the thyroid parenchyma adjacent to the tumours. OPN expression was significantly associated with smaller tumour size, PTEN nuclear expression and RAS status, and suggestively associated with non-invasive tumours. OPNa isoform was expressed significantly at higher levels in tumours than in non-tumour samples. OPNb and OPNc presented similar levels of expression in all samples. Furthermore, OPNa isoform overexpression was significantly associated with reduced growth and viability in the MTC-derived cell line (TT).;The expression of OPN in normal C-cells and C-cell hyperplasia suggests that OPN is a differentiation marker of C-cells, rather than a marker of biological aggressiveness in this setting.

MTC can metastasize to lymph nodes, trachea and distant organs, such as brain, lungs, liver and bones. MTC cells are resistant to chemotherapy and traditional external therapies are not showing definite clinical benefits. Scientists are trying to understand the molecular background of carcinogenesis and histone deacetylase (HDAC) seems to play a potential role to gene transcription. On the other hand, HDAC inhibitors (HDACI) hamper the HDAC action giving promising results as new anticancer drugs. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the current status of research considering the role of HDACIs in MTC treatment and to present the latest trends in MTC treatment protocols.;This literature review was accomplished using the MEDLINE database. The key words/phrases were; HDACI, medullary thyroid cancer, HDACI in the therapy of neuroendocrine tumors, HDACI in MTC. Forty-one articles were selected from the total number of the search's results. Only sixteen papers focus on the use of HDACIs in the treatment of MTC. In order to extract our conclusions, we took into account some studies whose main topic does not strictly refer to the MTC but they contain noteworthy and useful information. Only English articles published up to August 2016 were assessed and used for writing this review.;Molecules, such as valproid acid (VPA), vorinostat, suberoyl bis-hydroxamic acid (SBHA), depsipeptide, belinostat, m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamine (CBHA) and AB3 have shown promising antitumor effects against MTC.;HDACIs represent a promising field for targeted therapy both for its anticancer properties, as well as for augmenting radiotherapeutic modalities.

We divided patients into four groups: proven MTC (group 1, n = 93), pathologically proven non-MTC after surgery (group 2, n = 57), benign single nodule by cytology (group 3, n = 68) and patients without nodules on US (group 4, n = 24).;Basal serum CT levels were evaluated.;The median CT level of group 1 (119·5 pmol/l) was significantly higher than those of other groups (4·0, 3·8 and 3·8 pmol/l, P < 0·001). When we adopted 19·0 pmol/l of CT level as a cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 77·4%, 98·7%, 97·3% and 87·8%, respectively. When we compared 29·2 pmol/l (100 pg/ml) and 19·0 pmol/l (65 pg/ml) as cut-off values, 19·0 pmol/l was more sensitive and accurate than 29·2 pmol/l. Factors associated with hypercalcitoninemia in non-MTC groups were autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic kidney disease, proton pump inhibitors and other malignancies. Serum CT levels tended to decrease spontaneously in non-MTC groups.;Basal serum CT levels higher than 19·0 pmol/l can be a useful cut-off value for detecting macroscopic MTC, even though values below 19·0 pmol/l cannot exclude the presence of MTC like small volume MTC or premalignant C-cell hyperplasia.",

Interestingly 16.2% of the study patients had a decrease in Tg levels over time, giving negative values in Tg-DT. These patients had an excellent outcome. However, most of the patients did not receive ablation with radioactive iodine. Therefore, whether the Tg in these patients was derived from persistent disease or residual thyroid tissue could not be concluded. To resolve this question, we measured serum Tg levels in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) who underwent total thyroidectomy using similar surgical techniques for the treatment of PTC.;Twenty-seven consecutive patients with MTC who underwent total thyroidectomy were selected. Of them, five patients with antibodies to Tg were excluded from the study. In the remaining 22 patients, serum Tg levels were measured before and after surgery. None of the patients received radioactive iodine ablation. They were prescribed levothyroxine as a replacement for the lost thyroid function.;Serum Tg levels were detectable preoperatively, while postoperative serum Tg levels were lower than the detectable level, 0.5 ng/mL, in all 22 patients.;The results indicate that most of the patients with detectable Tg levels and negative Tg-DT values after total thyroidectomy for PTC in our previous study had persistent disease, and that their serum Tg was not from residual thyroid tissue, suggesting that up to 50% of patients with persistent PTC have a decrease in serum Tg levels in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone-suppressive therapy.",

The most important finding was the difference in method of detection of MTC between the two surveys.

Cronic diseases such as diverse cancers may be associated with cachexia, especially at advanced stage. Cancer-induced cachexia is associated with diminished quality of life, functional performance, reduced response to antitumor therapy, and increased morbidity and mortality. Myostatin (Mst) is one of the outstanding molecules in the skeletal muscle loss process in cancer and it may be released by both skeletal muscle and cachexia-inducing tumors. Recently changes in serum levels of Mst have been identified as an important factor of cancer-induced cachexia. The goal of this study was to assessserum Mst levels in MTC patients. In this descriptive and case-control study, 90 participants were selected, comprising 45 MTC patients (20 males, 29±13.9 years, 25 females, 29±14.5 years) and 45 control individuals (25 males, 23.1±11.6 years, 20 females, 31.5±14.4 years). Serum Mst was determined using an ELISA kit and body mass index (BMI) was calculated by weight and height measurements. The Kolmogorov Simonov test showed a normal distribution for log transformed Mst serum levels in both case and control groups. Geometric means were 5.9 and 8.2 ng/ml respectively, and a significant difference was found according to the independent t-test results (P<0.01) . There was also a significant difference mean of Mst between females in control and MTC groups, but not for the males. Pearson correlation test showed no correlation between age and BMI with Mst serum levels. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that Mst serum levels may have a potential ability for early diagnosis of cachexia in MTC patients, especially in females. ",

However, external radiation therapy (RT) plays an important part in well-defined patients. Out of the 115 patients with MTC treated at the Institute Gustave Roussy: Thirty-five MTC patients with residual cervical disease and without distant metastases had their thyroid region irradiated (60Co, 45 to 50 Gy in 5 weeks). The overall survival of these patients is similar to that of patients with limited cervical extension (n = 57) treated by surgery alone. The results of this study show the effectiveness of cervico-mediastinal irradiation treatment for MTC with extensive local tumor after incomplete surgery. Eight MTCs with inoperable cervical tumor were treated only by external RT. Median survival was 44 months. In six of them, long-term local control was observed: three are alive at 52, 62 and 70 months and 3 died from distant metastases at 36, 36, and 117 months after treatment. Sixteen MTCs with distant metastases were treated with RT on bone metastases (n = 10) or compressive lymph node metastases (n = 6) with good palliative effect. This study shows the efficacy of post-operative external RT in MTCs with extensive cervical tumors, as a curative treatment in non-surgically eradicable cervical tumors and as a palliative treatment for metastatic localisations. The technique of cervico-mediastinal RT is discussed.",

Our aim was to determine factors that predict outcome in patients with MTC.;We reviewed the records of all patients with MTC (n=56) who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1990 and December 2000. Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinicopathologic predictors of MTC outcome were performed to identify subsets of patients with different probabilities in terms of overall survival, local recurrence, and distant metastases.;Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a statistically significant decrease in overall survival is associated with T4b tumours (p=0.06), the presence of distant metastases at the time of presentation (p=0.033), lymphatic invasion (p=0.099), and postoperative treatment (p=0.045).;The analysis of survival curves of patients with MTC shows that the occurrence of locoregional and distant metastases occurs preferentially within the first 5 years, which identifies this as a crucial period for follow-up. In this series of patients with MTC, the tumours classified as T4b, metastases at presentation, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and postoperative treatment were the most important prognostic features. At present, there is no available beneficial adjuvant therapy. However, as the development of molecular therapy progresses, it should be tested in clinical trials with the purpose of achievement of novel targeted therapies for selected MTC patients with risk factors.",

Recently, we have identified somatic inactivating mutations in the cell cycle inhibitor gene P18 in human MTC, which coincided with activating RET mutations, suggesting a role for loss of P18 in combination with oncogenic RET in the multistep process of MTC development. Therefore, we crossed transgenic mice expressing oncogenic RET (RET2B) with mice lacking p18 (and p27, another cell cycle inhibitor) and monitored MTC development. RET2B;p18(+/-) mice and RET2B;p18(-/-) mice developed MTC with a highly increased incidence compared with their corresponding single mutant littermates. In addition, expression of oncogenic RET causes an earlier age of onset and larger MTCs in p18(-/-);p27(+/-) mice. In a subset of MTCs of RET2B;p18(+/-)(;p27(+/-)) mice, p18(Ink4c) expression was completely lost. This loss of p18(Ink4c) expression correlated with higher proliferation rates as well as with larger MTCs, indicating that loss of p18 in combination with oncogenic RET not only increases the risk for MTC development but also enhances MTC progression. Our data strongly indicate that oncogenic RET and loss of p18 cooperate in the multistep tumorigenesis of MTC.",

In cases of localized neck disease, surgery can be curative. However, once MTC has spread beyond the neck, systemic therapy may be necessary.

Radiation exposure has been strongly implicated as an aetiological factor. The greatest risk occurs with acute exposure to X and/or gamma rays, with a linear dose response curve, while the risk is inversely related to age at exposure with a latent period of 5-20 years. Together with irradiation, other factors (iodine, alcohol and calcium diet intake, hyperthyroidism, Hashi-moto's thyroiditis, Gardner syndrome, Cowden syndrome, pharmaceutical agents, hormonal factors, occupational exposure, activation of cellular oncogenes) have been associated with the risk of thyroid cancer. In prevention a policy should include regulations and methods for avoiding radiation exposure of the thyroid and for preventing nutritional deficiency and excess of iodine. Besides, early and continuous suppressive therapy of all patients affected by non-toxic goiter or treated previously with thyroidectomy, and a screening of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) using pentagastrin stimulation test and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, in subjects with a familial history of MTC, are of paramount importance to prevent thyroid cancer.",

A high prevalence of RET gene rearrangements (62.3%) with a significant predominance of ELE1/RET (PTC3) over H4/RET (PTC1) rearrangements was found in PTCs of the first post-Chernobyl decade. NTRK1 rearrangements were rare (3.3%). In 3.3%, we observed novel types of RET rearrangements: GOLGA5/ RET (PTC5), HTIF/RET (PTC6), RFG7/RET (PTC7), and an as yet undefined RFGX/RET.RET rearrangements, preferentially ELE1/RET, are related to rapid tumor development. At longer intervals after exposure to ionizing radiation, the prevalence of RET rearrangements declines with a shift from ELE1/RET to H4/RET, most significantly in female patients. The prevalence of specific types of rearrangements is independent of age at irradiation. A significantly higher prevalence of ELE1/RET was observed in the most heavily contaminated Oblasts, Gomel and Brest, suggesting a preferential formation of this type of rearrangement after high thyroid doses. RET rearrangement is related to aggressive growth: Rearrangement-positive PTCs were in a more advanced pT category and more frequently in the pN1 category at presentation than rearrangement-negative PTCs. ELE1/RET is related to the solid variant of PTC, H4/RET more frequently to typical papillary structures. The genotype/phenotype evaluation of post-Chernobyl PTCs reveals a characteristic spectrum of gene rearrangements that lead to typical phenotypes with important biological and clinical implications.",

MTC is inherited in 25% of cases, with an autosomal dominant transmission, age-related penetrance and variable expressivity. MTC is an obligatory component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), which comprises three well defined syndromes: MEN2A, which may be associated with pheochromocytoma and/or hyperparathyroidism; the much rarer MEN2B, which occurs early and is accompanied by developmental abnormalities; while in contrast, familial MTC (FMTC) is not associated with any endocrinopathy. The RET proto-oncogene is the causative gene of the MEN2 syndromes and mutations in this gene are found in >90% of inherited cases, allowing easier and more reliable family screening than pentagastrin stimulation tests. Nevertheless, the correlation between the genotype and the different clinical phenotypes is not perfect. The prognosis of MTC depends on its staging at presentation, and the early appearance of cervical lymph node metastases emphasizes the need for extensive surgery, although many patients still do not normalize calcitonin levels post-operatively, and they remain a challenge for the further management.",

Further, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) inhibitory agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib that are already approved in the United States for use in advanced renal cell carcinoma have shown high response rates in treating advanced DTCs in multiple phase II trials, and have become commonly used in progressive radioiodine-refractory metastatic DTC. Yet additional agents are now in development, with several including XL184 (cabozantinib) also showing promise in DTC and MTC. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), progress has been slower, with the greatest apparent gains resulting more from the application of systemic therapies earlier in the disease course, especially when used in conjunction with initial surgical and radiation therapies.

Knowledge of these features is the basis of the surgical concept of one or two-stage thyroidectomy, the exceptions and the concept of locoregional lymph node dissection. Lymph node surgery plays an important role in those cancers exhibiting mainly lymph node metastases (PTC, MTC) not only due to frequent recurrences but also due to its potential curative intent. Differentiated carcinomas may have an acceptable prognosis despite local invasion of the cervical aerodigestive system, thus resections are justified when technical prerequisites are given.",

The most problematic differential diagnosis is with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor showing cytological and histological features similar to those of a lung carcinoid.;We report a case of thyroid metastases from a typical carcinoid of the lung. The thyroid tumors were diagnosed in a 37-year-old woman known to have a lung nodule radiologically identified 8 years earlier, for which neither cytological nor histological analyses were performed. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid nodule suggested a neuroendocrine tumor, possibly a MTC. However, the lack of both elevated calcitonin (CT) blood level and CT immunoreactivity in cytological smears ruled out the diagnosis of MTC in favor of a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. Octreoscan demonstrated the neuroendocrine nature of the known lung neoplasm and the patient underwent right lung lobectomy together with total thyroidectomy. Histology examination confirmed the diagnosis of thyroid metastases from typical carcinoid of the lung.

The course of MTC is indolent, and survival rates depend on the tumor stage at diagnosis. The present article describes clinical evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MTC.;The aim of the consensus described herein, which was elaborated by Brazilian experts and sponsored by the Thyroid Department of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, was to discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of individuals with MTC in accordance with the latest evidence reported in the literature.;After clinical questions were elaborated, the available literature was initially surveyed for evidence in the MedLine-PubMed database, followed by the Embase and Scientific Electronic Library Online/Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature (SciELO/Lilacs) databases. The strength of evidence was assessed according to the Oxford classification of evidence levels, which is based on study design, and the best evidence available for each question was selected.;Eleven questions corresponded to MTC diagnosis, 8 corresponded to its surgical treatment, and 13 corresponded to follow-up, for a total of 32 recommendations. The present article discusses the clinical and molecular diagnosis, initial surgical treatment, and postoperative management of MTC, as well as the therapeutic options for metastatic disease.;MTC should be suspected in individuals who present with thyroid nodules and family histories of MTC, associations with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism, and/or typical phenotypic characteristics such as ganglioneuromatosis and Marfanoid habitus. Fine-needle nodule aspiration, serum calcitonin measurements, and anatomical-pathological examinations are useful for diagnostic confirmation. Surgery represents the only curative therapeutic strategy. The therapeutic options for metastatic disease remain limited and are restricted to disease control. Judicious postoperative assessments that focus on the identification of residual or recurrent disease are of paramount importance when defining the follow-up and later therapeutic management strategies.",

In this case, several factors influence the frequency and the type of RET/PTC, such as exposure to radiation, age and histological variant of the papillary tumor. On the other hand, the presence of the mutation does not seem to influence the biological behavior of the tumor or its response to conventional treatment modalities. In the setting of medullary thyroid cancer, germline RET point-mutations are implicated in the pathogenesis of virtually all hereditary forms and somatic point-mutations in nearly half of the sporadic forms. The clinical impact of this finding is that family members at-risk of hereditary MTC may be screened by genetic analysis, to distinguish those carrying or not-carrying the mutation. The last can be reassured on their status and relieved from further follow-up. Those with the mutation may be treated at a pre-clinical stage of the disease or even before the disease is started.

It has been claimed that RAS, p53 or GSP mutations and RET or TRK rearrangements might play a role in adult thyroid tumors. In childhood, the thyroid gland is particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation. The reactor accident in Chernobyl provided a unique chance to study molecular genetic aberrations in a cohort of children who developed papillary thyroid carcinomas after a short latency time after exposure to high doses of radioactive iodine isotopes. According to the concepts of molecular genetic epidemiology, exposure to a specific type of irradiation might result in a typical molecular lesion. Childhood papillary thyroid tumors after Chernobyl exhibit a high prevalence of RET rearrangement as almost the only molecular alteration. The majority showed RET/PTC3 (i.e., ELE/RET rearrangements), including several subtypes. Less frequently, RET/PTC1 (i.e., H4/RET rearrangements), and a novel type (RET/PTC5, i.e., RFG5/RET) were observed. Proof of reciprocal transcripts suggests that a balanced intrachromosomal inversion leads to this rearrangement. Breakpoint analyses revealed short homologous nucleotide stretches at the fusion points. In all types of rearrangement, the RET tyrosine kinase domain becomes controlled by 5' fused regulatory sequences of ubiquitously expressed genes that display coiled-coil regions with dimerization potential. Oncogenic activation of RET is apparently due to ligand-independent constitutive ectopic RET tyrosine kinase activity. The analysis of this cohort of children with radiation-induced thyroid tumors after Chernobyl provides insights into typical molecular aberrations in relation to a specific mode of environmental exposure and may serve as a paradigm for molecular genetic epidemiology.",

A 1-cm tumor was detected in the right lobe of the thyroid. Based on the clinical diagnosis of MTC, we performed a total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy of the central and right lateral compartments. Paraffin sections of the resected specimen were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemically characterized using antibodies to CT, CEA, chromogranin A, thyroglobulin, synaptophysin, sustentacular cells (SCs), low- and high-molecular cytokeratins (CK 5/6, 7, 18, 20), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), bcl-2, Melan A, C-kit, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and galectin-3. The patient's blood and tumor tissue were examined for mutations in the RET-protooncogene.;H&E staining of both frozen and permanent sections was unable to differentiate benign from malignant tissue. Typical morphologic characteristics for MTC were completely absent. Only the additional finding of positivity for synaptophysin and numerous SC cells visible in-between neoplastic cells made the diagnosis of paraganglioma-like MTC possible. Sequencing of the RET proto-oncogene revealed no mutations.;There are subgroups of MTC that present clinically similar to classic MTC, but in which missing typical morphologic characteristics make histopathology diagnosis difficult. In these cases, diagnosis, operative decisions, and follow-up strategies should be based on preoperative biochemical markers, imaging findings, and clinical parameters in accordance to the guidelines for classic MTC.",

This report presents a 25-year review of 22 children with MEN-2A, with a mean follow-up of 12.5 years.;All 22 children underwent a total thyroidectomy, and four (18%) were rendered permanently hypoparathyroid. Since 1976, however, only one patient (6.7%) has lost parathyroid function. Despite the fact that biological screening studies routinely were performed once a year in the majority of our patients and surgery was recommended for any elevation in the serum calcitonin (CT) levels, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) developed in 17 children (77%) and only five had C cell hyperplasia (CCH). Thirteen of the 17 had macroscopic tumor described by the pathologist, evidence of recurrent disease (MTC-REC) has developed in four children (24%).;There was considerable overlap in both the basal and stimulated CT levels among the five children with CCH, the 13 with localized MTC (MTC-NED), and the four who later had recurrent MTC. The basal calcitonin levels were between 25 and 110 (mean, 58) in the CCH patients, 30 to 1,130 (mean, 184) in the MTC-NED group, and 108 to 201 (mean, 140) in those with recurrent MTC.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a malignant tumor arising from calcitonin-secreting thyroid C cells, is the cardinal disease feature of this syndrome, and mortality in affected MEN-2 patients is mainly caused by this malignancy. Germ-line mutations of the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for these three neoplastic-prone disorders. MEN2 mutations convert the RET protooncogene in a dominantly acting oncogene as a consequence of the ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase. The majority of MEN2A and FMTC mutations are located in the extracellular domain and cause the replacement of one of five juxtamembrane cysteines by a different amino acid. To examine whether expression of a MEN2A allele of RET results in transformation of C cells, we have used the transgenic approach. Expression of the RET gene altered by a MEN2A mutation was targeted in C cells by placing the transgene under the control of the calcitonin gene-related peptide/calcitonin promoter. Animals of three independent transgenic mouse lines, which expressed the transgene in the thyroid, displayed overt bilateral C cell hyperplasia as early as 3 weeks of age and subsequently developed multifocal and bilateral MTC. Moreover, these tumors were morphologically and biologically similar to human MTC which afflicts MEN2 individuals. These findings provide evidence that the MEN2A mutant form of RET is oncogenic in parafollicular C cells and suggest that these transgenic mice should prove a valuable animal model for hereditary MTC.",

In familial MTC, only the thyroid is affected. Germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have recently been reported in association with MEN 2A and familial MTC. All mutations occurred within codons specifying cysteine residues in the transition point between the RET protein extracellular and transmembrane domains. We now show that MEN 2B is also associated with mutation of the RET proto-oncogene. A mutation in codon 664, causing the substitution of a threonine for a methionine in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, was found in all nine unrelated MEN 2B patients studied. The same mutation was found in six out of 18 sporadic tumours.",

Better survivorship was seen in the younger patients, in those with bilateral tumors, in familial MTC, and in patients whose tumor was confined to the thyroid gland at the initial surgery. The incidence of tumor recurrence was 34%. However, in those with adequate surgical treatment, the recurrence was only 23%. The 5- and 10-year survivorships were 80% and 67%, respectively.

The management of residual/recurrent or metastatic MTC still remains controversial, although a multimodal approach to advanced disease may be of value in palliation or local control of tumour progression.

There were no signs of pheochromocytoma, whereas primary hyperparathyroidism was suspected based on the findings of inappropriate hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone although no parathyroid tumor was detected with imaging studies. RET mutation analysis revealed a novel germline missense mutation in codon 666, c.1997A>G (p.K666R). She underwent total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy and simultaneous total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue. She was given calcium lactate and alfacalcidol to prevent postoperative hypocalcemia. Pathological findings of the thyroid tumor were compatible with MTC, but the resected parathyroid glands were intact. To our knowledge, c.1997A>G (p.K666R) is a new RET mutation. This is a minor variant, but it is significant because of the possible pathogenicity in tumor formation. It is often difficult to determine whether MTC is generated as part of MEN2-related disease or familial MTC when it is a unique manifestation. In addition, it is still unclear whether all missense mutations in this codon reported previously will lead to the same clinical course and prognosis. Further careful observations of clinical presentation are required to determine the clinical features associated with this variant.",

MTC is a rare, calcitonin-secreting thyroid malignancy often diagnosed by ultrasound and calcitonin screening as part of the routine workup for any thyroid nodule. If calcitonin is elevated, imaging studies are needed for preoperative staging, which dictates surgical management. This can be done by ultrasound of the neck and abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies for more distant disease are done preoperatively if calcitonin levels are higher than 500 pg/ml. Neither FDG-PET/CT nor F-DOPA-PET/CT are used routinely for preoperative staging but may contribute in doubtful individual cases. Postoperative elevated calcitonin is related to persistence or recurrence of MTC. Imaging studies to localize tumor tissue during postoperative follow-up include ultrasound, CT, MRI as well as PET studies. They should be used wisely, however, since treatment consequences are often limited, and even patients with persistent disease may survive long enough to accumulate significant radiation doses. Imaging studies are also useful for diagnosis of associated components of the hereditary MTC such as pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). ",

Genetic analysis can help to identify those advanced MTC with poorer prognosis who do not respond to chemotherapy.

The aim of the study was to analyze the outcome in a group of patients with MTC, diagnosed and followed up in a single care center. We performed a retrospective analysis of all the patients diagnosed with MTC in the Department of Endocrinology from the County Emergency Hospital Timisoara between 1992 and 2012. The study group included 19 patients, 6 men (31.6 %), mean age 41.2 ± 12.5 years (20-72 years). The preoperative diagnosis was based on the protocol for nodular thyroid disease. Total or near-total thyroidectomy was performed in 10 out of 16 patients who could be operated. Postoperative follow-up included repeated measurements of serum calcitonin and imaging investigations. Nine out of the total of 19 (47.3 %) patients had hereditary forms of MTC. Most of the cases (84.2 %) were submitted to surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 84 months. The pTNM staging indicated that the majority of the patients with hereditary MTC were diagnosed in an earlier stage. Disease remission was achieved in 7 cases (43.8 %). Four patients, all with sporadic forms, died. Survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were significantly higher (p = 0.048) in patients with hereditary MTC. An early diagnosis of MTC allows a better surgical approach and an improved survival rate. We support the general recommendation that modified radical neck dissection is not necessary for all the patients with MTC. ",

For MTC therapy, the Food and Drug Administration recently approved vandetanib and cabozantinib, multi-kinase inhibitors targeting RET and other tyrosine kinase receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or hepatocyte growth factor. Nevertheless, not all patients with the progressive MTC respond to these drugs, requiring the development of additional therapeutic modalities that have distinct activity. Previously, we reported that expression of activated Ras or Raf in the human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, can induce growth arrest and RET downregulation via a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated autocrine/paracrine loop. In this study, we aimed to evaluate bacterially-produced recombinant human LIF for its efficacy to suppress human MTC xenografts in mice. Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice. These results suggest that LIF is a potent cytostatic agent for MTC cells, which regulates unique mechanisms that are not targeted by currently available therapeutic agents.",

Sporadic MTC usually presents as a solitary palpable thyroid nodule and in most cases the definitive diagnosis is established only at the time of surgery. Nuclear medicine procedures, which play a minor role in the preoperative evaluation of MTC, are essential in postoperative follow-up to detect residual and/or recurrent tumor. A number of radiopharmaceuticals are able to visualize MTC lesions with considerable advantages in diagnosis and prognosis, some of them having also a therapeutic role. Among them, 99mTc[V]DMSA shows the highest diagnostic sensitivity and is considered by many authors the radiopharmaceutical of choice in the postoperative work-up of MTC. Radioiodinated MIBG, in spite of its high specificity has a poor sensitivity (30%); however it is useful for the identification of pheochromocytoma and, in patients showing MIBG uptake in tumoral lesions, high activities of 131I-MIBG may be used for therapy. 111In labeled octreotide detects lesions which express somatostatin receptors; a positive scintigraphic result seems to give also prognostic information (higher uptake in slow-growing lesions) and provides the basis for treatment with octreotide or lanreotide and 111In or 90Y-labeled octreotide analogues.

In a significant number of MTCs, however, no such genetic variations can be detected, which implies alternative pathogenic molecular alterations. To assess altered RET mutation-specific gene expression, and to identify yet unknown gene transcripts involved in the tumorigenesis of MTC, we performed an expression analysis by mRNA differential display (RT-DD). Snap-frozen tumor tissues and corresponding normal thyroid tissues of 8 patients suffering from MTC (6 sporadic, 2 hereditary tumors) were included in the study; 5/8 MTCs harbored RET point mutations (codons 618, 634, 918). The RT-DD method was refined by use of fluorescence-labeled arbitrary oligonucleotides, electrophoresis on an automated sequencer, and a novel fragment-recovery technique utilizing a high-performance fluorescence scanner. More than 400 differentially expressed mRNA transcripts--representing upregulated or downregulated genes in the compared tissues--were detected. In all, 28 selected fragments were recovered, cloned, sequenced, and identified. Differential expression of gene transcripts with known association to cell proliferation or tumor progression--such as annexin A2, Rab11a, trefoil proteins, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), mitochondrial displacement loop (D-loop), and G protein subunit gamma11--as well as of the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin was observed. Furthermore, several mRNA transcripts of yet unknown genes displayed mutation-specific upregulation or downregulation in MTC. Illumination of the molecular basis especially of C-cell carcinomas without detectable alterations of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase will be required for the development of therapeutic strategies for advanced tumors that cannot be bridled or cured by surgical interventions alone.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although thyroid carcinoma is more indolent than other solid tumors, distant metastatic disease due to differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is often refractory to treatment and thus a challenge for clinicians. New agents such as tyrosine kinases inhibitors have been introduced recently for therapy of metastatic thyroid cancer but they have toxic side effects as well as therapeutic benefits. The objective of this study was to determine the hematologic toxicities of sunitinib, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinases inhibitor, when used to treat progressive, advanced DTC and MTC.;Six patients with DTC and four with MTC who were treated with sunitinib were retrospectively studied for short-term hematological toxicities related to red cell and platelet mass and the major leukocyte series.;Before the start of sunitinib treatment, 5 of 10 patients (50%) received external beam radiation therapy and 6 of 10 (60%) had hematologic abnormalities. During sunitinib treatment, some grade of neutropenia was noted in 6 of 10 patients (60%), anemia in 1 of 10 (10%), thrombocytopenia in 7 of 10 (70%), and lymphocytopenia in 4 of 10 (40%). Monocytopenia was present in all 10 patients. Considering grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities, neutropenia was noted in 2 of 10 (20%), anemia in 1 of 10 (10%), and thrombocytopenia in 1 of 10 (10%). There was no grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia, but we noted a 52.4% (+/-17.47% standard deviation) decrease in monocyte counts. All patients had macrocytosis, despite normal circulating folate and cobalamin levels. In one patient with DTC, sunitinib had to be permanently discontinued because of hematological toxicity.;Despite the fact that most patients with DTC had received large doses of radioiodine and some had received external beam radiation therapy, both of which have myelosuppressive potential, treatment with sunitinib was well tolerated in most patients with DTC as well as in the patients with MTC. These results are encouraging, but, as our series was small and did not evaluate efficacy, more extensive studies in DTC and MTC are needed to determine the possible roles of sunitinib in these very different tumors.",

The following data were analysed: anatomical variants of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis rate, postoperative hypoparathyroidism rate, and histological results.;Two cases of right non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve were observed (2.2% of the 93 recurrent laryngeal nerves dissected). One case of persistent left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis was observed (1.1%) despite intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring. Eight cases of immediate postoperative hypocalcaemia were observed (23.5% of the 34 total thyroidectomies) and permanent hypocalcaemia was observed in 5 cases (14.7%) with a significantly lower immediate postoperative serum calcium than in the case of transient hypocalcaemia (P=0.035). Among the 11 patients operated for familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 36.3% presented one or more sites of C-cell carcinoma. Among the 32 patients operated for thyroid nodule, 6.3% presented papillary adenocarcinoma. Histological results were benign in all other cases.;Thyroid surgery in children and adolescents is part of global multidisciplinary management of thyroid disorders in children. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is a rare complication, but may occur despite the use of intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring. Permanent hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication and is correlated with immediate postoperative serum calcium. Systematic prophylactic total thyroidectomy in patients with a RET proto-oncogene mutation allowed early diagnosis of MTC in one-third of cases. In view of the low rate of malignant nodules in our series, the malignant thyroid nodule rates reported in children in the literature may be overestimated.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) originates from parafollicular C cells of the thyroid and accounts for 3-12% of all thyroid cancers. As opposed to other types of dedifferentiated thyroid tumours, MTC cells are highly functional, producing and secreting high amounts of calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen. As parafollicular C cells are of neural crest origin, MTC acts as a neuroendocrine tumour also and expresses somatostatin receptors. Although conventional radiological methods such as ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are widely used in the primary diagnosis and staging, they often fail to localize the residual or recurrent disease because the majority of MTC recurrence presents as occult disease. Thus, owing to functional characteristics of MTC, functional imaging modalities of nuclear medicine play a major role in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for MTC. Among nuclear medicine modalities, Tc(V) -dimercaptosuccinic acid, In-octreotide and I/I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine are commonly used in the diagnostic and even more in postoperative work-up of MTC. Alternatively, F-fluorodeoxyglucose and other positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals such as F-fluorodopa or F-fluorodopamine as well as radiolabelled antibodies such as Tc/I/I anticarcinoembryonic antigen, antigastrin, and anticholecystokinin-B have promising results. Functional imaging has a great advantage for nuclear medicine techniques in the routine work-up of MTC patients and also has a wide use in experimental studies.",

NPVs of PCT were assessed at 3 cut-offs (0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 ng/mL) and the diagnosis of MTC was based on CT levels. PCT and CT levels were correlated (r=0.7554 for CT levels above 10 pg/mL, n=66).

This review focuses on vandetanib (ZD6474, Zactima™; AstraZeneca) and its role in the treatment of MTC. Vandetanib is an oral TKI that targets VEGF receptors 2 and 3, RET, and at higher concentrations, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. This drug has been tested in two important phase II studies which demonstrated that both the 100 and 300 mg/day dosage of vandetanib have antitumor activity on advanced MTC. A phase III trial (ZETA trial) evaluating vandetanib in 331 patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC showed a significant prolongation of PFS for patients receiving vandetanib compared with placebo. Toxicity surveillance in all studies reported high rates of adverse effects with diarrhea, rash, fatigue and nausea being the most commonly experienced by patients.

The aim of this study was therefore to test the hypothesis that combined (18)F-DOPA PET/CT more accurately detects MTC lesions than each modality does alone.;Twenty-eight consecutive (18)F-DOPA PET, CT, and (18)F-DOPA PET/CT scans of patients followed up for sporadic MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 syndrome-associated MTC were reviewed retrospectively in randomized sequence by two blinded readers, one a nuclear medicine physician and the other a radiologist, with extensive experience interpreting such images.;Of 18 lesions detected concurrently by the three modalities, PET identified all as positive for MTC, but was unable to definitively localize 4 (22%) lesions. CT could definitively localize all 18 lesions, but could not definitively diagnose or exclude MTC in 6 (33%) lesions. Further, CT falsely identified as MTC-negative one lesion that was judged to be MTC-positive by both PET and PET/CT. Only PET/CT scans accurately characterized and localized all 18 lesions. On a per patient basis, the sensitivity of (18)F-DOPA PET/CT for MTC was 74% and the specificity, 100%. In the present series, no truly MTC-positive (18)F-DOPA PET/CT case was found in patients with basal human calcitonin (hCt) levels under 60 pg/mL, and conversely, no truly MTC-negative PET/CT case was found in patients with basal hCt over 120 pg/mL.

        "Doc_abstract":"Apart from the RET proto-oncogene (RET) no other genes have been found to be involved in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumorigenesis. Germline RET mutations are seen virtually in all familial forms of MTC and somatic RET mutations are often detected in sporadic MTC. In sporadic MTCs the RET gene is mutated in codon 918, where a methionine is substituted to a threonine (M918T). In this study 24 MTCs were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for chromosomal imbalances. Overall, alterations were detected in approximately 60% of the samples. The most common aberrations were gains on chromosome 19q (29%), 19p (21%), 11c-q12 (12.5%), and 22q (12.5%) and losses on 13q21 (21%) and 3q23-qter (12.5%). Gain of chromosome 11c-q12 was only detected in samples from patients whom died of MTC (p=0.001). These MTCs also harbored the somatic RET M918T mutation and also showed the highest numbers of CGH alterations in the series (p<0.003). Although there was a tendency towards a higher number of CGH imbalances in the tumors with RET M918T mutation, this difference was not significant. The results indicate that MTC is a comparatively genetically stable tumor, and that chromosomal regions 19q, 19p, 13q and 11q may be involved in MTC carcinogenesis.",

We sought to determine if the stimulated plasma calcitonin (CT) level at the time of diagnosis was of prognostic significance. The patients were divided into four groups according to their preoperative stimulated plasma CT levels (1) 250-1,000 pg/ml (n=25); (2) 1,000-5,000 pg/ml (n=36); (3) 5,000-10,000 pg/ml (n=8); (4) greater than 10,000 pg/ml (n=23). Compared between the four groups were several parameters, including incidence of regional lymph node metastases, incidence of residual MTC post-thyroidectomy (as indicated by increased (greater than 300 pg/ml) plasma CT levels after operation), incidence of distant metastases, and incidence of death. Also compared were the incidences of microscopic or gross MTC in thyroidectomy specimens. The incidence of regional lymph node involvement ranged from a minimum of one (4%) of 25 patients in Group 1 to 13 (57%) of 23 patients in Group 4. Similarly, plasma CT levels were elevated in only one (4%) of 25 patients in Group 1 compared to 14 (61%) of 23 patients in Group 4. There was no evidence of distant metastases or death in the patients in Groups 1, 2, or 3. In the 23 patients in group 4, however, four (17.4%) had distant metastases and two (8.7%) died of disease during the period of observation. Of th 25 patients in Group 1, MTC was evident only by microscopic examination in 14 (56%). Eleven (44%) of the patients in Group 1 had macroscopically evident medullary thyroid carcinoma. This is in contrast with patients in Group 4 where all 23 had grossly evident MTC. These data indicate that the stimulated plasma CT level at the time of diagnosis is an excellent prognostic indicator of the extent of a disease in patients with hereditary MTC. Aggressive screening of kindred members at risk is of critical importance for establishing the diagnosis and instituting therapy at a time when the neoplasm is confined to the thyroid gland.",

The identification of calcitonin as a specific and sensitive marker in 1968 determined a special interest of endocrinologists. Many hormones have been isolated in MTC tumors.

Moreover the presence of calcitonin receptors in MTC could have a role in the proliferation of this tumor. Somatostatin and the large use of somatostatin analogs in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors raise the hope that these drugs could be effective in MTC patients. Unfortunately, the benefits of these treatments is not validated. More interestingly, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could be of interest in this tumor by comparison of their use in colorectal polyps. By inhibiting Cox or inducing 15 PGDH enzymes, we have demonstrated in vitro its effectiveness. Thus, hormones in MTC are not only markers but probably mediate biological effects involved in tumor growth.",

At The Netherlands Cancer Institute 131I-MIBG scintigraphy was positive in 8 of 23 patients with MTC. Four of these patients have received therapeutic amounts of 131I-MIBG, resulting in 1 partial remission and meaningful palliation in 3 patients with metastatic MTC.

FNAB was performed in a thyroid nodule (no.=16) or lymph-node (no.=1 previously operated on for MTC) or in the prevalent nodule of multinodular goiters (no.=10). CT-FNAB values obtained in 37 subjects with normal serum CT (<10 ng/l) who underwent FNAB for thyroid nodules served as a negative control. In these subjects, CTFNAB values were 8.2+/-6.4 ng/l (range 2-30 ng/l). In patients with a thyroid nodule under evaluation for MTC, serum CT and CT-FNAB values were 14.5+/-3.9 ng/l (range 10-24 ng/l) and 16.4+/-29.8 ng/l (range 2-144 ng/l), respectively. In 4 patients, CT-FNAB values were higher than the highest values found in our negative controls (30 ng/l), but cytology results were compatible with a benign thyroid lesion and pentagastrin testing was negative. In 3 cases with CT-FNAB <30 ng/l, cytology was indicative of an indeterminate or probably follicular malignant lesion and histology was negative for MTC. None of the other subjects in whom pentagastrin testing was conducted showed serum CT values >100 ng/l. Our data do not show any correlation between CT-FNAB and serum CT. In conclusion, borderline CT values in patients with thyroid nodules are not rare.

ZD6474 blunted MTC cell proliferation and RET, Shc and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Single receptor knockdown by RNA interference showed that MTC cells depended on RET for proliferation. Adoptive expression of the ZD6474-resistant V804M RET mutant rescued proliferation of TT cells under ZD6474 treatment, showing that RET is a key ZD6474 target in these MTC cells. Upon RET inhibition, adoptive stimulation of EGFR partially rescued TT cell proliferation, MAPK signaling, and expression of cell-cycle-related genes.

Currently therapy is restricted to surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue lacking alternative forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore MTC is a particularly attractive target for gene therapeutic approaches. Many promising gene therapy strategies have been used in various animal models of MTC, showing enhanced antitumoral efficacy, and these will hopefully extend our current standard of care in the future. These approaches can tentatively be subdivided into four groups: (a) Inhibition of oncogenic RET signaling, (b) suicide gene therapy, (c) immunotherapy, and (d) combination of immunotherapy and suicide approaches. To block oncogenic signal transduction dominant-negative RET mutants were delivered into tumor cells and found to possess strong antineoplastic activity, including tumor growth suppression and increased animal survival. Suicide gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment featured either gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with concomitant application of ganciclovir or delivery of nitric oxide synthase II. Here antitumor effects were attributed to the occurrence of substantial bystander activities. Immunotherapy approaches comprised stimulation of immune response by delivery of interleukin 2 or 12. Finally, treatment with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in combination with interleukin 2 was found to be superior over either treatment alone. This review discusses the various gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment in detail, gives an overview on the diverse vector systems used to achieve efficient transduction of thyroid cancer cells, and points out the strategies employed to accomplish target cell selective gene expression thereby contributing to enhanced safety of gene therapy for MTC",

All three primary neoplasms and a first generation transplant from one of them contained calcitonin. Somatostatin was identified in two of three primary thyroidal neoplasms and in the first-generation transplant. Ultrastructurally, the neoplastic cells of the first-generation transplant contained membrane-bound dense-core granules that resembled those seen in normal mouse C cells. Intracisternal Type A retrovirus particles were also identified in neoplastic cells in this case. Transplantation of one of the neoplasms yielded subcutaneous masses averaging 2 cm in diameter by 3 months following transplantation in the second-generation recipients. These neoplasms resemble MTCs of man, rat, and other species and may prove of value for comparative morphologic and endocrinologic studies of C cell neoplasms and for studies of factors that regulate the synthesis and secretion not only of calcitonin but also of a variety of regulatory peptides, including somatostatin.",

The age-specific incidence of sporadic MTC increased markedly with age, whereas no unequivocal rise was found after the age of 20 for familial disease. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR), calculated separately for each of the six Swedish health care regions, revealed a roughly two-fold and mostly non-significant geographical variation in the occurrence of sporadic MTC. SMR for familial disease varied, however, between 0 and 306 and deviated highly significantly from the national average in four of the six regions.

Following reverse transcription (RT), the products were PCR-amplified and separated on a denaturating polyacrylamide gel. RT-PCR products demonstrating differential expression were reamplified and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. Six fragments for which differential expression was confirmed were cloned and sequenced. Resultant sequences were tested for homology to sequences in public data bases, and two novel MTC-derived fragments (MDF-1, MDF-2) were identified. Sensitivity of the method was confirmed by identification of a sequence encoding the calcitonin precursor flanking peptide which is expressed almost exclusively in MTC and normal thyroid C cells. Overexpression of the ribosomal genes S3a and P0 was found in the metastases. Recent reports suggest that components of the translational apparatus act as regulatory mediators of growth, proliferation, and neoplastic change. The altered expression of ribosomal proteins and gene products encoded by MDF-1 or MDF-2 may play an important role in the progression and metastatic spread of MTC.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether circulating tumor cells can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with MTC by RT-PCR targeted to calcitonin (CT) mRNA and whether the results of this method are correlated with disease manifestation and metastatic potential. Blood samples from 19 consecutive patients with MTC and elevated CT levels were analyzed. Four had newly diagnosed MTC, and 15 patients had undergone total thyroidectomy. Six of 19 patients had detectable CT mRNA by RT-PCR. CT levels in the CT mRNA-positive patients were significantly higher than those in CT mRNA-negative patients [2,239-265,313 pg/ml; median 80,921 pg/ml (n = 6) vs. 70-46,787 pg/ml; median, 932 pg/ml (n = 13); P = 0.006]. CT mRNA was detectable in 5 of 8 patients with distant metastases, in 1 of 6 patients with local/regional lymph node metastases, but in none of the patients with newly diagnosed, organ-confined MTC (n = 2) or surgically treated MTC without tumor manifestation by various imaging studies (n = 3). In peripheral blood from 10 healthy volunteers and 21 patients with benign thyroid nodules, no CT RNA could be detected. In conclusion, an RT-PCR-based procedure was established to detect circulating CT-producing cells in the peripheral blood of patients with MTC. RT-PCR results seem to reflect tumor spread and aggressiveness and thus may help with early identification of patients with disseminated and rapidly progressive disease.",

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term prognosis of survival in patients with MTC.;Long-term survival was analysed in 32 patients with MTC being treated in an endocrine centre over a 40-year period. Patients were classified as having sporadic MTC, familial MTC (FMTC), multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA or MEN IIB.;Seventeen patients had sporadic MTC (53.1%), eight had MEN IIA (25%) and three had MEN IIB (9.4%); the remaining four patients (12.5%) had not undergone genetic analysis until now. The overall average age at diagnosis was 42.0 years, and the median follow-up time was 9.5 years (range 0.5-39 years). Mortality due to progressive MTC was 15.6%. The 5-year survival rate was 96% (95% CI 89-100), the 10-year survival rate 91% (95% CI 79-100), and the 15-year survival rate 85% (95% CI 78-100). The estimated mean survival time after initial diagnosis was 31 years (95% CI 26.7-37.0). There is a significant difference in survival time between patients achieving complete remission compared with patients with biochemical persistent disease (P = 0.038) or metastasis (P = 0.0003). In five patients, advanced imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) identified additional sites of tumour load. Eight more lymph node metastases were found in four patients and one local tumour recurrence in one patient by PET/CT.;The overall prognosis of MTC is favourable, even if the rate of biochemical cure is lower in MTC than in differentiated types of thyroid cancer. This is also true for patients with biochemically persistent disease. Whether the identification of further tumour sites by advanced imaging procedures such as PET/CT translates into a better prognosis in patients with persistently elevated calcitonin levels remains to be investigated.",

Therefore, the clinical management of patients with sporadic CCH is controversial. To evaluate the malignant potential of sporadic CCHs, pure laser-microdissected C-cell populations of 24 CCH cases, either reactive or associated with nonfamilial MTC, were analyzed for MTC-associated protein neural cell adhesion molecule expression and RET point mutations in exons 10, 11, 15, and 16, by using immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism/heteroduplex electrophoresis/direct sequencing, respectively.

Neural cell adhesion molecule was immunoreactive in the majority of CCH associated with MTC even in the absence of morphological atypia, but not in reactive forms.

We examined the extent of this delay and its impact on the treatment of MTC.;Patients in the MEN database were retrospectively analyzed to determine the age at first presentation for a MEN2B-related complaint and the subsequent time to correct diagnosis.

Median age at diagnosis of MTC was 13 years (range 6-25 years). The median delay in diagnosis was 26 months (range 0-18 years). Persistent local-regional MTC was present following the initial cervical operation in 12 of 22 patients (55%); including 4 of 13 with MEN2B diagnosed prior to initial surgery and 8 of 9 with MEN2B diagnosed after initial surgery.;Most patients displayed phenotypic characteristics of MEN2B long before the correct diagnosis was made.

All patients underwent total thyroidectomy with removal of central lymph nodes from the neck. At the time of surgery, six children were found to have bilateral macroscopic MTC, five without and one with cervical metastases. One child (age 2 years) had C-cell hyperplasia, a premalignant precursor of MTC.

This prompted us to study the cytomorphological features of PDTC and assess features of distinction from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).;This was a retrospective study of thyroid FNAC smears from 44 PDTC cases retrieved from the database of a single tertiary cancer institute (2009-2013). Papanicolaou and Giemsa smears were evaluated for 21 cytomorphologic features. Immunocytochemistry was available for 6 cases only.;The frequencies of cytomorphologic features in the 44 cases were as follows: hypercellularity, 84.1%; insular pattern, 79.5%; small cell size, 93.2%; high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, 93.2%; granular chromatin pattern, 95.45%; nuclear overlapping, 88.64%; mild pleomorphism, 86.36%; grooves/inclusions, 22.7%; binucleation/multinucleation, 9.1%; abrupt nucleomegaly, 34.1%; apoptosis, 45%; mitosis, 25%; necrosis, 34.1%; and colloid, 22.7%.;A high index of suspicion is necessary for an upfront diagnosis of PDTC on FNAC.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with the two subtypes, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), is the most frequent subtype of thyroid cancer; more rare subtypes are medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). The incidence of DTC has increased rapidly in recent years due to the more frequent use of imaging methods such as ultrasound of the neck and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules. After total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment, DTC remains an indolent and curable disease in most patients, whereas the cure rate in MTC is lower and depends on early diagnosis. Most ATCs are incurable. In recent years, there has been great progress in identifying genetic changes in thyroid cancer, and genetic testing of FNA samples or blood samples provides useful information for clinical decision making. Tumor staging, either postoperatively or by imaging, and measuring the tumor markers thyroglobulin for DTC and calcitonin for MTC, allow for dynamic risk-adapted stratification for follow-up procedures. In advanced metastatic thyroid cancer, molecular targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, lenvantinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, helps control tumor progression and prolongs progression-free survival. Using a dynamic risk-stratified approach to manage thyroid cancer, the outcomes for most thyroid cancer patients are excellent compared with those for other cancers. The major challenge in the future is to identify high-risk patients and to treat and monitor them appropriately.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate sst5TMD4 expression in a series of human MTC and to explore the functional role of sst5TMD4 in TT cells. We evaluated sst5TMD4 and sst5 expression in 36 MTC samples. Moreover, we investigated the role of sst5TMD4 in TT cells evaluating cell number, DNA synthesis, free cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), calcitonin and vascular endothelial growth factor levels, cell morphology, protein expression, and invasion. We found that in MTC the balance between sst5TMD4 and sst5 expression influences disease stage. sst5TMD4 overexpression in TT cells confers a greater growth capacity, blocks sst2 agonist-induced antiproliferative effects, modifies the cell phenotype, decreases E-cadherin and phosphorylated β-catenin levels, increases vimentin, total β-catenin and phosphorylated GSK3B levels (in keeping with the development of epithelial to mesenchymal transition), and confers a greater invasion capacity. This is the first evidence indicating that sst5TMD4 is expressed in human MTC cells, where it associates with more aggressive behavior, suggesting that sst5TMD4 might play a functionally relevant role.

Altogether, 18 patients had unifocal micro-MTCs with a median diameter of 3.6 mm. One patient had a bilateral MTC (3 and 5 mm, respectively). Surgical procedures consisted of 9 total thyroidectomies and 10 lobectomies or subtotal thyroidectomies. Of these 10 patients, 4 underwent reoperation (totalization). One was operated on 48 months after a positive pentagastrin test: There was no thyroid residual tumor but three lymph node micrometastases. Among the six patients in whom thyroid tissue was left, a 91-year-old woman died of unrelated cause and the five others remain disease-free without biologic abnormalities at follow-ups of 18 to 70 months. Considering the aggressiveness of MTCs, total thyroidectomy with central compartment dissection is theoretically indicated. However, among the nine total thyroidectomies and four secondary totalizations associated with at least central compartment dissection, no other thyroid lesion was observed and only one case of lymph node microinvasion was found. Because of the morbidity associated with reoperation and neck dissection, we propose that it is indicated only for microcarcinomas > 5 mm in diameter, in cases of an abnormal response to pentagastrin, or when it is difficult to ensure prolonged follow-up of the patient.",

Ninety-one individuals participated in clinical and genetic screening, which included serum calcitonin and thyroid ultrasound (US) with cytology.

Through the cancer registry, two cases (aged 35 and 37 years) of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) were observed; the incidence for MTC was 340-fold (95% CI 52-1600) compared with average population. These individuals had C611R and C620R mutations in exon 10. One papillary thyroid cancer without RET mutations was detected by clinical screening. Four subjects (aged 31-50 years) with co-occurring RET mutations in exons 10 (C609R; n=1) and 13 (Y791F, n=3) had sporadic short-segment HD with normal thyroid US and serum calcitonin. Three novel mutations and five single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found outside exons 10 and 13 without associated signs of thyroid cancer. MTC-associated RET mutations were restricted to exons 10 and 13 affecting ∼5% of unselected adults with HD.

Of the 53 participants, eight different germline RET mutations were detected in 37 individuals. These RET mutations were distributed in exons 10, 11, 13, and 16. The most frequent RET mutation was localized at exon 11 codon 634 (67.6 %; 25/37) and the most prevalent mutation was C634R (37.8 %; 14/37). The most frequent phenotype was multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A). The incidences of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism in the MEN2A patients were 100, 36.4 and 18.2 %, respectively. The phenotype of families with Y606C or L790F mutation was categorized as familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, one proband was identified with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B and carried a de novo mutation of M918T. Two families with C618S/Y mutation were categorized as unclassified multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Our results further substantiate that most germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were localized at codon 634 in Chinese hereditary MTC patients and carriers. RET mutation at codon 634 was always associated to the phenotype of MEN2A. Screening of RET mutations should be probably limited to exons 10, 11, 13 and 16 initially to be cost-effective in China.",

In MEN 2B approximately 95% of patients present with a mutation at codon 918 (exon 16). Additionally, less frequent mutations in other codons have been found in both syndromes. The DNA-based genotype analysis enables the identification of gene carriers at risk of developing MTC and offer them prophylactic thyroidectomy prior to development of any thyroid pathologies. Prophylactic surgery is generally recommended for MEN 2A/FMTC gene carriers at the age of 4-6 years. Due to the aggressiveness of the MEN 2B syndrome gene carriers should be operated by the age of 1 year.

TT tumor xenograft, a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring oncogenic MEN-2A-type RET mutation. Oral treatment with RPI-1 caused growth arrest or regression in 81% treated tumors. Following treatment suspension, tumor inhibition was maintained (51%, P<0.05, 100 days) and cures were achieved in 2/11 mice. In treated tumors, Ret was tyrosine dephosphorylated. Moreover, compared to control tumors, a significant increase in apoptotic cells (210%, P<0.0001), loss of cellularity (47%, P<0.0001) and reduction of microvessel density (36%, P<0.0005) were detected. In vivo effects of RPI-1 were reflected in activation of BAD, cleavage of caspases, apoptotic DNA fragmentation and inhibition of VEGF production observed in in vitro RPI-1-treated TT cells. These findings thus indicate that RPI-1 antitumor effect on the MTC was characterized by apoptosis induction and angiogenesis inhibition. The results, consistent with a dependence on RET oncogene activation for maintenance and survival of MEN2A-type MTC, provide further preclinical rationale for a pharmacological RET-targeted intervention in thyroid cancer.",

Each variant of MEN2 results from a different RET gene mutation, with a good genotype-phenotype correlation with regard to aggressiveness of MTC, time of onset of MTC and the presence or absence of other endocrine tumours. Recommendations on the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery are based on a classification of RET mutations into three risk levels using the genotype-phenotype correlations. MEN2 provides a unique model for early prevention and cure of cancer and for stratified roles of mutation-based diagnosis of carriers.",

This RET mutation has not been reported previously. The boy's mother and his 82-year-old maternal grandfather showed the same mutation. None of the two ever showed symptoms of MTC. The mother underwent a preventive total thyroidectomy and pathological examination showed C-cell hyperplasia and early MTC. Further genetic analysis showed that the boy inherited a well-known coding polymorphism in exon 11 (G691S) from his father. Therefore the boy is a compound heterozygote for the insertion-deletion mutation at codon 666 and the G691S polymorphism in the RET gene. We hypothesize that the insTTCTdelG mutation at codon 666 is associated with low penetrance for MTC and that the young age of MTC in the reported child results most likely from the additive effects of both mutations (insTTCTdelG and G691S).",

Indeed, about 40% of PTCs harbor mutations in BRAF gene, whereas RET rearrangements (RET/PTC oncogenes) are present in about 20% of cases. Finally, RAS mutations and TRK rearrangements account for about 5% each of these malignancies. We used RNA-Sequencing to identify fusion transcripts and mutations in cancer driver genes in a cohort of 18 PTC patients. Furthermore, we used targeted DNA sequencing to validate identified mutations. We extended the screening to 50 PTC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using this approach we identified new missense mutations in CBL, NOTCH1, PIK3R4 and SMARCA4 genes. We found somatic mutations in DICER1, MET and VHL genes, previously found mutated in other tumors, but not described in PTC. We identified a new chimeric transcript generated by the fusion of WNK1 and B4GALNT3 genes, correlated with B4GALNT3 overexpression. Our data confirmed PTC genetic heterogeneity, revealing that gene expression correlates more with the mutation pattern than with tumor staging. Overall, this study provides new data about mutational landscape of this neoplasia, suggesting potential pharmacological adjuvant therapies against Notch signaling and chromatin remodeling enzymes.

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer is frequently associated with the oncogenic conversion of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. RET gene rearrangements, which lead to the generation of chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes, occur in PTC, whereas RET point mutations occur in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). We showed previously that the expression of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase J (PTPRJ) is suppressed in neoplastically transformed follicular thyroid cells. We now report that PTPRJ coimmunoprecipitates with wild-type RET and with the MEN2A-associated RET(C634R) oncoprotein but not with the RET/PTC1 and RET-MEN2B isoforms. Using mutated forms of PTPRJ and RET-MEN2A, we show that the integrity of the respective catalytic domains is required for the PTPRJ/RET-MEN2A interaction. PTPRJ expression induces dephosphorylation of the RET(C634R) and, probably via an indirect mechanism, RET/PTC1 oncoproteins on two key RET autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1062 and Tyr905). This results in a significant decrease of RET-induced Shc and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation levels. In line with this finding, adoptive PTPRJ expression reduced the oncogenic activity of RET(C634R) in an in vitro focus formation assay of NIH3T3 cells. As expected from the coimmunoprecipitation results, the RET(M918T) oncoprotein, which is associated to MEN2B and sporadic MTC, was resistant to the dephosphorylating activity of PTPRJ. Taken together, these findings identify RET as a novel substrate of PTPRJ and suggest that PTPRJ expression levels may affect tumor phenotype associated with RET/PTC1 and RET(C634R) mutants. On the other hand, resistance to PTPRJ may be part of the mechanism of RET oncogenic conversion secondary to the M918T mutation.",

Several germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are the source of distinct clinical phenotypes in hereditary MTC including familial MTC (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A (MEN 2A) and 2B (MEN 2B). The higher the penetrance of the MEN 2 phenotype the earlier the progression of MTC which forms the basis for the currently recommended codon-related concept of prophylactic thyroidectomy. In patients with sporadic MTC, routine calcitonin (CT) measurement in nodular goiter patients has been shown to reduce the frequency of advanced tumor stages. Patients with CT levels over 100 pg/ml after pentagastrin stimulation are recommended for total thyroidectomy. In patients with unexpected sporadic MTC after histological examination, completion thyroidectomy is currently only recommended when CT levels remain elevated. The extent of lymph node dissection in patients with MTC is controversial. However, with respect to lymphonodal micrometastases, systematic compartment-oriented microdissection has been shown to reduce the frequency of lymphonodal recurrence. On the other hand, to avoid unnecessary lymph node dissection, a more individualized concept is required in the future.

Hereditary MTC is divided into three clinical subtypes: multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A is characterized by MTC, pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN 2B is characterized by aggressive MTC, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus and the presence of distinctive mucosal neuromas on the tongue, lips and subconjunctival areas as well as ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract. The third clinical subtype of inherited MTC, familial MTC, is defined as the presence of MTC in families without evidence of adrenal or parathyroid gland involvement. Hereditary MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The first RET germline mutations were identified in 1993 in patients with MEN 2A and FMTC. Initially a codon 634 (exon 11) mutation was found in approximately 85% of patients with MEN 2A, and germline mutations in FMTC kindreds were more equally distributed throughout the RET proto-onocogene. In about 5% of families in these earlier series, mutations did not reside in exons 10 and 11. We now report a change in the spectrum of mutations detected in the RET proto-oncogene in patients with hereditary MTC from the 'classical' mutation at codon 634 in exon 11 (level 2) to more cases with mutations in the exons 13-15 (level 1) and less aggressive disease.

The cellular effects of TPX2 knockdown, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle diffusions, and mitotic gene expression were investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA).

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) originates from C cells, which secrete calcitonin (CT), their specific marker. C cells are located in contact with the basement membrane (BM) of the thyroid follicles, which is partly made up of the laminin-2 isoform synthesized by thyrocytes. During oncogenesis, proliferation of the C cells, invading the centre of the follicles, leads to a break in their normal contact with the BM. As specific interactions of cells with BM components, especially laminins, are important for proliferation and differentiation, we investigated the relationships of normal and neoplastic C cells with laminin in the Wag/Rij rat model of human MTC. Immunocytochemical studies showed a progressive loss of the laminin layer underlying the hyperplastic C cell nodules around the large dedifferentiated tumours. The alpha2, beta1 and gamma1 chains of the laminin-2 isoform were synthesized and secreted by rat MTC 6-23 cell cultures and the tumours induced by subcutaneous injection of these cells. In situ hybridization combined with anti-CT immunocytochemistry showed a low expression of alpha2 mRNA on differentiated C cells and thyrocytes, but an overexpression on immunonegative spontaneous MTC and induced intrathyroid tumours. The high level of alpha2 gene expression, together with tumour dedifferentiation, suggests a relationship with malignancy.",

However, management is difficult when routine imaging studies for MTC are negative. This paper brings a report of an illustrative case of a patient with MTC diagnosed by molecular screening, who persisted with detectable levels of serum calcitonin after surgical procedure. After 48 months, an increase in serum calcitonin impelled us to investigate the disease focus.

The major component tumor of these syndromes is medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). To date, somatic mutations in RET have not been identified in tumors from individuals with MEN 2, although they have been well documented in sporadic MEN 2-related tumors.

The survival rate of patients with MTC, who have undergone thyroidectomy and who show evidence of a rise in plasma levels of calcitonin and/or CEA is closely linked to the number and localization of the metastases. However the role of conventional imaging techniques (X-rays, US, CT, and MR) in the follow-up after thyroidectomy is controversial. Numerous radiocompounds are currently being used to detect local and distant recurrences of MTC. The present study evaluated OCT and pentavalent 99mTc-dimercapto-succinic-acid (99mTc-DMSA-V) scintigraphy performed in 13 patients with a histologic diagnosis of MTC and in one with MEN 2A, all of whom had undergone thyroidectomy between 3 months and 15 years before. The patients also underwent 123I (NaCI) scintigraphy to evaluate the sites and extension of thyroidal remnants. 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy was positive in 9/14 patients (64%); the 99mTc-DMSA-V was positive in 5/14 patients (35%). 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy recognized 18 sites of abnormal uptake (12 in the neck); 9mmTc-DMSA-V detected 9 MTC recurrences in the same patients. In conclusion, 111In-OCT scintigraphy represents, in the authors' experience, a useful method, more sensitive than 9mmTc-DMSA-V, to detect MTC recurrences in patient follow-up post-thyroidectomy.",

To elucidate whether single-chain fragment of variable (scFv) antibody labeled with 131I isotope is a potential imaging agent for diagnosing MTC. A human scFv antibody library of MTC using phage display technique was constructed with a capacity of 3x10(5). The library was panned with thyroid epithelial cell lines and MTC cell lines (TT). Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to identify the biological characteristics of the panned scFv. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was also used to explore the optimal concentration of the TT cell proliferation inhibition rate. They were categorized into TT, SW480 and control groups using phosphate-buffered saline. Western blotting showed that molecular weight of scFv was 28 kDa, cell ELISA showed that the absorbance of TT cell group was significantly increased (P=0.000??) vs. the other three groups, and MTT assay showed that the inhibition rate between the two cell lines was statistically significantly different (P<0.05) when the concentration of scFv was 0.1, 1 and 10 µmol/l.

Ct and CEA levels remained undetectable in four patients; recurrence was indicated in one patient after 10 years of follow-up by routine anatomic imaging and increased CEA levels, and Ct levels became slightly elevated during follow-up, despite massive tumor load, in the remaining two patients. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry for Ct, CEA, and chromogranin A. A high Ki67 proliferation index (PI) (three patients) and a high proportion of RET 918-mutated cells (four patients), as well as poorly differentiated histology, were associated with aggressive biological behavior of the MTC. The prognosis for nonsecretory MTC varied between long-term survival (12.5 years) and rapid progression leading to death within 1.75 years after diagnosis.;The prevalence of nonsecretory MTC was low (0.83% of patients with MTC).

Calcitonin peptide was readily detectable in normal C cells but its abundance in the neoplastic C cells of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) was reduced in correlation with the degree of tumour differentiation. Conversely, the content of calcitonin mRNA was higher in MTC than in normal C cells and was not significantly related to tumour differentiation. Both the peptide and mRNA of CGRP were present at much lower levels than those of calcitonin in normal C cells but were increased in neoplastic C cells. We conclude that neoplasia of thyroid C cells is associated with (i) an increase in the content of CGRP mRNA and peptide relative to that of calcitonin, consistent with a defect in control of transcript processing, and (ii) a decrease in the ratio of calcitonin peptide to mRNA abundance relative to the normal, suggesting a defect in synthesis or storage of the peptide.

Tautomycin and tautomycetin are antifungal antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus and Streptomyces griseochromogens, respectively. Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates multiple cellular processes and is important in various cancers, including MTC.

Nevertheless, in some cases the interpretation of FNAC results may be problematic due to limitations of the method. The expression level of some microRNAs changes with the development of thyroid tumors, and its quantitation can be used to refine the FNAC results. For this quantitation to be reliable, the obtained data must be adequately normalized. Currently, no reference genes are universally recognized for quantitative assessments of microRNAs in thyroid nodules. The aim of the present study was the selection and validation of such reference genes. Expression of 800 microRNAs in 5 paired samples of thyroid surgical material corresponding to different histotypes of tumors was analyzed using Nanostring technology and four of these (hsa-miR-151a-3p, -197-3p, -99a-5p and -214-3p) with the relatively low variation coefficient were selected. The possibility of use of the selected microRNAs and their combination as references was estimated by RT-qPCR on a sampling of cytological smears: benign (n=226), atypia of undetermined significance (n=9), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (n=61), suspicious for malignancy (n=19), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) (n=32), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (n=54) and non-diagnostic material (ND) (n=34). In order to assess the expression stability of the references, geNorm algorithm was used. The maximum stability was observed for the normalization factor obtained by the combination of all 4 microRNAs. Further validation of the complex normalizer and individual selected microRNAs was performed using 5 different classification methods on 3 groups of FNAC smears from the analyzed batch: benign neoplasms, MTC and PTC. In all cases, the use of the complex classifier resulted in the reduced number of errors. On using the complex microRNA normalizer, the decision-tree method C4.5 makes it possible to distinguish between malignant and benign thyroid neoplasms in cytological smears with high overall accuracy (>91%).",

Basal hCT concentrations exceeded 10 pg/mL in 44 of 150 patients (29%) with CHD and in 48 of 800 (6%) in patients with KT. Among these patients with elevated basal hCT, pentagastrin-stimulated concentrations of hCT exceeded 100 pg/mL in 4 patients with CHD and in 7 with KT. Thyroidectomy was performed in 8 patients (5 with KT, 3 with CHD) revealing the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) (n = 2) or of C-cell hyperplasia (n = 6). Two patients with C-cell hyperplasia had the neoplastic form of this disorder. One patient with MTC and 1 with C-cell hyperplasia also presented a papillary microcarcinoma. Stimulated concentrations of hCT were only moderately elevated in the remaining 3 patients and follow-up rather than surgery was deemed appropriate due to their concomitant severe medical problems. In conclusion, basal concentrations of hCT higher than 10 pg/mL are more common in patients with CHD (29%) and after successful KT (6%) than previously described in patients with thyroid nodular disease (3%). In spite of various additional factors complicating the interpretation of elevated hCT in CHD, pentagastrin-stimulated values above 100 pg/mL must be considered to indicate the presence of C-cell hyperplasia and/or of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Although thyroidectomy would theoretically be the therapy of choice, the potential benefit of the operation must be seen in the context of the patient's general condition.",

Twenty surgically resected sporadic MTCs, previously analyzed for RET mutations by Sanger sequencing using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, were investigated for intragenic mutations in 50 cancer-associated genes applying a multigene Ion AmpliSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Thirteen (65 %) MTCs harbored a RET mutation; 10 were detected at both Sanger and NGS sequencing, while 3 undetected by Sanger were revealed by NGS. One of the 13 RET-mutated cases also showed an F354L germline mutation in STK11. Of the seven RET wild-type MTCs, four cases (57.1 %) harbored a RAS mutation: three in HRAS (all Q61R) and one in KRAS (G12R). The three remaining MTCs (15 %) resulted as wild-type for all the 50 cancer-related genes. Follow-up was available in all but one RET-mutated case. At the end of follow-up, 7 of 12 (58 %) RET-mutated patients had relapsed, while the 4 RAS-mutated MTC patients were disease-free.

Nine MTCs, all pTNM stage T4, were positive for MRP2, whereas 3 MTCs, pTNM stages T2 and T3, were unreactive for MRP2. Six metastatic MTCs at stage T4 showed higher proportion of MRP2+ cells, compared with primary tumors. All 12 MTCs were positive for COX2. Three MTCs, pTNM stage T2 and T3, showed COX2 positivity in all cells. The proportion of COX2+ cells decreased with increased pTNM stage.

Thyroid cancer amounts about 0.5%-1.5% of all malignancies in children and adolescents. In Germany 10-30 cases could be expected in a year. The most common histologic type for this age group is the differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), i.e. the papillary and follicular subtypes (90%). In 10% of patients medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) will be diagnosed. DTC occur more often in girls than in boys (female/male-ratio 2:1), with a median age of about 12-13 years (yrs). An important aetiological factor of DTC is a former exposition to different kinds of radiation. In childhood and adolescence MTC mostly appears in patients suffering from the syndrome MEN-2, whereas the sporadic form is rare. As in DTC, more girls than boys can be diagnosed for MTC (female/male-ratio 2-3:1), with a median age about 10 yrs. The anaplastic/undifferentiated subtype occurs extremely rare. For all types of thyroid cancer the most important therapeutic approach is the surgical intervention. In most cases of DTC an optimal disease control could be achieved by radioiodine therapy. Prognosis of DTC in children and adolescents is favourable. However, therapeutic strategies and modalities reported in the literature are very different. In contrast, prognosis of MTC is rather poor, that of the anaplastic type is infaust. No other effective therapy option than surgery is available. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combined modality therapy by both radiotherapy and cytostatic drugs in children and adolescents with poor prognosis types of thyroid cancer, an interdisciplinary multicenter therapy study will now be started in Germany.",

However, the molecular basis for the large variability in TKI responses is unknown. In this exploratory study, we investigated the expression of eight key TKI target proteins (EGFR, KIT, MET, PDGFRB, VEGF (VEGFA), VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)) by immunohistochemistry in 103 molecularly characterized MTC samples and identified the associated clinical and molecular features. A number of MTC samples exhibited a high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, which were overexpressed in 57 and 43% of the MTC samples respectively. VEGFR1, PDGFRB, VEGF, KIT, and MET were present in 34-20% of the cases, while EGFR was highly expressed in only 10% of the MTC samples. Some proteins exhibited large differences in expression between sporadic and familial cases, suggesting that different RET mutations may be associated with the immunohistochemical profiles. MTC samples with the C634 RET mutation exhibited a higher expression of VEGFR3 and KIT than the M918T RET-mutated and non-mutated RET tumor samples (P=0.005 and P=0.007 respectively) and a lower expression of VEGFR1 (P=0.04). Non-mutated RET MTC cases exhibited a lower expression of PDGFRB (P=0.04). Overall, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that multiple TKI targets are highly expressed in a subset of MTCs, suggesting that molecular stratification of patients may have the potential to improve TKI therapies for MTC.

Side effects with an incidence ≥ 50% were hand-foot syndrome (74%), diarrhea (70%), skin rash (67%), fatigue (61%), and weight loss (57%). Deaths not related to progressive disease occurred in nearly 4% of patients.;Treatment with sorafenib in patients with progressive DTC and MTC is a promising strategy, but the adverse event rate is high, leading to a high rate of dose reduction or discontinuation. Consequently, sorafenib use in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer requires careful selection of patients and careful management of side effects.",

Slides cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from these cases were assessed for the activities of Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes by immunohistochemistry as well as by a battery of immunohistochemical stains for intermediate filaments, peptide hormone, and proliferation and promoter antigens. The staining reactions were semiquantitatively assessed and scored for comparison with each other as well as with each patient s clinical presentation and course. Staining for Cox-1 and Cox-2 enzymes was present only in tumorous tissue, not in nontumorous thyroid tissue or C-cells. Cox-2 staining was not consistently increased over Cox-1 staining; however, Cox-2 staining bore statistically significant correlations with the expression of low molecular weight keratin, thyroid-transforming factor-1, topoisomerase, and MIB1. Hyperplastic C-cells from patients with diverse physiologic conditions and from three patients with C-cell hyperplasia accompanying medullary carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIa showed no reactivity for the Cox antibodies. It appears that Cox enzyme immunoreactivity is present only in the neoplastic C-cells of medullary carcinoma, but with variable expression.

Since 1996, we have performed hemithyroidectomy, instead of total thyroidectomy, for sporadic nonhereditary MTC when the primary lesion is located in only one lobe. Regarding lymph node dissection, modified radical neck dissection (MND) at least ipsilateral to the tumor has been routinely performed, even if there is no clinically apparent metastasis. We investigated the clinical outcomes of MTC patients in our department.;A series of 118 patients with MTC who underwent initial surgery between 1975 and 2005 were enrolled in this study. The RET gene mutations were analyzed for all patients and 46 had germline RET gene mutations. Of those 46 patients, 26 were diagnosed as MEN 2A and 2 were diagnosed as MEN 2B. Postoperative follow-up periods averaged 141 months.;Of 115 patients who did not have distant metastasis at surgery and who underwent locally curative surgery, 78 (67.8%) were biochemically cured. All patients without pathological lymph node metastasis were biochemically cured, and 44.8% of patients with node metastasis were also biochemically cured. The 10-year and 20-year disease-free survival rates were 89.0% and 82.5%, respectively. None of the patients who did not show lymph node metastasis and only 2 (2.6%) of 78 patients who were biochemically cured showed clinically apparent carcinoma recurrence. The 10-year and 20-year cause-specific survival rates were 96.6% and 91.7%, respectively. Lymph node metastasis, tumor size>4 cm, extrathyroid and extranodal tumor extensions significantly affected cause-specific survival of patients.;Clinical outcomes of MTC patients in our series were better than those in Western countries, a result that might have resulted in part because of our routine MND regardless of whether clinically apparent node metastasis was detected.",

The cases of CLT were compared with 19 normal thyroid glands obtained at necropsy. C cells, immunoreactive with a polyclonal anti-calcitonin (CT) antibody, were counted at high magnification (X400) and the number of low-power magnification (X100) microscopic fields (LPFs) containing at least 50 C cells per slide was assessed. Image analysis was performed to determine the C-cell density expressed in number of C cells/cm2. C-cell hyperplasia was defined by the following criteria: C-cell density > 40 cells/cm2 and the presence of at least three LPFs containing more than 50 C cells. Twenty percent of the cases of CLT showed a CCH thus defined, and four of them had an elevated serum CT level. Statistical analysis showed no clinical or biological correlation with the presence of CCH. However, the frequency of CCH was higher if a follicular cell carcinoma was associated with CLT.

Laboratory studies revealed an elevated 24-h urine-free cortisol (780 micro g/d), epinephrine (66 micro g/d), and calcium (558 mg/d). Baseline serum cortisol was 23.9 micro g/dl and decreased to 12.9 and 4.5 micro g/dl after 2 mg and 8 mg dexamethasone suppression, respectively. Plasma ACTH was 170 pg/ml and decreased to 75 and 24 pg/ml after dexamethasone. Bone density t-score was -4.3 (trochanter). Computed tomography scans showed multiple cervical nodes and 2-cm right adrenal nodule. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a prominent, homogeneous pituitary; the adrenal MRI scan was not typical for a pheochromocytoma. Serum CRH was less than 6.6 pg/ml. Bilateral adrenalectomy revealed two adjacent right adrenal pheochromocytomas and corrected the elevated urine cortisol (30 micro g/d), epinephrine (0 micro g/d), and calcium (281 mg/d) but not plasma ACTH (125 pg/ml).

Immunohistochemical stain was negative for ACTH in the MTC-positive lymph nodes and the pheochromocytoma. Proopiomelanocortin mRNA by in situ hybridization was positive in the MTC but not in the pheochromocytoma. A repeat pituitary MRI scan was normal. The differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome in this case included pituitary disease or ectopic ACTH, either from medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma.

Of patients with neck pain, 18% were diagnosed at stage I to II and 82% at stage III to IV, compared to 64% at stage I to II and 36% at stage III to IV (p = 0.014).;Our study demonstrates that more patients with MTC present with anterior neck pain than do patients with PTC and that patients with MTC and neck pain have an increased risk of LN metastases. The results of this study suggest that MTC patients, who present with concomitant neck pain, should undergo a total thyroidectomy, prophylactic bilateral central neck dissection, and ipsilateral lateral neck dissection.",

A substantial proportion of sporadic MTCs also have RET mutations, making the RET tyrosine kinase a potential therapeutic target in MTC. We have established a transplantable MTC in nude mice from a sporadic human MTC carrying a RET C634R mutation. Transplanted tumors had an exponential growth rate with an approximate doubling time of about 3 weeks, and expressed a neuroendocrine phenotype characteristic of MTC, e.g., expression of calcitonin, chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin, synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), vesicular monoamine transporter-1 and -2, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 8/18, epithelial cadherin, and neural cell adhesion molecule. Plasma calcitonin and CgA levels were elevated in tumor-bearing mice and correlated with tumor size. Cytogenetic analysis, including spectral karyotyping, confirmed the human origin of the xenografted tumors and demonstrated an abnormal, near triploid karyotype. Treatment of tumor-bearing nude mice with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474, which specifically inhibits RET, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelium growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. Oral ZD6474 given once daily (250 mg/kg, 5 days/week) reduced tumor volume to 11% when compared with controls after 4 weeks. Our results show that this transplantable MTC, designated GOT2, represents a novel and useful model for studies of MTC and RET tyrosine kinase-dependent tumor growth.",

We have recently reported that activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in MTC cells results in morphologic changes. We hypothesized that Raf-1-induced morphologic changes could be associated with alterations in cell-cell contact molecules, thereby affecting the metastatic potential of MTC cells.;An estradiol (E(2))-inducible Raf-1 MTC cell line (TT-raf) was utilized in this study. Western blot analysis was used to confirm the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway activation and to measure levels of essential cell-cell contact molecules. Assays for cell adhesion and migration were performed to investigate the cell motility.;E(2) treatment of TT-raf cells resulted in the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway activation as evidenced by increased levels of phospho-MEK1/2 and -ERK1/2. This resulted in significant reductions in levels of essential cell-cell contact molecules including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and occludin. Importantly, activation of the Raf-1/ MEK/ERK pathway and the associated decrease in essential cell-cell contact molecules dramatically inhibited the abilities of adhesion and migration in MTC cells. Furthermore, treatment of Raf-1-activated cells with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK, abrogated these Raf-1-induced effects indicating that the suppression of the metastatic phenotype in MTC cells is a MEK-dependent pathway.;These data suggest that the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway regulates essential cell-cell contact molecules and metastatic phenotype of MTC cells. Thus, these findings provide further insight into the key steps in the metastatic progression of MTC.",

More importantly, the relapse of GD and the following radioiodine therapy and radiation exposure could have been prevented if a better therapy plan of total thyroidectomy was adopted in the first place, instead of hemithyroidectomy (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 11).",

The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs. However, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations. Here, we describe the genomic profiles of two medullary thyroid cancers and report the presence of a putative oncogenic BRAF fusion in one.

Stains for CD34 and CD31 were negative. This case illustrates that the spindle cell variant of MTC may exhibit an infrequent angiosarcoma-like appearance which may be misdiagnosed as angiosarcoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer is rare, but it is the most frequent endocrine malignancy. Its prognosis is generally favorable, especially in cases of well-differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs), such as papillary and follicular cancers, which have survival rates of approximately 95% at 40 years. However, 15-20% of cases became radioiodine refractory (RAI-R), and until now, no other treatments have been effective. The same problems are found in cases of poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic (ATC) thyroid cancers and in at least 30% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases, which are very aggressive and not sensitive to radioiodine. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent a new approach to the treatment of advanced cases of RAI-R DTC, MTC, PDTC, and, possibly, ATC. In the past 10 years, several TKIs have been tested for the treatment of advanced, progressive, and RAI-R thyroid tumors, and some of them have been recently approved for use in clinical practice: sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC and PDTC and vandetanib and cabozantinib for MTC. The objective of this review is to present the current status of the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer with the use of innovative targeted therapies by describing both the benefits and the limits of their use based on the experiences reported so far. A comprehensive analysis and description of the molecular basis of these therapies, as well as new therapeutic perspectives, are reported. Some practical suggestions are given for both the choice of patients to be treated and their management, with particular regard to the potential side effects. ",

It has been identified previously in several normal and tumoral neuroendocrine tissues, including human medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs). The aim of the study was to evaluate ghrelin levels in patients with MTC and nontoxic goitre (NTG) with elevated calcitonin (CT) levels, as an additional marker of the disease.;The study included 22 patients with MTC (four before and 18 after thyroidectomy), 12 patients with NTG with basal CT levels exceeding 10 ng/l and 15 healthy subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). After thyroidectomy, MTC patients were considered cured when basal and pentagastrin-stimulated CT levels were < 0.2 and < 10 ng/l, respectively. A pentagastrin-induced CT peak over 50 ng/l was considered as an abnormal response while 100 ng/l was the cut-off accepted for the diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia or tumour. Circulating ghrelin and CT levels were evaluated at baseline in patients and controls and at -10, 0, 1, 2, 5 and 15 min after pentagastrin injection (0.5 microg/kg body weight) in 12 patients with MTC and nine with NTG. Four surgically removed MTCs were tested for ghrelin expression.;Total plasma ghrelin and CT levels were measured with a commercially available radioimmunoassay (RIA) and two-site chemiluminescence immunometric assays, respectively. In paraffin-embedded MTC samples ghrelin immunostaining was performed with a polyclonal antibody (1:1000) and the reaction visualized by an indirect immunoperoxidase system.;Plasma ghrelin levels found in cured or not cured MTC and in NTG patients were similar to those of BMI-matched healthy controls. No correlation between ghrelin and CT levels, thyroid disease or previous thyroidectomy was observed. The administration of pentagastrin caused a 17% increase in ghrelin levels (basal ghrelin vs. peak: 162 +/- 62 pmol/l vs. 189 +/- 58 pmol/l, P < 0.05) that was particularly evident (33% increase) in patients with an abnormal CT response to the test (CT > 50 ng/l). Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for ghrelin in a small proportion of CT positive cells from the four MTCs removed.;Patients with MTC, NTG and controls showed similar ghrelin levels, ruling out this parameter as a marker of MTC. The increase in ghrelin levels in patients with a positive CT response to pentagastrin, together with the immunopositivity for ghrelin in some MTC cells, suggests C cells as minor source of ghrelin production.",

Cell growth of MTC cells as well as enzymatic activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase was markedly inhibited after treatment with different fractions of the plant. Furthermore, there was an increase in the expressions of caspase-3 and -7 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fraction, while bcl-2 overexpression remained constant. In particular, the alkaloids isopterpodine and pteropodine of U. tomentosa exhibited a significant pro-apoptotic effect on MTC cells, whereas the alkaloid-poor fraction inhibited cell proliferation but did not show any pro-apoptotic effects. These promising results indicate the growth-restraining and apoptotic potential of plant extracts against neuroendocrine tumors, which may add to existing therapies for cancer.",

Recognition of patients with the MMN syndrome and subsequent calcitonin screening and early surgical intervention will significantly reduce the chance of their developing terminal MTC. All MMN patients with mucosal neuromas or intestinal neurogangliomas should have such evaluations at least yearly.

MAPK activation was analyzed in stage I carcinomas and borderline tumors using phospho-specific antibodies against the extracellular-regulated kinase (p-ERK), the high osmolarity glycerol response kinase (p-p38), and the c-jun amino-terminal kinase (p-JNK). p-TrkA membrane expression was significantly more frequent in advanced-stage carcinomas compared with both borderline and stage I carcinomas (P < .001). p75 membrane expression was comparable in the 3 groups (P > .05). p-ERK and p-p38 expression was comparable in borderline and stage I carcinomas, whereas p-JNK was more frequently expressed in stage I ovarian carcinomas (P < .001). NGF receptor expression showed no association with MAPK activation in borderline and stage I carcinomas. In conclusion, expression of biologically active p-TrkA receptor at the cell membrane is up-regulated along tumor progression in ovarian carcinoma, whereas p75 expression remains unaltered.

A markedly divergent SSCP pattern and a PCR fragment 9 bp shorter than normal were demonstrated in 14 of the 15 MTC tumors.

Four lymphocyte controls and normal thyroid tissue from one patient failed to show the deletion.

It is clinically characterized by the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), bilateral pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism (MEN2A) within a single patient. Three distinct clinical forms have been described depending on the phenotype: the classical MEN 2A, MEN 2B, an association of MTC, pheochromocytoma and mucosal neuroma, (FMTC) familial MTC with a low incidence of other endocrinopathies. Each variant of MEN2 results from different RET gene mutation, with a good genotype phenotype correlation. Genetic testing detects nearly 100% of mutation carriers and is considered the standard of care for all first degree relatives of patients with newly diagnosed MTC. Recommendations on the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery are based on a classification into four risk levels utilizing the genotype-phenotype correlations. MEN 2 gives a unique model for early prevention and cure of cancer and for stratified roles of mutation-based diagnosis of carriers.",

In this paper, we report on a 53-year-old male patient with an evident RET gene germline mutation, who simultaneously developed hepatic metastases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma. Comprehensive immunohistochemical investigations were performed to elaborate markers which could be useful for differentiating between MTC metastases and pheochromocytoma, respectively. Calcitonin and CEA, in particular cytokeratins and trefoil factor family 1 (TFF1), were detectable exclusively in MTC, whereas all the other markers revealed a comparable expression in both MTC and pheochromocytoma. The only clues that could indicate a potential malignant course were size, a lack of sustentacular cells and hyaline globules, and a focal spindle cell pattern in pheochromocytoma. Owing to a wide agreement in cellular differentiation and a lack of specific, routinely applicable markers for pheochromocytomas, a comprehensive and goal-directed immunohistochemistry is required to rule out pheochromocytoma metastasis in patients with MEN2a.

Patients were classified as having sporadic MTC, familial non-multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) MTC, MEN 2A, or MEN 2B. The TNM, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study (NTCTCS), and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) extent-of-disease stages were determined for each patient. The predictive values of these staging or prognostic scoring systems were compared by calculating the proportion of variance explained (PVE) for each system.;Fifty-six percent of the patients had sporadic MTC, 22% had familial MTC, 15% had MEN 2A, and 7% had MEN 2B. The overall average age at diagnosis was 38 years, and patients with sporadic MTC presented at an older age (P < 0.05). Thirty-two percent of the patients with hereditary MTC were diagnosed by screening (genetic and/or biochemical). These patients had a lower incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05) and 94.7% were cured at last follow-up (P < 0.0001) compared with patients not screened. Patients with sporadic MTC who had systemic symptoms (diarrhea, bone pain, or flushing) had widely metastatic MTC and 33.3% of those patients died within 5 years. Overall, 49.4% of the patients were cured, 12.3% had recurrent MTC, and 38.3% had persistent MTC. The mean follow-up time was 8.6 years (median, 5.0 years) with 10.7% (n=11) and 13.5% (n=14) cause specific mortality at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Patients with persistent or recurrent MTC who died of MTC lived for an average of 3.6 years (ranging from 1 month to 23.7 years). Patients who had total or subtotal thyroidectomy were less likely to have persistent or recurrent MTC (P < 0.05), and patients who had total thyroidectomy with cervical lymph node clearance required fewer reoperations for persistent or recurrent MTC (P < 0.05) than patients who underwent lesser procedures. In univariate analysis, age, gender, clinical presentation, TNM stage, sporadic/hereditary MTC, distant metastasis, and extent of thyroidectomy were significant prognostic factors. Only age and stage, however, remained independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. The TNM, EORTC, NTCTCS, and SEER staging systems were all accurate predictors of survival, but the EORTC prognostic scoring system had the highest PVE in this cohort.;Screening for MTC and early treatment (total thyroidectomy with central neck lymph node clearance) had nearly a 100% cure rate. Patients with postoperative hypercalcitoninemia without clinical or radiologic evidence of residual tumor after apparently curative surgery may enjoy long term survival but have occult MTC. Only patient age at presentation and TNM stage were independent predictors of survival. The EORTC criteria, which included the greatest number of significant prognostic factors in our cohort, had the highest predictive value.",

Eleven individuals from two unrelated families were found to have the D631Y germline mutation. Among them, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) was identified in five patients: four of them had MEN 2A and one had familial MTC.

Two of six patients suffering with pheochromocytoma had no clinical evidence of MTC at the time of diagnosis. None had any evidence of hyperparathyroidism. This genetic profile might be related to the less vigorous clinical disease behavior and the late onset of MTC. In addition, pheochromocytoma might be the first manifestation prior to the development of MTC in some patients with the D631Y mutation.

In childhood papillary thyroid cancer, regardless of history of radiation exposure, RET/PTC rearrangements are a major event. Conversely, in adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer among the general population, the most common molecular event is BRAF(V600E) point mutation, not RET/PTC rearrangements. To clarify which gene alteration, chromosome aberration, or point mutation preferentially occurs in radiation-associated adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer, we have performed molecular analyses on RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF(V600E) mutation in 71 papillary thyroid cancer cases among atomic bomb survivors (including 21 cases not exposed to atomic bomb radiation), in relation to radiation dose as well as time elapsed since atomic bomb radiation exposure. RET/PTC rearrangements showed significantly increased frequency with increased radiation dose (P(trend) = 0.002). In contrast, BRAF(V600E) mutation was less frequent in cases exposed to higher radiation dose (P(trend) < 0.001). Papillary thyroid cancer subjects harboring RET/PTC rearrangements developed this cancer earlier than did cases with BRAF(V600E) mutation (P = 0.03). These findings were confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. These results suggest that RET/PTC rearrangements play an important role in radiation-associated thyroid carcinogenesis.",

Mutations in the RET protooncogene are known to be the cause of the MEN2A and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) syndromes in the majority of the families. Direct DNA testing allows prophylactic thyroidectomy to be offered to individuals carrying a mutation in the above codons, and in mutation-negative cases it reduces the yearly screening-related burden on family members at risk of the disease. By DNA sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 65 MTC probands were examined for mutations in residues 609, 611, 618, 620 of exon 10, and in residues 634, 768, 804 of exons 11, 13, and 14 respectively of the RET protooncogene. In our study, mutations in the above codons were detected in all of the 14 clinically MEN2A and FMTC families. One of these mutations, TGC609 TCC has not been reported previously. Of the 14 probands with the mutation, 25 relatives also had the identified mutation and 18 relatives proved to be non-carriers. Among the 51 probands with clinically sporadic MTC, none was found to carry a mutation in the above positions even if indirect signs of MTC, pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism could be detected in some families. The frequency of the TGC634AGC mutation is unexpectedly high in our samples, which can probably be attributed to a founder effect.

The aim of this study is to compare the sensitivity of FNA-CT and cytology in detecting MTC and to assess a cut-off value of FNA-CT for clinical practice.;Thirty-eight MTC lesions from 36 patients were retrospectively studied, diagnosed and treated in four different centres. Furthermore, 52 nonmedullary lesions from subjects undergone biopsy following increased serum CT were collected as a control group.;Cytology detected MTC in 21/37 lesions with 56·8% sensitivity.

Presently, early total thyroidectomy provides real cure of MTC for cases in which molecular diagnosis has been performed at early ages.

Basal as well as pentagastrin-stimulated values for CGRP are evaluated in relation to the corresponding levels for calcitonin. Serum CGRP is within normal range in most family members with pathological calcitonin response to the pentagastrin stimulation test. Furthermore, these potentially affected family members do not respond to the pentagastrin stimulation test with an increase in CGRP. Pentagastrin stimulation tests performed in patients with manifest MTC affect the serum CGRP levels inconstantly and in two patients, with elevated basal level of CGRP, stimulation caused a release of calcitonin while concentrations of CGRP remained unaffected.

Their mean age was 46 years (range: 19-73 years). The MTC was sporadic in 21 patients and familial in 4: NEM 2A (n = 3), NEM 2B (n = 1). In 11 patients (44%) operated in another centre, the first procedure was a total thyroidectomy; in 2 patients (8%) a total thyroidectomy with central lymphadenectomy was performed, and in 12 patients (48%) a total thyroidectomy with central and jugulo-carotid lymphadenectomy. After the first operation, 6 patients (24%) were classified stage II, 15 (60%) stage III and 4 (16%) stage IV. Basal and post-stimulation calcitonin dosages were performed for all the patients before and after reoperation.;Thirty three reoperations were performed. In 24 cases, the recurrence was located in the laterocervical site; in 5 cases, the lymph node involvement was both central and laterocervical, in 2 cases, there was a mediastinal involvement and in 2 cases a spinal involvement. After reoperation, the calcitonin rate became normal in 4 patients (16%); in the other 21 (84%), the calcitonin rate was still high.

In healthy volunteers, basal CT values were always less than 10 ng/L; the response to pentagastrin was below 30 ng/L for 36, and for the remaining 2, the peaks reached 30 for 1 subject and 48 ng/L for the other. The pentagastrin-stimulated CT peak was above 30 ng/L in each of the patients presented here, and all were thyroidectomized. In screening the 25 relatives of patients with familial MTC, a CT peak level over 30 ng/L was constantly associated with C-cell disease (23 cases of MTC and 2 of C-cell hyperplasia). A response to pentagastrin above 100 ng/L was observed in 15 patients among the 23 with MTC. In 8 of the 10 patients with a peak CT level between 30-100 ng/L, pathological examination showed a MTC; the other 2 had C-cell hyperplasia and a negative linkage study analysis. In the 25 other patients in the study without familial MTC, the pentagastrin-stimulated CT level was over 100 ng/L in 11 of the 14 subjects with MTC. The abnormal CT response to pentagastrin, which has been used as a criterion for surgical treatment, is currently determined by an immunoradiometric assay. Our study confirms that subjects with a peak CT level above 100 ng/L should undergo surgery whatever the reason for the test. In the context of inherited MTC, our results suggest that for patients with a CT peak level between 30-100 ng/L, surgery may actually be postponed when their probability of being gene carriers is low.

The most affected codon was 634 (58%) followed by codon 804 (16%). Among at-risk individuals, 49% were identified as gene carriers. Seven individuals were submitted to prophylactic thyroidectomy (mean age, 17.7 +/- 12.5 years; range: 3-42 years), and all but 1 had MTC.;RET mutational spectrum observed in the present population disclosed a higher frequency of codon 804 mutations than expected. Compliance with an early prophylactic surgery seemed to be influenced not only by medical advice and cultural factors but also by the aggressiveness of disease in gene carriers' families.",

However, the relevance of SNP for MTC patients is still controversial, whether these allelic variants play other interacting, predisposing or modifying roles in clinical behavior of MTC. The aim of this work is to elaborate allelic frequencies of the RET proto-oncogene polymorphisms in Turkish sporadic MTC patients and to demonstrate if there is an association between SNP and the clinical disease features, specifically the age at onset of MTC and lymph node involvement at diagnosis. We analyzed the allelic frequencies of SNP of the exon 11, 13, 14 and 15 of the RET proto-oncogene in blood samples from 50 sporadic MTC patients, using the polymerase chain reaction methodology followed by DNA sequencing. The observed allelic frequencies were 24% for G691S polymorphism in exon 11, 29% for L769L polymorphism in exon 13, 5% for S836S polymorphism in exon 14, and 26% for S904S polymorphism in exon 15. These frequencies are similar to those reported in other countries. We did not observe any significant association of all four SNP with the age at onset of MTC. Our results indicate a possible association between the presence of lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis (extent of disease) and L769L or S836S polymorphism. However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions that these two polymorphisms play a significant role in clinical behavior of MTC. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of this polymorphism in the clinical behavior of MTC.",

Cabozantinib has recently been approved for treating advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), but its long-term benefit remains uncertain and dose-dependent adverse events are very common. The present study has demonstrated that 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and a promising anticancer agent under investigation in clinical trials, strengthens anticancer activities of cabozantinib against MTC cells in vitro and in vivo. The activated hypoxia-inducible pathways, which are mainly regulated by HIF-1, contribute to the resistance of hypoxic MTC cells to cabozantinib. Cabozantinib upregulated HIF-1α expression at translational levels and increased the expression of the downstream factors including VEGF, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), HGF, and MET. 2ME2 corrected the activated pathways by cabozantinib through downregulating HIF-1α expression and inhibiting its nuclear translocation in hypoxic MTC cells. Administration of 2ME2 enhanced the efficacy of cabozantinib in suppressing the growth of MTC cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenografts established in mice. Given that 2ME2 targets insensitive hypoxic cancer cells to cabozantinib and can inhibit the activated pathways by cabozantinib, the present results warrant further investigation of 2ME2, particularly in combination with cabozantinib, for the treatment of MTC.

In this study, RET mutations were screened in 47 individuals either affected by MTC or belonging to families with hereditary MTC. Exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and examined by DNA sequence and/or restriction enzyme analysis to detect mutations in purified amplicons. Six MEN 2A families with a germline mutation at codon 634, one FMTC family carrying a mutation at codon 618 and two MEN 2B families with a mutation at codon 918 were identified. In affected members of a MEN 2A family no known RET mutations were observed. Besides, we identified a germline mutation in a patient with apparently sporadic MTC and in two out of three sons, indicating the presence of a sporadic misclassified familial disease.

We analyzed the clinical manifestation and course in 21 patients harboring a de novo RET M918T mutation. Mean age at MEN-2B diagnosis was 14.2 years (range: 1-31 years). All patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). At the time of syndrome diagnosis, oral manifestations (bumpy lips, ganglioneuroma), ocular manifestations (corneal fibers, conjunctivitis sicca), intestinal dysfunctions, musculoskeletal manifestations, and pheochromocytoma were found in 86%, 90%, 74%, 79%, and 19% of the patients, respectively. At the time of follow-up examination, the symptoms were found at higher frequency. Severe intestinal manifestation was predominantly found in patients with prepubertal onset (< or = 12 years) of MTC (n = 4/10) compared with patients with late onset (> 12 years) of MTC (n = 0/11) (40% versus 0%; p = 0.019).

In conclusion, whereas most typical MEN-2B symptoms were found to be age-related, severe intestinal manifestation was found to be predominantly expressed in patients with early onset of MTC. Furthermore, in patients with early onset of MTC who could not be biochemically cured, the long-term prognosis was found to be worse than that of non-cured patients with late onset of MTC, suggesting an additional pathological process in the younger subgroup reinforcing the very high transforming in vitro activity of the M918T RET mutation.",

In MEN-associated CCH and small MTC, bcl-2 was strongly expressed, bcl-x was moderately expressed and bax was only weakly expressed. Advanced tumours and LNM did show a more heterogeneous bcl-2 staining accompanied by an increased bax expression and accelerated proliferation. The rate of apoptosis was extremely low in all investigated tumours. P53 was detectable in three patients with rapidly growing and extensively metastasising MTC. No somatic p53 mutations were found. Hereditary MTC with germline RET mutations at codon 918 (MEN2b) and codon 634 revealed a bias towards a higher proliferation activity at a younger age and are more frequently accompanied by LNM. CCH and MTC are characterised with a preponderance of bcl-2 as a factor blocking the programmed cell death. While MTC, in general, is a slowly growing tumour, a minority of tumours do progress rapidly with high proliferation.

Mean follow-up period was 87 ± 67 months. The seven variables with the highest predictive accuracy for cancer specific mortality included age, gender, postoperative calcitonin, perivascular invasion, pathologic T status, pathologic N status, and M status. These variables were used to create the final nomogram. Discrimination from the final nomogram was measured at 0.77 with appropriate calibration.;We describe the first nomogram that estimates cause-specific mortality in individual patients with MTC.

The predominant BRAF V600E mutation has not been detected in benign thyroid tissue so far, so consequently, this assumedly pathognomonic alteration is qualified to improve the preoperative diagnosis of PTC.;Two hundred ninety preoperatively harvested fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) underwent routine cytologic assessment. BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements. Detected genetic alterations were verified by direct sequencing. Definitive histopathology was obtained in 93/290 lesions following surgery of the respective thyroid nodule.;While cytology alone diagnosed 13/30 malignancies (22 PTCs, 4 FTCs, 1 MTC, 1 UTC, 2 metastases), five additional malignancies were identified by supplementary mutation analysis. Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting. Mutation analyses of PTC-specific genetic alterations improve the preoperative identification and prognostic assessment of thyroid malignancies and therefore enable an optimized surgical strategy.",

Elevated basal calcitonin serum levels call for calcitonin stimulation, the level of which may direct the extent of surgery. Because pentagastrin has become restricted, calcium has increasingly been used instead for stimulation. This study identified a new spectrum of patients demonstrating a false-positive hypercalcitoninemia in the absence of C-cell disease, carrying multinodular goiter (MNG), thyroiditis, and non-MTC thyroid malignancy, and endeavored to explore the feasibility of extrapolating pentagastrin-stimulated to calcium-stimulated calcitonin thresholds.;Altogether, 43 (9.5 %) of 455 patients with nodular thyroid disease revealed increased basal calcitonin serum levels between 2005 and 2012, for which they underwent intravenous stimulation with pentagastrin (31 patients) or calcium gluconate (12 patients) before and after primary thyroidectomy.;Stimulation with calcium gluconate resulted in significantly higher and more variable preoperative calcitonin serum levels after 2 (241.2 vs. 104.9 pg/mL; P = 0.018) and 5 min (240.6 vs. 87.4 pg/mL; P = 0.007) than stimulation with pentagastrin. Stimulation with calcium gluconate produced 10-fold (nodular goiter), 15-fold (thyroiditis), and 21-fold (thyroid neoplasia other than MTC) calcitonin increases over baseline, as opposed to 5-fold, 10-fold, and 8-fold increases after stimulation with pentagastrin. None of the 43 patients, all of whom reverted to undetectable calcitonin serum levels after thyroidectomy, had immunohistochemical evidence of C-cell disease. Subgroup analyses according to gender and thyroid disease, being limited by the low number of patients in each subgroup, did not yield significant differences.;Calcium stimulation yields significantly greater calcitonin levels than pentagastrin stimulation, precluding generalization of pentagastrin-stimulated to calcium-stimulated calcitonin thresholds. After calcium stimulation, false-positive findings appear to be more common in patients of female gender and patients with thyroiditis and thyroid neoplasia other than MTC, potentially effecting surgical overtreatment.",

NVP-AST487, a N,N'-diphenyl urea with an IC(50) of 0.88 mumol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487. Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis are implemented.",

We investigated the histopathologic findings of 16 familial (mean age 32 +/- 21 years, female/male ratio 1.6:1) and 34 sporadic (mean age 58 +/- 15 years; female/male ratio 2.4:1) MTCs with stage T1 comparatively. Patients with hereditary tumors were younger. Hereditary tumors were more often found multifocal (13 of 16 vs 3 of 34; p < 0.001), bilateral (11 of 16 vs 3 of 34; p < 0.001), displaying desmoplastic stroma (14 of 16 vs 19 of 34; p = 0.02), and accompanied by C cell hyperplasia (16 of 16 vs 24 of 34; p = 0.01), but all of these factors were present in some sporadic patients. Only tumors with desmoplastic stroma showed lymph node metastasis, which was observed in eight of the 50 patients. After surgery all patients showed permanent normalization of calcitonin levels. We conclude that 1) morphologic parameters considered to indicate familial MTC risk are of no value in the individual patient, 2) many sporadic MTCs develop on the background of CCH, 3) tumors with desmoplastic stroma are more likely to develop lymph node metastasis, and 4) early detection of MTC permits curative surgery in the majority of patients.",

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",

This neoplasm is often associated with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism, a combination known as the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2A (MEN 2A). The rare association of MTC and pheochromocytoma with multiple mucosal neuromas is called multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2B (MEN 2B). Of those who present with clinical signs and symptoms, almost half die of the disease and others may suffer significant morbidity. By contrast, early diagnosis by screening of family members allows for treatment with thyroidectomy and/or adrenalectomy, which are often curative. Measurement of serum calcitonin before and after stimulation with pentagastrin and/or calcium is mandatory for the diagnosis of MTC. Testing of first-degree relatives of patients with MTC should be started by the age of 3 to 5 years. In families with the MEN 2B syndrome, screening should be started during the first year after birth and include a search for the characteristic phenotype. The mapping of the MEN 2A gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 10 has provided an alternative approach to the diagnosis of MEN 2A gene carriers. Genetic screening using linked markers can now be done with an accuracy of 95% in informative families. Surgery is the treatment of choice for cases of MEN 2, but the extent of surgical resection of the involved endocrine organs is still a subject of debate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Extrathyroidal spread of the tumors was correctly predicted using this procedure. Most tumors were hyperintense or markedly hyperintense on T2WI. T2-weighted signal intensity of the tumor was associated with increased amyloid deposition and high tumor cellularity and low level of fibrosis (r = 0.91, P = .01). Lymph node metastasis was present in 38 (23%) of 168 surgically dissected nodes. The combined use of 4 criteria (nodule size, a minimum-maximum diameter ratio of 0.80 or greater, marked hyperintensity on T2WI, and necrosis in the node) yielded a high detection accuracy (93%) for nodal metastasis, with 74% sensitivity and 98% specificity.;Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for detecting primary and recurrent MTC, and its signal intensity reflects the underlying pathologic changes.",

Through the 'Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs à Calcitonine', we have evaluated the ability to predict the carrier state using DNA probes. Our results suggest that the restriction fragment length polymorphism method can be used to identify individuals at risk within MEN2A families. They may then be followed by conventional endocrine methods for the onset of neoplastic changes, limiting the risk of subsequent metastatic disease. The method also permits the exclusion of further screening for family members at very low risk.

The disease phenotype associated with this mutation was compared with that of Cys634 mutations in some other large MEN 2A families.;The distinct course of disease in the family described here is similar to that in other FMTC families and MEN 2A families with a Cys618 mutation of the RET gene, but clearly different from that in families with a Cys634 mutation. The frequency of pheochromocytomas and parathyroid disease is clearly lower, whereas cure rates and life expectancy are higher. However, in families with a Cys618 mutation, pheochromocytoma and parathyroid disease do occur.;In FMTC families with cysteine codon mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, screening for other endocrinopathies is mandatory, since these may not be MTC-only families. Therefore, we suggest that MEN 2A families should not be subclassified into MEN 2A and FMTC, but rather according to their specific mutation in the RET protein (i.e., for this family MEN 2A RET C618S).",

Up to 25-30% of MTC cases occur as inherited disorders while the remaining cases represent the sporadic form of the disease. In this review, the structure and signalling properties of the RET proto-oncogene in its wild-type and mutant forms, and its role in hereditary and sporadic MTC, are discussed. A full data search was performed through PubMed over the years 2000-2008 with the key words 'medullary thyroid cancer, treatment, molecular biology, RET, molecular mechanism', and all relevant publications have been included, together with selected publications prior to that date. We also review novel therapies for metastatic MTC, especially the tyrosine kinase inhibitors which have activity at multiple receptor subtypes, and summarize the current ongoing trials in this area. While such tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly those affecting RET activity such as vandetanib, sorafenib and sunitinib, are promising, the low rate of partial responses and absence of complete responses in all of the various trials of monotherapy emphasize the need for new and more effective single agents or combinations of therapeutic agents with acceptable toxicity.",

In MTC, radionuclide imaging is employed as complementary method in addition to the routine radiological procedures. Especially, scintigraphy using labelled peptides that specifically bind to the somatostatin receptors is used. Recently a somatostatin analogue labelled with 99mTc (99mTc-HYNIC-TOC) was synthetized. As shown in previous studies, it has favourable pharmacokinetic and clinical characteristics. Aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC in the radionuclide imaging in patients in different stages of MTC. 32 patients in following stages of the disease were studied: evaluation before thyroidectomy (6 patients), remission after surgical treatment (5 patients), stagnation or recurrence after surgical therapy (21 patients). The classification was based on the calcitonin concentrations. The study group included 19 women and 13 men aged 14 to 83 years. Whole body scintigraphy was performed twice: 2 and 4 hours after injection of 20 mCi 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC using dual-head Varicam gamma camera (Elscint). The obtained results were compared to the clinical data and other employed imaging modalities. The scintigraphy using 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC showed 20 true positive, 4 true negative, 1 false positive and 7 false negative results. The sensitivity of this method was 74,1% and specificity - 80,0%. These results are better than those obtained by other authors using other imaging methods. The current study showed high utility of the new peptide tracer in the diagnosis of MTC. Its diagnostic accuracy allows us to recommend it for diagnosis and treatment planning (including radionuclide therapy) in patients with MTC on the routine basis.",

The rs2066827*GT+GG CDKN1B genotype was more frequent in s-MTC patients (62.22%) than in controls (40.21%), increasing the susceptibility to s-MTC (OR=2.47; 95% CI=1.048-5.833; P=0.038). By contrast, the rs11515*CG+GG of CDKN2A gene was more frequent in the controls (32.65%) than in patients (15.56%), reducing the risk for s-MTC (OR=0.174; 95% CI=0.048-0.627; P=0.0075). A stepwise regression analysis indicated that two genotypes together could explain 11% of the total s-MTC risk.

To assess the role of RET in the development of MTC and PC, we screened 14 sporadic MTC, two MTC-derived cell lines, and 5 sporatic PC cases of RET mutations by a systematic analysis of the whole coding sequence, including all intron-exon junctions. In only 6 of the 14 sporadic MTC we were able to detect a RET mutation. Apart from the MET918-->Thr mutation in 5 of the MTC cases, we found a 3-bp deletion in exon 11, only present in the tumor, in another case. Analysis of 2 cell lines revealed the Met918-->Thr mutation in 1 and a Cys634-->Trp mutation in the other cell line. A possible somatic nature of these mutations could not be confirmed because in neither case was constitutive DNA available. We conclude that a large proportion of sporadic MTC must be due to mutations in an unidentified gene(s) other than RET. In none of the sporadic PC cases was a RET mutation found. As PC is a frequent complication in families suffering from von Hippel Lindau disease, for which mutations of the VHL gene are responsible, we also screened the 5 sporadic PC cases for VHL mutations. This revealed a Gly164-->Ser mutation in a single specimen. Thus, in PC, a large majority of tumors are due to mutations in an unidentified gene(s) other than RET and VHL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumour which frequently occurs in the context of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, where it coexists with other usually benign tumours. The clinical picture varies and distant metastases are frequently present at diagnosis. Calcitonin levels are elevated in the presence of metastatic disease. Two MTC cases are presented, which had elevated postoperative calcitonin levels. Imaging revealed lung lesions which were originally attributed to metastatic disease from the MTC. However, at follow-up, these cases presented unusual features. The rapid increase in the lung lesions and the development of hypercalcaemia in the first patient suggested a second unrelated tumour. Biopsy of the lung lesion was compatible with lung adenocarcinoma. In the second patient, the appearance of a liver mass, although calcitonin levels remained stable, led to biopsy of the lesion: this was negative for calcitonin and compatible with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. These MTC cases show that further malignancies may coexist with MTC and may obscure the clinical picture and influence the therapeutic decisions, especially in the case of metastatic disease. Features such as unusual imaging characteristics and the development of hypercalcemia, never encountered in MTC outside the MEN2 syndromes, as well as 'disproportionately' low calcitonin levels, incompatible with extensive metastatic disease, were the factors that led to further work-up. Both the cases subsequently proved to carry an unsuspected second malignancy. It is crucial to discriminate the metastatic lesion attributed to MTC from another coexisting primary malignancy, because different therapeutic strategies are needed for each setting. ",

Planar DMSA scans and dynamic computed tomographic scans failed to localize MTC in any of these patients who had minimal disease. SPECT DMSA scans correctly localized cervical MTC in two of three patients, as proved by subsequent surgical resection.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the involvement of miRNAs in human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and to identify the markers of metastatic cells and aggressive tumour behaviour. Using matched primary and metastatic tumour samples, we identified a subset of miRNAs aberrantly regulated in metastatic MTC. Deregulated miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and validated by in situ hybridisation on a large independent set of primary and metastatic MTC samples. Our results uncovered ten miRNAs that were significantly expressed and deregulated in metastatic tumours: miR-10a, miR-200b/-200c, miR-7 and miR-29c were down-regulated and miR-130a, miR-138, miR-193a-3p, miR-373 and miR-498 were up-regulated. Bioinformatic approaches revealed potential miRNA targets and signals involved in metastatic MTC pathways. Migration, proliferation and invasion assays were performed in cell lines treated with miR-200 antagomirs to ascertain a direct role for this miRNA in MTC tumourigenesis. We show that the members of miR-200 family regulate the expression of E-cadherin by directly targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 mRNA and through the enhanced expression of tumour growth factor β (TGFβ)-2 and TGFβ-1. Overall, the treated cells shifted to a mesenchymal phenotype, thereby acquiring an aggressive phenotype with increased motility and invasion.

Not all patients with progressive MTC respond to current therapy inhibiting RET, demanding additional therapeutic strategies. We recently demonstrated that disrupting mitochondrial metabolism using a mitochondria-targeted agent or by depleting a mitochondrial chaperone effectively suppressed human MTC cells in culture and in mouse xenografts by inducing apoptosis and RET downregulation. These observations led us to hypothesize that mitochondria are potential therapeutic targets for MTC. This study further tests this hypothesis using1-ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methylbenzothiazolin-2-yliden)]-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidenemethyl] pyridinium chloride (MKT-077), a water-soluble rhodocyanine dye analogue, which can selectively accumulate in mitochondria.;The effects of MKT-077 on cell proliferation, survival, expression of RET and tumor protein 53 (TP53), and mitochondrial activity were determined in the human MTC lines in culture and in mouse xenografts.;MKT-077 induced cell cycle arrest in TT and MZ-CRC-1. Intriguingly, MKT-077 also induced RET downregulation and strong cell death responses in TT cells, but not in MZ-CRC-1 cells. This discrepancy was mainly due to the difference between the capacities of these cell lines to retain MKT-077 in mitochondria. The cytotoxicity of MKT-077 in TT cells was mainly attributed to oxidative stress while being independent of TP53. MKT-077 also effectively suppressed tumor growth of TT xenografts.;MKT-077 can suppress cell survival of certain MTC subtypes by accumulating in mitochondria and interfering with mitochondrial activity although it can also suppress cell proliferation via other mechanisms. These results consistently support the hypothesis that mitochondrial targeting has therapeutic potential for MTC.",

This report describes an unusual case of bronchial carcinoid metastatic to the thyroid diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).;A 42-year-old woman with an undiagnosed bronchial carcinoid tumor presented to our clinic with a solitary nodule in the thyroid gland. FNAC of the nodule showed loosely cohesive groups of cuboidal tumor cells with scant, slightly granular cytoplasm; centrally located nuclei with a coarsely granular, salt-and-pepper chromatin pattern and inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunocytochemically the tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin and negative for thyroglobulin, calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen. The cytologic diagnosis of a metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma was confirmed histologically.;Metastasis to the thyroid gland may pose a diagnostic problem, particularly with tumors of neuroendocrine origin, as these have similar cytologic features in various organs. The correct preoperative cytologic diagnosis of metastatic carcinoid tumor in patients without a prior history of cancer and differential diagnosis with MTC are crucial because prognosis, workup and treatment are different in each.",

The purpose of this study was to assess adiponectin and leptin levels in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cases in order to identify novel tumor markers.;This research was based on a case-control study, including 45 patients with medullary thyroid cancer (21 men and 24 women) and 45 healthy controls (24 males and 21 females).

Save for a moderate hypertension, he was asymptomatic and an impalpable thyroid nodule was detected by ultrasonography. A high urinary noradrenaline output and cytology of the masses raised the suspicion of pheochromocytoma. At laparotomy, an adrenal pheochromocytoma and a paracaval paraganglioma were excised. Subsequently, hemithyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology revealed papillary microcarcinoma. A nodule of desmoid tumor was also removed from the abdominal wall. An analysis of RET, APC, and TP53 gene mutations, and of RET and NTRK1 gene rearrangements, yielded negative results. No in vitro transforming activity was detected in the tumor DNA when assayed in transfection experiments.

Targeting RET, therefore, might be useful in tailoring surveillance of MTC patients. Here we showed that theaflavins, the bioactive components of black tea, successfully induced apoptosis in human MTC cell line, TT, by inversely modulating two molecular pathways: (i) stalling PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway that resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss, cytochrome-c release and activation of the executioner caspases-9 and -3, and (ii) upholding p38MAPK/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway via inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK. Over-expression of either constitutively active myristoylated-Akt-cDNA (Myr-Akt-cDNA) or dominant-negative-caspase-8-cDNA (Dn-caspase-8-cDNA) partially blocked theaflavin-induced apoptosis, while co-transfection of Myr-Akt-cDNA and Dn-caspase-8-cDNA completely eradicated the effect of theaflavins thereby negating the possibility of existence of other pathways. A search for the upstream signaling revealed that theaflavin-induced disruption of lipid raft caused interference in anchorage of RET in lipid raft that in turn stalled phosphorylation of Ras and PI3Kinase. In such anti-survival cellular micro-environment, pro-apoptotic signals were triggered to culminate into programmed death of MTC cell. These findings not only unveil a hitherto unexplained mechanism underlying theaflavin-induced MTC death, but also validate RET as a promising and potential target for MTC therapy.",

Our aim was to study the in vitro effect of miR-9-3p on MTC cell viability, autophagy and to investigate the mRNA autophagy gene profile of sporadic versus hereditary MTC. The therapeutic role of miR-9-3p was investigated in vitro using human MTC cell lines (TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells), cell viability assays, and functional mechanism studies with a focus on cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. Post-miR-9-3p transfection mRNA profiling of cell lines was performed using a customized, quantitative RT-PCR gene array card. This card was also run on clinical tumor samples (sporadic: n = 6; hereditary: n = 6) and correlated with clinical data. Mir-9-3p transfection resulted in reduced in vitro cell viability; an effect mediated through autophagy inhibition. This was accompanied by evidence of G2 arrest in the TT cell line and increased apoptosis in both cell lines. Atg5 was validated as a predicted miR-9-3p mRNA target in TT cells. Post-miR-9-3p transfection array studies showed a significant global decline in autophagy gene expression (most notably in PIK3C3, mTOR, and LAMP-1). Autophagy gene mRNAs were generally overexpressed in sporadic (vs. hereditary MTC) and Beclin-1 overexpression was shown to correlate with residual disease.

Somatic mutations in RET, predominantly at codon 918, and very rarely at codon 883, have been found in a proportion of sporadic MTC. We have previously shown that approximately 80% of sporadic MTCs had at least one subpopulation with a somatic RET mutation. Uneven distribution of somatic mutation within a single tumor or among metastases from a single individual was notable. In the present study, we sought to correlate RET expression, as demonstrated by RET immunohistochemistry, with mutation status in sporadic MTC for each tumor. Seventy evaluable subpopulations, belonging to 28 unrelated sporadic cases, comprising primary MTC and metastases, were immunostained with two different polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminus of RET. The regional presence of codon 918 or 883 seemed to coincide with increased RET immunopositivity in at least 62 of 70 (89%, P < 0.000001) tumor subpopulations. The reasons for this concordance are not entirely clear but could be related to either RNA or protein stability. Preliminary studies have suggested that the presence of somatic codon 918 mutation in MTC has a prognostic significance. If these preliminary results prove true, then given our data, we can further explore the feasibility of RET immunocytochemistry as a rapid assessment for the presence of somatic codon 918 for molecular diagnostic and prognostic purposes.",

Gain-of-function mutations in the REarranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene have been identified in 98 % of hMTC and 50 % of sMTC. The aim of this investigation was to identify mutation(s) in the much conserved RET exon10 in Iranian MTC patients. We started screening patients with MTC for RET in 2001. This study included 347 individuals (154 with sMTC, 38 with FMTC, 8 with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A [MEN2A], 3 with MEN2B, and 3 with pheochromocytoma; 207 index cases and 140 relatives). Germline mutation screening of RET exon10 was performed with PCR-DNA sequencing. A total of 14 missense mutations (10 mutations in men and 4 in women) were identified in cysteine codons 611, 618, and 620 (exon10) in 11 patients and three first-degree relatives as follows: four C611Y (three with FMTC and one relative), one C618R (FMTC), one C618S (sMTC), one C620G (sMTC), four C620R (one with FMTC and three with sMTC), and three C620F (one with FMTC and two relatives). In the present study, six different mutations were identified in exon10 of RET in 14 patients with sMTC and FMTC that were restricted to codons 611, 618, and 620, but not in codon 609. This data showed a skewed pattern of RET exon10 mutation compared to other populations. No mutation was found for MEN2A, MEN2B, and pheochromocytoma in exon10 in this population.

Effusions were additionally studied for expression of p53, p21(WAF1/CIP1), Ki-67, and the M(r) 85,000-cleaved fragment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (p85-PARP) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Thirty-two effusions were studied for TrkA, p-TrkA, p53, and p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression using immunoblotting. mRNA expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interleukin 8, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was studied in 63 effusions and all solid tumors using in situ hybridization. Protein expression of bFGF, interleukin 8, and VEGF was additionally studied in 30 effusions using IHC.;NGF, TrkA, and p-TrkA were expressed in carcinoma cells in effusions in 60 of 80 (75%), 64 of 80 (80%), and 15 of 80 (19%) specimens, respectively. In solid tumors, p-TrkA expression was more frequent (52 of 65 tumors; 80%) and was accompanied by p-TrkA expression in endothelial cells. NGF colocalized with bFGF protein (P = 0.016) and mRNA (P = 0.032) in effusions, and with VEGF (P < 0.001) and bFGF (P = 0.008) in solid tumors. In survival analysis, expression of p85-PARP (P = 0.017) and cytoplasmic TrkA (P < 0.001) in effusions predicted better outcome, whereas membrane expression of p-TrkA in solid tumors correlated with poor survival (P = 0.004). Diffuse expression of p53 and Ki-67 was often seen using IHC, whereas p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p85-PARP expression was infrequent and focal. None of these correlated with NGF or TrkA expression or activity.;Coexpression of NGF with molecules involved in angiogenesis and p-TrkA expression in endothelial cells suggest that the proangiogenic role attributed to NGF in vitro and in vivo may be relevant in clinical cancer.

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor developing from the C cells of the thyroid. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several forms of MTC. The deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway seems to contribute to the tumorigenic activity of RET proto-oncogene mutations. Targeting this pathway through specific inhibitors at simple or multiple sites may represent an attractive potential therapeutic approach for patients with advanced MTCs.

The proper management of such patients has been uncertain, but most investigators have advocated repeat testing and evaluation after an interval of several months. The present study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic implications of these modest increases in plasma calcitonin. In 25 kindred members at direct risk for familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), basal peripheral plasma calcitonin (CT) levels were less than 240 pg/ml. Following provocative testing with intravenous calcium or pentagastrin or both, calcitonin values remained below 240 pg/ml in eight subjects (Group A), however, they were mildly elevated (260-580 pg/ml) in 12 subjects (Group B) and moderately elevated (700-940 pg/ml) in five subjects (Group C). Following the transfemoral placement of a catheter into the inferior thyroid vein (ITV), provocative testing was repeated, and ITV and peripheral blood samples were collected simultaneously. Basal ITV plasma CT levels were below 240 pg/ml in all patients in Group A, however, they were mildly elevated (500 pg/ml) in one of the 12 patients in Group B and moderately elevated (800 pg/ml, 1400 pg/ml) in two of the five patients in Group C. Following provocation, ITV plasma CT levels became markedly elevated in one patient in Group A and in all of the patients in Groups B(2520+/-635 pg/ml) and C (6322+/-2598 pg/ml). Thyroidectomy was performed in patients whose ITV plasma CT level was elevated following provocative testing. Medullary thyroid carcinoma of C-cell hyperplasia were evident either on microscopic (1/1 patient in Group A;9/12 patients in Group B; and 2/5 patients in Group C), or gross (3/12 patients in Group B;3/5 patients in Group C) examination of thyroidectomy specimens. In only one of 14 patients was metastatic MTC noted on histologic examination of resected cervical lymph nodes. Postoperative peripheral plasma CT levels were unchanged from basal and less than 240 pg/ml following provocative testing in all but one patient. The present study then provides definitive evidence that patients at direct risk for familial MTC who have even minimally abnormal responses in peripheral plasma CT following provocative testing generally harbor some stage of a C-cell proliferative disorder.

From a surgical point of view, compartment-oriented lymph node dissection, clearing gross, and occult metastases are important for locoregional tumor control. The discovery of missense germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and the close genotype-phenotype correlation in hereditary MTC promoted the worldwide breakthrough of prophylactic thyroidectomy.

MEN2A accounts for 90-95% of childhood MTC cases and is most commonly due to mutations in codon 634 of RET. MEN2B is associated with the most aggressive clinical presentation of MTC and is almost always due to the Met918Thr mutation of RET. Surgery is the primary treatment and only chance of cure, although the advent of targeted therapies seems to be improving progression-free survival in advanced cases. Since the discovery of the role of RET in MEN2A, considerable advances in the management of this syndrome have occurred, and most of the children with MEN2A who have undergone early thyroidectomy will now lead full, productive lives. Strong genotype-phenotype correlations have facilitated the development of guidelines for interventions. Contemporary approaches for deciding the appropriate age at which surgery should take place incorporate data from ultrasonography and calcitonin measurements in addition to the results of genotyping.

        "Doc_abstract":"Knowledge of tumour initiation in human epithelia is limited by sample availability and difficulty in experimental manipulation of human cells. The thyroid is a useful model since, in addition to multiple tumour stages, it presents two distinct 'pathways' of tumorigenesis: 'follicular' tumours, in which ras oncogene mutations occur at high frequency and 'papillary' tumours, associated with ret (or trk) activation. We have used these observations to reconstruct early thyroid tumorigenesis, using amphotropic retroviral vectors. When introduced into normal thyroid epithelial cells, mutant ras induces self-limiting growth of well-demarcated, differentiated colonies--a phenotype consistent with follicular adenoma. Activated ret on the other hand induces smaller, poorly-demarcated colonies with a morphology consistent with early papillary tumours. Mutant p53--which occurs only in the latest stages of thyroid cancer--was without effect. Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence in a human epithelium for alternative initiating oncogenes and their determination of the subsequent 'direction' of tumour development.",

Surgical treatment and histologic analysis confirmed pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in the proband. Surgical exploration revealed the MTC to be metastatic to the liver.;This family demonstrates the characteristic findings of MEN type IIb: prominent corneal nerves in a clear stroma and multiple submucosal neuromas of the conjunctiva, eyelids, lips, and tongue.

The studies were conducted in two cell lines, a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line and a lung tumor (BEN) cell line. Both cell types secrete CT and CgA. Forskolin treatment resulted in a significant increase in the secretion of CT and CgA in each cell line and in CT-specific cytoplasmic RNA in the MTC cell line. Treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in significantly increased secretion of both substances in the lung tumor cells but not in the medullary thyroid carcinoma cells. A significant increase in CT-specific or CgA-specific cytoplasmic RNA was not seen in either cell line. We conclude that the secretion of CT and CgA are regulated in a coordinated fashion in these cell lines through processes that are calcium-mediated and processes that involve cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A. However, each of these regulatory pathways is not always operative in a given tissue. The coordinate regulation of the secretion of CT and CgA supports the hypothesis that CgA participates in the secretory process of its associated hormones.",

Aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC in the radionuclide imaging in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).;30 patients with MTC aged 22-83 years in different stages of the disease were investigated. In 6 patients (group 1) scintigraphy was performed before surgery directly after diagnosis of MTC. Four patients (group 2) were qualified to the study in the phase of remission after surgical treatment that had been confirmed by low concentrations of calcitonin. Twenty patients (group 3) were investigated due to stagnation or recurrence confirmed by persistent hypercalcitoninemia. The scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC (Tektrotyd, POLATOM) was performed 2 and 4 hours post injection of 20 mCi (740 MBq) of the tracer. Other imaging techniques were also employed and analysed in individual cases (US, CT, (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA, (131)I-MIBG, (99m)Tc-MDP, (111)In-octreotide and FDG-PET).;Images obtained 2 and 4 hours p.i. were similar. In group 1, uptake of the tracer was found in the primary tumour of MTC in all patients. In group 2, a false positive result was found in 1 of 6 patients. In the remaining 5 of 6 cases no pathological foci were visualised. In group 3, uptake in the thyroid bed was found in 3 of 20 cases and in the lymph nodes in 14 of 20 patients. In 3 of 20 cases uptake in the bone metastases was found. Globally, sensitivity of the scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC was 86.4%, specificity - 75.0%, and accuracy - 84.6%.;The scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-HYNIC-TOC showed high utility in the diagnosis of MTC. Confirmation of the presence of somatostatin receptors with this method may be used for treatment planning: surgery or radionuclide therapy.",

These results have suggested that dopa uptake ad decarboxylation to dopamine may play an inhibitory role in the control of CT secretion. We studied the effects of either L-dopa or bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, on CT secretion in 11 patients with MTC. Seven patients had multiple endocrine adenomatosis type II (MEA II), 1 had MEA III, and 3 had sporadic MTC. Metastatic disease was confirmed in 8, was probable in 2, and was absent in 1. L-Dopa (500 mg orally) was given to 10 patients in 12 trials. Serum obtained serially for CT measurement RIA over a 4-h period showed a fall in 4 instances in 3 patients; there was no decrease in 7 patients. Absorption of L-dopa was confirmed by the finding of the expected rise in serum GH concentration in all nonresponders except 1. Bromocriptine administered in increasing doses (7.5-50 mg/day) for periods from 4-18 weeks in 5 patients with metastatic disease failed to lower the serum CT concentration in any patient. In 2 of 4 cases, pentagastrin-induced CT release was augmented during bromocriptine administration. These results show L-dopa suppression of CT secretion only in a minority of patients with MTC; the lack of response to bromocriptine suggessts that dopamine receptor stimulation by dopaminergic ergots does not inhibit CT secretion in this same group of patients.",

More than 75% are sporadic tumors and the remainder is familial and MEN2 related. Both sporadic and syndromic MTCs frequently show mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. It has been noted that some MTC cases present an indolent, and some an aggressive clinical course. Ki-67 expression is generally low, with documented exceptions, whereas high expression of Bcl-2 has been reported in majority of the cases. Some studies have shown that Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expressions have prognostic value, as well as RET mutational status. We analyzed 20 unrelated MTC cases for Ki-67, Bcl-2 expression and RET mutations and tested their intercorrelations, correlations to the morphologic features and stage of the tumors, as well as their influence on survival. In 13 of the 20 analyzed cases we found 23 sequence changes distributed in exons 8, 10-13 and 16. There were 11 different missense mutations, single nucleotide deletion with frameshift, and 8 different synonymous mutations. Only 4 of the sequence changes have been previously published. Twelve patients (60%) had tumors expressing one or more missense mutations or single nucleotide deletion and 7 of them (35%) had at least one damaging or possibly damaging RET mutation. Most of the tumors had low Ki-67 expression (mean 6.48% of cells) and high Bcl-2 expression (mean 68.3%). Significantly better survival was observed in cases with low Ki-67 (< 6.5%; p < 0.05), high Bcl-2 expression (> 68.3%; p < 0.01) and younger age at diagnosis (< 51 years; p < 0.05).",

Primary treatment consists of surgical resection including a total thyroidectomy, central neck nodal dissection and functional lateral neck nodal dissections. Most patients with a palpable primary tumour have nodal disease at the time of operation, and nodal involvement is often bilateral.;adequate resection of the primary tumour and cervical lymph nodes is important to optimize outcome and minimize the risk of recurrent disease. Following primary surgical resection, more than 50% of the patients will have recurrent disease with persistent elevation of calcitonin levels.

In view of the possible role of estrogen in the development of thyroid neoplasia, we explored whether proliferation of the human MTC TT cell line, might be curbed by carboxy-daidzein-tBoc (cD-tBoc), a novel isoflavone derivative. Estrogen receptor (ER) α mRNA expression in TT cells was more abundant than ERβ, with a ratio of 48:1. Estradiol-17β (E2) increased DNA synthesis in a dose dependent manner. [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation was also stimulated by the ERβ agonist DPN and the ERα agonist PPT. cD-tBoc inhibited TT cell growth as assessed by thymidine incorporation, XTT assay, and microscopic analysis of culture wells. Creatine kinase specific activity, a marker of the modulatory effects of estrogen on cell energy metabolism, was likewise inhibited. The inhibitory effect of cD-tBoc on [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation could be blocked by the ERβ antagonist PTHPP but not by the ERα antagonist MPP, suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of cD-tBoc on these cells is mediated through ERβ. Furthermore, cD-tBoc potently increased apoptosis and cell necrosis. Co-incubation with the antiapoptotic agent Z-VAD-FMK reversed the growth inhibitory effect elicited by cD-tBoc. These results support the hypothesis that estrogens are involved in the proliferation of MTC. The potent anti-proliferative effects mediated by isoflavone derivatives in the human MTC cell line TT suggest and that this property may be utilized to design effective anti-neoplastic agents.",

Using PFGE, no evidence was found in DNA from lymphocytes of a major DNA rearrangement in two individuals affected with MEN 2A and an individual with MEN 2B compared with normals. Metastatic MTC from one patient has been used to generate a cDNA library which will be used to screen for candidate MEN 2A and MEN 2B gene(s).",

        "Doc_abstract":"A quarter of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene indicating MEN2. Therefore genetic testing is recommended for all patients presenting with MTC. Approximately 40% of MTCs have somatic RET mutations. Somatic mutations in the RAS genes are the next most common driver mutations and appear to be mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation. The single most common somatic RAS mutation is HRASQ61R (c.182A>G), reported in 4.6% to 11% of all MTCs. Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) initially developed to identify the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma (clone SP174) has proven highly sensitive and specific. Because the amino acid sequences for the HRAS and NRAS proteins at codon 61 are identical, we postulated that SP174 IHC would also identify the somatic HRASQ61R mutation. IHC with SP174 was performed on a tissue microarray of 68 patients with MTC including 13 (22.8%) with molecularly confirmed MEN2. Seven (10.3%) MTCs demonstrated positive staining. Six of these patients had already undergone germline RET mutation testing as part of clinical care and were all confirmed to be wild type, excluding the diagnosis of MEN2. All SP174 immunohistochemically positive MTCs were proven to have HRASQ61R mutation (and lack KRASQ61R and NRASQ61R) by Sanger sequencing. All MEN2 patients showed negative staining. We conclude that IHC with SP174 is highly specific for the HRASQ61R mutation in MTC. Because current data suggest that this mutation is mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation, IHC may also have a role in triaging formal genetic testing for MEN2.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene. Systematic analysis for germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in a series of 67 patients with apparently sporadic MTC to determine whether they were true sporadic cases or unsuspected de novo MEN 2 cases.;Sixty-seven unselected patients with sporadic MTC were randomly ascertained from clinic patients from four centres. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by histopathology. Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or from paraffin-embedded tissue and subsequently used for polymerase chain reaction amplification.;Polymerase chain reaction based RET mutation analysis was performed by direct double-stranded cycle sequencing of exons 10, 11, 13 and 16, within which the majority of MEN2 mutations have been shown to occur.;In this series, there was one proven case of germline mutation in RET codon 620, which previously has been shown to be responsible for MEN 2, thus indicating heritable disease. No germline mutation in codon 918, typical of MEN 2B, was found.;A figure of 1.5% germline mutations in 67 apparently sporadic MTC is lower than the incidence of familial disease reported in previous series involving clinical and biochemical screening. The presence of a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a patient with MTC indicates heritable disease. The absence of germline RET exon 10, 11, 13 or 16 mutation appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability, although the presence of a familial form of MTC other than classical MEN 2A cannot be excluded conclusively.",

Clinical biological characteristic of the histological variants was investigated. Sixty cases of PTC were selected. As the important parts of micro ecosystems, ECM, MMPs, CAMs and cytokine were investigated in use of tissue chip and method of immunohistochemistry. In addition, a group of cases of thyroid carcinoma including PTC was analyzed, follicular thyroid carcinoma and medulla thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and their reports of PET-CT as the initiation.;The variants could be divided into three groups in terms of the rate of cervical lymph node metastasis. The high-metastases group included diffuse sclerosing variant, tall cell variant, column cell variant and diffuse follicular variant. The low-metastases group included macrofollicular variant and papillary microcarcinomas. Others are included in the moderate-metastases group. The rate of cervical lymph node metastasis of each group were 83.0% , 55.5% and 34.1% (P < 0. 05), respectively. The 10-year-survival were 75.3% , 95.8% and 100.0% , respectively.

Based on our recent data of CD30 ligand (CD30L)/CD30 receptor (CD30) in these nodules and on the knowledge that this signal stimulates IL-6 production in non-thyroid neoplasms, we wanted to evaluate the immunocytochemical expression of these 2 ligand/receptor systems in a large archival series of paraffin-embedded specimens. These specimens included 6 normal thyroids and 130 thyroid nodules. Co-expression of IL-6 and IL-6R in the epithelial (follicular) cells was observed solely in CD30L/CD30 positive nodules: 5/15 (33%) oncocytic adenomas; 6/30 (20%) follicular adenomas which belonged to 2 variants (4/4 microfollicular toxic and 2/2 hyalinizing trabecular); 9/30 (30%) papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), all belonging to the conventional variant. In PTC the proportion of tumor epithelial cells that were IL6 positive was inversely correlated with the pTNM staging (r=-0.549, p=0.01). All 15 follicular cancers (FTC), all 6 anaplastic cancers (ATC) were IL-6/lL-6R negative; 14/15 FTC and 5/6 ATC were CD30L/CD30 negative. In another oncocytic adenoma, another 4 conventional PTC and another 7 non-conventional PTC CD30L/CD30 expression was associated to expression of IL-6 only. IL-6 staining associated to absent expression of CD30L and CD30 was observed in 7 follicular adenomas (all belonging to variants different from toxic and hyalinizing trabecular), 2 oncocytic adenomas, 5 of the 30 colloid nodules and 2 normal thyroids. Of the 6 tumors arising from the parafollicular C cells (medullary thyroid cancer, MTC), all 3 that had metastasized were CD30L/CD30/IL-6 positive and IL-6R negative; only IL-6 expression was lost in both the local and distant metastases. This finding matched the loss of IL-6 expression in one PTC metastasis. All 3 non-metastasized MTC were IL-6/IL-6R negative, and 1/3 was CD30L positive/CD30 negative. We conclude that only in a subset of both benign and malignant thyroid nodules the IL-6/IL-6R signal could be induced by the CD30L/CD30.

Most of these CTA are highly immunogenic, eliciting a humoral and cellular response in the patients with advanced cancer, and are useful for tumor-specific immunotherapy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a neoplasm derived from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid and occurs in either a sporadic or a familial form. In the present study, we examined by RT-PCR the expression of a number of genes encoding CTA in 23 surgical samples of sporadic MTC. Among the 11 cDNA antigens examined, RAGE, MAGE-4, and GAGE 1-2, were not expressed in any of the tissues. SSX 2 was present only in one tissue, whereas BAGE, GAGE 1-6, MAGE-1, MAGE-2, MAGE-3, and SSX 1-5 were detected in two to five samples. NY-ESO-1 cDNA was the most frequent, being detected in 15 of 23 examined samples (65.2%). Six (26.1%) tissues did not express any CTA-specific mRNA, whereas 10 tumors expressed only one gene (43.5%), 3 (21.4%) expressed 2 genes, and 4 displayed a broad CTA gene expression. NY-ESO-1 expression in primary MTC tissues significantly correlated with tumor recurrence. The presence of specific anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies was searched in the sera of MTC-affected patients examined by ELISA using recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein. A humoral response against this CTA was detected in 6 of 11 NY-ESO-1 expressing patients (54.5%), and in 1 of 6 patients with NY-ESO-1-negative tumor. No anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies were detected in healthy subjects (n = 17). The presence of anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies was searched also in the sera of MTC affected patients whose tissues were not available for CTA analysis. Anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies were present in 15 of 42 sera (35.7%), demonstrating that MTC is a neoplasm frequently associated with humoral immune response to NY-ESO-1. Serological survey may be useful as a way to identify patients with humoral immune response to NY-ESO-1 that provide a new attractive target for vaccine-based immunotherapy of MTC.",

These compounds have been shown to limit growth and suppress hormonal secretion; thus, targeting different signaling pathways may be an effective treatment.;MTC cells were treated with varying combinations of up to 20 mM lithium chloride with either 3 mM VPA or 20 muM SBHA for 48 h.

Additive inhibition of growth was observed with combination therapy. Lower-dose combination therapy achieved greater decreases on NE markers and growth than treatment with any of the drugs alone. Moreover, an increase in the cleavage of the apoptotic markers caspase-3 and PARP was observed.;Combination therapy with lithium chloride and HDAC inhibitors suppresses NE markers and decreases growth via apoptosis of MTC cells in vitro.

In the present study a panel of MoABs against different type 1 chain derived blood group antigens, comprising A, B, H type 1, Le(a), sialyl-Le(a) (CA 19-9), sialyl type 1 structure (CA 50), and Le(b) was used to investigate their immunoreactivity in 38 medullary carcinomas of the thyroid (MTC) and in normal thyroid tissue. The antigens were not expressed in normal follicular or C-cells but were expressed to a various extent in MTC. The studies revealed some characteristic anomalies in the frequency and patterns of tumor-associated antigen expression. The MoAB C 50 stained 32 of the 38 tumors, H type 1 (Le(d)) was demonstrated in 21 and the Le(b) antigen in 27. The Le(a)- and the A antigen were detected in 10 and 12 tumors and the B antigen in one. From the results some rules about the pathways for tumor-associated re-expression of these antigens can be deduced. Le(a) antigen expression was significantly correlated with the CA 50 and Le(b) antigens. The significant relation observed between A-, H1-, and Le(b) antigen formation in MTC suggests the existence of a carcinoma-associated fucosyltransferase committing the type 1 precursor chain along the H1-antigen pathway, and by further glycosylation to an A-, B-, or a Le(b) antigen. Comparative studies of tumor-associated H type 1 and H type 2 antigen expression revealed that H type 2 antigen synthesis was significantly related to a blood type 0 in the host. On the other hand, H1 antigen reactivity was independent of the AB0 blood type of the hosts and was also detected in H type 2 antigen-negative tumors. These findings support the proposal that even in tumor tissue, H antigen expression is still determined by the interaction of at least two different genes. Despite the occurrence of the precursor substance (CA 50) and the formation of the Le(a)- and Le(b) antigens, indicating the presence of a alpha 1,4-fucosyl-transferase (Lewis-enzyme), only two tumors showed the formation of CA 19-9. In conclusion, the investigations demonstrated the dominant re-expression of three type 1 chain-derived structures in MTC, namely H type 1, Le(b), and CA 50. These findings support the general concept demonstrated in other carcinomas, that fucosyl- and sialyltransferases are preferentially activated in MTC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Because of the increased metastatic rates in certain genetic backgrounds, early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improved patient outcomes. Our objective was to summarize recent findings related to the genetics, diagnosis, and management of MTC and PHEO/PGL.;A literature review was performed.;MTC is primarily associated with mutations in the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene. Determining the specific genetic mutation can guide patient management and screening. Early detection and appropriate surgical management of MTC is critical to prevent or limit metastatic spread, as treatment options for patients with metastatic disease are limited. PHEO/PGL also has a strong genetic component, with approximately 50% of cases linked to germline and somatic mutations in 15 genes. Although most PHEO/PGLs are benign, factors such as genetic background, size, tumor location, and high methoxytyramine levels are associated with higher rates of metastatic disease. The state-of-the-art diagnosis and localization of PHEO/PGLs is based on measurement of plasma metanephrines and methoxytyramine and functional imaging studies. For both PHEO/PGL and MTC, surgery is the only curative treatment. Treatment options for patients with metastatic disease are limited.;As genetic testing becomes more widely available, the diagnosis of MTC and PHEO/PGL will be made earlier due to routine screening of at-risk patients.

The identification and characterization of novel RET mutations involved in MTC is valuable, as RET gene testing plays a crucial role in the management of these patients. In an MTC patient, we have identified a germline c.1996A>G transition in heterozygosis leading to K666E substitution. In addition, the conservative S904S (c.2712C>G) and the non-conservative functional G691S (c.2071G>A) polymorphisms have been identified. Through functional studies, we demonstrate for the first time that K666E is a gain-of-function mutation with oncogenic potential, based on its ability to transform NIH3T3 cells. It was not possible to define whether K666E is a de novo or inherited RET variant in the patient, as the family history was negative for MTC, and the carrier status of family members could not be tested. Our results, together with a recent report of co-segregation of the mutation in three MTC families, suggest that K666E is a causative MTC mutation. As we have shown that the same patient allele carries both K666E and G691S variants, the latter known to increase downstream RET signaling, a possible role for the G691S polymorphism has also been investigated. We have demonstrated that, although RET-G691S is not oncogenic per se, it enhances the transforming activity of the RET-K666E mutant, thus suggesting a modifier role for this functional polymorphism.",

CCH can be classified as physiological (reactive) or neoplastic. Reactive CCH has no malignant potential and can be observed in association with many other thyroid diseases (including differentiated thyroid cancer); in contrast, neoplastic CCH should be considered as a preneoplastic stage in the spectrum of C cell disease, ultimately leading to the development of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Neoplastic CCH is commonly observed in patients with germ-line mutations in the RET oncogene (commonly in families with a history of hereditary MTC, i.e. familial MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2)). CCH should be considered in patients with hypercalcitoninemia without nodular thyroidopathy. Total thyroidectomy, which is commonly performed for the majority of thyroid diseases, is an adequate treatment and achieves cure, even in patients with neoplastic CCH. There is no role for cervical lymph node dissection in patients with pure CCH. In conclusion, reactive CCH has no malignant potential, in contrast to neoplastic CCH. Total thyroidectomy achieves cure of patients with CCH.",

More than 80% of the tumors harbored apoptotic cells. Tumors in individuals who had died of the MTC disease had a higher percentage of apoptosis. All cases demonstrated immunoreactivity to bcl-2 disease-free individuals had a higher rate than those with recurrent disease. No obvious pattern could be discerned in the relation of p53 or Ki-67 to the outcome of the disease. An inverse correlation between bcl-2 and apoptosis (r=-0.81; p < 0.01) was demonstrated. bcl-2 was significantly (p = 0.014) associated with apoptosis even after taking both p53 and Ki-67 into consideration, but these two factors were unrelated to apoptosis. None of the factors studied were correlated to crude survival, either in univarlate or in muiltivariate analyses. This study established that bcl-2 immunoreactivity is closely associated with apoptosis in MTC, suggesting that a down-regulation of the bcl-2 protein is related to a more aggressive growth rate and might be a useful marker for the evaluation of MTC.",

Treatments were performed with 3,330 MBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of 3 months.;The imaging procedure was positive in all eight patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in five patients, 131I/123I-MIBG imaging in four patients. With respect to the number of metastatic lesions, MIBG imaging was less effective than octreotide. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified one patient to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and three patients with 131I-MIBG. An overall antitumor effect was observed in all four patients, one with partial remission and three with stable disease. No relevant toxicity was observed.;The combined imaging can increase the detection rate of metastatic foci in patients with MTC and identify more patients for effective radionuclide treatment.

There was, however, a significant correlation with the pTNM classification and UICC staging. The prognosis for patients with score 0 was significantly better than score 1 patients. CD15 immunoreactivity appears to be a predictive factor in sporadic and hereditary MTC.

As CT, which arises from the precursor protein preprocalcitonin (PPCT), is expressed by almost all MTC cases, these molecules may represent target antigens for immunotherapy against MTC. In our study we investigated whether DNA immunization is able to induce cellular and humoral immune responses against human PPCT (hPPCT) in mice. Antigen-encoding expression plasmids were delivered intradermally by gene gun. One group of mice received DNA encoding hPPCT only. Two groups were coinjected with mouse cytokine genes. We observed in lymphocyte proliferative assays substantial proliferation against hPPCT in mice coinjected with the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene, in contrast to mice vaccinated with hPPCT expression plasmid only. In addition, codelivery of the GM-CSF gene augmented the frequency of anti-hPPCT antibody seroconversions in sera of immunized animals, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results illustrate that cellular and humoral immune responses against hPPCT can be generated by DNA immunization and increased by coinjection of the GM-CSF gene. Our findings may have implications for the use of DNA immunization as a potential novel immunotherapeutic treatment for patients suffering from progressive MTC.",

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced. We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 14), serine/threonine kinase 11 (N = 11), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 6), mutL homolog 1 (N = 4), Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 3) and MET proto-oncogene (N = 3). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5' fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional PCR analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing, confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion, indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In conclusion, we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC. Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The present study determined the topographical distribution of [125I] nerve growth factor in rat brain at various time points following an intraventricular injection. In addition, we quantified the tissue content of nerve growth factor in various brain tissues following the injection. Autoradiographic analysis of the distribution of [125] nerve growth factor indicated that the neurotrophin is rapidly distributed within the entire ventricular system. However, penetration of nerve growth factor into the brain parenchyma was very limited. At early time points following an injection of nerve growth factor, there was an accumulation of label in the immediate vicinity of the lateral ventricle and third ventricle with predominant labeling around the septum, hypothalamus and cerebellum. By 24 h following nerve growth factor administration, there was discreet labeling of the lateral septum, medial septum, diagonal band, hypothalamus, olfactory tubercle and nucleus of the olfactory tract, and some label was present in the hippocampus and subiculum. Quantitative ELISA of nerve growth factor in brain tissues 1 h following the injection indicated a 446% and 133% increase over basal levels of nerve growth factor in the basal forebrain and hippocampus, respectively. At 24 h nerve growth factor levels measured in brain were not significantly different from endogenous basal levels as determined by ELISA, whereas there were high quantities of 125I present in the thyroid gland, suggesting that the administered [125I] nerve growth factor was rapidly degraded following the intraventricular injection. We observed a similar labeling pattern of the medial septum/diagonal band cholinergic cell body group 24 h following either an intraventricular or intrahippocampal injection of [125I] nerve growth factor. There was a good correlation between the [125I] nerve growth factor labeling pattern and the presence of trkA messenger RNA. This suggested that, at least in the septohippocampal pathway, nerve growth factor accumulated in a region which contained trkA nerve growth factor receptors. Thus, this study shows that after a single unilateral intraventricular injection of nerve growth factor into rat brain there is effective uptake by diagonal band/septal cells on both sides of the brain, and by cells whose positions correlate with the locations of cholinergic and trk A messenger RNA-expressing cells. Significant uptake was also observed in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. The very limited penetration and rapid degradation of intraventricularly administered nerve growth factor suggests that tissue penetration may be a limiting factor when attempting to influence brain neurons by exogenous neurotropic factors.",

Exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Sixty-seven people were found to carry pathogenic, germline mutations in the RET gene. In exon 10, C609F, C609R and C609Y (3 families), C618G, C618F (2 families), and C620G (4 families) mutations were identified. In exon 11, C634R (8 families) and C649L mutations (1 patient) were found. Five families carried Y791F mutation in exon 13. One patient with PTC revealed the presence of a Y791F mutation. In 3 families, exon 14 of the RET gene harbored the following mutations: V804L (1 patient), E819K (1 patient) and R844Q (1 patient). In 1 family, the S891A mutation was identified in exon 15, 3 families were found to carry mutations in exon16, R912P in 1 family and M918T in 2 families. In summary, of the 235 patients affected by MTC, 46 (19.6%) carried pathogenic RET gene mutations, 1 patient with RET mutation had kidney carcinoma, and 1 had PTC. The results show the occurrence of a variety of mutations prevalent in patients with MTC in the population of Central Poland.

The age-related risk of MTC is associated with the type of RET mutation. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors associated with recurrent MTC in MEN 2 patients. METHODS In a nationwide case-control study, all patients who underwent total thyroidectomy in the Netherlands under the age of 20 years were classified into standard (1), high (2), or very high risk (3) for MTC based on RET-mutation type. Disease-free patients were compared with those with recurrent disease. RESULTS A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Sixty-six percent had MTC on histology, the youngest being 1 year old. Codon 634 was most affected. Sixteen (18%) patients had persistent or recurrent disease, one of whom died. Significantly associated determinants of outcome in univariate analysis were higher age at surgery, no age-appropriate prophylactic surgery according to risk level, elevated preoperative calcitonin levels, affected codon, and the presence of lymph node metastases at surgery. On multivariate analysis only age of surgery was the single independent factor associated with persistent disease. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic thyroidectomy beyond the recommended age is associated with persistent/recurrent disease. In addition, codon 634 mutation is associated with a high risk of recurrence requiring early surgery for all these patients.",

Therefore, we generated autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DCs from 10 patients suffering from advanced MTC for repeated vaccination. Mature DCs were derived from peripheral blood monocytes by using CD14 magnetic bead selection and subsequent culture in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 4, and tumor necrosis factor alpha with or without addition of IFN-gamma. DCs were loaded with tumor lysate and further injected into a groin lymph node. Toxicity, tumor marker profile, immune response, and clinical response were determined.;Vaccination was well tolerated and induced a positive immunological response in all of the tested patients as evaluated by in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity or in vitro intracytoplasmic IFN-gamma detection assay. Three patients had a partial response, 1 patient presented a minor response, and 2 patients showed stable disease. The remaining 4 patients had progressive disease.;These data provide strong evidence that vaccination with tumor-lysate pulsed DCs results in the induction of a specific immune response in patients suffering from MTC.

Here, we investigate whether the RET variants L769L, S836S, and G691S/S904S influence disease presentation in hereditary or sporadic MTC patients. One hundred and two patients with hereditary MTC and 81 patients with sporadic MTC attending our institution were evaluated. The frequencies of RET polymorphisms in hereditary MTC were as follows: L769L, 17.3%; S836S, 7.95%; and S904S/G691S, 18.2%. No associations were observed between these polymorphisms and pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, lymph node, or distant metastasis. However, patients harboring the S836S variant were younger than those without this allele (17±8.2 vs 28.6±14.4 years, P=0.01), suggesting that these patients had metastases at a young age. Accordingly, the cumulative frequency of local and/or distant metastases as estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves showed that lymph node and distant metastases occurred earlier in patients harboring the S836S variant (P=0.003 and P=0.026 respectively). The S836S allele frequency was higher in sporadic MTC patients than in controls (10.5 vs 3.1%, P=0.01). Individuals harboring the S836S variant were younger (38.6±13.3 vs 48.5±16.7 years, P=0.02) and showed a higher percentage of lymph node and distant metastases (P=0.02 and P=0.04 respectively). Kaplan-Meier estimates of lymph node and distant metastases yielded distinct curves for patients with or without the S836S allele (P=0.002 and P=0.001 respectively). Additional analyses using a COX regression model showed that the S836S variant was independently associated with metastatic disease (hazard ratio 2.82 (95% confidence interval 1.51-5.26), P=0.001).

        "Doc_abstract":"Recurrent and metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) remains difficult to treat due to its limited responsiveness to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and imaging. To investigate an alternative therapeutic approach, we examined the feasibility of targeting gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy delivered by adenoviral vectors to MTC. We previously described a modified human calcitonin (CT)/CT gene-related peptide promoter that produced increased expression while maintaining specificity for MTC cells. In this study, we introduced an additional level of specificity by using cell-specific splicing and examined whether the selectivity of the gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy for MTC was enhanced when both the promoter and splicing features were combined in a single transcription unit. Two replication-defective adenoviruses were constructed that expressed the Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene under the transcriptional control of a modified T2 promoter (Ad.T2-PNP) or the T2 promoter in combination with a CT minigene cassette in which the PNP gene was imbedded within the CT gene exon 4 (Ad.T2-CT/PNP). The specificity of PNP expression by Ad.T2-PNP, Ad.T2-CT/PNP, and control viruses in the MTC cell line, TT, and in a panel of non-MTC cell lines was evaluated. The highest level of PNP gene expression and the most effective cell killing in the presence of prodrug occurred in TT cells infected with Ad.T2-PNP, followed by Ad.T2-CT/PNP. Infection of most non-MTC cell lines, even with high multiplicities of Ad.T2-PNP, produced only low-level PNP expression that resulted in minimal cell killing in the presence of prodrug. High-level expression of PNP and effective cell killing was observed with both adenoviral gene constructs. The highest level of cell specificity was achieved with the combined use of promoter and splicing regulation in the Ad.T2-CT/PNP virus.",

The objectives of this study are to describe the rare M918V RET mutation discovered in 8 MTC kindreds from Brazil lacking the MEN 2B phenotype classically observed in M918T patients and to investigate the presence of a founder effect for this germline mutation. Eight apparently sporadic MTC cases were diagnosed with the germline M918V RET mutation. Subsequently, their relatives underwent clinical and genetic assessment (n = 113), and M918V was found in 42 of them. Until today, 20/50 M918V carriers underwent thyroidectomy and all presented MTC/C-cell hyperplasia; the remainder carriers are on clinical follow-up. None of the M918V carriers presented clinical features of MEN 2B. Their clinical presentation was heterogeneous, and the age at tumor diagnosis ranged from 24 to 59 years. Lymph node metastases were present in 12/20 patients, and presumable distant metastases in 2/20; in contrast, we observed a carrier of up to 87 years of age without evidence of MTC. Ethnographic fieldwork and haplotype analyses suggested that the founder mutation first settled in that area fifteen generations ago and originated from Portugal. Our study is the first to demonstrate the RET M918V mutation co-segregating in 8 familial MTC kindreds with validated evidence of a founder effect. We suggest that M918V MTC should be clinically considered an American Thyroid Association (ATA) moderate-risk category.",

After 48 hours, the cells were analyzed for levels of hASH1 and chromogranin A by Western blotting and for calcitonin production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.;Activation of raf-1 in the TT-raf cells resulted in high levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK1/2, a morphologic transdifferentiation, and a decrease in chromogranin A and calcitonin levels that are associated with a reduction in hASH1 production. Furthermore, using MEK inhibitors, we demonstrated that these raf-1-mediated changes are dependent on MEK but not ERK1/2 activation.;hASH1 down-regulation by raf-1 in MTC cells is associated with a significant decrease in hormone production.

In hypercalcemia patients with primary hyperparathyroidism the plasma CT is normal or only marginally elevated. It is speculated that the raised levels in pregnant and lactating women and in new-born infants prevent excessive bone destruction at times of greater physiological need for calcium. Larger molecular weight forms than monomeric CT (1--32) are circulating at least in plasma of patients with calcitonin-producing tumors and in renal insufficiency. The biological function of these larger molecular weight forms is not yet known. The discrepancies among the results of different laboratories can in part be explained by the immunoheterogeneity of the hormone and the different antigenic recognition sites of the antisera used. The measurement of plasma CT levels is nevertheless important for the diagnosis of MTC and may prove useful in some patients with malignant tumors unrelated to the C-cells of the thyroid gland.

However, the same is not true for a resource-poor country, where clinicians are still struggling to diagnose and adequately manage this relatively uncommon thyroid malignancy. We hereby present our experience of managing MTC at a tertiary care referral center in North India.;This was a retrospective study conducted between January 1990 and July 2009. Demographics, clinical profiles, details of surgical procedures, and follow-up records were reviewed.;A total of 71 patients with MTC were identified. Mean age of this group was 39.9±14.1 years, and men outnumbered women 1.7:1. Some 84.5% of patients had seemingly sporadic MTC, and 15.5% had familial MTC (MEN2a=14.1%, MEN 2b=1.4%). All patients had a thyroid nodule at the time of presentation. Mean tumor diameter was 4.9 cm. Cervical lymphadenopathy, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastases were present in 59%, 7.2%, 10%, and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Staging showed that 4.8% of patients were stage I, 17.5% stage II, 14.3% stage III, and 63.6% stage IV. Treatment was as follows: 92.6% of patients had total thyroidectomy (primary or secondary); 67.6% central compartment lymph node dissection, 62.3% lateral cervical lymph node dissection, and 7.2% trans-sternal mediastinal lymph node dissection performed.

The 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 74.6% and 58%, respectively.;The majority of the patients with MTC presented at stage IVa, contributing to the high rate of persistent hypercalcitoninemia. Despite a policy of observation and intervening only in overtly symptomatic patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia, overall survival (OS) in our study was comparable to other series, reinforcing the belief that persistent hypercalcitoninemia has an indolent course in most patients.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of MTC patients followed-up at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology Francisco Gentil (Lisbon, Portugal). For that purpose, a retrospective analysis of 140 MTC patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2010 was performed. The results indicated that patients with hereditary MTC (11.4%) were significantly younger than patients with sporadic MTC. Of the latter, 34.3% had no clinical suspicion of MTC prior to surgery. The sensitivity of cytology and calcitonin (CT) assay in diagnosing MTC were 51.3 and 98.7%, respectively. All familial index cases and 69.0% of sporadic cases presented with advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis, while 73.0% of familial MTC detected by genetic/pentagastrin screening were diagnosed at the early stage of the disease. Biochemical cure (BC) was achieved in 39.7% of patients and, of these, only 6.5% relapsed. The 5 and 10-year survival rates were 79.3 and 73.6%, respectively. Age >45 years (P=0.026), advanced stage at diagnosis (P<0.001) and absence of BC (P<0.001) were predictors of a worse prognosis on univariate analysis. However, when the patients detected by genetic/pentagastrin screening were excluded from the analysis, age was no longer a prognostic factor, although disease stage remained a significant prognostic factor. On multivariate analysis, BC was the only factor with a significant impact on prognosis (P=0.031). In addition, the present study confirmed that the majority of patients were diagnosed at advanced stages, and CT determination was observed to be more sensitive than cytology to diagnose MTC. Patients at early stages were more prone to achieve BC, which was a favorable prognostic factor. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports for the first time that age at diagnosis is not a predictor of survival for patients with MTC when cases diagnosed by genetic/pentagastrin screening (who are usually young patients at the initial stages of the disease), are excluded from the analysis.",

Here we show that nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is activated in RET-associated C-cell carcinoma specimens. TT cells, a human MTC cell line expressing MEN 2A type RET, display transcriptionally active RelA(p65) in the nucleus. NF-kappaB activity in these cells is attributable to constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity and high turn over of IkappaBalpha. RET harboring the mutations C634R (MEN 2A) or M918T (MEN 2B), in contrast to wild-type RET, activates a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter construct upon transient transfection in HeLa cells. We show that the prototype RET mutation C634R enhances phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by IKKbeta but not by IKKalpha. RET-induced NF-kappaB and IKKbeta activity requires Ras function but does neither involve the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase nor the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. In contrast, RET-induced NF-kappaB activity is dependent on Raf and MEKK1. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity results in cell death of TT cells and blocks focus formation induced by oncogenic forms of RET in NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggest that RET-mediated carcinogenesis critically depends on IKK activity and subsequent NF-kappaB activation.",

We studied four patients with thyroid nodules, three of whom underwent surgical neck exploration, after an erroneous diagnosis of MTC because of falsely high serum CT eventually proved to be due to HA. One patient had a lingual thyroid, two autoimmune thyroiditis and the fourth a colloid goiter. The minimal incremental CT response to calcium infusion raised our suspicion of possible false high CT values due to HA. There was no linearity of the CT values obtained by testing serial dilutions of the sera in the CT assay, which employs two monoclonal mouse anti-CT antibodies. Addition of normal mouse gamma globulin eliminated the interference by HA in the sera of two patients. Serum assayed in a polyclonal radioimmunoassay using goat anti-CT antibodies gave normal CT values. Finally, incubation of the sera in Heterophilic Blocking Tubes (HBT) eliminated the false CT immunoreactivity. A spontaneous change of the CT serum concentrations was noticed in three patients over several months, apparently due to changing titles of HA. We suggest that, in patients a) whose CT response to calcium or pentagastrin infusion is minimal despite high basal CT values, b) with autoimmune thyroiditis and c) in whom an unexpected change in serum CT concentrations occurs, the possibility of spuriously high CT values because of circulating HA should be considered.",

The radiopharmaceutical that showed the greatest preoperative tumor uptake was selected for intraoperative RGS. Surgery was performed 24 hours after the administration of (111)In-pentetreotide or 4 hours after the injection of (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA. Furthermore, three male patients underwent surgery who suffered from recurrent pheochromocytoma (injection of 180 MBq iodine 123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine [(123)I-MIBG] 4--5 hours before surgery).;Overall, lesion detection sensitivities in patients with MTC for computed tomography, (111)In-pentetreotide, and (99m)Tc(V)-DMSA were 32%, 34%, and 65%, respectively. Surgical palpation identified lymph node metastases of recurrent MTC with a sensitivity of 65%, whereas RGS localized 64 malignant lesions (sensitivity, 97%). Altogether, 71 lesions could be excised, 5 of which were adjudged false positive with respect to MTC metastases. Both surgical palpation and RGS localized all paravertebral subdiaphragmatic lesions (size > or = 2 cm) of recurrent pheochromocytoma seen in the preoperative MIBG scan.;RGS was capable of localizing more and smaller metastases of MTC compared with conventional imaging modalities and surgical palpation. However, the relatively high radioligand accumulation in the kidneys ((111)In-pentetreotide) and the dense hepatic and biliary signals using MIBG limited their use for intraoperative detection of tumors in the area of the adrenal gland.",

MTC cells were inoculated from tissue culture into eight Wag-Rij rats. One month later blood was drawn before and after the intravenous injection of calcium, and plasma levels of CGRP and calcitonin (CT) levels in that blood were determined by radioimmunoassay. The tumor was examined for content of CGRP and of CT by means of radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemistry. The tumor was divided and portions were passed to another eight rats. One month later, the studies were repeated. The tumor was passed two additional times (four passages in all). Controls consisted of non-tumor-bearing Wag-Rij rats. Basal levels of plasma CGRP in control rats (7 +/- 1 ng/ml) were unaffected by calcium stimulation. In tumor-bearing rats, the plasma CGRP level, which was initially slightly elevated (15 +/- 7 ng/ml), rose progressively with passages to 279 +/- 79 ng/ml in the third passage and fell to normal values at the end of passage four. Hypercalcemia had no effect on plasma CGRP levels in tumor-bearing rats but did stimulate the release of CT in both control and tumor-bearing rats, although it is not clear whether this release was from the tumor or from normal thyroid parafollicular cells in these tumor-bearing rats. We conclude that rat MTC synthesizes and releases CGRP but, unlike CT, CGRP appears unresponsive to calcium stimulation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Routine calcitonin assay programs and recent studies on the natural history of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have greatly added to our understanding of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) and refined its classification. This article is an update on CCH physiopathology related to clinical presentation. With this combined approach, two types of CCH that differ by their physiological characteristics can be identified: neoplastic CCH and reactive (also called physiological) CCH. Neoplastic CCH is caused by a germline mutation of the RET protooncogene in a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome. It progresses to MTC following a time line that depends on the RET mutation involved. CCH may actually be a misnomer for a neoplastic condition that some authors have proposed to call \"in situ-MTC\". Reactive CCH is considered to be caused by a stimulus that is external to the C-cell, and its premalignant potential is not documented. Many situations such as hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidy, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or follicular tumors have been associated with reactive CCH, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. But C-cell density in normal patients is subject to important variability, and several studies have demonstrated the dramatic male predominance in physiological CCH when hypercalcitoninemia was a random discovery. These data suggest that a number of conditions which were previously associated with reactive CCH might be purely fortuitous. Our clinical/pathological confrontation contributes to appropriately distinguishing between various CCH types, and in turn to identify the best way of managing patients.",

Although its varied cytomorphologic features are well described in literature, very little is mentioned about the morphologic manifestation of its secretory activity. This study, based on nine fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples from eight MTC patients, is an attempt to present the varied cytomorphologic features suggesting secretory activity in MTC as observed in Papanicolaou and MGG stained FNA smears and correlate them with the immunocytochemical (ICC) staining for calcitonin performed on FNA smears and the serum calcitonin values. The average number of cells in these nine samples was as follows: oval/triangular/plasmacytoid (56.7%), small round (23.6%), spindle-shaped (12.7%), and miscellaneous (7.1%). The cytomorphological features suggesting secretory activity, viz., fine cytoplasmic vacuoles, azurophillic granules, marginal vacuoles, and intracytoplasmic lumina (ICL) with secretions were present in eight, eight, five, and six samples, respectively. Material likely to be amyloid, based on morphological features, was present extracellularly in three samples and both intracellularly and extracellularly in six samples. Immunocytochemically, all the nine samples stained for calcitonin and all the three stained for chromogranin showed positive cytoplasmic reaction in the neoplstic cells. The background amyloid (in six samples), the coarse cytoplasmic granules (in two samples), and the contents of ICL (in one sample) were found to be positively stained for calcitonin. The intracytoplasmic secretory material appeared to be diffusing out of some cells both in the routine MGG stained smears and in the smears stained for calcitonin. Histopathology reports of seven samples in six patients confirmed the cytodiagnosis of MTC in all. Baseline serum calcitonin values in three cases and postoperative serum calcitonin levels during follow-up in three others were high. Thus, our study highlighted the morphological manifestations of secretory activity in MTC and the nature of secretory material as calcitonin, supported by immunocytochemical staining and serum calcitonin level.",

To determine the cell-specific component of this fragment, oligonucleotides containing the individual elements were inserted in front of a minimal CT promoter and tested for reporter protein production in CT-positive (TT) and -negative (RO-D81 and HeLa) cells. In TT cells, using two copies of E2 or four copies of Ets increased minimal promoter activity a 20-40 fold. Using two copies of E3 had no effect on minimal promoter activity. In CT-negative MTC cells (RO-D81), the Ets response element was active but the two copies of E2 were not. Similar results were obtained with the non-neuroendocrine cell-line HeLa. I therefore concluded that E2 was the cell-type-specific component of the enhancer. An E2-specific binding protein was detected in both MTC cell lines but not in HeLa. This protein had different mobility and DNA-binding specificity in CT-positive TT cells and CT-negative RO-D81 cells. In conclusion, the CAGCTG motif of E2 modulated the cell-specific transcription of the CT gene, and its inactivation in CT-negative MTC cells correlated with modifications in its binding proteins.",

Only in rare cases, like in human medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC), telomerase activity (TA) is low or undetectable; however, this does not limit tumours to become clinically significant. Here, we report that very low TA (below 5% of HEK293) observed in MTC cell strains derived from different patients, although not sufficient for immortalising the cells, is necessary for prolonging their replicative life span. Telomere erosion led to induction of a crisis period after long-term in vitro cultivation, which was reached earlier when treating the cells with MST-312, a telomerase inhibitor at non-toxic concentrations. Crisis was bypassed either by ectopic hTERT introduction or by infrequent spontaneous immortalisation, the latter of which was always associated with telomerase reactivation and changes of the cellular phenotype. While confirming the high importance of telomerase for tumour development, these data draw attention to the relevance of low TA: although insufficient for telomere stabilisation, it allows MTC cells to reach more population doublings, increasing both cell numbers as well as the risk of accumulating mutations and thus might support the development of clinically significant MTC.",

All scintigraphic findings were correlated with contemporaneous CT or MRI studies. CT, MRI and bone scans showed 42 (26 bone, 16 soft tissue) metastatic sites in 11 of the 14 patients. In the remaining three patients no lesions were detected during diagnostic evaluation. 99mTc(V)-DMSA showed all of the soft tissue metastases but could not show two bone lesions.

In 95% of MEN2A families and 85% of FMTC families, the germ-line missense mutations underlying the disease affect one of the five cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the RET proto-oncogene. The mutated codons are 609, 611, 618 and 620 in exon 10, and 634 in exon 11. The most frequent mutations (80% in MEN2A, and 50% in FMTC) occur in codon 634. In our laboratory, the mutations of the codon 634 was detected by two independent methods: DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP).

Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are the underlying cause of the MEN2 syndromes and some cases of HSCR. In this report, we show that Cys 618 Arg mutation cosegregates with familial MTC and HSCR in two Moroccan Jewish families in which no involvement of pheochromocytoma or parathyroidism was observed. A single haplotype shared by chromosomes bearing the Cys 618 Arg mutation in both families strongly suggests a founder effect for this mutation. We have observed in our and in several other previously reported families, an excess of maternal over paternal mutated RET alleles in offsprings affected by HSCR. We suggest that parental imprinting may play a role in the ethiology of HSCR caused by mutations in the RET protooncogene.",

Seventeen patients had adjuvant or palliative EBRT delivered to 41 sites. Six patients initially had adjuvant EBRT (median, 60.80 Gy); none had relapse in the treated area. Five patients with locoregional recurrence after surgery were treated (median, 59.40 Gy), and durable disease control was achieved in 3. Twelve patients received palliative EBRT to 29 sites of metastatic disease (median, 30.00 Gy), which provided sustained symptom relief at 45% of sites.

Amino acid sequences from one form of purified rat MTC alpha-amidating enzyme have been utilized to design oligonucleotide probes for isolating cDNAs encoding this protein. Sequence analysis of multiple cDNA clones indicates that there are at least two types of cDNA in rat tissues. These cDNAs differ primarily by the absence (type A) or the presence (type B) of a 315-base internal sequence. Additional heterogeneity in the 3' coding regions of the different mRNAs has also been found. Both types of cDNA predict primary translation products that are preproenzymes which must be post-translationally processed at both their amino and carboxyl termini. Sequence analysis of the purified peak III protein from rat MTC demonstrates that the type A mRNA encodes this 75-kDa protein. This analysis also provides support for the assignment of the C-terminal processing site. In addition, data are presented which demonstrate that type B mRNA is also functional.

Phorbol at 1000 nM resulted in 4- and 10-fold increases in CgA secretion and 3- and 5-fold increases in CT secretion by the MTC and M103 cells, respectively. The secretory patterns were similar for CgA and CT. In the M103 cells the same treatment resulted in a 100% increase in CgA-specific cytoplasmic RNA and a 70% increase in CT-specific cytoplasmic RNA. The secretion of CgA and CT was coordinately regulated by phorbol in both MTC and M103 cells, and related mRNA changes could be detected in the M103 cells.

In non-familial cases, the diagnosis can be suggested by the presence of GI symptoms, ganglioneuromas, and/or the typical facies. The intestinal innervation pattern, analyzed with the acetylcholinesterase technique, is pathognomonic for MEN 2B. In our protocol a rectal biopsy is, therefore, the first measure.

A total of 120 MTC patients were classified into three DRS groups based on their responses to initial therapy. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to TNM staging and DRS. In the DRS, 70, 23 and 7 % of the MTC patients were classified into excellent, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response groups, respectively. On TNM staging, 37, 16, 13 and 35 % of patients were stages I-IV, respectively. There were significant differences in survivals according to TNM staging (p = 0.03) and DRS (p = 0.005). During the median follow-up of 6.2 years, 75 patients (63 %) demonstrated no evidence of disease (NED). About 60 and 17 % of patients in stages III and IV were NED, respectively.

Our understanding of microRNA (miRNA) profiles of metastatic disease also remains limited and may unveil novel therapeutic strategies for these patients.;MTC patients with a history of total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection were identified from within the prospective Sydney University Endocrine Surgical Unit database. Patients with available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue were included and clinicopathological data were collated. Total RNA was extracted and quantitave polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis performed on the primary tumour and a corresponding lymph node metastasis for expression of miRNAs of proven significance in MTC (miR-9*, miR-183 and miR-375).;Tissue was available for analysis in seven patients. The median age at diagnosis was 55 years (range: 22-67). Median tumour size was 18 mm (range: 6-55) and over a median follow-up period of 34 months (range: 1-210), five further operations were undertaken for residual disease. One patient died of metastatic disease. Pairwise correlations of qPCR expression levels between primary tumours and corresponding lymph node metastases revealed significant correlations for miR-9* (P < 0.001), miR-183 (P = 0.001) and miR-375 (P = 0.004).;miRNA expression patterns in nodal metastases significantly reflect those of the primary tumour in MTC. This further validates previously reported miRNA profile analyses and reiterates the potential significance of miR-9*, -183 and -375 in the pathophysiology of MTC. The possibility of lymph node biopsy miRNA analysis driven clinical decision making may now also be a possibility where conventional techniques are unhelpful.",

Pretargeting has demonstrated a more favorable therapeutic index and clinical efficacy than directly labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) MAb in preclinical MTC models. Moreover, two phase I/II clinical trials assessing anti-CEA × anti-DTPA-indium BsMAb (murine F6x734 and chimeric hMN14x734) with (131)I-di-DTPA-indium showed encouraging therapeutic results in progressive, metastatic, MTC patients, with an improved survival in intermediate- and high-risk (pre-pRAIT Ct DT, <2 years) patients, as compared to contemporaneous untreated patients (median overall survival, 110 months vs 61 months; P < 0.030). pRAIT efficacy has been recently confirmed in a prospective multicenter phase II study assessing hMN14x734 and (131)I-di-DTPA-indium in rapidly progressive MTC patients. New pRAIT compounds are now available with fully humanized, recombinant, trivalent BsMAb (anti-CEA TF2) and histamine-succinyl-glutamine (HSG) peptides.

Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of serum PCT assays in patients with MTC. We investigated 24 patients at 17-78 years of age, all after total thyroidectomy due to MTC. All patients had serum CT concentrations measured by radioimmune assay. The upper limit of the CT level was 60 pg/ml. The serum PCT was evaluated with an immunochromatographic kit. The reaction was considered positive when the PCT level exceeded 0.5 ng/ml. In all cases the C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level was measured. The statistical analysis was performed with Statistica 5.1G. The CT levels in all patients varied from 0 to 1410, mean 603.8 pg/ml. In 8 patients the CT level was within normal range, in 6 patients it was marginally, and in 10 patients markedly elevated. The PCT test was considered positive in 16 patients. There was correlation among serum PCT and CT concentrations (Spearman test, p<0.0001). The PCT levels varied considerably among patients with normal, marginally and markedly elevated CT levels (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.0013). All patients had normal CRP values. Fisher's exact test revealed a correlation between serum PCT and CT increase (p=0.04). Further studies on a larger group of patients should be considered; thus, the PCT assay can be considered useful in cases of unclear CT concentration.",

Imaging sequences were applied with and without irradiation of off-resonant radiofrequency (RF) prepulses, but other parameters were unchanged. Therefore, quantitative assessment of MTC could be performed. In contrast to former examinations of other researchers, no significant difference of MTC was found between malignant liver lesions and benign lesions as FNH or adenoma. MTC might provide differentiation between hemangioma and cysts versus solid tumors, but MTC is not capable of distinguishing benign and malignant types of solid liver tumors. Effects of unchanged MTC prepulses on signal intensity of normal liver tissue and most lesions were more pronounced for nearly proton density-weighted fast low-angle shot (FLASH) images than for T1-weighted FLASH images, obtained by using higher excitation flip angles. Liver-to-lesion contrast could not be improved clearly by MTC prepulses. The contrast between liver and lesions in the gradient-echo breath-hold images was compared with standard T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images. Liver-to-lesion contrast in the breath-hold images was found to be inferior to T2-weighted spin-echo images in 14 of 17 cases. Lesion conspicuity in regions near the diaphragm was better in breath-hold images, because problems with marked breathing motion (as in standard imaging) could be avoided.",

The measurement of CTN concentrations in blood reflects C-cell activity and is performed in general by immunoassay methods. However, there are analytical, physiological, pharmacological, and pathological factors that can influence results of serum CTN values. Due to the influence of these factors, there is a high variability in assay-dependent cutoffs used to discriminate between MTC, C-cell hyperplasia (CCH), and the absence of the pathological impairment of C-cells. There is a lot of evidence that the measurement of serum CTN concentrations in patients with thyroid nodules can lead to an earlier diagnosis of MTC or CCH than the exclusive use of imaging procedures and/or fine-needle aspiration cytology. Basal CTN concentrations higher than 60-100 pg/mL are highly indicative for the diagnosis MTC. In the range between cutoff and 60 pg/mL CTN, both MTC and HCC may be a relevant diagnosis. PCT and CTN appear to have a comparable diagnostic capability to diagnose MTCs. However, \"positive\" PCT values of more than 50 pg/mL may be reached also in subclinical infections and will lead, therefore, to an overdiagnosis of the tumor. Pentagastrin- or calcium-stimulated serum CTN concentrations higher than cutoff values might improve diagnostics of MTC, but the non-availability of the first and the lacking of relevant cutoff values for the second tool favors the use of only basal values currently.

Estrogen stimulated and anti-estrogen, ICI 182 780, suppressed ERE reporter activity in TT cells expressing ERalpha or ERbeta, suggesting that both ERs use the same classical ERE-mediated pathway. Ad-ERalpha infection stimulated TT cell growth; in contrast, Ad-ERbeta infection suppressed their growth. Apoptosis was detected in Ad-ERbeta-infected TT cells. Estrogen and anti-estrogen suppressed AP1 activity in Ad-ERalpha-infected cells, whereas upon Ad-ERbeta infection estrogen further stimulated AP1 activity which in turn is suppressed by anti-estrogen, suggesting that each ER acts differently through a non-ERE-mediated pathway. Our results suggest that ERalpha and ERbeta may play different roles in MTC tumor growth and progression.",

We have reported finding immunoreactive CT in the urine of man and have found it to be a useful technique for the diagnosis and study of patients at risk for MTC or other hypercalcitonemic diseases. Using basal urine CT alone we were able to separate 73% of patients at risk for MTC into clearly normal or abnormal groups.

The therapeutic procedure consists of a) thyroid blockade; b) administration of high specific activity 131I-MIBG; c) single doses, varying from 3.7 to 9.5 GBq, given by slow i.v. infusion (2-3 hours); d) monitoring of the patient during the infusion of the tracer. Targeted radiotherapy with 131I-MIBG in malignant pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, carcinoids and medullary thyroid carcinomas, was shown to be effective with partial reduction of tumoral lesions (mainly in pheochromocytomas with 58% of objective responses) and palliation in metastatic tumors; in a few pheochromocytomas also succeed in eradicating the residual/recurrent tumor. In patients with stage IV NB who failed to respond to or relapsed after conventional chemotherapy, MIBG therapy showed an important palliative role. A significant therapeutic improvement in the outcome of stage III and IV NB patients was obtained by introducing 131I-MIBG as a first line therapy, partial or even complete responses occurring in more than 60% of the cases treated. Experiences combining chemotherapeutic agents and 131I-MIBG are also in progress with encouraging results. MIBG therapy is well tolerated; toxicity is limited to minor hematologic toxicity and patients generally recover spontaneously. The risk of pancytopenia rises in patients with bone and/or bone marrow metastases; in these cases bone marrow harvesting is recommended. An alternative approach to 131I-MIBG therapy in MTC uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. A novel immunotargeting method, which includes a bispecific antibody and 131I as a radiolabel, seems to be very promising.",

The concentration of calcitonin (CT) was determined with an assay specific for an epitope involving the midportion and C-terminal end of the molecule. In six of the seven tumors investigated, concentrations of CT were found to be higher than for CGRP. Gel chromatography showed heterogeneity with respect to CGRP immunoreactivity. Thus, in all seven extracts, three peaks were seen with Kd values 0.37, 0.63, and 0.80, respectively. This profile of immunoreactive CGRP was similar to that obtained from human medulla spinalis, thereby indicating normal posttranslational processing of pro-CGRP in MTC tumors. Further characterization of the three main peaks identified by gel chromatography was performed on pooled fractions from one of the tumors using HPLC, sequencing, and mass spectrometry. The immunoreactive peak with Kd 0.37 was identified as human beta-CGRP, the peak with Kd 0.63 as 19-37 beta-CGRP, and the peak with Kd 0.80 as 25-37 beta-CGRP. No alpha-CGRP was identified in this tumor. This indicates selective expression of beta-CGRP, at least in the tumor investigated.",

PF cells are derived from the same region of the neural crest that gives rise to the neurons of the gut and are capable of extending neurofilament-bearing neuritic processes. PF cells also synthesize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and costore 5-HT in the same vesicles as the specific 5-HT-binding protein, 45 kDa SBP. A hypothesis has been advanced that PF cells and enteric neurons share a common developmental precursor. The present investigation was undertaken in order to determine whether a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line, which is derived from PF cells, sufficiently mimics PF cells that it can be substituted for them in investigations of serotonergic cellular biology. In contrast to PF cells, MTC cells can be propagated in vitro to provide adequate amounts of material for biochemical studies. MTC cells were found to contain neuropeptides, including calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and somatostatin, which have also been reported to be present in PF cells and enteric neurons. MTC cells also were observed to store endogenous 5-HT, to be able to synthesize 3H-5-HT from 3H-L-tryptophan, and to take up 3H-5-HT from the ambient medium by a carrier-mediated mechanism very similar to that of serotonergic neurons. In addition, the longterm accumulation of 3H-5-HT in MTC cells was antagonized by reserpine, suggesting that the cells contain 5-HT storage vesicles that, like the synaptic vesicles of serotonergic neurons, are characterized by a reserpine-sensitive transporter of biogenic amines. MTC cells also contain type A, but not type B, monoamine oxidase. Finally, MTC cells were found to contain both 45 and 56 kDa SBP. MTC cells thus retain a great many of the properties of PF cells, and, like PF cells, they are serotonergic cells with characteristics similar to serotonergic neurons. Substantial differences were found in the content of immunoreactive 5-HT and neuropeptides in individual MTC cells. Moreover, the release of newly synthesized 5-HT to the medium exceeded the ability of the cells to store the amine. Studies of the ultrastructure of the MTC cells revealed a limited and highly variable number of secretory granules, probably accounting for their limited 5-HT storage capacity and for the heterogeneity of immunostaining with antisera to 5-HT or neuropeptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Sections from 42 malignant pleural effusions from breast cancer patients and 65 corresponding solid tumors (34 primary, 31 metastatic) were evaluated for protein expression of the activated p-TrkA receptor. The majority of lesions were additionally studied for NGF and p75 expression. Six effusions and four breast carcinoma cell lines were studied for expression of p-TrkA using immunoblotting (IB). Membrane expression of p-TrkA was high in carcinoma cells in effusions (39/42, 93%) and locoregional recurrences (12/13, 92%), with significantly lower expression in both primary tumors (14/34, 41%) and lymph node metastases (8/18, 44%), respectively (p < 0.001 for effusions vs. primary tumors; p = 0.001 for effusions vs. lymph nodes). In contrast, p75 expression was less frequent in effusions compared to both primary tumors and lymph node metastases, significantly so for the latter (p = 0.019). NGF expression was comparable at all sites, but its expression in tumor cells in effusions (7/21 cases) was limited to cases in which time to progression (TTP) to effusion occurred within 5 years or less from primary operation. In univariate analysis of survival, mean and median TTP were 6.3 and 6 years for NGF-negative effusions, compared to 3 and 4 years for NGF-positive cases (p = 0.013). IB confirmed expression of p-TrkA in five of six effusions, while all four breast cancer cell lines were p-TrkA-negative. Our data provide the first documented evidence of molecular events that occur along tumor progression of breast carcinoma from primary tumors to effusion. The almost universal expression of p-TrkA in cancer cells in effusions and late recurrences is in full agreement with our recent report linking this factor with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the rapid progression to effusion in cases showing NGF expression in tumor cells underscores the aggressive clinical behavior of tumors that are able to utilize this pathway in an autocrine manner.",

NF-kappaB has been shown to be activated through several signaling pathways that involve growth factor receptors. The aim of the study was to assess the immunohistochemical expression of members of the NF-kappaB family and the putative targets of NF-kappaB in a series of medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), in correlation with RET mutational status. A tissue microarray was constructed from paraffin-embedded blocks of 48 MTCs (13 familial, 35 sporadic) previously evaluated for germ line and somatic RET mutations. Immunohistochemical evaluation included members of the NF-kappaB (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, RelB) family, as well as putative targets of NF-kappaB such as Flip, Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1. Nuclear immunostaining for members of NF-kappaB was frequent in MTCs (p50, 19%; p65, 68%; p52, 86.6%; c-Rel, 75%; RelB, 36%). MTCs with germ line or somatic RET mutations (29 cases) showed NF-kappaB nuclear translocation (particularly of p65, P = .035) more frequently than MTCs without RET mutations (19 cases). Immunostaining for putative targets of NF-kappaB showed a significant statistical association between p65 and Bcl-xL (P = .024). In addition, Bcl-xL expression was statistically higher in the tumors with exon 16 RET mutation in comparison with those with exon 10 and 11 RET mutations or wild-type RET (P = .002). Moreover, the significance of RETsignaling in NF-kappaB activation was evaluated in the RET-mutated TT cell line. TT cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying short hairpin RNA to knock down RET expression, and NF-kappaB activity was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. Silencing of RET in the TT cell line produced a significant decrease in NF-kappaB activation and reduction in ERK1/2. The results suggest that the NF-kappaB is frequently activated in MTCs. The results also support the hypothesis that RET activation by somatic or germ line mutations may be responsible for NF-kappaB activation in MTCs.",

He remained in partial remission for 7 years following numerous chemotherapy attempts to induce partial remission. In October 2008, the patient, then 58 years old, relapsed with numerous tumors throughout his central body. On December 1, 2008, the tumor marker for MTC, calcitonin, was at 38,611 pg/ml, i.e., much higher than the norm of <20 pg/ml. Since all other chemotherapy attempts had failed, he was ineligible for any new studies. Subsequently, the patient was immediately started on 10 mg/kg of dichloroacetate (DCA). By April 2009, the calcitonin level was reduced to 2,000 pg/ml. In May 2009, a new positron emission tomography showed a dramatic reduction in all tumor locations. The patient presently remains in remission and continues receiving the same dosage of DCA, with his tumor marker remaining stable in laboratory data since November 2009.",

The detection rates of c-Myc, TGF-alpha and EGFR were 90%, 90% and 95% respectively. Concomitant demonstration of the markers was reflected in significant associations (correlation factor between TGF-alpha and EGFR was 0.93, p < 0.001). The markers were almost invariably located within the cytoplasm, which might suggest their crucial role in growth regulation and cell differentiation; this seems especially true of TGF-alpha and EGFR. The different markers showed no relation to either histopathological or histochemical variables (tumour behaviour, tumour size, tumour cell type). The prominent co-expression of c-Myc, TGF-alpha and EGFR proteins indicates that in MTC these factors might be of importance for tumour cell proliferation via autocrine growth stimulation.",

Understanding the expression of differentiated function in molecular terms requires detailed characterization of the regulation of mRNA synthesis and catabolism. Although considerable emphasis has been placed on transcriptional control, the discovery of HnRNA and 'split genes' gives rise to the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation at the level of processing of nuclear precursors. A rat calcitonin-producing medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) line was used as a model for definition of certain aspects in regulation of gene expression. Serial transplantation of several rat MTC lines containing and secreting large amounts of calcitonin generated tumours in which calcitonin biosynthesis was decreased more than 10-fold. We report here that the conversion from a 'high' to a 'low' calcitonin producing state is associated with specific modifications of the calcitonin mRNA synthetic pathway and a consequence of these changes seems to be the production of a new cytoplasmic mRNA.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells, where, in the inherited form, constitutive activation of the RET protooncogene is responsible for unrestrained cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that somatostatin (SRIF) reduces cell growth in the human MTC cell line TT, which expresses all SRIF receptor (SSTR) subtypes and responds differently to selective SSTR agonists. The antiproliferative mechanism of SRIF and its analogs in MTC is still unclear. Src homology-2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), is activated by somatotropin release-inhibiting factor and reduces mutated RET autophosphorylation in a heterologous system. In this study, we explore the role of PTP activation, in particular of SHP-1, in TT cells, where RET is constitutively activated. In TT cells, SRIF stimulated the PTP activity of SHP-1, which was associated with proliferation inhibition and with reduction in the MAPK pathway activation. Blockade of PTP activity with sodium orthovanadate induced cell proliferation and MAPK phosphorylation and blunted the inhibitory effects of SRIF. Moreover, SHP-1 associates with SSTR2 depending on its activation. By using a MAPK kinase inhibitor, we demonstrated that TT cell growth depends on MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, in TT cells overexpressing SHP-1, cell proliferation and MAPK signaling were strongly down-regulated, whereas in TT cells transfected with a dominant negative form of SHP-1, cell proliferation and MAPK signaling were markedly induced. Our data demonstrate that SRIF inhibitory effects on TT cell proliferation are mediated, at least in part, by SHP-1, which acts through a MAPK-dependent mechanism.",

VPA, a drug long used for the treatment of epilepsy, has recently been identified as a potential Notch1 activator. We hypothesized that VPA might activate Notch1 signaling in MTC cells, with antiproliferative effects.;Human MTC cells were treated with VPA (0-5 mM) and Western blotting was performed to measure levels of Notch1 pathway proteins and neuroendocrine tumor markers. After confirming that VPA is a Notch1 activator in MTC cells, we performed cell proliferation assay. Finally, to determine the mechanism of growth inhibition, we measured protein levels of various markers of apoptosis.;Notch1 was absent in MTC cells at baseline. VPA treatment resulted in an increase in both full-length and active Notch1 protein. Notch1 activation with VPA suppressed 2 neuroendocrine tumor markers, ASCL1 and chromogranin A. Importantly, VPA inhibited the growth of MTC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, indicating the induction of apoptosis.;VPA activates Notch1 signaling in MTC cells and inhibits their growth by inducing apoptosis. As the safety of VPA in human beings is well established, a clinical trial using this drug to treat patients with advanced MTC could be initiated in the near future.",

Inclusion criteria were age (0-20 years) and histologic degree of C-cell disease (normal = N, C-cell hyperplasia = CCH, medullary thyroid carcinoma = MTC, metastatic MTC = MMTC). To evaluate therapeutic results of ETT (1-5 years) versus late total thyroidectomy (LTT; 6-20 years), age-dependent histologic stages of C-cell disease and postoperative occurrence of PRD were compared. Prognostic value of specific codons, age-dependent histologic distribution, and long-term outcome were analyzed.;In a total of 260 cases, 42 (16%) underwent ETT, and 218 (84%) underwent LTT. Histologic analysis showed significant difference between ETT versus LTT (57% vs 76%) regarding malignant stage of C-cell disease (of combined rate of MTC and MMTC). Long-term outcome was documented in 74 patients (28%). During a median follow-up period of 2 years (range: 0-15 years), 21 of 65 of the LTT group versus 0 of 9 of the ETT group suffered PRD. Information about codon analysis was available in 150 patients (58%). Mutated codons were c634 (63%), c618 (19%), c620 (9%), and c804 (6%).

This review details the genetic studies conducted thus far in the search for potential genes for FNMTC.;An electronic PubMed search was performed from the English literature for genetics of FNMTC and genetics of familial papillary thyroid carcinoma (subdivision of FNMTC). The references from the selected papers were reviewed to identify further studies not found in the original search criteria.;Six potential regions for harboring an FNMTC gene have been identified: MNG1 (14q32), TCO (19p13.2), fPTC/PRN (1q21), NMTC1 (2q21), FTEN (8p23.1-p22), and the telomere-telomerase complex. Important genes reported to have been excluded are RET, TRK, MET, APC, PTEN, and TSHR.;The genetics of FNMTC is an exciting field in medical research that has the potential to permit individualized management of thyroid cancer. Studies thus far have been on small family groups using varying criteria for the diagnosis of FNMTC.

HSP90 is a molecular target for the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV).;We hypothesized that treatment with NFV may lead to the inhibition of RET signaling and induction of apoptosis in MTC cells.;Two human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, which harbor endogenous C634W or M918T RET mutations, respectively, were exposed to clinically achievable concentrations of NFV. JC-1 staining and caspase-3 cleavage assays were performed to measure mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Activation of RET signaling was examined by Western blot. Autophagy was monitored by the detection of the light-chain 3BII. Expression of HSP90 and LC3B were examined in 36 human MTCs.;At a therapeutic serum concentration (10 μM), NFV inhibited the viability of TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells by 55% and 10%, respectively. In a dose-dependent manner, NFV inhibited cyclin D1 and caused caspase-3 cleavage. NFV decreased the level of RET protein and blocked the activation of RET downstream targets (phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated AKT, and p70S6K/pS6). NFV induced metabolic stress, activated AMP-activated protein kinase and increased autophagic flux. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (chloroquine) augmented NFV-inducible cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagy was protective in NFV-treated cells. NFV led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and induced both oxidative stress and DNA damage. An antioxidant (n-acetylcysteine) attenuated DNA damage and prevented NFV-inducible apoptosis. HSP90 overexpression was found in 17 of 36 human MTCs and correlated with metastases and RET mutations. LC3B was detected in 20 of 36 human MTCs.;NFV has a wide spectrum of activity against MTC cells, and its cytotoxicity can be augmented by inhibiting autophagy. Expression of NFV molecular targets in metastatic MTC suggests that NFV has a potential to become a thyroid cancer therapeutic agent.",

The hormonal therapy with somatostatin analogues and the metabolic scintigraphies using MIBG, somatostatine analogues, radio-active iodine have no therapeutic effects demonstrated. The development of targeted therapy by the use of specific monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CEA radiolabeled antibodies, is to be evaluated. The prognostic factors, as defined in large series of patients studied, does not necessary reflect the aggressiveness of the tumour.

Most RET activating mutations are clustered in mutational \"hot spots\" in exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and are usually detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. To improve sensitivity, time and costs of mutational screening we have developed a denaturing high performance chromatography (DHPLC) protocol, based on the detection of heteroduplex molecules by ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography under partially denaturing conditions. The mutational screening of RET exons 10, 11, 13-16 was performed in a total of 111 subjects, including 45 MTC patients and 49 relatives with known RET mutations and 17 individuals, being at risk of hereditary MTC and carrying unknown RET alleles. Heteroduplex peaks with a distinct and reproducible DHPLC elution profile allowed the detection of both rare and common RET mutations. Overall, the DHPLC-based methodology showed a high level of sensitivity and accuracy, nearing 100%. Furthermore, our protocol showed the ability to identify: 1) all the mutated codons of RET located in the \"hot spots\" domain; 2) the different point mutations occurring in the same codon of RET gene; 3) less frequent or rare mutations; 4) polymorphisms. As such, it can be proposed as a relatively simple and highly accurate method for a rapid genetic testing for members of MTC families.",

This is the largest study so far in bibliography investigating the diagnostic accuracy of combined [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT in patients with MTC and elevated calcitonin levels. Methods. Between February 2007 and February 2011, 59 [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT were performed on 51 patients with MTC and elevated calcitonin levels for localization of recurrent disease. Conventional morphologic imaging methods were negative or showed equivocal findings. Results. Among the 59 [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT, 29 were positive (26 had true-positive and 3 false-positive findings) and 30 negative. The overall per-patient sensitivity of [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT was 44.1%. Using as cut-off point the calcitonin value of 1000 pg/ml, in patients with calcitonin exceeding this value, sensitivity raised to 86.7%. The overall sensitivity of [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT was lower (23%) in patients with MEN IIA syndrome. Conclusion. The findings of this paper show that [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT is valuable for the detection of recurrence in patients with highly elevated calcitonin levels, >1000 pg/mL, but in patients with lower calcitonin levels, its contribution is questionable. Also, there is evidence that the sensitivity of [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT is lower in patients with MTC as part of MEN IIA syndrome.",

Data from all patients with MTC who had undergone surgery at our institution from May 2009 to May 2016 were retrospectively evaluated.

The ideal cutoff points for predicting lymph node involvement were 2.7 for the NLR and 105.3 for the PLR. The optimal cutoff points of the NLR and PLR for predicting recurrence were 2.8 and 129.8, respectively. Using the cutoff values, we found that PLR>105.3 (odds ratio [OR] 4.782, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-16.7) was an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis and that PLR>129.8 (OR 3.838, 95% CI 1.1-13.5) was an independent predictor of recurrence.Our study suggests that the preoperative PLR, but not NLR, was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and recurrence in patients with MTC.",

Cell counts were performed with a Coulter counter or by flow cytometry. DNA synthesis was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. A cell death ELISA was used to assess apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western immunoblot. MAPK activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay, and MAPK inhibition was achieved with SB202190 (p38 MAPK) and PD098059 (MAPK kinase). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Compared with controls, PP2 reduced DNA synthesis, abolished Akt phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. The MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD098059, attenuated DNA synthesis, whereas genistein caused modest declines in cell count and DNA synthesis and minimal changes in apoptosis.

With the purpose of minimizing the disadvantages of the original T3 suppression test, we have evaluated the efficacy of a method using L-thyroxine as TSH suppression agent and [99 mTc] pertechnetate as radiopharmaceutical.;Open nonrandomized prospective study;A control group of 15 normal volunteers (11 males, 4 females; 21-35 years, mean 26.4 years) and a patient group of 20 patients (18 females, 2 males; 27-83 years, mean 53.6 years) divided into 4 subgroups, were studied: 7 patients with autonomous functioning nontoxic nodules, 3 with autonomous functioning toxic nodules, 7 with Graves disease and 3 with nonautoimmune diffuse toxic goitre. Baseline thyroid uptake and imaging were begun 20 minutes after an intravenous injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of [99 mTc] pertechnetate. This was followed by a single daily intake of 2 microg/kg of L-thyroxine, for 10 days. Thyroid imaging and uptake were then repeated.;In the control group [99 mTc] pertechnetate uptake after L-thyroxine suppression had a mean reduction of 75.8 +/- 7.69% (58-87%) in comparison to the baseline level. All subjects were euthyroid by clinical and laboratory criteria and none complained of side-effects, despite significant suppression of TSH levels. In the patient group, thyroid uptake after suppression decreased in 10 patients (maximum reduction 39%), was unchanged in 2 patients and increased in the remaining 8 patients.;The method described was efficient for demonstration of autonomous thyroid tissue, since none of the patients showed significant reduction of thyroid uptake after L-thyroxine suppression compared with the control group. This test was as effective as the original T3 suppression test, but more convenient to the patient: no side-effects, ease of hormonal intake, low dosimetry and short stay in the nuclear medicine laboratory.",

The disease is caused by germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. Subtypes of MEN 2 include MEN 2A, MEN 2B and familial MTC (FMTC) which differ in pattern of additional lesions or--in FMTC--lack of pheochromocytoma. In 2009, after extensive review of the literature, the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association made several recommendations regarding clinical and genetic diagnostic testing and treatment options. In this article, the recently published literature is reviewed and concerns regarding future perspectives are added. In particular, a critical handling of rare DNA variants and double mutations is necessary. Up to now, mutation-specific risk profiles and mutation-associated treatment recommendations are unavailable. We emphasise the need for approved centres for treatment of patients affected by MEN 2, not only adults but young children as well. As a high level of skill is required for endoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery, surgeons should declare their expertise before operating such patients. Registry-based follow-up should be mandatory including documentation of short- and long-term outcome in order to provide valid data for future counselling of patients with MEN 2.",

A 570-kb long-range restriction map has been generated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using probes developed during a 160-kb bidirectional cosmid walk at D10S94. Six CpG islands are clustered within a 180-kb region; five fall within a 145-kb NotI restriction fragment that is contained in its entirety in our cosmid contig. The SacII, SfiI, and NotI restriction maps for lymphoblast and cloned DNA are concordant. These CpG islands may represent the 5' ends of candidate genes for MEN2A, MEN2B, and/or MTC1.

We have constructed a recombinant replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing murine interleukin-12 (mIL-12), driven by a modified CALC-I promoter (TCP). This vector (AdTCPmIL-12) includes two separate cassettes encoding mIL-12 p35 or p40 subunit controlled by TCP inserted in the E1 region of adenovirus type 5. In vitro and in vivo reporter gene expression using TCP revealed its cell-specific activity. AdTCPmIL-12-infected rat MTC (rMTC) cells produced high amounts of functional mIL-12 cells in vitro, while other cell lines infected with AdTCPmIL-12 did not. AdTCPmIL-12-transduced rMTC cells completely lost their tumorigenicity in syngenic WAG/Rij rats. Direct injection of 1 x 10(9) plaque forming units of AdTCPmIL-12 into subcutaneous rMTC tumors in WAG/Rij rats caused tumor regression in over 60% of animals within 20 days. Rats cured of tumors did not develop tumors after re-injection of naive rMTC cells, demonstrating lasting immunity. Treatment with AdTCPmIL-12 of one tumor resulted in regression of an established tumor at a distant site. Moreover, intratumoral or intravenous injection of AdTCPmIL-12 did not induce evident toxicity. These results indicate AdTCPmIL-12 can contribute to effective and less toxic gene therapy of MTC.",

Depletion of MNK activity by using two MNK inhibitors, CGP57380 or cercosporamide, as well as by MNK1-specific knockdown sensitized glioblastoma (GBM) cells and GBM-derived spheres to TMZ. Furthermore, CGP57380 treatment enhanced response of MTC cells to (177)Lu-labeled gastrin analogue. In order to understand how MNK signaling pathways support glioma survival we analyzed putative MNK substrates by quantitative phosphoproteomics in normal condition and in the presence of TMZ. We identified MNK inhibitor-sensitive phosphorylation sites on eIF4G1, mutations of which either influenced eIF4E phosphorylation or glioma cell response to TMZ, pointing to altered regulation of translation initiation as a resistance mechanism. Pharmacological inhibition of overexpressed MNK1 by CGP57380 reduced eIF4E phosphorylation and induced association of inactive MNK1 with eIF4G1. Taken together, our data show an activation of MNK-mediated survival mechanisms in response to either glioma chemotherapy or MTC targeted radiation and suggest that inhibition of MNK activity represents an attractive sensitizing strategy for cancer treatments.

When these conditions are present, radionuclide therapy can be adopted in MTC patients.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I (MEN-I) is characterized by the concurrence of pituitary adenomas, parathyroid hyperplasia and pancreatic islet cell neoplasms. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type II (MEN-II or IIa) consists of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), parathyroid hyperplasia and pheochromocytomas. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type IIb (MEN-IIb) is similar to MEN-IIa in that affected patients have MTC and pheochromocytomas. Multiple mucosal neuromas and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract are also present in patients with MEN-IIb, but these individuals rarely manifest hyperparathyroidism. The Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndromes have attracted a great deal of attention because of their characteristic clinical features and familial pattern of occurrence. By utilizing recently developed \"provocative tests\" it is possible through aggressive screening of kindred members at risk to detect certain of these diseases (particularly MTC and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia) at an early stage. Therapeutic intervention in selected patients is associated with a high cure rate.",

It occurs as a sporadic neoplasm in 70-80% of cases and is hereditary in 20-30% because of germline mutations of the rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene. Successful disease management relies on accurate staging. Tumor secretory biomarkers are highly sensitive to a disease; however, despite a wide variety of radiopharmaceuticals for molecular imaging that take advantage of hybrid SPECT/CT and PET/CT fusion imaging, imaging of MTC is still problematic. After initial surgical resection, the limited sensitivity of localization of small locoregional disease and the inability to detect early liver metastases hamper the success of later surgical approaches. F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET has been used to detect MTC recurrences with modest success and may be best suited for only a small subset of more biologically aggressive MTCs. Recent developments in PET imaging with novel radiopharmaceuticals targeting specific cellular processes of MTC offer increased sensitivity for identifying recurrence, assessing prognosis, and guiding selection of optimal therapies.",

In vitro studies assessed cell viability and proliferation (MTS; trypan blue assays), apoptosis (flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining; confirmed by Western blot analysis), long-term cytotoxic effects (clonogenic assay), and suppression of key regulatory proteins such as RET, Akt, and mTOR (by Western blot analysis).;The novel withanolides potently reduced MTC cell viability (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], 270-2,850 nmol/L; 250-1,380 nmol/L for vandetanib; 360-1,640 nmol/L for cabozantinib) with induction of apoptosis at <1,000 nmol/L of drug.

Results of RT-PCR indicate that P19 neurons express several neurotrophin receptors (p75(NTR), trkB, and trkC, but not trkA) but they do not express any of the four neurotrophins. Consistent with the presence of trkB but not trkA, BDNF causes rapid phosphorylation of MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2, but NGF does not. Neurotrophins induce translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus. All four neurotrophins induce activation of NF-kappaB in a biphasic manner. This effect is apparently mediated by p75(NTR), because an inhibitor of trk receptors, K252a, does not inhibit activation of NF-kappaB. Instead, K252a itself promotes activation of NF-kappaB and this effect is additive with the effect of neurotrophins. Inhibition of reactive oxygen intermediates with PDTC completely abolishes basal activity of NF-kappaB and strongly inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by neurotrophins, indicating an important role of reactive oxygen intermediates in the pathway by which neurotrophins activate NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB is known to promote expression of the iNOS gene. We found that all four neurotrophins increased iNOS mRNA levels, resulting in increased accumulation of iNOS protein. In contrast, none of the neurotrophins stimulated nNOS mRNA or protein synthesis. PDTC abolishes constitutive and neurotrophin-induced expression of iNOS mRNA and protein and abolishes constitutive expression of nNOS mRNA, suggesting that reactive oxygen intermediates promote expression of nNOS.",

Abdominal computed tomography showed no blood flow whatsoever in tumors undergoing MTC. There are fewer limits to the sites and angles for insertion of electrodes under laparotomy. Thus, the surgical approach provides access to all parts of the liver for treatment. We conclude that intraoperative MTC is highly effective in tumor necrosis, and can be a useful local treatment for nonresectable HCC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC), the majority of germline mutations are restricted to specific positions in exons 10 and 11 of the RET gene. However, germline mutations may very occasionally occur in other exons, including exon 14 of the RET gene. Interestingly, an increased frequency of a rare germline sequence variant of the RET exon 14, S836S, has been detected in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and this variant has been proposed to play a role in the genesis of MTC and, perhaps, FMTC. In this study we report the segregation of a germline V804L mutation and a germline sequence variant S836S in exon 14 of the RET gene in an extended Hungarian FMTC kindred comprising 80 individuals of four generations. Molecular analysis of the RET gene was performed by direct DNA sequencing in 23 family members, of whom 12 had the V804L mutation, three had the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles, and six had the S836S polymorphism, all in heterozygous forms. Two of the family members had neither mutation nor polymorphism of the RET gene. Three of the family members who had the V804L mutation and one member who could not be tested for mutation were operated for non-metastatic MTC, while one member with MTC who had the V804L mutation refused surgery. In all patients affected with MTC, the disease developed relatively late in life and never caused death. None of the other family members carrying the V804L mutation and/or the S836S polymorphism had clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC. These observations suggest that the co-existence of the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles does not seem to aggravate the relatively low-risk disease phenotype characteristic in most patients with codon 804 mutations of the RET exon 14.",

MTC is mainly sporadic in nature, but an hereditary pattern [multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)] is present in 20-30% of cases, transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait due to germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. About 98% of patients with MEN 2 have germline mutations in exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 or 16 of the RET gene. The primary treatment of both hereditary and sporadic forms of MTC is total thyroidectomy and removal of all neoplastic tissue present in the neck. The therapeutic option for lymph node surgery should be dictated by the results of presurgical evaluation. After total thyroidectomy, measurements of serum calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen are of paramount importance in the postsurgical follow-up of patients with MTC as they reflect the presence of persistent or recurrent disease. Complete remission is demonstrated by undetectable and stimulated serum CT measurement. On the contrary, if serum CT is detectable under basal conditions or becomes detectable after stimulation, the patient is probably not cured, but imaging techniques will not demonstrate any disease until serum CT approaches levels >150 pg/ml. The tumour metastasises early to both paratracheal and lateral cervical lymph nodes. Metastases outside the neck may occur in the liver, lungs, bones and, less frequently, brain and skin. Surgery is the main treatment for local and distant metastases whenever feasible. Systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (alone or in combination) has shown very limited efficacy, achieving only partial responses in the range of 10-20% and of short duration. Several kinase inhibitors are currently under evaluation and preliminary results are promising. Familial cases must be identified by searching for RET proto-oncogene mutations in the proband and in family members. Carriers of the RET gene are candidates for prophylactic thyroidectomy at different ages depending on the risk associated with the specific RET mutations.",

A preliminary study evaluated doxorubicin, dacarbazine (DTIC), cyclophosphamide, and vincristine, singly and in combination, for their effect on the growth of MTC xenografts (TT) in nude mice. Given individually, DTIC yielded the most effective tumor growth inhibition, delaying the mean time to doubling from 1 week for untreated tumor-bearing mice to 7.5 weeks. Administering either the 4 drugs in combination or a 2-drug combination comprised of doxorubicin and DTIC significantly improved the efficacy compared with any single drug alone, increasing the mean doubling time to 10-12 weeks.;Drug doses were selected to conform to the doses of each drug given clinically. For the combined modality therapy, administration of 90Y-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 to nude mice bearing established TT tumors was followed by various chemotherapy regimens initiated 24 hours after RAIT. Chemotherapy protocols combined with RAIT included doxorubicin or DTIC alone and in combination, and the doxorubicin, DTIC, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine 4-drug protocol. Tumor volumes were measured weekly, and toxicity was evaluated by measuring blood counts and body weight.;Combinations of RAIT and chemotherapy with DTIC or RAIT and chemotherapy with the drug combinations were found to augment the antitumor effects of RAIT or chemotherapy alone, without a significant increase in toxicity. The mean tumor volume doubling times were increased up to 100% compared with the results of chemotherapy alone. No significant differences in tumor growth were observed between the RAIT plus DTIC protocol and the RAIT plus two- or four-drug protocols.;The superiority of the combined modality treatment argues for the integration of RAIT into chemotherapeutic regimens for MTC treatment.

Because many patients with CT-DTCs had extrathyroidal tumor extension (pT4 category), distant metastases (M1 category), or both, only 35 matched pairs could be identified. The TNM classification in both groups was as follows: pT1, n = 8; pT2, n = 15; pT3, n = 4; pT4, n = 8; pN0, n = 4; pN1, n = 31; M0, n = 30; M1, n = 5.

Thus, we tested the anti-tumoral action of an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, celecoxib, on MTC development.;We studied the expression of prostaglandin (PG) metabolism enzymes in our in vitro (TT cells) and in vivo (TT tumors) models and in human MTCs by Western blot. We checked the effect of celecoxib on xenografted subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Celecoxib was administrated in powder food during 9 weeks from day 1 after TT cell injection. At the end of the experiment plasma CT was measured by radioimmunoassay, the number of proliferating cells in tumor tissues was detected by Ki67 immunocytochemistry and apoptotic nuclei by caspase 3 ad Bcl-2 expression and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. PGE(2) concentrations in TT cell medium were evaluated by an enzyme immunoassay kit.;Our in vitro and in vivo models were validated: the status of PG metabolism enzymes was comparable in these models and in human MTCs. A very low dose of celecoxib, 120 ppm in food, inhibited tumor volume by 71% and reduced plasma CT level. Although no proapoptotic effect was detectable in tumors, a decrease of proliferating cells was revealed. The inducible PG synthesis enzyme, cyclooxygenase 2, was only detectable in rare stromal cells. The expression of the constitutive PG synthesis enzyme, cyclooxygenase 1, was diminished, while the level of the catabolism enzyme, 15-PG dehydrogenase, was decreased. In vitro, TT cells treated for 12 days with 25 muM celecoxib reproduced these changes, and PGE(2) secretion was not significantly modified by the treatment, in these conditions.;Celecoxib has a good therapeutic potential for MTC to prevent metastasis growth, and its anti-tumoral effect is, at least in part, independent of PGE(2).",

The use of imaging is most important in the follow-up of differentiated (DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Patients with DTC are followed with serum thyroidglobulin and 131I whole body scintigraphy when the serum thyroglobulin level is elevated. When the 131I scintigram is negative, 201Tl scintigraphy may best identify the site of recurrent DTC. Alternative radioisotopes, ultrasound, CT, and FDG PET are also useful in localizing the site of DTC metastases. MTC recurrences and metastases are more difficult to image. Selective venous catheterization is the most sensitive and specific method for detecting areas of recurrent MTC. High-resolution ultrasound, CT, MR imaging, and scintigraphy are all capable of, and useful in, detecting macroscopic foci of metastatic tumor. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and 99mTc DMSA have been the most frequently used nuclear imaging agents in patients with recurrent MTC. Imaging for hyperparathyroidism remains controversial. Sestambi has become the preferred isotope for parathyroid scintigraphy; whereas high-resolution ultrasound is also frequently used. Preoperative imaging is being used as a method to allow a unilateral neck exploration, more recently, in conjunction with intraoperative 1-84 PTH assay and with intraoperative use of the gamma probe.

        "Doc_abstract":"Deregulated expression of the Aurora kinases (Aurora-A, B, and C) is thought to be involved in cell malignant transformation and genomic instability in several cancer types. Over the last decade, a number of small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been developed, which have proved to efficiently restrain malignant cell growth and tumorigenicity. Regarding medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we previously showed the efficacy of a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor (MK-0457) in impairing growth and survival of the MTC-derived cell line TT. In the present study, we sought to establish if one of the Aurora kinases might represent a preferential target for MTC therapy. The effects of selective inhibitors of Aurora-A (MLN8237) and Aurora-B (AZD1152) were analyzed on TT cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and ploidy. The two inhibitors reduced TT cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with IC50 of 19.0 ± 2.4 nM for MLN8237 and 401.6 ± 44.1 nM for AZD1152. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that AZD1152 inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) by Aurora-B, while it did not affect Aurora-A autophosphorylation. MLN8237 inhibited Aurora-A autophosphorylation as expected, but at concentrations required to achieve the maximum antiproliferative effects it also abolished H3 (Ser10) phosphorylation. Cytofluorimetry experiments showed that both inhibitors induced accumulation of cells in G2/M phase and increased the subG0/G1 fraction and polyploidy. Finally, both inhibitors triggered apoptosis. We demonstrated that inhibition of either Aurora-A or Aurora-B has antiproliferative effects on TT cells, and thus it would be worthwhile to further investigate the therapeutical potential of Aurora kinase inhibitors in MTC treatment.",

MTC is known to overexpress the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2). Octreotide (Oct) is a somatostatin analogue that has a high binding affinity for SSTR and can be used as a tumor-targeting ligand. We prepared Oct-targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 using Oct-poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid and evaluated Oct-mediated association and cytotoxicity of the liposomes with an MTC cell line TT. The association of higher concentrations of modified Oct-targeted liposomes with TT cells was significantly higher than PEGylated liposomes and was significantly inhibited by empty Oct-targeted liposomes but not by free Oct. With exposure for 96 h, the cytotoxicity of Oct-targeted liposomal CPT-11 (IC50: 1.05 ± 0.47 μM) was higher than free CPT-11 (IC50: 3.76 ± 0.61 μM) or PEGylated liposomal CPT-11 (IC50: 3.05 ± 0.28 μM). In addition, empty Oct-targeted liposomes showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than empty nontargeted liposomes at a concentration where free Oct did not show cytotoxicity, suggesting that Oct as a ligand showed cytotoxicity. Moreover, Oct-targeted liposomal CPT-11 led to significantly higher antitumor activity and prolonged the survival time compared with nontargeted liposomal and free CPT-11 at a one-third dose and lower administration times with free CPT-11. These findings indicated that Oct-targeted liposomes loaded with CPT-11 may offer considerable potential for MTC chemotherapy because cytotoxicity of both CPT-11 and Oct was enhanced by effective cellular uptake via SSTR2.",

A statistically significant higher prevalence of mutations affecting non-cysteine codons was also found (P<0.0001). Furthermore, the phenotype data collection showed an unexpected higher prevalence of FMTC (57.6%) with respect to other MEN 2 syndromes (34% MEN 2A and 6.8% of MEN 2B).

The antisera were applied by the immunogold procedure on ultrathin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed, usually osmium-postfixed, tissues. In MTC cases, a strong labelling was present over two types of aggregates: one composed of rigid, criss-crossing fibrils 7-10 nm in diameter, suggestive of amyloid, and the other consisting of loosely arranged fibrils, 4-7 nm in width, often wavy or poorly defined. In both cases, the labelling was closely associated with that part of the sectioned fibril exposed to the antiserum. Amorphous material was sometimes present adjacent to the later aggregates, but did not bind the calcitonin antibodies. In contrast, no labelling occurred over the amyloid deposits found in two non-calcitonin-producing endocrine tumours of the pancreas, nor over the cytoskeletal filaments stored in various endocrine polypeptide tumours. The specific value of the labelling for calcitonin-like immunoreactivity was assessed by control tests, such as absorption of the antiserum by excess calcitonin and comparative use of normal serum and antisera directed against human IgG and P component. No immunoreactivity of the MTC amyloid fibrils was found using antibodies directed against katacalcin and human prealbumin. We conclude that in tumour tissues conventionally processed for electron microscopy, MTC amyloid fibrils of varying morphology can be selectively and specifically labelled for calcitonin-like immunoreactivity.",

Immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9 and TIMP-2 was detected in 89.6 and 93.5% of the samples, respectively. The expression of MMP-9 was not found to correlate with clinical parameters, although, a trend toward a correlation between MMP-9 and distant metastasis was observed (P=0.053). By contrast, TIMP-2 staining was found to correlate with age at diagnosis (P=0.026) and negatively correlate with tumor size and tumoral stage (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Notably, the highest levels of TIMP-2 expression were observed in patients with intrathyroidal disease.

Recently, anti-CEA antibodies and somatostatin analogs have shown promising results in the staging of MTC. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity of both methodologies, especially for the detection of occult MTC, and to assess whether there may be correlations between the scintigraphic behavior and the patients' prognosis.;A total of 26 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma were examined at our institution between 1977 and 1996. Ten of them had known disease, 14 had occult metastatic MTC, and 2 were free of disease at the time of presentation. Fourteen patients were investigated with anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (receiving a total of 35 injections: clones BW431/26, BW431/31, IMACIS, or F023C5, labeled with 99mTc, (111)In or (131)I), and 8 patients were studied with (111)In-labeled octreotide. Two patients received potentially therapeutic doses of (131)I-labeled anti-CEA antibodies. All patients underwent conventional radiologic evaluation (ultrasonography, CT, and MRI) and/or biopsy within 4 weeks. Additional imaging was performed with 99mTc-(V)-DMSA, (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine, 201thallium chloride, 99mTc-methylene diphosphate, and/or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Clinical follow-up was obtained.;All patients with established disease had elevated plasma CEA (range, 6.8-345 ng/mL; calcitonin levels between 92 and 11,497 pg/mL), whereas in 9 of 14 occult cases, levels were < or = 5 ng/mL (range, 0.6-829 ng/mL; calcitonin, 72-2920 pg/mL). In patients with known disease, the overall lesion-based sensitivity was 86% for the anti-CEA MAbs, whereas octreotide was unable to target any tumor in patients with rapidly progressing disease or distant metastases (overall sensitivity, 47%). In all patients with occult MTC, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide were able to localize at least one lesion (patient-based sensitivity, virtually 100%). In patients with postsurgically persistent hypercalcitoninemia, cervical lymph nodes were identified as the most frequent site of metastases, whereas in patients with occult and slowly progressing disease several years after primary surgery, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide showed bilateral involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes; however, tumor to nontumor ratios were usually higher with octreotide in these cases. With anti-CEA Mabs, the highest tumor to nontumor ratios were observed in clinically aggressive, rapidly progressing disease. The sensitivity of all other diagnostic modalities was, at < or = 50%, significantly lower. Indication for antitumor effects was observed in a patient receiving 65 mCi of (111)I-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of the clone F023C5.;For the detection of occult MTC, anti-CEA MAbs and octreotide seem to have a sensitivity that is superior to conventional diagnostic modalities, especially also when used in combination. Better detectability with anti-CEA antibodies (which may result in higher CEA expression) seems to be associated with more aggressively growing forms of MTC, whereas somatostatin receptor expression at normal CEA plasma levels and weaker MAb targeting may be associated with a more benign clinical course. This is in accordance with the study of Busnardo et al. (Cancer 1984; 53:278-85), who showed higher CEA serum levels to be associated with a worse prognosis, as well as with the in vitro findings of Reubi et al. (Lab Invest 1991;64:567-73), who demonstrated lower somatostatin receptor expression in less differentiated MTC. Fu",

PTC is associated with gene rearrangements generating RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes, and to the BRAFV600E activating point mutation. A role of tumor-suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of PTC has not been assessed yet. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3) gene, encoding a metalloproteinases inhibitor and capable of inhibiting growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of several cancers, was found to be silenced by promoter methylation in a consistent fraction of PTCs, in association with tumor aggressiveness and BRAFV600E mutation, thus suggesting an oncosuppressor role. To explore this possibility, in this study we performed gene expression and functional studies. Analysis of gene expression data produced in our laboratory as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data sets confirmed the downregulation of TIMP3 gene expression in PTC with respect to normal thyroid. The functional consequences of TIMP3 downregulation were investigated in the PTC-derived NIM1 cell line, in which the expression of TIMP3 is silenced. Restoration of TIMP3 expression by exposure to soluble TIMP3 protein or by complementary DNA transfection had no effect on the growth rate of NIM1 cells. Instead, it affected the adhesive, migratory and invasive capabilities of NIM1 cells by modulating several proteins involved in these processes. A striking effect was observed in vivo, as TIMP3 reduced the tumorigenicity of NIM1 cells by repressing angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration. Our data indicate that the loss of TIMP3 expression exerts a functional role in the pathogenesis of PTC.",

We hypothesized that LNM is associated with poor prognosis in children.;Patients with MTC 21 years or younger from the National Cancer Data Base from 1985 to 2007 were studied. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with lymph node evaluation. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.;Of 430 patients, 276 (64.2%) had nodal evaluation with LNM present in 121 (28.1%). Older patients, those with tumors larger than 2 cm, and those with involved margins were more likely to have LNM (all P < .05). Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy, those with involved margins, and older patients were more likely to undergo lymph node evaluation after controlling for patient, tumor, and hospital factors (all P < .05). Over time an increasing number of patients with MTC have undergone total thyroidectomy. Patients 16 to 21 years of age had lower 10-year overall survival compared to patients 0 to 15 years old (88.7% vs 98.1%, P = .005).

In 22 cases diagnosis of a small (pT1 or pT2) sporadic MTC was incidental and only postoperatively confirmed. Normally total thyroidectomy with neck dissection is standard surgical therapy of a known MTC. Because of postoperative incidental diagnosis in all 22 cases surgical therapy was less then total thyroidectomy. Mutation analysis of RET Proto-Oncogen and familial history were negative in all cases. All patients were systematically followed-up in defined intervals by calcitonin, pentagastrin stimulation test, carcinoembryonic antigen and ultrasound. Median follow-up is 6.2 years (range: 2-13 years) and although a hemithyroidectomy or less was performed all 22 patients are cured by the MTC.

This cell stores 5-HT, shares many properties with neurons, and can be induced to change its phenotype from endocrine to neuronal by exposure in vitro to NGF. The membranes of isolated parafollicular 5-HT storage vesicles appear to contain a chloride channel that is gated in response to stimulation of the cells by secretogogues. Opening of this channel permits the interior of the vesicle to acidify in response to the action of a H+ ATPase in the vesicular membrane. Development of a delta psi appears to limit acidification of the vesicular interior when the chloride conductance is low. Transmembrane transport of 3H-5-HT into parafollicular vesicle is inhibited by dissipating the delta pH across the granular membranes. The physiological significance of the ability of parafollicular vesicles to modify the internal pH of their 5-HT-storing organelles remains to be determined. Like the synaptic vesicles of central and peripheral serotonergic neurons parafollicular vesicles contain a specific 5-HT binding protein, SBP. 5-HT storage organelles and SBP have been found in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cells, a tumor line derived from parafollicular cells.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by germline activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and has been categorized into three distinct clinical forms. MEN-2A is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN-2B is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. The rarest clinical form of MEN-2 is familial MTC (FMTC), which is also associated with MTC, but other endocrinopathies are characteristically not present. Each clinical form of MEN-2 results from a specific RET gene mutation, with a strong correlation of phenotype expression with regard to the onset and course of MTC and the presence of other endocrine tumors and a corresponding genotype. Recommendations for screening of RET mutations are necessary as their presence or absence will influence interventional strategies such as the timing of a prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery. Timing of screenings and development of interventional strategies are extremely important in caring for patients with certain RET mutations as evidence of metastatic MTC has been documented as early as 6 years of age. Interventional strategies should consider the risks of complications of these interventions based on certain characteristics of each individual case such as age of the patient, course of disease in affected family members, and the invasiveness of any proposed surgical procedure.",

Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated CT concentrations were measured in 71 healthy volunteers--aged 20-67 years--and 76 genetically unaffected members of families with hereditary MTC--aged 4-61 years. In healthy subjects, CT peak values were below 30 ng/l in 68 cases and below 50 ng/l in 3 cases. In the genetically unaffected patients, CT peak values were below 15 ng/l in young patients and below 30 ng/l in patients older than 19 year excepted 5 men with stimulated CT levels ranging from 36.5 to 52 ng/l. In 2 of these 5, thyroidectomy revealed C-cell hyperplasia. Borderline test results are not sufficient to establish diagnosis of MTC and in these familial syndromes, management has to be based on the results of genetic testing.

This protein was purified from cell culture medium conditioned by Raf-activated MTC cells and was identified by mass spectrometry as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF expression upon Raf activation and subsequent activation of JAK-STAT3 was also observed in small cell lung carcinoma cells, suggesting that this autocrine-paracrine signaling may be a common response to Ras/Raf activation. LIF was sufficient to induce growth arrest and differentiation of MTC cells. This effect was mediated through the gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway, since anti-gp130 blocking antibody or dominant-negative STAT3 blocked the effects of LIF. Thus, LIF expression provides a novel mechanism allowing Ras/Raf signaling to activate the JAK-STAT3 pathway. In addition to this cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory pathway, we find that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway induces an intracellular growth inhibitory signal, independent of the LIF/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can lead to growth arrest and differentiation via at least two different signaling pathways. This use of multiple pathways may be important for \"fail-safe\" induction and maintenance of cell cycle arrest.",

Ganciclovir, a nucleoside analog selectively transformed to a toxic metabolite by HSV1-TK, totally eradicated rMTC-TK tumors in 60% of the animals. 1:1 rMTC and rMTC-TK mixed tumors were also strongly inhibited by ganciclovir (P < 0.05), indicating the occurrence of an efficient \"bystander\" effect in vivo. Double labelling of rMTC cell membranes and apoptotic nuclei revealed that, as with the TK+ cells, some TK- cells died by apoptosis. A 1:1 mixture of rMTC and rMTC-TK cells was administered to produce established tumors and then rMTC cells, transfected to express the IL-2 gene (rMTC-IL2), were inoculated. Combined ganciclovir and IL-2 treatment improved the inhibition of tumor growth compared to that following ganciclovir alone (86% compared to 54%, P < 0.05).

Mature DCs were generated from peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-4, and TNFalpha. After loading with calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) peptide, 2-5 x 10(6) DCs were repeatedly delivered by sc injections.

One of these patients had a complete regression of detectable liver metastases and a significant reduction of pulmonary lesions. T-cell response in this patient revealed a calcitonin- and CEA-specific immunreactivity. Our data indicate that vaccination with calcitonin and/or CEA peptide-pulsed DC results in the induction of a cellular, antigen-specific immune response in patients with MTC, leading to clinical response in some patients.

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

The efficiency of transduction was evaluated using AdCMVbeta-gal at different conditions. The gene transduction efficiency was dependent on multiplicity of infection, duration of exposure to the virus, and viral concentration. The expression of functional mIL-2 in transduced tumor cells was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Two cell lines (rat MTC and mMTC) secreted large amounts of functional mIL-2 after transduction, as tested in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) L-2 cells. When AdCMVmIL2-infected mMTC cells were injected s.c. into their host animals, tumors developed in 2 of 10 animals, in contrast to 9 of 10 animals injected with AdCMVbeta-gal-infected mMTC cells and all 10 animals injected with parental mMTC cells. Moreover protected animals developed a long lasting immunity against mMTC tumor cells and their splenocytes, showing cytotoxicity to parental tumor cells, and active natural killer (NK) cell activity. BALB/c-SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) mice were also used to evaluate the function of NK cells in antitumor activities. No tumor developed in SCID mice injected with AdCMVmIL2-infected cells, whereas all animals injected with either AdCMVbeta-gal-infected or parental mMTC cells developed tumors.

Whether this approach is justified, and, if so, when and to which extent surgery should be performed remained to be clarified. A questionnaire was sent to all surgical departments in Germany and Austria. All of the patients who fulfilled the following criteria were enrolled: (1) preoperatively proved RET mutation; (2) age </= 20 years, (3) clinically asymptomatic thyroid C cell disease; and (4) TNM classification pT0-1/pNX/pN0-1/M0. Seventy-five patients were identified, and fifteen mutations were detected in six codons. Two adolescents had unilateral pheochromocytomas as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia II (MEN-II) syndrome. No hyperparathyroidism was noted. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy, and 57 patients went on to have lymph node dissection. Parathyroid glands were removed in 34 patients and autografted in 11. Histopathology revealed MTC in 46 patients (61%, youngest 4 years); C cell hyperplasia (CCH) only was detected in the other 29 patients. Three patients had lymph node metastases (LNMs) the youngest being age 14 years. Calcitonin levels were not useful for differentiating between CCH and MTC, but in all patients with LNMs at least the stimulated calcitonin levels were assayed. After surgery, five patients (6.7%) sustained permanent hypoparathyroidism, and one patient (1.3%) had a permanent unilateral recurrent nerve palsy. All but three patients (96%) were biochemically cured. In conclusion, prophylactic total thyroidectomy can be performed safely in experienced centers. We recommend prophylactic total thyroidectomy at age 6. Cervicocentral lymph node dissection should be included when calcitonin levels are elevated or if patients are older than 10 years. Bilateral lymph node dissection should be performed if LNMs are suspected or when patients with elevated calcitonin are older than 15 years.",

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cells characteristically express the transcription factor ASCL1 (achaete-scute complex-like 1) as well as high levels of the neuroendocrine (NE) markers calcitonin and chromogranin A (CgA). In this study, we show that the active NOTCH1 intracellular domain is absent in human MTC tumor tissue samples and MTC-TT cells. To determine the effects of NOTCH1 expression, we created a doxycycline-inducible NOTCH1 intracellular domain in MTC cells (TT-NOTCH cells). Treatment of TT-NOTCH cells with doxycycline led to dose-dependent induction of NOTCH1 protein with corresponding decreases in ASCL1 protein and NE hormones. ASCL1 promoter-reporter assay and Northern analysis revealed that ASCL1 reduction by NOTCH1 activation is predominantly via silencing of ASCL1 gene transcription. Overexpression of ASCL1 in MTC cells indicated that CgA expression is highly dependent on the levels of ASCL1. This was further confirmed by experiments using small interfering RNA against ASCL1, in which reduction in ASCL1 led to reduction in both CgA and calcitonin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NOTCH1 signaling activation leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but that reduction in NE markers is independent of ERK1/2 activation. Activation of NOTCH1 resulted in significant MTC cell growth inhibition. Notably, reduction in MTC cell growth was dependent on the level of NOTCH1 protein present. Moreover, no increase in growth upon expression of ASCL1 in NOTCH1-activated cells was observed, indicating that the growth suppression observed upon NOTCH1 activation is independent of ASCL1 reduction. Mechanistically, we show that MTC cell growth inhibition by NOTCH1 is mediated by cell cycle arrest associated with up-regulation of p21.",

The main Tg transcripts present in neoplastic cells (8.5 and 4.8 kb for patient 1 and patient 2) were identical to or smaller than those of normal thyroid tissue (8.5 kb). The tumor CT mRNA (1 kb) was identical to that of normal tissue. In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of CT and Tg mRNA in the great majority of tumor cells. Furthermore, the presence of small amounts of organified iodine was evidenced by analytical ion microscopy in 35% of these cells. This raises an important question regarding the histogenesis of this tumor.",

There was no difference between creatinine before (0.73 mg/dl) and after (0.79 mg/dl) operation. On the follow-up CT, there was a low density area after enucleation. This area gradually decreased and disappeared on enhanced CT 18 months after operation.

We recently observed this phenomenon in a large familial MTC (FMTC) family carrying the RET-S891A mutation. Among genetic modifiers affecting RET-driven MTC, a role has been hypothesized for RET-G691S non-synonymous polymorphism, though the issue remains controversial. Aim of this study was to define the in vitro contribution of RET-G691S to the oncogenic potential of the RET-S891A, previously shown to harbour low transforming activity.;The RET-S891A and RET-G691S/S891A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, transiently transfected in HEK293T cells and stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Their oncogenic potential was defined by assessing the migration ability by wound healing assay and the anchorage-independent growth by soft agar assay in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either the single or the double mutants. Two RET-S891A families were characterised for the presence of RET-G691S.;The functional studies demonstrated that RET-G691S/S891A double mutant displays a higher oncogenic potential than RET-S891A single mutant, assessed by focus formation and migration ability. Moreover, among the 25 RET-S891A carriers, a trend towards an earlier age of diagnosis was found in the MTC patients harboring RET-S891A in association with RET-G691S.;We demonstrate that the RET-G691S non-synonymous polymorphism enhances in vitro the oncogenic activity of RET-S891A. Moreover, an effect on the phenotype was observed in the RET-G691S/S891A patients, thus suggesting that the analysis of this polymorphism could contribute to the decision on the more appropriate clinical and follow-up management.",

Then prophylactic or surgical thyroidectomy with modified or level VI lymph node dissection and adrenalectomy were performed for the carriers. The cases were closely followed up. Massively parallel sequencing revealed four missense mutations of RET. We unexpectedly discovered that the proband's daughter with MEN 2A-related MTC presented a novel p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C compound mutation, due to the involvement of p.C634Y in the proband with MEN 2A and p.V292M/R67H/R982C in the proband's husband with FMTC. In the maternal origin, p.C634Y caused bilateral MTC in all 5 cases and bilateral pheochromocytoma in 2 of the 5; the earliest onset age was 28 years. In the paternal origin, one of the six p.V292M/R67H/R982C carriers presented bilateral MTC (70 years old), one only had bilateral C-cell hyperplasia (44 years), two had bilateral multi-nodules (46 and 48 years) and two showed no abnormality (22 and 19 years).;The results confirmed the successful clinical utility of whole exome sequencing, and our data suggested that the p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C mutation of RET exhibited a more aggressive clinical phenotype than p.C634Y or p.V292M/R67H/R982C, while p.V292M/R67H/R982C presented a relatively milder pathogenicity of MTC and likely predisposed to FMTC.",

The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown encouraging results in neuroendocrine tumors. As part of a prospective phase II study, we analyzed the safety and efficacy of everolimus in advanced MTC. Methods. Seven patients with per RECIST 1.1 documented advanced MTC were included and received everolimus 10 mg daily. The primary objective was determining treatment efficacy. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Results. Median follow-up duration was 28 weeks (17-147). Five patients (71%) showed SD, of which 4 (57%) showed SD >24 weeks. Median PFS and OS were 33 (95%CI: 8-56) and 30 (95%CI: 15-45) weeks, respectively. Toxicity was predominantly grade 1/2 and included mucositis (43%), fatigue (43%), and hypertriglyceridemia (43%). Four MTCs harbored the somatic RET mutation c.2753T>C, p.Met918Thr. The best clinical response was seen in a MEN2A patient. PK characteristics were consistent with phase I data. One patient exhibited extensive toxicity accompanying elevated everolimus plasma concentrations. Conclusions. This study suggests that everolimus exerts clinically relevant antitumor activity in patients with advanced MTC. Given the high level of clinical benefit and the relatively low toxicity profile, further investigation of everolimus in these patients is warranted. ",

RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that cTfg was ubiquitously expressed in rat tissues, while rTfg was predominantly expressed in the brain and retina. Western blot analysis demonstrated two bands with molecular weights of about 30 kDa and 50 kDa in the rat brain.

The aims of this study were to evaluate VEGF-A, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and microvessel density (MVD) expression in MTC samples and correlate it with clinical parameters.;Paraffin-embedded samples from 38 MTC patients were evaluated for VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and MVD expression by immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed in medical records.;Thirty-eight patients aged 31.8 +/- 17.1 years were enrolled. Twenty-seven patients had hereditary disease (71.1%). Twenty-five of them were found to have multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and two were found to have MEN 2B. VEGF-A immunohistochemical staining was detected in 95% (36/38), VEGFR-1 in 96% (36/37), and VEGFR-2 in 91% (31/34) of MTC samples. Age at surgery was positively correlated with VEGFR-2 (p = 0.003). There was no correlation between VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, and tumor stage (tumor node metastasis). Nevertheless, VEGFR-1 was found to be inversely correlated with tumor node metastasis (p = 0.034). We also observed a trend toward an association between VEGFR-1 signal intensity and cure of disease, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.054). Neither VEGF-A nor VEGFR-2 was associated with disease outcome after a median follow-up period of 5 years (p = 0.882 and p = 0.236, respectively).

Geostatistics and geographic information system (GIS) tools have emerged as powerful geospatial technologies to identify disease clusters, map patterns and trends, and assess the impact of ecological and socioeconomic factors (SES) on the spatial distribution of diseases. In this study, these tools were used to analyze thyroid cancer incidence in a rural population.;Thyroid cancer incidence and socio-demographic factors in Vermont (VT), United States, between 1994 and 2007 were analyzed by logistic regression and geospatial and temporal analyses.;The thyroid cancer age-adjusted incidence in Vermont (8.0 per 100,000) was comparable to the national level (8.4 per 100,000), as were the ratio of the incidence of females to males (3.1:1) and the mortality rate (0.5 per 100,000). However, the estimated annual percentage change was higher (8.3 VT; 5.7 U.S.). Incidence among females peaked at 30-59 years of age, reflecting a significant rise from 1994 to 2007, while incidence trends for males did not vary significantly by age. For both females and males, the distribution of tumors by size did not vary over time; ≤1.0 cm, 1.1-2.0 cm, and >2.0 cm represented 38%, 22%, and 40%, respectively. In females, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounted for 89% of cases, follicular (FTC) 8%, medullary (MTC) 2%, and anaplastic (ATC) 0.6%, while in males PTC accounted for 77% of cases, FTC 15%, MTC 1%, and ATC 3%. Geospatial analysis revealed locations and spatial patterns that, when combined with multivariate incidence analyses, indicated that factors other than increased surveillance and access to healthcare (physician density or insurance) contributed to the increased thyroid cancer incidence. Nine thyroid cancer incidence hot spots, areas with very high normalized incidence, were identified based on zip code data. Those locations did not correlate with urban areas or healthcare centers.;These data provide evidence of increased thyroid cancer incidence in a rural population likely due to environmental drivers and SES. Geospatial modeling can provide an important framework for evaluation of additional associative risk factors.",

One MEN 2A patient carried a de novo mutation at codon 634 (C>R). In two families of MEN 2B, all carried the mutation at codon 918 (M>T). These two cases of MEN 2B were all de novo mutations. One family of familial MTC or unclassified MEN 2 carried the codon 620 (C>F) mutation. Among the seven sporadic cases of MTC, none was found to carry any mutation in hotspot exons. Only two non-synonymous variants (T278N/exon 4 and D489N/exon 7) were found in two cases. However, these two variants were not uncommon in our elderly population.;We found that all eight MTC patients with a family history or with the other phenotypes of MEN 2 had RET mutations, whereas no significant RET mutation was found in seven patients with isolated MTC without family history and other endocrine diseases.

This study reports the authors' experience with sorafenib as a treatment for advanced MTC.;This is a retrospective longitudinal study of 13 patients with progressive metastatic MTC treated with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily between December 2011 and January 2015. The primary endpoints were to evaluate response and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with sorafenib outside a clinical trial. The secondary endpoint was an assessment of the toxicity profile. One patient was excluded because of a serious allergic skin rash one week after starting sorafenib.;The analysis included 12 patients with metastatic MTC (median age 48 years), 10 with sporadic and 2 with hereditary disease. The median duration of treatment was 11 months, and the median follow-up was 15.5 months. At data cutoff, 2/12 (16%) patients were still on treatment for 16 and 34 months. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors analysis, 10 (83.3%) patients showed stable disease, and two (16.6%) had progression of disease; no partial response was observed. The median PFS was nine months. However, three patients with extensive and rapidly progressive disease died within three months of sorafenib treatment. The median PFS excluding these three patients was 12 months. Adverse events (AE) occurred in nine (75%) patients. The main AEs were skin toxicity, weight loss, and fatigue. Five (41.6%) patients needed dose reduction, and one patient discontinued treatment because of toxicity.;Treatment with sorafenib in progressive metastatic MTC is well tolerated and resulted in disease control and durable clinical benefit in 75% of patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"During the last two decades, there has been a marked expansion of our knowledge of both the basic and clinical aspects of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). There are two clinically distinct types of MEN2 syndrome, termed MEN2A and MEN2B. Within MEN2A, there are four variants: (i) classical MEN2A, represented by the uniform presence of MTC and the less frequent occurrence of pheochromocytoma, or primary hyperparathyroidism, or both; (ii) MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis; (iii) MEN2A with Hirschsprung's disease; and (iv) familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), i.e., families or individuals with only MTC. MEN2B is associated with MTC, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. Hereditary MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain of function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Specific RET mutations may suggest a predilection toward a particular phenotype and clinical course with a strong genotype-phenotype correlation. Based upon these genotype-phenotype correlations, RET mutations are now stratified into three risk levels, i.e., highest, high, and moderate risk, based on the penetrance and aggressiveness of the MTC. Children in the highest risk category should undergo thyroidectomy in their first year of life, and perhaps even in their first months of life. Children in the high-risk category should have ultrasound of the neck and calcitonin (CTN) measurement performed prior to thyroidectomy. Thyroidectomy should typically be performed at the age of 5 or earlier, depending on the presence of elevated serum CTN levels. However, heterogeneity in disease expression and progression within these groups varies considerably. To personalize disease management, the decision regarding the age of prophylactic thyroidectomy is no longer based upon genotype alone but is currently driven by additional clinical data, the most important being serum CTN levels; specifically, the decision to perform thyroidectomy should err on the safe side if the CTN level is elevated but below 30 pg/ml, especially in the moderate risk group. Personalized management also includes decisions about the best age to begin biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. ",

MEN2A is comprised of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia.

Both pheochromocytomas and ganglioneuromas originate from neural crest cells. Interestingly, two mouse models of MEN2B exhibit adrenal ganglioneuroma formation. One mouse model develops only ganglioneuromas (but not pheochromocytomas) and expresses only one of the oncogenic RET isoforms. The other mouse model, created by site-directed mutagenesis to simulate the most common human mutation, develops both ganglioneuromas and pheochromocytomas.;Given our two cases, our current understanding of the mouse models, and the common origins of all these tumor cell types, we recommend including ganglioneuromas as a rare, but not unexpected, component of the MEN2 syndromes.",

Five patients with primary tumor were studied prior to surgery, four patients were studied after successful removal of the primary tumor, and 26 patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence were studied. Eight patients were studied serially to assess progression of disease, and four patients were studied before and after surgery. Twenty-one of the 26 patients with disease had positive scans with four false-negative scans and three true negative scans. One patient had a false-positive scan (sensitivity 80%, specificity 75%). Two of the false-negative scans were obtained in patients with moderate but stable elevations of calcitonin but no other evidence of recurrence. One false-negative scan was obtained in a patient who was discovered on screening to have an abnormal pentagastrin response, and a small 1 cm tumor was subsequently removed. Uptake in local neck recurrence was frequently intense, but uptake at sites of bone metastases was less marked. 99mTc (V) DMSA is an inexpensive radiopharmaceutical which produces good quality images and has been shown to have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity in the follow-up of patients with MTC and thereby contributes significantly to the management of these patients.",

The mean observation time of each patient between diagnosis of tumour and measurement of bone mineral density was 62.4 months (range 1-158 months). The mean calcitonin serum level was 14.4 micrograms/l at the time of measurement of bone mineral density. All patients were substituted with 150-200 micrograms L-thyroxine daily. At both sites, the mean bone mineral densities of all patients with MTC were not significantly different from controls. Patients with normal calcitonin levels (below 0.2 micrograms/l) after treatment had a normal bone mineral density of the spine but significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced bone mineral density values of the forearm. This was due to the decreased body surface areas of patients in this subgroup. Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIa had significantly higher bone mineral densities. Other bone-influencing factors, such as postoperative hypoparathyroidism, calcium intake, diarrhoea, menopause, tumour stage, previous anti-tumour treatment, or thyroxine substitution dose, did not affect bone mineral density. We thus conclude that long-term excess of endogenous calcitonin in patients with MTC has no positive effect on bone mineral density.",

Moreover, the detection of high-level expression of minimally phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in both TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, together with our data on the effects of EGF stimulation on the proteomic profiles and the response to Gefitinib treatment, suggest the relevance of EGFR signaling in these cell lines, especially since analysis of 14 archival MTC specimens revealed EGFR mRNA expression in all samples.

The present study demonstrates that the human MTC cell line TT stably expresses all the SSTR subtypes and responds to SSTR2 and SSTR5 activation by subtype-selective agonists with two different patterns in terms of [(3)H]thymidine ([(3)H]thy) incorporation and cell number. The SSTR2 preferential agonists (BIM-23120, BIM-23197, BIM-23190, and BIM-23014; 10(-9)-10(-6) M), significantly suppressed [(3)H]thy incorporation (58-13%) and reduced cell proliferation (50-28%), whereas the SSTR5-selective agonist, BIM-23206 (10(-9)-10(-6) M), significantly increased [(3)H]thy incorporation in TT cells (80-175%), but failed to influence cell proliferation. SSTR2 antagonist (BIM-23627) counteracted the action of SSTR2 preferential agonists on TT cells. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of SSTR5-selective agonists, BIM-23206, dose-dependently prevented the suppression of TT cell [(3)H]thy incorporation and proliferation produced by SSTR2 preferential agonist, BIM-23120, showing an antagonism between these compounds. The following conclusions were reached: 1) the human MTC cell line TT expresses all SSTR subtypes; 2) SSTR2 activation inhibits DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, whereas SSTR5 activation increases DNA synthesis; and 3) SSTR2 preferential agonist (BIM-23120) can antagonise SSTR5-selective agonist (BIM-23206) action and vice versa.

        "Doc_abstract":"The new incretin-based therapies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of their glucose-lowering capacity with low risk of hypoglycemia. As they are weight neutral or induce weight loss in this mostly overweight population, they are popular among clinicians and patients alike. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised about GLP1's trophic effects. While increased β cell mass observed in rodents sounds appealing for treatment of diabetes, there was also an increased incidence of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in some species. We reviewed literature available in the Medline database until March 2012. Safety signals have emerged for MTC and pancreatic carcinoma from adverse event databases in the United States and Europe. Considering the relatively short duration of these studies, it is more likely that premalignant lesions are stimulated in presence of GLP1, rather than new neoplasms induced. Moreover, interpreting results of animal studies is difficult because of species-specific differences in presence and density of GLP1 receptors. Furthermore, data are emerging suggesting beneficial effects of GLP1 on colon and breast cancer. In conclusion, presently, the benefits of using DPP4 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists for treatment of type 2 diabetes outweigh the risks. Nonetheless, their safety profile should be monitored and their indications should be widened cautiously. At present they remain contra-indicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.",

Germline high penetrance gain-of-function RET mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, of which medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma are components, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause Hirschprung disease (HSCR). A low-penetrance founder locus, in linkage disequilibrium with a RET ancestral haplotype comprising specific alleles at three intron (IVS) 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (haplotype 0) and SNP A45A, predisposes to the majority of isolated HSCR. A different low-penetrance locus, in linkage disequilibrium with IVS 1 haplotype 2 and SNP S836S, was associated with a subset of sporadic MTC. We, therefore, sought to determine whether RET might also be a low-penetrance gene for apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. We analyzed 104 pheochromocytoma cases without germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHD, and SDHB for their status at A45, S836, three IVS 1 SNPs, and a novel upstream insertion/deletion variant. Pheochromocytoma cases were not associated with either A45A or S836S, but we found that cases were associated with haplotype 0 (P = 0.032). However, unlike HSCR, this pheochromocytoma-associated haplotype 0 was not associated with A45A. Taken together with the strengthening of association with the addition of the 5' insertion/deletion variant data (P = 0.016), our observations suggest the presence of a low-penetrance pheochromocytoma susceptibility locus in a region upstream of the putative loci for HSCR and apparently sporadic MTC.",

This review discusses promising recent clinical trials data for multikinase inhibitors including motesanib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and cabozantinib/XL184. Across multiple studies reported to date, RET mutations, although prevalent in these subjects, have not proven so far to predict whether patients will respond to multikinase inhibitors.

This presentation deals with our experience in such conditions. During 11 years, 98 cases of pHPT were seen (90 in Ulm from 1968 to 1979, 8 since then in Heidelberg). In 9 patients, 2 to 4 parathyroids were in hyperfunction. A recurrence of pHPT was diagnosed after symptomfree intervals of 2 - 13 years in 5 patients. Data are presented of 4 patients suffering from MEN type I (Wermer syndrome): 3 had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and pHPT, and the 4th insulinoma and pHPT. Whereas pHPT is the most frequent endocrinopathy in MEN type I, it is rarely seen in MEN type II, the Sipple syndrome (combination of medullary thyroid carcinoma, MTC, and pheochromocytoma). Among 20 own cases with MTC and 10 others with pheochromocytoma, no pHPT was observed.

In 8 families with FMTC or MEN-2A, no mutation could be detected in the cysteine-rich domain encoded in exons 10 and 11 of the ret protooncogene. DNA sequencing of additional exons (no. 13-15) revealed rare noncysteine mutations in 3 families (codons 631, 768, and 844). In contrast to these rare events, heterozygous missense mutations in exon 13, codons 790 and 791, were found in 5 families (4 with MTC only; 1 family with MTC and pheochromocytoma) and 11 patients with apparently sporadic tumors. Two different mutations in codon 790 (TTG-->TTT, TTG-->TTC; Leu790Phe) and one mutation in codon 791 (TAT-->TTT; Tyr791Phe) created a phenylalanine residue. We conclude that codons 790 and 791 of the ret protooncogene represent a new hot spot for FMTC/MEN-2A causing mutations. With the discovery of these considerably common mutations in codons 790 and 791 and the identification of some rare mutations, 100% of the German FMTC/MEN-2A families could be characterized by a mutation in the ret protooncogene.",

Six primary tumours, diagnosed by increased calcitonin levels, were all correctly diagnosed; 47 recurrences, also suspected by blood tumour markers, were detected and confirmed by cytology or histology. In one case, single photon emission tomography allowed the detection of small lymph nodes with a diameter of 4-7 mm. These lesions, not judged neoplastic by ultrasound, were confirmed to be neoplastic by fine needle aspiration. Pretargeted ISG correctly localises primary tumours and recurrences in MTC patients, when the only marker of relapse is serum elevation of calcitonin.

        "Doc_abstract":"Calcitonin (CT) secretion by parafollicular cells of the thyroid (C cells) is regulated by small changes in the concentration of extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]e). Elevation of [Ca2+]e elicits a rise in the C cell cytoplasmic calcium concentration and stimulates CT release. The molecular entity through which C cells detect changes in [Ca2+]e and modulate hormone secretion is unknown. Recently, an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) complementary DNA was isolated from bovine parathyroid gland. To assess whether parathyroid cells and C cells use similar mechanisms to detect changes in ambient Ca2+, rat, human, and sheep C cells were examined for expression of the parathyroid CaR or a related receptor isoform. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis identified CaR transcripts in rat and human thyroid gland. Northern blot analysis demonstrated CaR messenger RNA (mRNA) in rat thyroid gland, a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) isolate, and a highly enriched preparation of sheep C cells. Rat MTC 44-2 cells, a cell line responsive to changes in [Ca2+]e, express abundant levels of CaR mRNA. Human TT cells, a C cell line lacking the extracellular calcium-sensing function, have undetectable levels of CaR mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis, using antiserum specific to the parathyroid CaR, detected CaR protein in rMTC 44-2, but not TT cells. Immunostaining of both dispersed sheep C cells and rat thyroid gland sections identified C cell-specific expression of the CaR protein, and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the C cell-specific expression of CaR mRNA in the intact rat thyroid. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the rMTC 44-2 CaR transcripts was found to encode the same CaR protein as that expressed in the parathyroid and kidney. The results demonstrate that C cells express the same extracellular calcium-sensing receptor that is found in parathyroid and kidney, and the presence of this receptor protein in C cell lines correlates with the extracellular calcium-sensing function. This CaR is likely to represent the primary molecular entity through which C cells detect changes in [Ca2+]e and control CT release, suggesting that activation of the same receptor can either stimulate or inhibit hormone secretion in different cell types.",

In addition, somatic RET mutations have been identified in a variable proportion (about 30-70%) of sporadic (nonfamilial) MTC cases.;We describe a Greek family with two novel likely pathogenic sequence variants of the RET gene. The first is a C to T transition at position 2458 (c.2458C>T) that causes an arginine to cysteine substitution (p.R820C) in exon 14 in the intracellular region of the kinase. This sequence variant was identified in an apparently healthy woman who had a recently deceased sister with confirmed aggressive MTC (age of onset 37 years). To assess the pathogenicity of this novel missense sequence variant, screening was performed on all available relatives: her two sons, the mother, and a second sister, including an MTC tumor sample from the deceased sister of the proband. At the time of the investigation, no clinical symptoms suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or MTC were present in any of the individuals screened.;The c.2458C>T transition was found in one son, the living sister, and the mother. Interestingly, it was not present in the tumor sample from the deceased sister. Instead, an in-frame deletion of 54 nt in exon 10 resulting in a protein missing 18 amino acids from I590 to G608 (c.1766_1819del 54) was found. Both genetic alterations were present in heterozygous state.;These data suggest that the novel in-frame deletion was the disease-causing mutation in the deceased sister. The effect of the 2458C>T mutation on the activity of the kinase is under investigation.",

Genetic screening provides early diagnosis and preventive treatment. In order to validate DNA analysis as a reliable method of early identification of gene carriers, we compared the results of genetic screening with clinical, biochemical, imaging and pathological findings in the members of an affected family.;The diagnosis of a bilateral necrotic Pheo in a female patient led to the study of a family with four generations, aged 3 to 78 years (mean = 30.3 yrs). The study included a clinical examination; basal and pentagastrin stimulated calcitonin values; urinary catecholamines and their metabolites; serum calcium and a genetic study (direct sequence of PCR products from genomic DNA isolated from leucocytes using specific primers in exon 11 of the RET protooncogene of chromosome 10). The radiologic study, gammagraphic study (131I-MIBG) and magnetic resonance study were performed in members with clinical suspicion of Pheo.;Seven out of nine patients had a mutation on codon 634 of exon 11 of RET (TGC-CGC), leading to cysteine arginine substitution in the codified protein; all gene carriers had biochemical markers of MTC/CCH and four of Pheo. The Pheo patients underwent adrenalectomy (bilateral in three) and all the gene carriers underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy. The pathologic findings were: MTC in four (metastasized in one); CCH in three and parathyroid hyperplasia in one.;Phenotypic penetration of RET mutation was 100% for MTC/CCH, but only 57% of the gene carriers had Pheo.

To comprehend these complex courses and to find relevant prognostic factors we report a 20-year single center experience of 289 patients with MTC or precursor C-cell-hyperplasias.;Between April 1986 and May 2006, 289 consecutive patients with MTC or MEN2 gene carriers were treated at the Department of Surgery at the University Hospital Düsseldorf. Tumor stages were documented according to the classification of the International Union against Cancer 5th edition, 1997 (Schott. Endocr Relat Cancer. 2006;13:779-795). A system to easily comprehend operative procedures is suggested.;There were 159 female and 130 male patients (f/m ratio 1.22). Mean age at time of diagnosis was 32 years (4-77) in the familial cases and 53 years (23-84) years in the sporadic cases. Sixty-six patients (23%) had multifocal disease. Twelve MEN2-patients had only C-cell-hyperplasia (pT0). Tumor stage was pT1 in 86 patients, pT2 in 106 patients, pT3 in 25 patients, pT4 in 52 patients and unclear in 8 patients. In the 289 patients 648 operations were performed. One hundred seventy patients had more than 1 operation (59%). Ninety-nine patients (34%) are calcitonin-negative and 91 patients (31%) live with elevated calcitonin. Median follow-up time of the surviving 211 patients was 8.9 years (range, 0.3-30.7 years). The 5- and 10-year survival of all tumor patients was 86% and 68%, respectively.;The chance to achieve biochemical cure in MTC is clearly dependent on the primary tumor size. The chance for long-term biochemical cure in a pT4-tumor is almost nil even after multiple and extended reoperations, whereas a pT1 tumor can be cured in up to 67% of the patients. Long-term survival, however, can be achieved even in pT4 tumor patients in almost 50%.",

In thyroid tissue the NT-3 mRNA level was threefold lower and the NT-4 mRNA level sixfold higher than those detected in adult rat hippocampus, while BDNF mRNA was undetectable. Very low levels of mRNA for truncated trkB and trkC receptors and no catalytic trkA, trkB or trkC were found. In conclusion NT-3 and NT-4, but not the corresponding functional receptors, are expressed in the thyroid tissue. Therefore, it is unlikely that these factors serve a direct local autocrine or paracrine function in thyroid cell types, and a target-derived mode of action on neurons innervating the thyroid tissue is suggested. An opposite result has been found for the neurotrophic factor GDNF: thyroid tissue showed a high level of transcripts for the GDNF receptor subunits (GDNFR-alpha and Ret), while GDNF mRNA was undetectable. The in situ hybridization analysis of GDNFR-alpha and ret mRNA revealed an interesting difference in the cell distribution of these transcripts: ret mRNA is selectively expressed in a subpopulation of cells scattered in the follicular epithelium and in the interfollicular spaces, while GDNFR-alpha expression is more homogeneous and widespread, including the more abundant cell type of the thyroid gland: the follicular cell. Double-labeling in situ hybridization/immunocytochemistry experiments, with a specific marker (calcitonin), showed that parafollicular cells express ret but not GDNFR-alpha. This differential distribution of the GDNF receptor components (GDNFR-alpha and ret) may reflect a peculiar biological role in intercellular communication in the thyroid gland.",

The study showed a focus of radionuclide accumulation corresponding to the parapharyngeal mass. After resection of the latter, pathology confirmed metastatic MTC. To our knowledge, this is the first case of metastatic, histologically proven MTC, which was unequivocally detected by 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine PET scanning.

A dose-dependent inhibition of ASCL1, a neuroedocrine transcription factor, was observed at the protein and mRNA levels. Protein levels of CgA, a marker of hormone secretion, were also reduced after treatment with resveratrol.

Patient-related reasons for deviation from MTC recommendations included failure to attend for follow-up (n = 24, 16.6%), clinical deterioration (n = 19, 13.1%) and patient preference (n = 13, 9.0%). Physician-related reasons for discordance included treating physician preference (n = 43, 29.7%) and finding that the patient was not a candidate for the recommended intervention (n = 37, 25.5%). After the first MTC discussion, 62.0% of patients received the recommended treatment; these patients were more likely to be alive at 1 year compared with those who did not receive the recommended treatment (P = 0.007). More of the patients who followed recommendations underwent liver transplantation (25.6% versus 14.4%; P = 0.10).;There are patient-related as well as physician-related reasons for non-adherence to recommendations.

A planar and tomographic (SPECT) [99mTc]MIBI scan, performed in order to investigate a recent hyperparathyroidism localized a parathyroid adenoma and revealed an abnormal uptake in the left lateral neck region, corresponding to apparently banal lymph nodes on MRI. This abnormal uptake was also observed on a [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) study and was proven to be an uptake in MTC lymph nodes metastases as confirmed by histopathologic analysis. We conclude that, using an adequate acquisition protocol (i.e. SPECT), [99mTc]MIBI scan is potentially able to localize both parathyroid adenoma and recurrent MTC at one and the same time, particularly in case of non-diagnostic conventional imaging techniques.

The object of this study was to determine the in vitro biochemical and cellular inhibitory profile of cabozantinib against RET, and in vivo antitumor efficacy using a xenograft model of MTC.;Cabozantinib was evaluated in biochemical and cell-based assays that determined the potency of the compound against wild type and activating mutant forms of RET. Additionally, the pharmacodynamic modulation of RET and MET and in vivo antitumor activity of cabozantinib was examined in a MTC tumor model following subchronic oral administration.;In biochemical assays, cabozantinib inhibited multiple forms of oncogenic RET kinase activity, including M918T and Y791F mutants. Additionally, it inhibited proliferation of TT tumor cells that harbor a C634W activating mutation of RET that is most often associated with MEN2A and familial MTC. In these same cells grown as xenograft tumors in nude mice, oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition that correlated with a reduction in circulating plasma calcitonin levels. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses of tumors revealed that cabozantinib reduced levels of phosphorylated MET and RET, and decreased tumor cellularity, proliferation, and vascularization.;Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of RET and prevalent mutationally activated forms of RET known to be associated with MTC, and effectively inhibits the growth of a MTC tumor cell model in vitro and in vivo.",

We investigated the hypothesis that NGF and its high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) are highly expressed in cases of oral SCC that have histologic evidence of PNI.;We performed immunohistochemistry on archived oral tongue SCC specimens from the established oral and general pathology databases at the University of California, San Francisco. The following groups were evaluated: 1) 21 T1/T2 oral tongue SCC cases with PNI and 2) 21 T1/T2 oral tongue SCC cases without histologic evidence of PNI.;Strong homogeneous cytoplasmic staining for NGF and TrkA was detected in the malignant cells in the PNI-positive group of tumors. In group II (PNI negative) NGF and TrkA were detected in the stroma cells or were very weakly expressed by the malignant cells. We were able to show the presence of NGF and TrkA in the cytoplasm of malignant squamous cells in tumors with histologic evidence of PNI. Immunostaining for NGF (P = .0001) and TrkA (P = .039) was significantly higher in the PNI-positive oral SCC group than in the PNI-negative oral SCC group.;This study shows that oral SCC with evidence of PNI shows increased expression of NGF and TrkA and suggests that NGF and TrkA are involved with the mechanism leading to PNI.

Serious morbidity and mortality rates associated with these tumors are related to the potent effects of catecholamines on various organs, especially those of the cardiovascular system. Before any surgical procedure is done, preoperative blockade is necessary to protect the patient against significant release of catecholamines due to anesthesia and surgical manipulation of the tumor. Treatment options vary with the extent of the disease, with laparoscopic surgery being the preferred treatment for removal of primary tumors. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid C cells or parafollicular cells. Thyroid C cells elaborate a number of peptides and hormones, such as calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chromogranin A. Some or all of these markers are elevated in patients with MTC and can be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to follow patients longitudinally for recurrence. Medullary thyroid cancer consists of a spectrum of diseases that ranges from extremely indolent tumors that are stable for many years to aggressive types associated with a high mortality rate. Genetic testing for RET mutations has allowed identification of familial cases and prophylactic thyroidectomy for cure. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection.",

SS-R have also been found in the majority of malignant lymphomas, in several brain tumors (all meningiomas, most astrocytomas) and in breast tumors. The majority of tumors expressing SS-R are rather differentiated, e.g. astrocytomas in contrast to glioblastomas, but exceptions exist such as high grade malignant lymphomas. An inverse relationship exists between SS-R and receptors for epidermal growth factor in lung tumors, glial tumors and most breast tumors, whereas meningiomas express both receptors simultaneously. A minority of tumors such as ovarian tumors, MTC and insulinomas, express a subtype of SS-R, characterized by low affinity for the octapeptide SS analog octreotide. The function of SS-R in human tumors differs according to tumor type, SS-R in pituitary and GEP tumors mediate hormone secretion inhibition, and have possibly some antiproliferative effects. In meningiomas, however, activation of SS-R inhibits forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, and weakly stimulates proliferation. Although SS-R seem to mediate antiproliferative effects in animal models and cell lines of lymphomas, breast and lung tumors, such an effect has not yet been convincingly documented in human primary tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We therefore examined the feasibility of radioiodine therapy of MTC after human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) gene transfer, using the tumor-specific carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) promoter for transcriptional targeting. NIS gene transfer was performed in vivo in human MTC cell (TT) xenografts, using adenoviral vectors carrying the NIS gene linked to the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad5-CMV-NIS) or a CEA promoter fragment (Ad5-CEA-NIS). Functional NIS expression was confirmed by immunostaining as well as in vivo (123)I gamma-camera imaging followed by application of a therapeutic (131)I dose. TT cell xenografts in nude mice injected intratumorally with Ad5-CEA-NIS accumulated 7.5 +/- 1.2% ID/g (percentage injected dose per gram tumor tissue; 5 x 10(8) PFU) and 12 +/- 2.95% ID/g (1 x 10(9) PFU) with an average biological half-life of 6.1 +/- 0.8 and 23.6 +/- 3.7 hr, respectively, as compared with accumulation of 8.4 +/- 0.9% ID/g with a biological half-life of 12 +/- 8 hr after application of Ad5-CMV-NIS (5 x 10(8) PFU). After Ad5-CEA-NIS-mediated NIS gene transfer in TT cell xenografts administration of a therapeutic dose of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of (131)I resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth associated with significantly lower calcitonin serum levels in treated mice as well as improved survival.

While MTC cells expressed barely detectable amounts of EGFR, MTLn3 cells expressed readily detectable levels of receptor. This was demonstrated in Northern blot analysis, in immunoprecipitation studies using metabolically labeled whole cell lysates and in Western blot analysis of membrane fractions. Cross-linking of radiolabeled ligand to intact cells identified on both cell types specific binding to a 170 kd protein, however, at much lower levels on low-metastatic MTC cells and not in sufficient amounts to estimate receptor numbers by Scatchard analysis. In contrast, Scatchard plot analysis of I-125-EGF binding to MTLn3 cells revealed the expression of about 10,000 high and 46,000 low affinity sites. Both cell lines expressed the ligand in comparable amounts as was demonstrated by using a specific rat TGFalpha cDNA probe in Northern blot and an antibody recognising membrane bound TGF in FACS analysis. Adhesion of MTC cells to immobilized collagen or fibronectin was rapid reaching 50% after 30 min while control MTLn3 cells demonstrated lower adhesion to collagen.

Twelve (27%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia and 9 (20%) patients suffered from permanent hypocalcemia, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher incidence with decreasing age. Three (7%) patients had other complications, of whom 2 were younger than 3 years. For patients younger than 3 years, the average length of stay (LOS) was 6.7 days, versus 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively, for the older patient groups (P < 0.05). Patients with complications had a longer LOS compared with patients without (5.0 vs 2.0, P < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical signs of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up of 10.5 years. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in very young children is associated with a higher rate of complications, causing a significant increased LOS. Irrespective age of surgery, MTC did not recur in any patient. In planning optimal timing of surgery, clinicians should take the risk of complications into account. We advise not to perform total thyroidectomy before the age of 3 for patients defined high risk by the American Thyroid Association guideline.",

Highly potent antigen-presenting cells, namely dendritic cells (DCs), may serve as an interesting tool for anticancer vaccination. Here we report on the IN VITRO findings of a vaccination trial in five MTC patients, who were treated with a new DC generation protocol consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon-alpha (IFN-DCs). These cells were pulsed with tumor-specific calcitonin and administered twice. In two patients who responded to therapy we found a large increase (in mean 2.9+/-1.9%) of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD4+ cells as well as an increase of granzyme B positive CD8+ cells (mean 2.2+/-0.2%) in the peripheral blood. In parallel, a decrease of CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T cells was seen. Importantly, IN VITRO stimulation of PBMC with 10 different 15mer calcitonin peptides resulted in the identification of two HLA class II epitope regions within the central part of full-length calcitonin. These data were in accordance with the results drawn from the computer-based algorithm epitope prediction software SYFPEITHI. Measurement of different pro- and anti-angiogenic factors did not allow for a distinct outcome of prediction of the treated patients. In summary, we have demonstrated that immunization with IFN-DCs leads to a tumor epitope-specific immune response in MTC patients and may, therefore, represent a promising tool for future vaccination trials.",

In vitro expression showed that phosphorylation of the crucial tyrosine 905 was much stronger in the p.505_506del RET mutant compared with WT RET, indicating ligand-independent autophosphorylation. Furthermore, the p.505_506del RET mutant induced a strong activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consequently, the p.505_506del RET mutant cells increased HEK293 colony formation 4-fold compared with WT RET.;The finding of bilateral pheochromocytoma and MTC in our patient was highly suspicious of a RET mutation. Exome sequencing revealed a 6-base-pair deletion in exon 7 of RET, an exon not yet associated with MEN2. Increased ligand-independent phosphorylation of the p.505_506del RET mutant, increased activation of downstream pathways, and stimulation of cell proliferation demonstrated the pathogenic nature of the mutation.

This ignorance is partly due to the lack of appropriate animal models from which to investigate this complex process. The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor pathway (pRb/E2F) is mutated in almost all human tumours, and a number of laboratories have now established pRb- or E2F-deficient mouse models. Consistent with the role of mutation in retinoblastoma in cancer biology, Rb heterozygous mice are prone to develop tumours. Among the ensuing tumours, the medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs) have a lessened tendency to form secondary cancers and metastases. Intriguingly, if an E2f3 mutation is introduced in this genetic background, more aggressive MTCs develop, which metastasize more frequently. Gene chip microarrays, however, provide an unbiased approach for examining the genome-wide expression levels and enable identification of a large set of metastasis-enriched gene sets. The identified genes may simply represent putative markers of the disease stage. Alternatively, genes may be identified that causally determine a link to the onset of metastasis. We describe the use of gene chip microarrays for identification of putative markers enriched in metastatic mouse MTCs. The chapter details how the most promising candidates are verified using additional methods, such as quantitative real-time PCR. In this case, co-transfection of the E2F-transcription factor using a heterologous reporter gene system is suggestive of E2Fs directly regulating putative metastasis markers.",

The close proximity to the plasma membrane of the affected cysteine residues prompted us to investigate the possible role of the transmembrane (TM) domain of RET (RET-TM) in receptor-receptor interactions underlying dimer formation. Strong self-association of the RET-TM was observed in a biological membrane. Mutagenesis studies indicated the involvement of the evolutionary conserved residues Ser-649 and Ser-653 in RET-TM oligomerization. Unexpectedly, RET-TM interactions were also abrogated in the A639G/A641R double mutant, first identified in a sporadic case of MTC. In agreement with this, no transforming activity could be detected in full-length RET carrying the A639G and A641R mutations, which remained fully responsive to glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulation. When introduced in the context of C634R - a cysteine replacement that is prevalent in MEN2A cases - the A639G/A641R mutations significantly reduced dimer formation and transforming activity in this otherwise highly oncogenic RET variant. These data suggest that a strong propensity to self-association in the RET-TM underlies - and may be required for - dimer formation and oncogenic activation of juxtamembrane cysteine mutants of RET, and explains the close proximity to the plasma membrane of cysteine residues implicated in MEN2A and MTC syndromes.",

Successful management of recurrent disease requires accurate localisation with cross sectional and functional imaging. The introduction of gallium-68-Dotatate ((68)Ga-Dotatate) peptides positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) has significantly improved the detection of NET and has been reported as a valuable adjunct in MTC localisation. We retrospectively reviewed our cases of MTC to correlate the detectability of (68)Ga-Dotatate in relation to calcitonin levels and assess suitability of inoperable patients for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).;Seven patients (age range 31-66 years, M:F 3:4) with raised calcitonin (mean=7,143pg/mL) were referred for (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT scan for localisation of persisting recurrent MTC.

All patients had multiple imaging including ultrasound (US), CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT and iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG). Positive findings were defined as areas of increased uptake other than the organs of normal distribution and were correlated with results of biopsies, other imaging, long term monitoring of calcitonin and clinical follow up.;In 6/7 patients with very high serum calcitonin (range= 672-37,180, mean=8,320pg/mL) (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT confirmed the presence of active disease seen on other modalities or detected hitherto unsuspected lesions. In at least 3 cases, (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT showed many more lesions compared to other imaging combined. In 1/7 patient (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT was negative in line with a relatively low calcitonin level (80pg/mL) and negative disease on fine needle aspiration.;(68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT is an effective tool for localising metastatic spread of MTC.

Recent studies have shown that both the number of involved lymph nodes (LNs) and the metastatic lymph node ratio (MLNR) confer prognostic information. This study was to determine the predictive value of MLNR on cancer-specific survival (CSS) in SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-registered MTC patients treated with thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy between 1991 and 2012, investigate the cutoff points for MLNR in stratifying risk of mortality and provide evidence for selection of appropriate treatment strategies. X-tile program determined 0.5 as optimal cut-off value for MLNR in terms of CSS in 890 MTC patients. According to multivariate Cox regression analysis, MLNR (0.50-1.00) is a significant independent prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio 2.161, 95% confidence interval 1.327-3.519, p=0.002). MLNR (0.50-1.00) has a greater prognostic impact on CSS in female, non-Hispanic white, T3/4, N1b and M1 patients. The lymph node yield (LNY) influences the effect of MLNR on CSS; LNY ≥9 results in MLNR (0.50-1.00) having a higher HR for CSS than MLNR (0.00-0.49). In conclusion, higher MLNRs predict poorer survival in MTC patients. Eradication of involved nodes ensures accurate staging and maximizes the ability of MLNR to predict prognosis.",

A family with MEN 2A, consisting of 88 members and their spouses, was studied to test the reliability of the provocation of plasma calcitonin with pentagastrin and the possibility of DNA diagnosis of mutated gene carriers with DNA probes closely linked to the MEN2A gene including RBP3 and FNRB genes.

Twenty-seven histological parameters were considered, including cellular heterogeneity, shape of the cells, and cytoplasmic characteristics. Other parameters such as sex, age, and phenotype of the disease were also studied. First, predictive parameters of interest on survival function were selected by univariate analysis (Mantel-Cox test). Then, the extracted parameters were tested in a multifactorial analysis using the Cox's forward stepping proportional hazard model. Five parameters were significantly associated with a lower survival function: presence of necrosis in the tumor (P = .001), squamous pattern (P = .002), age over 45 years (P = .004), presence of oxyphil cells in the tumor and absence of cells with intermediate cytoplasm (P = .025), less than 50% of calcitonin immunoreactive cells in the tumor (P = .04).",

MEN1 is characterized by parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumours, whilst MEN2 is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in association with phaeochromocytoma. There are three clinical variants, referred to as MEN2A, MEN2B and MTC-only. All these forms of MEN may be inherited as autosomal dominant syndromes. The MEN1 gene is on chromosome 11q13 and about 300 MEN1 mutations have been identified. These are of diverse types and are scattered throughout the coding region. There is also a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation. All these findings make it difficult to implement MEN1 mutational analysis in the clinical setting. The situation in MEN2 is more straightforward. The gene causing all three MEN2 variants is located on chromosome 10cen-10q11.2, and is the c-ret proto-oncogene which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with cadherin-like and cysteine-rich extracellular domains, and a tyrosine kinase intracellular domain. Specific mutations of c-ret have been identified for each of the three MEN2 variants and mutational analysis has been used in the diagnosis and management of patients and families with the MEN2 variants.",

The following survival variables were tested: sex, age, stage, familial disease, Serum Carcino Embryonic Antigen (CEA) and Calcitonin (CT) levels three months postoperatively, intensity of CEA and CT immunostaining, percentage of cells stained for CEA and CT. The actuarial survival rate, including postoperative mortality (N = 1), was studied by uni and multivariate analysis using a Cox model (N = 31). The 5-year survival was 69 +/- 7%. By univariate analysis, stages I or II (p < 0.0001), age of 45 years and less (p < 0.0001), normalized CEA levels (p < 0.006), percentage of CT stained cells greater than 80% (p < 0.04) and weak CT and CEA staining (p < 0.02) were significant predictors of increased survival rates. Age less than 45 and stages I or II were significant prognostic factors of goof survival on multivariate analysis (p < 0.001).

In the papillary form of thyroid cancer (PTC), for example, activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes, ret or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type I (NTRK1) by intra- or interchromosomal rearrangements have been suggested as a cause of the disease. The 1986 accident at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine, led to the uncontrolled release of high levels of radioisotopes. Ten years later, the incidence of childhood papillary thyroid cancer (chPTC) near Chernobyl had risen by two orders of magnitude. Tumors removed from some of these patients showed aberrant expression of the ret RTK gene due to a ret/PTC1 or ret/PTC3 rearrangement involving chromosome 10. However, many cultured chPTC cells show a normal G-banded karyotype and no ret rearrangement. We hypothesize that the \"ret-negative\" tumors inappropriately express a different oncogene or have lost function of a tumor suppressor as a result of chromosomal rearrangements, and decided to apply molecular and cytogenetic methods to search for potentially oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements in Chernobyl chPTC cases.

The present study was conducted to investigate the expression of NGF and TrkA in salivary ACC and to examine the effects of NGF on adhesion, migration and invasion capacities of a salivary ACC cell line (SACC-83) in vitro.;Expression of NGF and TrkA was explored using immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues of 32 cases of salivary ACC. The effects of NGF on in vitro adhesion, migration, and invasion capacities of the SACC-83 cell line were examined using an MTT assay and a modified Boyden chamber assay respectively.;In ACC specimens, 31 (96.9%) and 32 (100%) tumors showed immunoreactivity for NGF and TrkA respectively. Significant correlations were found between NGF/TrkA expression levels and perineural invasion (P < .05). In cell adhesion assay, the percent adherences of SACC-83 cells co-cultured with 25 ng/ml NGF at 1.5 hours and 5, 25 ng/ml NGF at 6 hours were significantly higher than that co-cultured with 0 ng/ml NGF (P < .05). However, high concentration of NGF (500 ng/ml) resulted in a significant inhibition of invasion (P < .05).;Overexpression of NGF and TrkA in human salivary ACC tissues may constitute a reason for perineural invasion in salivary ACC.",

We evaluated quantitatively by in situ hybridization the expression of the CT gene in tissue section of 5 MTCs (2 sporadic and 3 familial forms). The primary tumor of one MTC was compared to a brain metastasis. In situ hybridization was carried out with tritiated cDNA probes coding for CT and CGRP mRNA. After autoradiography the number of silver grains was counted in 400 cells by computerized analysis of digitized images and expressed as the labelling level (L.L. = grain area/cell area per day of autoradiographic exposure). This was used to calculate the relative abundance per cell of the specific messengers studied, which depends on the autoradiographic efficiency and the specific activity of the probe used. The CT mRNA content was 3.25-6.55 10(-10) micrograms equivalents in the 3 familial forms of MTC and 4.95-9.25 10(-10) micrograms equivalents for the 2 sporadic forms. The levels of CT mRNA in the brain metastasis and in the primary tumor were identical (4.10 10(-10) micrograms equivalents). CGRP mRNA expression was weaker in the sporadic and in the familial thyroid tumors (0.60-1.65 10(-10) micrograms equivalents).

It may be sporadic (75% of cases), or may occur as a manifestation of either the hereditary syndrome Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2A or MEN 2B) (25% of cases), or rarely as an isolated familial syndrome (FMTC). Complete surgical resection comprising in most cases total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection at an early stage of the disease is the only potential cure for MTC. The familial form of the disease, MEN-2A occupies a unique place in surgical history, having been the first disease where surgical removal of an affected organ was undertaken before the development of malignancy, solely on the basis of genetic testing. Total thyroidectomy prior to the development of invasive cancer completely avoids an otherwise lethal malignancy. Timing of prophylactic surgery is based on models that utilise genotype-phenotype correlations, which have now been stratified into three risk groups based on the specific codon involved. MTC should be followed with postoperative serial serum calcitonin levels to survey for persistent or recurrent disease as indicated by detectable levels. The challenge however, if calcitonin levels are increased, is to find the source of its production. The first localisation technique recommended would be ultrasound of the neck, since there is a high frequency of local recurrence and cervical node metastasis, followed by a total body CT scan and bone scintigraphy.",

Thallium is a well-known marker of cellularity with a great sensitivity and a lack of specificity. In order to determine whether the association of these two markers is able to improve the detection of neuroendocrine lesions, 137 scintigraphic examinations using MIBG and thallium were performed in 101 patients referred for suspicion or follow-up of neuroendocrine tumours. Thallium chloride was first injected (1 MBq/kg), images being acquired about 20 min after injection; 123I-MIBG (4 MBq/kg) was then injected and images acquired 5 and 24 h later. In patients with phaeochromocytoma or neuroblastoma, thallium scintigraphy appeared of little help since no tumoural site was discovered by thallium accumulation alone. In contrast, thallium examination seemed of interest in the detection of paraganglioma and MTC, the association of the two radiopharmaceuticals increasing the number of detected sites.",

Sg IV immunoreactivity was present in almost all normal-looking and hyperplastic C-cells, in 59 of 62 (96%) of the primary tumours, in 18 of 26 (69%) lymph node metastases and in distant metastasis. Sg IV reactivity ranged from small foci of positive tumour cells to a reaction in virtually every malignant cell. Two different staining patterns were obvious: a granular cytoplasmic reactivity and a perinuclear cluster-type signal. Normal-appearing and hyperplastic C-cells were characterized by a uniform granular staining often coexisting with discrete cluster-type immunoreactivity. Various combinations of these staining patterns were observed in C-cell carcinomas. The pure cluster-type reactivity was restricted to malignant C cells and was not detected in normal-appearing and hyperplastic C-cells. In serial sections immunohistochemical results for Sg IV, calcitonin (Ct) and chromogranin A (Cg A) showed only partial correlation. Depending on the area of the tumour chosen, immunohistochemical reactivity for Ct and Cg A might not be demonstrated in neoplastic C-cells, while staining for Sg IV was retained. The amount and type of Sg IV reactivity of MTCs was not correlated with the biological behaviour of the tumours. These results indicate that mAb Hisl-19 is an excellent marker for normal, hyperplastic and neoplastic C-cells. MAb Hisl-19 is especially useful in cases with weak or questionable reactivity for Ct and Cg A. The switch from the granular pattern to the perinuclear distribution seems to indicate a malignant transformation of C-cells and might prove useful an an additional diagnostic clue.",

Immunohistochemical investigations included monoclonal antibodies (MABs) directed against alpha(2,3)-sialyl-Le(a), i.e. CA19-9 (MAB 19-9), native Le(a) (MAB anti Le(a)) and alpha(2,3)sialyl type 1 structure, i.e. CA 50 (MAB C50). To detect sialic acid masked Le(a) reactivity, MAB anti-Le(a) was also applied to native and enzymatically desialylated tissue sections with and without masking of sialic acid residues by sialic acid and sequence specific lectins. Only 7 MTC (15%) displayed a weak expression of CA19-9, while 16 (33%) showed moderate positive staining for native Le(a). Twenty-seven tumours exhibited a strong staining by the N'ase MAB anti Le(a) staining sequence. The latter could most effectively be inhibited by the simultaneous masking of alpha(2,3)-and alpha-(2,6)-linked sialic acid residues due to the competitive binding of sialic acid and sequence specific lectins: Maackia amurensis agglutinin (specific alpha(2,3)-linked sialic acid) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (specific alpha(2,6)-linked sialic acid). Thus, in MTC the major portion of sialic acid masked Le(a) antigen reactivity is different from that detected by the MAB 19-9. The antigen reactivity is probably due to Le(a) structures containing both alpha(2,3) and alpha(2,6)-linked sialic acid residues. A highly significant correlation between the expression of CA50 and that detected by the N'ase MAB anti-Le(a) staining sequence indicates that the alpha(2,3)-sialyl type 1 chain represents a common intermediate structure within the pathway of the biosynthesis of sialylated Le(a) antigens, excluding the formation of CA19-9 via the formation of the disialyl type 1 structure. This is subsequently fucosylated to the corresponding sialic acid masked Le(a). Preliminary clinicopathological studies indicate that the sialic acid masked Le(a) antigens detected by the N'ase MAB anti-Le(a) staining sequence are related to biologically aggressive MTC.",

Total thyroidectomy was performed in 143 patients (91.1%); central compartment (CC) node dissection (level VI) in 41 patients; central plus lateral compartment (LC) node dissection (levels II, III, and IV) in 82 patients. Subtotal thyroidectomy was initially performed in 14 cases: 10 of them were re-operated because of persistence of elevated serum calcitonin levels.;After a median post-surgical follow-up of 68 months (range 2-440 months), 42.9% of patients were living disease-free, 39.8% were living with disease, 3.1% were deceased due to causes different from MTC, and 3.2% were deceased due to MTC. The overall 10-year survival rate was 72%. At uni-variate statistical analysis (a) patient's age at initial treatment (>45 years; >/=45 years), (b) sporadic vs. hereditary MTC, (c) disease stage, and (d) the extent of surgical approach resulted as significant variables. Instead, at multivariate statistical analysis, only (a) patient's age at initial diagnosis, (b) disease stage, and (c) the extent of surgery resulted as significant and independent prognostic variables influencing survival.;The presence of lymph node and distant metastases at first diagnosis significantly worsened prognosis and survival rate in our series. Early diagnosis of MTC is very important, allowing complete surgical cure in Stages I and II patients. Due to the relatively bad prognosis of MTC, especially for disease Stages III and IV, it appears reasonable to recommend radical surgery including total thyroidectomy plus CC lymphoadenectomy as the treatment of choice, plus LC lymphoadenectomy in patients with palpable and/or ultrasound enlarged neck lymph nodes.",

Thirty-five consecutive MTC patients with detectable and progressively increasing postoperative serum concentrations of calcitonin were enrolled in the study. The detection rates of 18F-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy (MIBG) were compared in relation with calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen serum concentrations, Ki-67 score and results of conventional imaging techniques (CIT). FDG-PET positivity was significantly associated with calcitonin serum concentrations >400 pg/ml and Ki-67 score >2.0% (P<0.05), while SRS positivity was associated with calcitonin serum concentrations >800 pg/ml (P<0.05). SRS positivity significantly correlated with tumor appearance at CIT (P<0.01), while FDG-PET was positive in nine CIT-negative patients. The secretive and proliferative tumor profile may guide the choice of the imaging technique to use in the follow-up of patients with MTC. A Ki-67 score >2.0% suggests to perform a FDG-PET in addition to conventional imaging. Calcitonin secretion predicts both FDG-PET and SRS uptake but SRS positivity is generally found only in patients with well defined MTC lesions that are also detectable at the conventional imaging examination.

The most commonly studied exons in index cases are 8, 10, 11, and 13-16. To address the ATA guidelines regarding the sequencing of the entire coding region of RET, we selected 50 patients with sporadic MTC (sMTC) without mutations in the hot spot regions of RET for extended investigation of exons 1-7, 9, 12, 17, 18, and 19. Twenty-seven of 50 patients presented with one or more features suggesting familial disease. We found only a new RET variant (p.Gly550Glu) in one patient with MTC. Several polymorphisms were observed, and their frequency was histogram scaled by exons and introns. Eight patients were also included for somatic mutation search. We estimated the sequencing cost by stratifying into four investigation approaches: (1) hot spot exons in a new patient, (2) the remaining exons if the hot spots are negative in a patient with suspected familial disease, (3) a relative of a carrier for a known RET mutation, and (4) tumor sequencing. In spite of the increasing number of variants being described in MTC, it appears that there is no direct clinical benefit in extending RET germ line analysis beyond the hot spot regions in sMTC. The cost evaluation in apparent sMTC using a tiered approach may help clinicians make more suitable decisions regarding the benefits of investigating only the hot spots against the entire coding region of RET.",

She is a member of a big family with this syndrome and had undergone bilateral, subtotal adrenalectomy because of bilateral PHE six years prior to the present admission. In 1989, a small nodule was identified in her right thyroid lobe by ultrasonography and was suspected to be a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Further examinations revealed the coexistence of multiple lung and liver masses. These tumors were considered to be metastases of PHE because of the increased urinary excretion of catecholamines as well as extremely high catecholamines both in the hepatic venous blood and in the cystic fluid of the liver tumor even though there was no apparent recurrences of PHE in the adrenal region. After surgical removal of the MTC in August, 1989, she was given 3.7 GBq of 131I-metaiodobenzyl guanidine (131I-MIBG) infusions twice--in October, 1989 and in August, 1990. 131I-MIBG showed a strong accumulation in the lung and liver masses on both occasions. Periodic increases in blood pressure and tachycardia with an excessive catecholamine secretion were observed over two weeks after the first treatment. However, this treatment was not effective in reducing urinary catecholamines nor the size of the metastatic tumors. She, therefore, underwent chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and decarbazine in 1991, which slightly but significantly reduced urinary excretion of catecholamines and the size of the lung tumors. She had clinically stable period for one year after the treatment but rapid growth of these metastatic tumors occurred afterwards and she died in August, 1992.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In this paper we present the phenotype-genotype correlation of 20 unrelated Chinese families with 15 cases of MEN2A and five cases of MEN2B.;Cross-sectional study.;A total of 147 members from the 20 families were included. Among them, 119 family members were from MEN2A pedigrees (including 15 MEN2A probands) and 28 members from MEN2B pedigrees (including five MEN2B probands).;Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes and was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA analysis for RET mutations in exons 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 was performed with specific primers.;Thirty-seven MEN2A and five MEN2B patients were identified as having RET mutations. The incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma (PCC) and hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in the 37 MEN2A patients was 91.9, 56.8 and 10.8%, respectively; the onset of MTC in MEN2A patients was earlier than that of PCC and HPT. Five germline mutations, all located at codon 634 of exon11 in the RET proto-oncogene, were detected in all of the 37 MEN2A patients. The highest frequency of the five germline mutations was C634Y (46.7%), followed by C634R (26.7%), C634W (13.3%), C634F (6.7%) and C634S (6.7%). No statistical significance was found between the incidence of PCC and different genotypes of codon 634 in MEN2A patients, whereas the incidence of HPT was closely associated with C634R and C634Y. The gene mutation (M918T) at exon16 of the RET proto-oncogene was present in five MEN2B probands.;RET proto-oncogene mutations were restricted to codon 634 and 918 in Chinese families with MEN2A and MEN2B.

Sixty-four had their initial treatment at our center, and 8 came for subsequent treatment. At first treatment, 8 patients were subjected to partial thyroidectomy, 10 to total thyroidectomy, 53 to total thyroidectomy with neck dissection, and 1 to only radical neck dissection; postoperative serum calcitonin (Ct) levels returned to normal in 3, 6 and 27 patients, respectively. In the patient with only radical neck dissection, Ct levels remained elevated. No patient with Ct normalization after surgery became responsive to pentagastrin in the follow-up. Thirteen patients had a reoperation due to nodal relapse. At a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (6-252 months), the 10-year survival rate was 84.5% with a significant difference between patients under and over 40 years of age (96.4 vs 57%), between stage I-II (100%) and stage III, IV (83.8%, 0% respectively). At the last follow-up, 36 (50%) patients were alive and disease free and 26 were alive with disease (15 with distant metastases). Of the 10 deaths, 7 were due to tumor recurrence, 3 to 120 months after surgery.;Data suggest that an earlier diagnosis rather than more extensive surgery could improve survival and reduce recurrences. However, the least treatment required is total thyroidectomy plus central neck and upper mediastinum clearance and in addition, according to the extent of nodal involvement, mono- or bilateral neck dissection. To avoid ineffective reoperation due to distant (mainly liver) micrometastases, persistent residual microscopic disease requires a more aggressive restaging.",

MEN2 has been reported in approximately 500 to 1000 families worldwide and the prevalence has been estimated at approximately 1:30,000. Two different forms, sporadic and familial, have been described for MEN2. Sporadic form is represented by a case with two of the principal MEN2-related endocrine tumors. The familial form, which is more frequent and with an autosomal pattern of inheritance, consists of a MEN2 case with at least one first degree relative showing one of the characteristic endocrine tumors. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is a subtype of MEN2 in which the affected individuals develop only medullary thyroid carcinoma, without other clinical manifestations of MEN2. Predisposition to MEN2 is caused by germline activating mutations of the c-RET proto-oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. The RET gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is the receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic growth factors. The combination of clinical and genetic investigations, together with the improved understanding of the molecular and clinical genetics of the syndrome, helps the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Currently, DNA testing makes possible the early detection of asymptomatic gene carriers, allowing to identify and treat the neoplastic lesions at an earlier stage. In particular, the identification of a strong genotype-phenotype correlation in MEN2 syndrome may enable a more individualized treatment for the patients, improving their quality of life. At present, surgical treatment offers the only chance of cure and therefore, early clinical and genetic detection and prophylactic surgery in subjects at risk are the main therapeutic goal.",

Hashimoto's thyroiditis, nodular goitre and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are factors reported to influence basal serum hCT concentrations. The diagnostic role of mildly to moderately increased hCT levels is thus a matter of debate. In this study, we attempt to clarify the role of the aforementioned factors.;From 2008 to 2009, we collected data from 493 patients who were divided into five groups. We assessed whether there were significant differences in hCT levels between patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, patients with nodular goitre, patients with PPI therapy, and healthy control subjects. In addition, we investigated whether a delayed analysis of blood samples has an effect on serum hCT concentrations.;Immunoradiometric assays (Calcitonin IRMA magnum, MEDIPAN) revealed that the time of analysis did not play a role when low levels were measured. Delayed analysis, however, carried the risk of false low results when serum hCT concentrations were elevated. Men had significantly higher serum hCT levels than women. The serum hCT concentrations of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and nodular goitre were not significantly different from those of control subjects. Likewise, PPI therapy did not lead to a significant increase in serum hCT concentrations regardless of the presence or absence of nodular goitre.;Increases in serum hCT levels are not necessarily attributable to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, nodular goitre or the regular use of PPIs and always require further diagnostic attention.",

Somatostatin analogues have been used successfully in disease localization, but recently concerns have been raised that increased thoracic uptake of indium-111 pentetreotide in patients with previous external beam irradiation may represent a false-positive finding, caused by post-irradiation pulmonary fibrosis. We recently examined seven patients with metastatic MTC by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (six with occult and one with established disease). In four patients, all of whom had stable or slowly rising tumour marker levels over several years, a chimney-like bilateral mediastinal uptake of indium-111 pentetreotide was found. In two patients with persisting hypercalcitonaemia immediately after primary surgery, supraclavicular lymph node metastases were identified as the responsible lesions. None of these seven patients had prior external beam radiation therapy. In two cases, histological confirmation was obtained. In one patient, disease progression could be shown during follow-up. These data suggest that bilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement is a typical site of disease in slowly progressing occult metastatic MTC; the \"chimney sign\" may represent a typical finding with somatostatin analogues in such cases. Therefore, we believe that even in the case of prior external beam irradiation, mediastinal uptake of octreotide might represent metastatic MTC rather than radiation fibrosis.",

Elevations in serum calcium trigger release of calcitonin from the C-cell, which in turn functions to inhibit absorption of calcium by the intestine, resorption of bone by the osteoclast, and reabsorption of calcium by renal tubular cells. Oncogenic transformation of the thyroid C-cell is thought to progress through a hyperplastic process prior to malignancy with increasing levels of serum calcitonin serving as a biomarker for tumor burden. The discovery that multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused by activating mutations of the RET gene serves to highlight the RET-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in both initiation and progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thyroid C-cells are known to express RET at high levels relative to most cell types; therefore, aberrant activation of this receptor is targeted primarily to the C-cell, providing one possible cause of tissue-specific oncogenesis. The role of RET signaling in normal C-cell function is unknown though calcitonin gene transcription appears to be sensitive to RET activation. Beyond RET, the modeling of oncogenesis in animals and screening of human tumors for candidate gene mutations have uncovered mutation of RAS family members and inactivation of Rb1 regulatory pathway as potential mediators of C-cell transformation. A growing understanding of how RET interacts with these pathways, both in normal C-cell function and during oncogenic transformation, will help in the development of novel molecular-targeted therapies.

They were positive for direct RET mutation analysis. CT was assayed by immunoradiometric method before and after Pg. Pg test results before and after thyroidectomy, age at operation and histologic results were analysed.;Mean preoperative peak CT was 82.5 +/- 34.0 pg/ml (22-133): among these 36 patients preoperative basal and peak CT were normal in 16 and 2 patients respectively. F-MTC and MEN 2A patients were different according to their preoperative peak CT levels (58.1 +/- 24.0 vs 97.6 +/- 31.3) pg/ml, p < 0.01) and age at thyroidectomy (20.4 +/- 10.5 vs 11.6 +/- 7.6 years, p < 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test). Total thyroidectomy was performed in all patients at a mean age of 14.8 +/- 9.8 years (2.5-41.7) and was associated with lymph node dissection in 30 cases. The 2 F-MTC patients with normal preoperative peak CT levels had bilateral C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) associated with uni or bilateral micro-MTC. Other patients had uni or bilateral micro MTC except 4 who had isolated CCH without carcinoma. The age of two MEN-2A and 1 MEN 2B patients with micro-MTC ranged from 2.5 to 4.7 yr. Micro MTC was present in 100% of MEN-2A cases after the age of 10 yr. There were no lymph nodes metastases. During postoperative survey, the last PG tests (n = 33) were performed 27.5 months (1-92) after thyroidectomy: peak CT values were always < 10 pg/ml.;Thyroidectomy should be performed at a very young age in RET mutation carriers, regardless of the plasma CT values. This choice is justified in NEM-2A and NEM-2B patients but must be discussed in F-MTC families with less aggressive forms of the disease.",

This disorder is usually caused by the mutations of the rearranged during transfection protooncogene gene (RET) or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1). To investigate the genetic cause in a Chinese Han family with MEN2A and the genotype-phenotype correlations, nine members belonging to 3 generations of MEN2A family with 5 affected subjects underwent genetic analysis. Standard GTG-banded karyotype analysis and sequencing of the RET and NTRK1 genes were performed to identify the genetic cause of this family. A heterozygous mutation p.Cys634Arg in the RET gene was identified in 5 patients with MEN2A and one asymptomatic family member. The phenotype of patients was that of classic MEN2A, characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. The clinical features of all cases with RET mutations varied greatly, including onset age of clinical manifestations, severity and comorbidities. Thus, this study not only identified the hereditary nature of the MEN2A in the cases, but also discovered a family member harboring the same p.Cys634Arg mutation, who was unaware of his condition. These finding may provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of MEN2A and have implications for genetic counseling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We report here an efficient and rapid method for the specific detection of calcitonin in tumor C-cells of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). This occasionally aggressive tumor arises from the endocrine thyroid C-cells. Its principal marker is calcitonin, the predominant C-cell secretion, which is detected in patients and in our animal model by radioimmunoassay of the plasma, as well as by immunohistochemistry of thyroid tissues. Although calcitonin is easily detectable in normal C-cells, its content is greatly reduced in tumor cells owing to the disappearance of the secretory granules that store the mature peptide. This finding suggests cell dedifferentiation correlated with an increasing aggressivity of the tumor. We therefore developed a rapid detection of calcitonin mRNA by in situ hybridization on routine paraffin sections, using a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP. The reaction was detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, and the enzyme catalyzed the appearance of a dark blue color. The signal was exclusively restricted to the normal, hyperplastic, and tumor C-cells. It was specific, as increasing concentrations of the unlabeled oligonucleotide led to progressive disappearance of the reaction. Its sensitivity was slightly diminished as compared with corresponding frozen sections, but the intensity of the signal was quite acceptable. High levels of calcitonin mRNA were found in all normal and hyperplastic C-cells. They were increased in most of the tumor MTC cells, which did not correlate with the amount of intracellular peptide stores but explained the abnormally high basal levels of circulating calcitonin of the tumor-bearing rats. ISH is therefore of greater value than ICC for an early anatomopathological detection of this tumor. Our data show that the tumor cells are not \"dedifferentiated.\" They only lack the granular compartment storing the mature peptide before exocytosis, but CT biosynthesis and the rest of the secretory process seem to be complete. Our results suggest that factors expressed in malignant C-cells affect basic cell mechanisms involved in the storage of the mature calcitonin, rather than the expression of the CALC gene.",

Individuals with MEN 2B may develop megacolon and pseudo-obstruction due to intestinal ganglioneuromatosis simulating Hirschsprung's (HSCR) disease. We hereby describe the clinical and genetic features of a 21-year-old male patient with MEN 2B associated with pseudo-HSCR disease. The patient had MTC, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus, multiple mucosal ganglioneuromas, thickened corneal nerves and severe gastrointestinal involvement. Emergent laparotomy was performed when he was presented with acute bowel obstruction. The myenteric and submucosal nerve plexuses in the small and large intestines were composed of diffusely hyperplasic, disorganized, mature ganglion cells. Genetic testing revealed a de novo ret proto-oncogene germline mutation in codon 918 in exon 16. Megacolon and pseudo-obstruction similar to the HSCR disease may develop in patients with MEN 2B. However, the observed dysmotility is the result of an abnormal proliferation of intramural ganglion cells in contrast to the absence of enteric ganglia which were present in the HSCR disease. Attentiveness about the phenotypic characteristics and unusual findings might lead to early and correct diagnosis of the MEN 2B syndrome.

DNA extracted from the blood and tumour tissues was analysed for mutations in RET. The transforming potential and mitogenic properties of the identified RET mutation were investigated.;The patient carried a novel heterozygous germ-line RET mutation in exon 5 (Val292Met, GTG>ATG) (V292M/RET) with no evidence of additional somatic alterations. The mutation maps to the third cadherin-like domain of RET, which is usually not included in RET screening. Interestingly, MTC with concomitant phaeochromcytoma has never been associated with a RET mutation involving the extracellular cadherin-like domain. V292M/RET was absent in the only two relatives examined. In vitro assays indicate that the mutant has low-grade transforming potential.;Complete characterization and classification of all novel RET mutations are essential for extending genetic analysis in clinical practice.

However, ectopic production of PTH is rare and its molecular etiology remains largely uninvestigated. We report a case of ectopic production of PTH by a sporadic MTC. The etiology of ectopic PTH gene expression was examined, focusing on GCM2 which has a crucial role in developing parathyroid glands. We observed ectopic expression of the PTH and GCM2 genes in tissues from the tumor and metastatic lymph nodes. However, GCM2 gene expression was also detected in adjacent thyroid tissue and lymphoblasts, in which PTH gene expression was absent. Hypomethylation of the PTH promoter, which is reportedly associated with ectopic production of PTH, was not seen in either the tumor tissue or metastatic lymph nodes. Meanwhile, DNA hypomethylation was seen in a CpG island identified in the GCM2 promoter region, regardless of whether or not the GCM2 gene was expressed. We showed that transcriptional activity of the CpG island sequences cloned into a reporter plasmid was dependent upon DNA methylation. Finally, we present the first report of a PTH-producing MTC. There was no apparent association between ectopic PTH and GCM2 gene expression, despite co-expression of the two genes. Neither genomic rearrangement nor DNA hypomethylation in the PTH gene appeared responsible for ectopic production of PTH. Although DNA hypomethylation may be necessary for the GCM2 gene expression, ectopic expression of GCM2 won't be possible by DNA hypomethylation alone.",

Tumor targeting was possible in all 19 patients, with an overall lesion sensitivity of 91%.

Several CCK-2 receptor-binding radiopeptides have been developed, and some have been carried through into clinical studies. However, these studies are mostly limited and difficult to compare. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of three promising CCK-2 receptor-binding radiopeptides in patients with MTC.;(111)In-DOTA-(D: )Asp-Tyr-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH(2) ((111)In-DOTA-CCK), a CCK analogue, and the gastrin-based ligands (99m)Tc-N(4)-Gly-(D: )Glu-(Glu)(5)-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH(2) ((99m)Tc-demogastrin 2) and (111)In-DOTA-(D: )Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH(2) ((111)In-DOTA-MG11) were each administered to the same group of six patients. Planar images made at 3-5, 7 and 24 h p.i. were used for comparison of tumour visualisation and renal uptake.;(99m)Tc-demogastrin 2 scintigraphy visualised all known lesions and new lesions in four of six patients. (111)In-DOTA-CCK and (111)In-DOTA-MG11 on the other hand missed several lesions; tumour uptake of these two radiopharmaceuticals was quite low. Comparison of retention of renal activity showed no major differences between the three radiopeptides.;(99m)Tc-demogastrin 2 scintigraphy appeared most promising as a diagnostic tool in patients with MTC. Further studies are required to evaluate its value in patient management. Direct comparisons of the compounds studied strongly suggests that (111)In-DOTA-CCK and (111)In-DOTA-MG11 have less potential as imaging agents than (99m)Tc-demogastrin 2. These DOTA-linked compounds are considered unlikely to be useful for radionuclide therapy because of low tumour uptake.",

The present study uses the cultured frog tadpole tail fin biopsy (C-fin) assay and the TH-responsive rat pituitary GH3 cell line to assess the effects of these three chemicals (1-1000 nM) on TH signaling and cellular stress within 48 h. mRNA abundance of TH receptor β, Rana larval keratin type I (TH-response), heat shock protein 30, and catalase (stress-response) was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the C-fin assay. The TH-responsive gene transcripts encoding growth hormone, deiodinase I, and prolactin were measured in GH3 cells with the heat shock protein 70 transcript acting as a cellular stress indicator. We found alteration of stress indicators at a wide range of concentrations of TCS, mTCS, and TCC in both test systems. mTCS and TCC affected TH-responsive gene transcripts at the highest concentration in mammalian cells, whereas a modest effect included lower concentrations in the C-fin assay. In contrast, TCS did not affect TH-responsive transcripts.

RET germline mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome (MEN 2A) characterized by complete penetrance of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and lower prevalence of Pheo and hyperparathyroidism. We describe the genetic etiology of an apparently sporadic case of monolateral Pheo in a 42-year-old male patient. A new (not previously reported) MEN 2A-associated germline RET mutation located in exon 11 (Glu632Gly, caused by an A>G point mutation at position 1895 of the RET cDNA) was found in the patient but not in his living first-degree relatives. This observation increases the number of possible germline RET mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation of this new genetic alteration is unknown, but this rare mutation is probably associated with a low risk for MTC (usually the first tumor diagnosed in MEN 2A syndrome) and with the development of Pheo before the onset of MTC. Since we expect MTC to occur in our patient, strict follow-up is mandatory. Our findings emphasize the relevance of genetic testing in patients with Pheo, especially when the clinical presentation (family history, young age at diagnosis, multiple locations, malignant lesions, and bilateralism) is suggestive.

We also studied DNA from 24 primary neuroblastomas and 10 MTCs for N-ras mutations. ras genes were analyzed by direct sequencing of specific DNA fragments amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. With the exception of the SK-N-SH cell line, the examined ras gene sequences were normal in all the neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and MTCs tested.

Interestingly, this mutation is different from the activating codon 61 mutation which resulted in the initial identification of N-ras from SK-N-SH DNA. Therefore, we analyzed the sequences of earlier passages and sublines of the SK-N-SH cell line, but mutations at codon 59 or 61 were not detected, suggesting that neither mutation was present in the primary tumor. Our results indicate that N-ras mutations may occur spontaneously during in vitro passage of cell lines but rarely, if ever, occur in primary neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and MTCs.

In contrast, no differences in trkB or trkC mRNAs levels were observed in any brain region at studied ages. According to previous reports, p75LNGFR mRNA was elevated in hypothyroid cerebellum as compared to age-matched controls on P5 and P15. We have also observed a distinct pattern for neurotrophin genes. The level of NGF mRNA was 20-50% lower in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of hypothyroid rats on neonatal hypothyroid rats on P15 and also after adult-onset hypothyroidism. Treatment of neonatally-induced hypothyroid rats with a single injection of triiodothyronine led to the recovery of hippocampal but not cortex NGF mRNA levels to that of control animals. On the contrary, no differences in the relatively high expression of the two mRNAs encoding BDNF were observed in any brain area.

        "Doc_abstract":"In the latest years, high levels of circulating cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) have been found to be associated with cancer diagnosis and progression, and cf-DNA has become a potential candidate as biomarker for tumor detection. cf-DNA has been investigated in plasma or serum of many tumor patients affected by different malignancies, but not yet in thyroid cancer (TC). Furthermore, in TC cells the capability to metabolize iodine is frequently lost. SLC5A8 and SLC26A4 genes are both involved in the iodine metabolism, and SLC5A8 hypermethylation status is associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, which is the most frequent genetic event underlying the development of papillary TC. The aim of our study is the development of a new non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of TC based on cf-DNA, SLC5A8 and SLC26A4 hypermethylation, and BRAF(V600E) analysis.;cf-DNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in nine cases of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), 58 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC), five of synchronous medullary and follicular thyroid cancers (SMFC), 23 follicular adenomas (FA), 86 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). A control group of 19 healthy subjects was taken. Moreover, in the PTC group we analyze the state of hypermethylation of SLC5A8 and SLC26A4, BRAF(V600E) mutation, and their involvement in the loss of function of the thyroid.;cf-DNA showed a high ability to discriminate healthy individuals from cancer patients. cf-DNAALU83 and cf-DNAALU244 values were significantly correlated with the histological type of TC (P-value < 0.0001). A significant increase in the amount of cf-DNAALU83 and cf-DNAALU244 when methylation occurs was observed (P-value = 0.02). A correlation between BRAF(V600E) and cf-DNAALU244/ALU83 was also found (P-value = 0.02).;According to our experimental results, the panel including cf-DNA, SLC5A8 and SLC26A4 hypermethylation, and BRAF(V600E) analysis appears easy, reproducible, and non-invasive for the diagnosis on TC. Its possible implication in clinical setting remains to be elucidated.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To report the results of a retrospective study on the use of the different imaging methods in the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasias, and to provide an overall evaluation of the diagnostic yield of the various examinations performed correlating the results with the surgical findings.;The study was conducted by reviewing the data of 12 patients, of whom four with MEN1 and eight with MEN2, assessed with different imaging modalities. In the patients with MEN1 the examinations revealed 4 parathyroid hyperplasias, 4 gastro-pancreatic endocrine-secreting lesions, one hypophyseal adenoma, one bronchial carcinoid and two bilateral adrenal hyperplasias. In the patients with MEN2 the examinations revealed 6 medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC), 4 pheochromocytomas and 3 parathyroid hyperplasias.;In MEN1 the parathyroid hyperplasias were diagnosed by scintigraphy in all four cases, whereas neck ultrasound was positive in only two cases. The gastro-pancreatic endocrine-secreting lesions were demonstrated in all four patients with CT and endoscopic ultrasound (two patients also underwent scintigraphy with octreotide, which was positive). In only one patient with MEN1 did the chest X-ray detect a bronchial carcinoma, confirmed by CT. CT also enabled identification of a single hypophyseal adenoma. The patients with MEN2 were divided into two groups: one consisting of asymptomatic patients undergoing screening following positive genetic testing and one of symptomatic patients. In the first group the imaging examinations diagnosed one MTC and three pheochromocytomas; all patients in the second group had MTC (detected by positive ultrasound and scintigraphy examinations).;Given the rarity of this condition we believe that the only statistically important finding in our series concerns the sensitivity of the imaging examinations performed in that, with adequate clinical and laboratory data, the possible problem of false positive results is exceptional. The role of diagnostic imaging in the management of patients with MEN1 and 2 is twofold: identification of the target organs of lesions suspected on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings to enable adequate medical and/or surgical treatment; staging of malignant lesions to enable correct surgical planning. In particular, our study once again highlights the diagnostic efficacy of CT for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas and of the combination of biopsy plus ultrasound and ultrasound plus scintigraphy for the diagnosis of MTC in MEN 2. As for MEN1 spiral CT was found to have good sensitivity (66%) in localising endocrine neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract; endoscopic ultrasound on the other hand revealed good diagnostic efficacy, showing constantly positive findings. Finally, in both pathologies we believe that the assessment of parathyroid conditions to be mainly a matter for nuclear medicine.",

A network of coordinators utilizing a common questionnaire provides for an effective national screening program. Calcitonin stimulation procedures are systematically used for all first-degree relatives of MTC patients. Pathological studies utilize special immunopathologic techniques. Genealogic information is obtained on all index cases, and blood specimens are collected for establishing permanent cell lines. The data collected are used not only to establish the diagnosis of the hereditary or sporadic form of the disease but also to expand the screening as appropriate. This common protocol has benefited patients and their families by improving early detection of cases, increasing the number of families available for follow-up, and improving the prognosis of this cancer. Studies on these families have contributed significantly to the localization of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 gene.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is genetically determined in 30% to 35% of cases, notably through multiple mutations in the RET protooncogene located on chromosome 10, for which a genotype-phenotype relationship determines age of onset. There are three phenotypes: MEN 2 A and B, and isolated familial MTC. The type of mutation determines 3 levels of aggressiveness. Current guidelines recommend thyroidectomy during the first months of life for patients with very-high-risk (level 3) mutations and before 5 years of age for high-risk (level 2) mutations. There are no precise recommendations for lower-risk mutations, for which the surgical decision also depends on the calcitonin level and family history. We describe 18 patients who underwent prophylactic surgery. Regardless of the mutation, all patients with a normal preoperative calcitonin level were cured. However, surgery was performed later than recommended, for various reasons, including late genetic diagnosis and parents' opposition.",

Most are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. In HCS, a single copy of the mutated tumor suppressor gene is inherited, and mutation of the second wild type allele of the gene is required for tumorigenesis. Patients with HCS have a higher than normal risk of a second malignancy. Management strategies to address increased cancer risk in HCS include genetic counseling and testing, targeted surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. Genetic testing for high-risk family members is strongly recommended. Available data indicate surgical prophylaxis is more successful than surveillance in reducing cancer risk in carriers of BRCA, CDH1, APC, and RET mutation.",
