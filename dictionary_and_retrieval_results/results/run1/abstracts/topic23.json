        "Doc_abstract":"To evaluate the mutational profiles associated with BRAF mutations in human melanoma, we have studied BRAF, RAS, PTEN, TP53, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes and their expression in melanoma lesions. Owing to the lack of sufficient material from fresh specimens, we employed short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies. In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival. These data support the existence of several molecularly defined melanoma groups which likely reflect different clinical/biological behaviour, thus suggesting that a more extensive molecular classification of melanoma would significantly impact its clinical management.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway is involved in various cellular activities, including proliferation, migration, cell growth, cell survival and differentiation during adult homeostasis as well as in tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling with concurrent loss of function of the tumor suppressor molecule PTEN contributes to cancer formation. Members of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway, including these proteins and mTOR, are altered in melanoma tumors and cell lines. A hallmark of activation of the pathway is the loss of function of PTEN. Indeed, loss of heterozygosity of PTEN has been observed in approximately 30% of human melanomas, implicating this signaling pathway in this cancer. PI3K signaling activation, via loss of PTEN function, can inhibit proapoptotic genes such as the FoxO family of transcription factors, while inducing cell growth- and cell survival-related elements such as p70S6K and AKT. Determining how the PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, alone or in cooperation with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities is a major challenge in research into melanoma initiation and progression. Moreover, the acquisition of basic knowledge will help patient management with appropriate therapies that are already, or will shortly be, on the market.",

We have used a variety of assays to examine the functional properties of tumor-associated alleles, including eight premature termination mutants, eight missense mutants, and three isoforms of p16 initiated at different amino-terminal methionine codons. The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein, outside the ankyrin-like repeats, appeared to be dispensable, but the majority of the premature termination mutations led to loss of function. Of the missense mutations tested, four displayed clear loss of function whereas two behaved like the wild type under all conditions tested. The remaining two mutations, a G-to-W mutation at position 101 (Gl01W) and V126D, both of which are associated with familial melanoma, were found to be temperature sensitive for binding to Cdk4 and Cdk6 in vitro, for inhibiting cyclin D1-Cdk4 in a reconstituted pRb-kinase assay, and for increasing the proportion of G1-phase cells following transfection.

Tumor angiogenesis represents an integral component of cancer metastasis prompting us to investigate a possible role of mda-9/syntenin in inducing angiogenesis. Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacologic approaches were used to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma, and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays and xenograft tumor animal models. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments confirm that MDA-9/syntenin induces angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several proangiogenic factors/genes. Experimental evidence is provided for a model of angiogenesis induction by MDA-9/syntenin in which MDA-9/syntenin interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating Src and FAK resulting in activation by phosphorylation of Akt, which induces hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α). The HIF-1α activates transcription of insulin growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is secreted thereby promoting angiogenesis and further induces endothelial cells to produce and secrete VEGF-A augmenting tumor angiogenesis. Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell nonautonomous function of MDA-9/syntenin in the context of angiogenesis, which may directly contribute to its metastasis-promoting properties. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (nonautonomous).",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cellular adhesion molecules of the cadherin, integrin, and immunoglobulin superfamilies are important to both growth and metastasis of many cancers, including malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma is an excellent model for studying these molecules, due in part to a sequential series of five defineable stages. As the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells changes from the noninvasive radial growth phase to the vertical growth phase, which has high metastatic potential, so does the repertoire of the cellular adhesion molecules expressed on the cells surface. The cellular adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 confers metastatic potential and increased tumorigenicity to melanoma cells. MCAM/MUC18 mediates homotypic and heterotypic adhesion between melanoma cells and endothelial cells, respectively. Both types of interaction may promote metastasis at different stages in the metastasis cascade. We developed a fully humanized antibody to MCAM/MUC18 (ABX-MA1) that blocked melanoma metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, ABX-MA1 blocked the homotypic interaction between melanoma cells and endothelial cells as well as the promoter and collagenase activity of MMP-2. During melanoma progression the loss of E-cadherin expression disrupts normal homeostasis in the skin by freeing melanoma cells from structural and functional regulation by keratinocytes. The loss of functional E-cadherin is parallelled by a gain in N-cadherin function that mediates homotypic interaction between melanoma cells, facilitates gap-junctional formation with fibroblasts and endothelial cells and promotes melanoma cell migration and survival. In addition, loss of E-cadherin may affect the beta-catenin/wnt signaling pathways, resulting in deregulation of genes involved in growth and metastasis. The integrin family member alpha(v)beta(3) is widely expressed on melanoma cells in the vertical growth phase. When alpha(v)beta(3) is expressed in melanoma cells in the radial growth phase, this integrin is associated with increased tumor growth in vivo. alpha(v)beta(3) may also promote melanoma invasion, through an interaction with MMP-2, and transendothelial migration, via a heterotypic melanomaendothelial cell interaction. This review summarizes recent knowledge on how changes in these adhesion molecules contribute to the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in human melanoma.",

Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK).

We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2. Although MDS targets several common genes in tumors, mutational variability among melanomas may decide which metabolic and signal transduction pathways will be activated or shutdown.",

The direct correlation between serum MIA levels of patients with progressing melanomas and tumor load supports a role for MIA as a melanoma progression factor. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), activating ras mutation, or loss of p53 function on MIA expression and release from melanoma cells. We previously showed that transfection of a mutant constitutively active ras into the melanoma cell line, WM35, induces a phenotypic change from radial to vertical growth, exhibiting increased proliferation and migration. Here, we report that MIA release was elevated in a ras-transfected cell line. In addition, loss of functional p53, using a dominant negative construct, substantially lowered the level of MIA release compared to control. UVR stimulated release of MIA into the extracellular compartment in both the control and ras-transfected cell lines. In addition, MIA mRNA was increased following UVR in all cell lines tested. By inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, we were able to confirm that MIA protein is not released from cells due to cell death alone. We have identified a transcriptional effect of UVR on MIA expression and have shown that release of MIA protein is dependent upon functional p53. We propose that UVR-induced production and release of MIA may promote the detachment of radial and vertical growth phase melanomas from basement membrane or matrix proteins, serving as a unique progression mechanism for melanoma.",

Canine malignant melanoma is a rapidly metastatic disease that generally is incurable. The loss of function of cellular safeguards built into the genetic program and of immune surveillance systems that cooperate to prevent tumor formation and progression appear to be important underlying causes of canine malignant melanoma. In effect, many existing cancer treatments restore the function of 1 or the other of these mechanisms. For example, chemotherapy and radiotherapy often kill tumor cells by initiating a genetic suicide mechanism (apoptosis), and immunotherapy initiates or enhances a response by the body's immune cells to identify and destroy cancer cells by mechanisms that rely on direct cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Nevertheless, standard therapeutic approaches have not proved effective in treatment of canine malignant melanoma, with only marginal improvement in the outcome of dogs with this disease. The advantages of an improved understanding of the molecular basis of canine cancer are underscored by recent promising advances in diagnosis and in immunologic and genetic therapies that may help reduce the mortality of dogs affected with malignant melanoma.",

Here, in the context of melanoma, we show that RNF2 is prognostic, exhibiting progression-correlated expression in human melanocytic neoplasms. Through a series of complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in mouse and human systems, we establish that RNF2 is oncogenic and prometastatic. Mechanistically, RNF2-mediated invasive behavior is dependent on its ability to monoubiquitinate H2AK119 at the promoter of LTBP2, resulting in silencing of this negative regulator of TGFβ signaling. In contrast, RNF2's oncogenic activity does not require its catalytic activity nor does it derive from its canonical gene repression function. Instead, RNF2 drives proliferation through direct transcriptional upregulation of the cell-cycle regulator CCND2. We further show that MEK1-mediated phosphorylation of RNF2 promotes recruitment of activating histone modifiers UTX and p300 to a subset of poised promoters, which activates gene expression. In summary, RNF2 regulates distinct biologic processes in the genesis and progression of melanoma via different molecular mechanisms.;The role of epigenetic regulators in cancer progression is being increasingly appreciated. We show novel roles for RNF2 in melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis, albeit via different mechanisms.

Multiple sera of a subcohort of 33 patients were tested during progression from stage III to IV. Small interfering RNA-based loss-of-function experiments were done to assess effects of Ang-2 on melanoma cells.;Circulating levels of sAng-2 correlate with tumor progression in melanoma patients (P<0.0001) and patient survival (P=0.007). Analysis of serum samples during the transition from stage III to IV identified an increase of sAng-2 up to 400%. Comparative analyses revealed a 56% superiority of sAng-2 as predictive marker over the established marker S100beta. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the prominent expression of Ang-2 by tumor-associated endothelial cells but identified Ang-2 also as a secreted product of melanoma cells themselves. Corresponding cellular experiments revealed that human melanoma-isolated tumor cells were Tie2 positive and that Ang-2 acted as an autocrine regulator of melanoma cell migration and invasion.;The experiments establish sAng-2 as a biomarker of melanoma progression and metastasis correlating with tumor load and overall survival.

To study the role of NRAS in zebrafish, a transgenic approach was applied to generate fish that express human oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) under the control of the melanocyte-restricted mitfa promoter. By screening the progeny of the injected animals, two strains stably expressing the NRAS transgene were identified: Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(1) and Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(2). Stable expression of this transgene results in hyperpigmented fish displaying a complete ablation of the normal pigment pattern. Although oncogenic NRAS expression alone was found to be insufficient to promote tumor formation, loss of functional p53 was found to collaborate with NRAS expression in the genesis of melanoma. The tumors derived from these animals are variably pigmented and closely resemble human melanoma. Underscoring the pathological similarities between these tumors and human disease and suggesting that common pathways are similar in these models and human disease, gene set enrichment analysis performed on microarray data found that the upregulated genes from zebrafish melanomas are highly enriched in human tumor samples.

Following a complete downregulation after birth, ROR1 was shown to re-express in various types of cancers. Little is known about ROR1 expression and function in melanoma. Here we show that ROR1 is aberrantly expressed in both melanoma cell lines and tumors and that its expression associates with poor Post-Recurrence Survival of melanoma. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches we found that ROR1 enhances both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of melanoma cells. In addition, ROR1 decreases cell adhesion and increases cell motility and migration. Mechanistically, ROR1 was found to induce upregulation of Akt and the mesenquimal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. The regulation of N-cadherin by ROR1 relies on both Akt dependent and independent mechanisms. ROR1 does not affect Wnt canonical pathway but was found to be engaged in a positive feedback loop with Wnt5a. In summary, we show that ROR1 contributes to melanoma progression and is a candidate biomarker of poor prognosis.

SKI is upregulated in human malignant melanoma tumors in a disease-progression manner and its overexpression promotes proliferation and migration of melanoma cells in vitro. The mechanisms by which SKI antagonizes TGF-beta signaling in vivo have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that human melanoma cells in which endogenous SKI expression was knocked down by RNAi produced minimal orthotopic tumor xenograft nodules that displayed low mitotic rate and prominent apoptosis. These minute tumors exhibited critical signatures of active TGF-beta signaling including high levels of nuclear Smad3 and p21(Waf-1), which are not found in the parental melanomas. To understand how SKI promotes tumor growth we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches and found that simultaneously to blocking the TGF-beta-growth inhibitory pathway, SKI promotes the switch of Smad3 from tumor suppression to oncogenesis by favoring phosphorylations of the Smad3 linker region in melanoma cells but not in normal human melanocytes. In this context, SKI is required for preventing TGF-beta-mediated downregulation of the oncogenic protein c-MYC, and for inducing the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a mediator of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Together, the results indicate that SKI exploits multiple regulatory levels of the TGF-beta pathway and its deficiency restores TGF-beta tumor suppressor and apoptotic activities in spite of the likely presence of oncogenic mutations in melanoma tumors.",

In the case of cutaneous melanoma, the existence of genetic susceptibility has long been evident from its tendency to cluster in families, but it has been unclear until recently whether the genetic basis of familial melanoma derives from the concerted interaction of multiple genes or from a major locus with properties of a tumor suppressor gene. The original strategy used to circumvent difficulties in identifying those who harbor the genetic defect exploited a proposed melanoma precursor lesion, the dysplastic nevus, as the phenotypic marker from which the presence of the melanoma-associated genotype was inferred. That strategy in genetic linkage studies provided the first indication of a major gene for melanoma and assigned the locus to the short arm of chromosome 1. In part because the criteria for the dysplastic nevus have been neither well-defined nor generally agreed upon, multiple independent attempts to confirm the assignment of a gene to that location have failed. The probable map position of a major gene became clear when the most frequently deleted region of the human genome in melanoma tumors was localized to chromosome 9p. The significance of this assignment was established when genetic linkage studies of multiple melanoma kindreds subsequently evaluated the correlated inheritance between melanoma gene carriers, as assigned by a history of melanoma, and molecular markers for DNA polymorphisms near the 9p candidate region; this analysis provided strong statistical evidence of linkage to a melanoma susceptibility locus. Once this candidate tumor suppressor gene) as well as other relevant suppressor loci that may exist is actually cloned and characterized, rapid advances can be expected in our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis for development of melanoma. This will provide opportunities for exploring the mechanisms underlying defects in the gene and the molecular consequences of its loss of function. It will then be possible to identify precisely those persons with a genetic risk for melanoma; as a result, surveillance efforts can be more appropriately focused than has heretofore been possible.",

We find that melanocytes depleted of MEN1 are deficient in homologous recombination (HR)-directed DNA repair, which is accompanied by increased nonhomologous end-joining activity. Following DNA damage, MEN1 levels increase as a result of phosphorylation by the DNA damage kinase ATM/ATR. Most importantly, we show that MEN1 functions by directly stimulating the transcription of several genes, including BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1, that encode proteins involved in HR. MEN1 and its coactivator, the mixed-lineage leukemia histone methyltransferase, are recruited to the BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 promoters by estrogen receptor 1, resulting in increased histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation and transcription.

Assessing pathogenicity of nonsynonymous mutations is critical to evaluate melanoma risk in carriers. In the current study, we investigate 20 CDKN2A germline mutations whose effects on p16(INK4A) structure and function have not been previously documented (Thr18_Ala19dup, Gly23Asp, Arg24Gln, Gly35Ala, Gly35Val, Ala57Val, Ala60Val, Ala60Arg, Leu65dup, Gly67Arg, Gly67_Asn71del, Glu69Gly, Asp74Tyr, Thr77Pro, Arg80Pro, Pro81Thr, Arg87Trp, Leu97Arg, Arg99Pro, and [Leu113Leu;Pro114Ser]).

        "Doc_abstract":"Derailed endolysosomal trafficking is emerging as a widespread feature of aggressive neoplasms. However, the oncogenic signals that alter membrane homeostasis and their specific contribution to cancer progression remain unclear. Understanding the upstream drivers and downstream regulators of aberrant vesicular trafficking is distinctly important in melanoma. This disease is notorious for its inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Nevertheless, melanomas uniformly overexpress a cluster of endolysosomal genes, being particularly addicted to the membrane traffic regulator RAB7. Still, the underlying mechanisms and temporal determinants of this dependency have yet to be defined. Here we addressed these questions by combining electron microscopy, real time imaging and mechanistic analyses of vesicular trafficking in normal and malignant human melanocytic cells. This strategy revealed Class I PI3K as the key trigger of a hyperactive influx of macropinosomes that melanoma cells counteract via RAB7-mediated lysosomal degradation. In addition, gain- and loss-of-function in vitro studies followed by histopathological validation in clinical biopsies and genetically-engineered mouse models, traced back the requirement of RAB7 to the suppression of premature cellular senescence traits elicited in melanocytes by PI3K-inducing oncogenes. Together, these results provide new insight into the regulators and modes of action of RAB7, broadening the impact of endosomal fitness on melanoma development. ",

In a quest for alternative therapy targets, we had previously identified Signal Sequence Receptor 2 (SSR2) as a gene with high expression in a subgroup of human primary melanomas. Now we show that SSR2 exerts a prosurvival functionality in human melanoma cells and that high expression levels of SSR2 are associated with an unfavourable disease outcome in primary melanoma patients. Consistent with SSR's role in translocation of proteins from the ribosome across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, our data supports induction of SSR2 as a part of the ER stress response. This response included SSR2 upregulation upon development of therapy resistance to BRAF inhibitors, as well as the dependency of cell survival of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells on SSR2. Complementary gain and loss of function data showed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to ER stress as an inducer of SSR2 via transcriptional regulation through X-Box Binding Protein 1s (XBP1s) and support an ER stress-UPR-Transcription Factor XBP1s-SSR2 response axis in human melanocytic cells. Together with its dispensability for survival in normal human cells, these data propose SSR2 as a potential therapeutic target in (therapy-resistant) human melanoma. ",

Overall growth of the Jag2-expressing cultures increased somewhat, and a significant 3-fold increase in clonogenic growth in soft agar was also noted. Introduction of Jag2 increased motility in both wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. We also observed a significant increase in Jag2 and Hes1 mRNA in invasive OMM1 cells that had passed through a Matrigel-coated filter in the transwell assay when compared with noninvading cells. Loss-of-function studies performed in 92.1 and OMM1 lines using Jag2 shRNAs showed that downregulation of the ligand significantly suppressed cellular growth, invasion, and migration.;Our data suggest that Jag2 may play an important role in promoting Notch activity, growth, and metastasis in uveal melanoma.",

The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

Loss-of-function mutations at the MC1R are associated with a switch from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production, resulting in a red or yellow coat colour. Activating mutations, in animals at least, lead to enhanced eumelanin synthesis. In man, a number of loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R have been described. The majority of red-heads (red-haired persons) are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for up to five frequent loss-of-function mutations. A minority of redheads are, however, only heterozygote. The MC1R is, therefore, a major determinant of sun sensitivity and a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Recent work suggests that the MC1R also shows a clear heterozygote effect on skin type, with up to 30% of the population harbouring loss-of-function mutations. Activating mutations of the MC1R in man have not been described. The MC1R is particularly informative and a tractable gene for studies of human evolution and migration. In particular, study of the MC1R may provide insights into the lightening of skin colour observed in most European populations. The world wide pattern of MC1R diversity is compatible with functional constraint operating in Africa, whereas the greater allelic diversity seen in non-African populations is consistent with neutral predictions rather than selection. Whether this conclusion is as a result of weakness in the statistical testing procedures applied, or whether it will be seen in other pigment genes will be of great interest for studies of human skin colour evolution.",

We propose a strategy for melanoma prevention based on using analogs of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) that function as melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) agonists. Treatment of human melanocytes with alpha-MSH results in stimulation of eumelanin synthesis, reduction of apoptosis that is attributable to reduced hydrogen peroxide generation and enhanced repair of DNA photoproducts. These effects should contribute to genomic stability of human melanocytes, thus preventing their malignant transformation to melanoma. Based on these findings, we synthesized and tested the effects of 3 tetrapeptide alpha-MSH analogs, Ac-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, n-Pentadecanoyl- and 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, on cultured human melanocytes. The latter two analogs were more potent than the former, or alpha-MSH, in stimulating the activity of tyrosinase, thus melanogenesis, reducing apoptosis and release of hydrogen peroxide and enhancing repair of DNA photoproducts in melanocytes exposed to UV radiation (UVR). The above analogs are MC1R agonists, as their effects were abrogated by an analog of agouti signaling protein, the physiological MC1R antagonist, and were absent in melanocytes expressing loss-of-function MC1R. Analogs, such as 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2 with prolonged and reversible effects, can potentially be developed into topical agents to prevent skin photocarcinogenesis, particularly melanoma.",

Recently, we showed that up-regulation of this gene by the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 was responsible for sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through c-FLIP repression in melanoma. The present study aimed at investigating whether, in addition to inducing H3 hyperacetylation at the c-myc promoter, MS-275 could enhance cell death through the regulation of miRNAs involved in apoptosis, such as the miR-17-92 cluster. Following MS-275 treatment, a decrease in miR-92a-3p was observed either in TRAIL-resistant or TRAIL-sensitive cutaneous and uveal melanoma cells. Prediction tools revealed that miR-92a-3p targeted MYCBP2. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that the 3'-UTR of MYCBP2 mRNA was the target of miR-92a-3p, as ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p resulted in MYCBP2 downregulation whereas miR-92a-3p knockdown markedly increased the expression of MYCBP2. Silencing of MYCBP2 counteracted the pro-apoptotic effects exerted by the down-regulation of miR-92a-3p and prevented c-myc-induced repression of c-FLIP, indicating a pivotal role of MYCBP2 as a mediator of miR-92a-3p and c-myc function. Together, our findings indicate that the MS-275-triggered downregulation of the oncogenic miR-92a-3p- which leads to the overexpression of its target gene MYCBP2 - is an event required for the enhanced susceptibility of melanoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Our data illustrate another epigenetic mechanism activated by MS-275 at the post-transcriptional level in melanoma, in addition to its best-known effects at the transcriptional level.",

Surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG and quantified by measuring radiolabeled antibody binding. Bowes melanoma cells, which in their wild type did not express CD36 and did not bind radiolabeled TSP, when transfected with the sense construct bound TSP in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with CD36 expression. Conversely, C32 melanoma cells, which in their wild type expressed high levels of CD36 and bound radiolabeled TSP at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, did not express CD36 and did not bind TSP when transfected with an antisense construct. In addition, transfected Bowes cells and wild type C32 cells, unlike wild type Bowes cells, adhered to activated platelets in a TSP-dependent manner. These data, i.e. the gain of function with sense cDNA transfection and loss of function with antisense transfection, strongly support the TSP receptor function of CD36.

Furthermore, the actions of TNF-alpha were suppressed by the addition of an anti-inflammatory peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). In the current study, we extend this work investigating to what extent TNF-alpha might stimulate melanoma invasion by promoting cell migration and whether alpha-MSH is also inhibitory. Two human melanoma cell lines were examined in vitro (HBL and C8161) using a scratch migration assay. Analysis using either time-lapse video microscopy or imaging software analysis of migrating 'fronts' of cells revealed that C8161 cells migrated more rapidly than HBL cells. However, when cells were stimulated with TNF-alpha both cell types responded with a significant increase in migration distance over a 16-26 h incubation time. alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone had an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha-stimulated migration for HBL cells, completely blocking migration at 10(-9) M. In contrast, C8161 cells did not respond to alpha-MSH (as these cells have a loss-of-function melanocortin-1 receptor). However, stable transfection of C8161 cells with the wild-type melanocortin-1 receptor produced cells whose migration was significantly inhibited by alpha-MSH. In addition, the use of a neutralising antibody to the beta(1)-integrin subunit significantly reduced migration in both cell types. This data therefore supports an inflammatory environment promoting melanoma cell migration, and in addition shows that alpha-MSH can inhibit inflammatory stimulated migration. The data also support a fundamental role of the beta(1)-integrin receptor in melanoma cell migration.",

Here we report that in melanoma cell lines which do not express p16, or express a mutant p16, no G2 delay is observed in response to UV. The loss of functional p16 also correlates with an increase in DNA damage as judged by increased numbers of bi- and multinuclear cells and cells containing 1-2 micronuclei following UV irradiation.

High expression levels of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 4A3, a dual phosphatase, is highly predictive of metastasis development and PTP4A3 overexpression in uveal melanoma cells increases their in vitro migration and in vivo invasiveness. Melanocytes, including uveal melanocytes, are derived from the neural crest during embryonic development. We therefore suggested that PTP4A3 function in uveal melanoma metastasis may be related to an embryonic role during neural crest cell migration. We show that PTP4A3 plays a role in cephalic neural crest development in Xenopus laevis. PTP4A3 loss of function resulted in a reduction of neural crest territory, whilst gain of function experiments increased neural crest territory.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced DNA photoproducts play an important role in melanomagenesis. Cutaneous melanin content represents a major photoprotective mechanism against UVR-induced DNA damage, and generally correlates inversely with the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. Melanoma risk is also determined by susceptibility genes, one of which is the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. Certain MC1R alleles are strongly associated with melanoma. We hereby present experimental evidence for the role of two melanoma risk factors, constitutive pigmentation, as assessed by total melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin contents, and MC1R genotype and function, in determining the induction and repair of DNA photoproducts in cultured human melanocytes after irradiation with increasing doses of UVR. We found that total melanin and eumelanin contents (MC and EC) correlated inversely with the extent of UVR-induced growth arrest, apoptosis and induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), but not with hydrogen peroxide release in melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. In comparison, melanocytes with loss-of-function MC1R, regardless of their MC or EC, sustained more UVR-induced apoptosis and CPD, and exhibited reduced CPD repair. Therefore, MC, mainly EC, and MC1R function are independent determinants of UVR-induced DNA damage in melanocytes.",

It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed.

Rho GTPase pathways display functional redundancy in developmental events, including axon guidance. Therefore, their roles can often be masked when using simple loss-of-function genetic approaches. As a complement to loss-of-function genetics, we constructed a constitutively activated CDC-42(G12V) expressed in C. elegans neurons. CDC-42(G12V) drove the formation of ectopic lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in the PDE neurons, which resembled protrusions normally found on migrating growth cones of axons. We then used a candidate gene approach to identify molecules that mediate CDC-42(G12V)-induced ectopic protrusions by determining if loss of function of the genes could suppress CDC-42(G12V). Using this approach, we identified 3 cytoskeletal pathways previously implicated in axon guidance, the Arp2/3 complex, UNC-115/abLIM, and UNC-43/Ena. We also identified the Nck-interacting kinase MIG-15/NIK and p21-activated kinases (PAKs), also implicated in axon guidance. Finally, PI3K signaling was required, specifically the Rictor/mTORC2 branch but not the mTORC1 branch that has been implicated in other aspects of PI3K signaling including stress and aging. Our results indicate that multiple pathways can mediate CDC-42-induced neuronal protrusions that might be relevant to growth cone protrusions during axon pathfinding. Each of these pathways involves Rac GTPases, which might serve to integrate the pathways and coordinate the multiple CDC-42 pathways. These pathways might be relevant to developmental events such as axon pathfinding as well as disease states such as metastatic melanoma. ",

We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor.

A prominent in vivo model of the senescence barrier is represented by nevi, which are composed of melanocytes that, after an initial phase of proliferation induced by activated oncogenes (most commonly BRAF), are blocked in a state of cellular senescence. Transformation to melanoma occurs when genes involved in controlling senescence are mutated or silenced and cells reacquire the capacity to proliferate. Pirin (PIR) is a highly conserved nuclear protein that likely functions as a transcriptional regulator whose expression levels are altered in different types of tumors. We analyzed the expression pattern of PIR in adult human tissues and found that it is expressed in melanocytes and has a complex pattern of regulation in nevi and melanoma: it is rarely detected in mature nevi, but is expressed at high levels in a subset of melanomas. Loss of function and overexpression experiments in normal and transformed melanocytic cells revealed that PIR is involved in the negative control of cellular senescence and that its expression is necessary to overcome the senescence barrier.

This anomaly appears to be particularly relevant in tumors exhibiting a defect in DNA-mismatch repair, and induces structural abnormalities in HLA cell-surface expression that are not reversible by cytokine treatment. We examined HLA expression in 118 melanoma, colon or larynx tumors to identify total loss of HLA class I expression with or without somatic beta2-microglobulin gene mutation. Microsatellite instability was investigated in these tumors to determine whether a replication error phenotype (RER+) implied a particular alteration in HLA phenotype. A total of 7.6% of the tumors showed the RER+ phenotype, and 12.7% were HLA-ABC-negative. In the RER+ group, only one tumor was HLA-ABC-negative and no beta2-microglobulin mutation was identified. In contrast, in the HLA-ABC-negative group, only one tumor showed microsatellite instability. None of the three melanomas that contained beta2-microglobulin mutation exhibited the mutator phenotype.

IFIH1 is causal in type 1 diabetes based on the protective associations of four rare variants, where the derived alleles are predicted to reduce gene expression or function. Originally, however, T1D protection was mapped to the common IFIH1 nsSNP, rs1990760 or Thr946Ala. This common amino acid substitution does not cause a loss of function and evidence suggests the protective allele, Ala(946), may mark a haplotype with reduced expression of IFIH1 in line with the protection conferred by the four rare loss of function alleles. We have performed allele specific expression analysis that supports this hypothesis: the T1D protective haplotype correlates with reduced IFIH1 transcription in interferon-β stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (overall p = 0.012). In addition, we have used multiflow cytometry analysis and quantitative PCR assays to prove reduced expression of IFIH1 in individuals heterozygous for three of the T1D-associated rare alleles: a premature stop codon, rs35744605 (Glu627X) and predicted splice variants, rs35337543 (IVS8+1) and rs35732034 (IVS14+1). We also show that the nsSNP, Ile923V, does not alter pre-mRNA levels of IFIH1. These results confirm and extend the new autoimmune disease pathway of reduced IFIH1 expression and protein function protecting from T1D.",

Recent results from our laboratory demonstrate that Apaf-1 has an apoptosis-unrelated function that may well account for its role as a tumor suppressor. The knockout of apaf-1 (in mice), the knockdown of Apaf-1 (in human cells) and loss of function mutations of ced-4 (the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of Apaf-1) compromise the arrest of DNA synthesis in response to DNA damage, in a context in which apoptosis does not occur. Here, we show that the depletion of Apaf-1 also sensitizes cells to chromosomal instability induced by different types of DNA damage such as cisplatin, UVC light and gamma-irradiation.

The activity was neutralized by anti-IL-1 alpha antibody but not by anti-IL-1 beta antibody. Resistant cells expressed IL-1 alpha but not IL-1 beta mRNA. Therefore, the resistant cells appeared to produce IL-1 alpha mRNA for IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was not detected in resistant cells, indicating that the resistance is not attributable to IL-1Ra. These resistant cells were also resistant to the anti-proliferative effect of human IL-6, but not to that of human TNF. Resistant cells appeared to produce constitutively IL-6 more than sensitive cells, and IL-6 production both in sensitive and in resistant cells was augmented by exogenous IL-1. Furthermore, constitutive production of IL-6 in resistant cells was inhibited by IL-1Ra. Type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) mRNA was expressed equally in resistant and sensitive cells.

Additionally, there is currently no general method for cloning antigen-specific effector T cells directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, without the need for prior expansion in vitro. Here we describe an efficient method for cloning effector T cells ex vivo. Functional T cells are detected using optimised interferon gamma capture following stimulation with viral or tumour cell-derived antigen. In combination with multiple phenotypic markers, single effector T cells are sorted using a flow cytometer directly into multi-well plates, and cloned using standard, non antigen-specific expansion methods. We provide examples of this novel technology to generate antigen-reactive clones from healthy donors using Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus as representative viral antigen sources, and from two melanoma patients using autologous melanoma cells. Cloning efficiency, clonality, and retention/loss of function are described. Ex vivo effector cell cloning provides a rapid and effective method of deriving antigen-specific T cells clones with traceable in vivo precursor function and phenotype. ",

The human MC1R is a Gs protein-coupled receptor, which is activated by its agonists α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-melanocortin; α-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The ENDBR is a Gq coupled-receptor, which is activated by Endothelin (ET)-3 during embryonic development, and ET-1 postnatally. Pigmentation and the DNA repair capacity are two major factors that determine the risk for melanoma. Activation of the MC1R by its agonists stimulates the synthesis of eumelanin, the dark brown photoprotective pigment. In vitro studies showed that α-MSH and ET-1 interact synergistically in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor to stimulate human melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis, and to inhibit UVR-induced apoptosis. An important function of the MC1R is reduction of oxidative stress and activation of DNA repair pathways. The human MC1R is highly polymorphic, and MC1R variants, particularly those that cause loss of function of the expressed receptor, are associated with increased melanoma risk independently of pigmentation. These variants compromise the DNA repair and antioxidant capacities of human melanocytes. Recently, activation of ENDBR by ET-1 was reported to reduce the induction and enhance the repair of UVR-induced DNA photoproducts. We conclude that α-MSH and ET-1 and their cognate receptors MC1R and ENDBR reduce the risk for melanoma by maintaining genomic stability of melanocytes via modulating the DNA damage response to solar UVR. Elucidating the response of melanocytes to UVR should improve our understanding of the process of melanomagenesis, and lead to effective melanoma chemoprevention, as well as therapeutic strategies.

Thus, higher inhibitor concentrations in tumor tissues might be reached with less systemic effects.

To maintain genomic integrity, cells are equipped with dedicated sensors to monitor DNA repair or to force damaged cells into death programs. The tumor suppressor p53 is central in this process. Here, we report that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upstream Stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) coordinates p53 function in making proper cell fate decisions. USF1 stabilizes the p53 protein and promotes a transient cell cycle arrest, in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, cell proliferation is maintained inappropriately in Usf1 KO mice and in USF1-deficient melanoma cells challenged by genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate that the loss of USF1 compromises p53 stability by enhancing p53-MDM2 complex formation and MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In USF1-deficient cells, the level of p53 can be restored by the re-expression of full-length USF1 protein similarly to what is observed using Nutlin-3, a specific inhibitor that prevents p53-MDM2 interaction. Consistent with a new function for USF1, a USF1 truncated protein lacking its DNA-binding and transactivation domains can also restore the induction and activity of p53. These findings establish that p53 function requires the ubiquitous stress sensor USF1 for appropriate cell fate decisions in response to DNA-damage. They underscore the new role of USF1 and give new clues of how p53 loss of function can occur in any cell type. Finally, these findings are of clinical relevance because they provide new therapeutic prospects in stabilizing and reactivating the p53 pathway.",

We characterized 10 novel somatic point mutations in PDGFRA that have been reported in isolated cases of glioblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, peripheral nerve sheath tumors and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The PDGFRA transmembrane domain mutation V536E stimulated Ba/F3 cell growth and signaling via ERK and STAT5 in the absence of ligand. This mutant, identified in glioblastoma, was strongly inhibited by imatinib. Modeling suggested that the mutation modulates the packing of the transmembrane domain helices in the receptor dimer. By contrast, two mutations in highly conserved residues affected the receptor traffic to the cell surface or kinase activity, thereby preventing the response to PDGF. The other mutations had no significant impact on the receptor activity. This functional analysis matched the predictions of SIFT and PolyPhen for only five mutations and these algorithms do not discriminate gain from loss of function. Finally, an E996K variant that had been identified in a melanoma cell line was not expressed in these cells. Altogether, several newly identified PDGFRA mutations do not activate the receptor and may therefore represent passenger mutations.

We found that reparative M2 macrophages express significantly greater levels of OA/GPNMB than pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. Furthermore, using loss of function and rescue studies, we demonstrated that M2 macrophages-secreted OA/GPNMB positively regulates the viability, proliferation, and migration of MSCs. More importantly, we demonstrated that OA/GPNMB acts through ERK and AKT signaling pathways in MSCs via CD44, to induce these effects.

Accordingly, multiple studies have examined the potential value of these enzymes as targets for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, most clinical trials with MMP inhibitors have yielded negative results which has made necessary to re-evaluate the role of these proteases in cancer. Recent works mainly based on the use of mouse models deficient in specific MMPs have revealed that these enzymes play many roles in cancer distinct from matrix destruction, influencing early steps of tumor evolution, and expanding their pro-tumorigenic properties. However, these in vivo studies have also shown that, unexpectedly, some MMP family members like MMP8 may have paradoxical anti-tumor functions. Nevertheless, the final validation of these MMPs as bona fide tumor suppressors requested the identification of the putative genetic or epigenetic changes underlying their inactivation during cancer development. To this purpose, very recent large-scale genomic studies have explored the possibility that MMPs could be genetically altered in a panel of human malignant tumors from different sources. These studies have demonstrated that MMP8 is a frequently mutated gene in human melanoma. Functional analysis of the identified mutations has confirmed that all of them lead to the loss-of-function of MMP8 and enhance the progression of melanoma, thus providing definitive evidence that MMP8 is a tumor-suppressor gene. Parallel studies have extended these findings to other MMP-related metalloproteinases such as ADAMTS15, which has been found to be genetically inactivated in human colorectal cancer. This review describes the identification and validation of some MMPs and related enzymes as anti-tumor proteases and speculates about the molecular mechanisms underlying their protective roles in tumor development.

The functional importance of the AR N/C interaction is supported by naturally occurring loss-of-function AR AF2 mutations where AR retains high-affinity androgen binding but is defective in AR FXXLF motif binding. Ligands with agonist activity in vivo such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and the synthetic anabolic steroids induce the AR N/C interaction and increase AR transcriptional activity in part by slowing the dissociation rate of bound ligand and stabilizing AR against degradation. AR ligand-binding domain competitive antagonists inhibit the agonist-dependent AR N/C interaction. Although the human AR N/C interaction is important for transcriptional activity, it has an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activity from AF2 by competing for p160 coactivator LXXLL motif binding. The primate-specific AR coregulatory protein, melanoma antigen gene protein-A11 (MAGE-A11), modulates the AR N/C interaction through a direct interaction with the AR FXXLF motif. Inhibition of AF2 transcriptional activity by the AR N/C interaction is relieved by AR FXXLF motif binding to the F-box region of MAGE-11. Described here are methods to measure the androgen-dependent AR N/C interdomain interaction and the influence of transcriptional coregulators.",

In order to increase tumor selectivity of replication, we prepared mutants from the avirulent strain Ulster with monocyclic replication cycle and adapted them for multicyclic replication in human melanoma cells. Two mutants (M1 and M2) showed interesting functional differences: while M2 showed T cell co-stimulatory effects in a tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay, M1 did not. A distinct difference of these 2 virus mutants appeared also when testing their capacity to induce interferon-alpha and -beta as well as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) molecules in human monocytes. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) molecules of the 2 virus mutants showed 7 non-silent mutational differences. Upon cloning of the HN mutant genes into an expression vector and transfection of cells, only HN derived from M2 (HN-M2) was detected at the cell surface by immunostaining with specific antibodies and showed hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity. In order to define which amino acid was responsible for the loss of functional activity of HN derived from M1 (HN-M1), distinct HN mutants were generated via site-directed mutagenesis and tested. Substitution of serine 200 by a proline abrogated HN expression and its hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. Molecular modeling revealed that proline 200 in HN influences flexibility of a loop near the entrance to the neuraminidase active site, a function that may be crucial for the functions of this viral protein.",

An obstruction of the oesophagus was excluded via endoscopy, but the proximal oesophagus appeared to be distended and circular contractions were missing. A guttural pouch endoscopy revealed a single, black-mottled plaque on the pharyngeal ramus of the vagus nerve in the left guttural pouch, causing a local swelling of this nerve. The pharyngeal ramus seemed to be atrophic distal to the lesion. A biopsy was taken from the lesion and histopathological findings proved the reasonable suspicion of a guttural pouch mycosis with a high degree of purulent-necrotic inflammation and invasion of fungal hyphae. There were no signs of neoplasia, such as melanoma. Daily guttural pouch irrigations with a clotrimazole emulsion (20 g Canesten(®) Gyn(4) solved in 500 ml water), led to a good recovery of the mucosa above the nerve. Periodic endoscopic examination of the left guttural pouch showed that local thickening and distal atrophy of this pharyngeal ramus did not improve, neither did the clinical symptoms. Due to progressive weight loss, acute respiratory distress and aspiration pneumonia, the 20-year-old pony mare unfortunately had to be euthanized three weeks after discharge. This case report emphasizes the enormous importance of a single nerve for the realization of the swallowing process. The one-sided loss of function of the pharyngeal branch of the vagal nerve cannot be compensated neither by the remaining ipsilateral nerves nor by the contralateral normal functioning glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves and thus inevitably leads to severe dysphagia.

Chromatin remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF complex are involved in making DNA accessible to transcription factors and thereby are implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations and altered expression of chromatin remodeling complex genes have been described in cancer cells. Indeed, non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have been shown to harbor mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a member of the SWI/SNF complex, but evidence has been less clear in primary tumors. Recently, inactivating mutations in AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) were found in liver cancer related to HCV infection and in melanoma. Here, we explored, using a genome-wide strategy and subsequent sequencing of targeted genes, whether chromatin remodeling is implicated in primary lung adenocarcinoma. Two genes were individualized from the genome screening as homozygously deleted in a set of samples: JARID2 and ARID2. Subsequent analysis of the entire coding sequences showed that ARID2 loss-of-function mutations were found in 5% of nonsmall cell lung cancers, thereby constituting one of the most frequently mutated genes in this cancer type after TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and STK11.",

Most cutaneous cell types express MC receptors (MC-Rs) and synthesize MCs, such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), that act in autocrine and paracrine fashion. In human skin cells, activation of adenylate cyclase by MCs occurs at 10(-6)-10(-9) M doses of the ligand, but effects are induced in some cell types at subnanomolar concentrations. In addition to the pigmentary action of MCs on epidermal melanocytes, the hair follicle is a source and target for MCs. MCs regulate lipogenesis in sebocytes expressing both MC-1R and MC-5R. In adipocytes, lipid metabolism is modulated by agouti signalling protein, a natural MC-1R/MC-4R antagonist. The anti-inflammatory activity of alpha-MSH includes immunomodulatory effects on several resident skin cells and antifibrogenic effects mediated via MC-1R expressed by dermal fibroblasts. In human mast cells, alpha-MSH appears to be proinflammatory due to histamine release. alpha-MSH exhibits cytoprotective activity against UVB-induced apoptosis and DNA damage, a finding that helps explain the increased risk of cutaneous melanoma in individuals with loss of function MC-1R mutations. These findings should improve our understanding of skin physiology and pathophysiology and may offer novel strategies with MCs as future therapeutics for skin diseases.",

The phosphorylase is a housekeeping enzyme involved in the purine and amino acid metabolism whose activity is evidentiable in all the normal tissues. Chromosomal deletions encompassing both MTAPase and p16INK4 genes cause the total absence of the enzymatic activity only in malignant cells, thus resulting in defined metabolic differences between malignant and normal cells. MTAPase deficiency was investigated by direct radiochemical assay method and by immunochemical techniques in 35 different human malignant cell lines established from several tumor types. The enzyme-deficient cells derived from breast, lung, ovary and liver cancer, malignant melanomas, malignant gliomas and liposarcomas. Two of the MTAPase-deficient cell preparations (from a liver carcinoma and from a melanoma) are primary cultures thus directly representing the original cancer genotypes. Several of the MTAPase-negative cells were studied for p16INK4 gene deletions and for p16INK4 protein deficiency. In all the examined samples a full correlation exists between the lack of MTAPase and that of p16INK4. A similar result was obtained analysing extracts of Vero cell line, which is a fibroblast MTAPase-negative cell line established from the kidney of a normal adult monkey. Conversely, Cos cells, which also are fibroblasts derived from monkey kidney, show both MTAPase and p16INK4 protein. These results: (i) demonstrate that the phosphorylase deficiency is distributed among almost all the most important human cancers; (ii) confirm and extend the tumor types were p16INK4 gene inactivation is observable and (iii) suggest that deletions at 9p21 (in humans) or at syntenic chromosomes (in other species) might represent a general mechanism of p16INK4 gene loss of function and possibly, in turn, of cancer development and/or progression.",

Furthermore, we have shown that a peptide derived from the self-binding domain of the autophilic T15 antibody can be crosslinked to the Fc carbohydrate of monoclonal antibodies specific for the B-cell receptor of B-cell tumors. These peptide-crosslinked antibodies can exert self-binding properties, leading to an increase in binding efficiency to the target cells as well as an increase in potential to induce apoptosis.

The T15 peptide-conjugated antibody shows the ability to bind to itself, as well as an increased binding to its antigen, ganglioside GM2.

We studied four kindreds with HGD and four kindreds with AS for abnormalities of the ACTH receptor (ACTHR) gene. The ACTHR coding sequence in all AS kindreds and two HGD kindreds was normal. Analysis of the ACTHR gene of the proband in one of the HGD kindreds showed him to be homozygous for the previously described G221T transition causing a Ser74Ile substitution of the protein, which has been shown to inactivate the ACTHR in signal transduction. The proband in another HGD kindred was found to be a compound heterozygote with the G221T transition in one allele and a novel C818A transition in the other allele of ACTHR. The C818A transition caused the substitution of the highly conserved Pro273 by His in the receptor protein. In vitro expression of the mutated ACTHR in mouse melanoma M3 cells showed that at a medium ACTH concentration of 3 nM, cells transfected with the wild-type ACTHR produced twofold and threefold, respectively, of the amount of intracellular cAMP when compared to cells transfected with the ACTHR carrying the Pro273His and the Ser74Ile mutation, respectively, confirming that HGD in this kindred is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the ACTHR.

CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively.

Individuals with loss-of-function mutations for the glypican 3 gene exhibit Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, a rare X-linked overgrowth disorder. Expression of glypican 3 mRNA and protein is normally silenced in most adult organs and may reappear during malignant transformation. In the past few years, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of glypican 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma have been elucidated. More recently, glypican 3 has been emerging as a new diagnostic marker for germ cell tumors and especially testicular and ovarian yolk sac tumors. However, in other tumors such as renal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas, studies disagree on the level of glypican 3 expression. Finally, there is the controversial notion of glypican 3 as a tumor suppressor gene. In this review article, we update current knowledge on glypican 3 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, evaluate its utility as a tumor marker in clinical practice, and explore its role as a novel oncofetal protein with clinical implications. Our focus is on the diagnostic value of glypican 3 in germ cell tumors and other neoplasms in addition to hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, glypican 3 has been proven to be a useful immunohistochemical marker in distinguishing yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, and Wilms tumors from other malignancies histologically mimicking these primitive tumors.

The clinical significance of BANCR, and its' molecular mechanisms controlling cancer cell migration and metastasis are unclear.;Expression of BANCR was analyzed in 113 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and seven NSCLC cell lines using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. Gain and loss of function approaches were used to investigate the biological role of BANCR in NSCLC cells. The effects of BANCR on cell viability were evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst staining and flow cytometry. Nude mice were used to examine the effects of BANCR on tumor cell metastasis in vivo. Protein levels of BANCR targets were determined by western blotting and fluorescent immunohistochemistry.;BANCR expression was significantly decreased in 113 NSCLC tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. Additionally, reduced BANCR expression was associated with larger tumor size, advanced pathological stage, metastasis distance, and shorter overall survival of NSCLC patients. Reduced BANCR expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC. Histone deacetylation was involved in the downregulation of BANCR in NSCLC cells. Ectopic expression of BANCR impaired cell viability and invasion, leading to the inhibition of metastasis in vitro and in vivo. However, knockdown of BANCR expression promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro. Overexpression of BANCR was found to play a key role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression.;We determined that BANCR actively functions as a regulator of EMT during NSCLC metastasis, suggesting that BANCR could be a biomarker for poor prognosis of NSCLC.",

Because double TCF/LEF-binding sites were identified within the 5'-promoter region of human SPRY4 gene, comparative genomics analyses on SPRY4 orthologs were further performed. SPRY4-FGF1 locus at human chromosome 5q31.3 and FGF2-NUDT6-SPATA5-SPRY1 locus at human chromosome 4q27-q28.1 were paralogous regions within the human genome. Chimpanzee SPRY4 gene was identified within NW_107083.1 genome sequence. Human, chimpanzee, rat and mouse SPRY4 orthologs, consisting of three exons, were well conserved. SPRY4 gene was identified as the evolutionarily conserved target of WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway based on the conservation of double TCF/LEF-binding sites within 5'-promoter region of mammalian SPRY4 orthologs. Human SPRY4 mRNA was expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, brain, pancreatic islet, colon cancer, head and neck tumor, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. WNT signaling activation in progenitor cells leads to the growth regulation of progenitor cells themselves through SPRY4 induction, and also to the growth stimulation of proliferating cells through FGF secretion. Epigenetic silencing and loss-of-function mutations of SPRY4 gene in progenitor cells could lead to carcinogenesis. SPRY4 is the pharmacogenomics target in the fields of oncology and regenerative medicine.",
