        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma development is often associated with alteration in the activity and expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CKDs) and cyclins, resulting in aberrant cell proliferation. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal roles of miRNAs in controlling the development and growth of glioblastoma. Here, we provide evidence for a function of miR-340 in the inhibition of glioblastoma cell proliferation. We found that miR-340 is downregulated in human glioblastoma tissue samples and several established glioblastoma cell lines. Proliferation and neurosphere formation assays revealed that miR-340 plays an oncosuppressive role in glioblastoma, and that its ectopic expression causes significant defect in glioblastoma cell growth. Further, using bioinformatics, luciferase assay and western blot, we found that miR-340 specifically targets the 3'UTRs of CDK6, cyclin-D1 and cyclin-D2, leading to the arrest of glioblastoma cells in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Confirming these results, we found that re-introducing CDK6, cyclin-D1 or cyclin-D2 expression partially, but significantly, rescues cells from the suppression of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest mediated by miR-340. Collectively, our results demonstrate that miR-340 plays a tumor-suppressive role in glioblastoma and may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker and/or a therapeutic avenue for glioblastoma. ",

Targeting the CDK4/CDK6-cyclin D1-Rb-p16/ink4a pathway using a potent CDK4 and CDK6 kinase inhibitor has potential for treating primary central nervous system tumors such as glioblastoma and some peripheral tumors with high incidence of brain metastases. We compared central nervous system exposures of two orally bioavailable CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors: abemaciclib, which is currently in advanced clinical development, and palbociclib (IBRANCE; Pfizer), which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Abemaciclib antitumor activity was assessed in subcutaneous and orthotopic glioma models alone and in combination with standard of care temozolomide (TMZ). Both inhibitors were substrates for xenobiotic efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistant protein expressed at the blood-brain barrier. Brain Kp,uu values were less than 0.2 after an equimolar intravenous dose indicative of active efflux but were approximately 10-fold greater for abemaciclib than palbociclib. Kp,uu increased 2.8- and 21-fold, respectively, when similarly dosed in P-gp-deficient mice. Abemaciclib had brain area under the curve (0-24 hours) Kp,uu values of 0.03 in mice and 0.11 in rats after a 30 mg/kg p.o. dose. Orally dosed abemaciclib significantly increased survival in a rat orthotopic U87MG xenograft model compared with vehicle-treated animals, and efficacy coincided with a dose-dependent increase in unbound plasma and brain exposures in excess of the CDK4 and CDK6 Ki values. Abemaciclib increased survival time of intracranial U87MG tumor-bearing rats similar to TMZ, and the combination of abemaciclib and TMZ was additive or greater than additive. These data show that abemaciclib crosses the blood-brain barrier and confirm that both CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors reach unbound brain levels in rodents that are expected to produce enzyme inhibition; however, abemaciclib brain levels are reached more efficiently at presumably lower doses than palbociclib and are potentially on target for a longer period of time.

There is therefore an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of glioma tumorigenesis and develop or improve therapeutics. The aim of this study was to assess the possible prognostic value of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and the effects of microRNA-495 (miR-495) manipulation on CDK6 expression and cell survival in glioma cells.;Analyses of clinical specimens from GBM patients were used. Expression of CDK6 was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Expression of CDK6 was also analyzed after over-expression of miR-495 in T98 cells; both cell proliferation and RB phosphorylation were examined. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and RB phosphorylation were also examined after knockdown of CDK6 in U87-MG and T98 cells.;Analyses of clinical specimens from GBM patients identified that CDK6 is significantly expressed in gliomas. CDK6 antigen expression was higher in tumor cores and margins than in adjacent normal brain tissues, and higher levels of CDK6 expression in the tumor margin correlated with decreased survival. Over-expression of miR-495 in T98 cells downregulated the expression of CDK6 and inhibited retinoblastoma phosphorylation, and knockdown of CDK6 in U87-MG and T98 cells by siRNAs resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and inhibition of cell proliferation.;This study revealed miR-495 is down-regulated in glioma tissues. Furthermore, miR-495 regulated CDK6 expression and involved in glioma cell growth inhibition, which indicated the possible role of miR-495 in tumor progression.",

However, the mechanism of its chemo-preventive effect on human glioblastoma cells is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of phloretin and its associated chemo-preventive effect in human glioblastoma cells. The results indicate that phloretin inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase and induced apoptosis of human glioblastoma cells. Phloretin-induced cell cycle arrest was associated with increased expression of p27 and decreased expression of cdk2, cdk4, cdk6, cyclinD and cyclinE. Moreover, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades were suppressed by phloretin in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, phloretin triggered the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). This was accompanied by the up-regulation of Bax, Bak and c-PARP and the down-regulation of Bcl-2. The antioxidant agents N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione weakened the effect of phloretin on glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that phloretin exerts potent chemo-preventive activity in human glioblastoma cells through the generation of ROS. ",

Among 120 glioblastomas, 40% had no wild-type CDKN2A gene, 12% amplified the CDK4 gene, and 14% had no wild-type RBI gene. With two exceptions, each tumour had only one of these abnormalities. Thus the majority of the glioblastomas (64%) had distinct genetic aberrations which would obviously disrupt the control of transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. A further 30% had loss of one allele of the CDKN2A and/or RBI genes. Only seven (6%) glioblastomas had no abnormalities of these genes. Anaplastic astrocytomas showed similar changes to the glioblastomas but at lower frequencies-34% showing no aberrations of the genes analysed. The astrocytomas showed solely loss of one allele of the RBI gene in 28% of tumours, with retention of one wild-type copy. In the glioblastomas with no alterations of CDKN2A, CDK4 or RB1, several other genes (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK6, E2F, CDK7, MYC and MYCN) whose products take part in cell cycle regulation were examined.

We attempt to identify the tumor suppressive miRNA not only down-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) but also potent to inhibit the oncogene EZH2, and then investigate the biological function and pathophysiologic role of the candidate miRNA in GBM. In this study, we show that miRNA-138 is reduced in both GBM clinical specimens and cell lines, and is effective to inhibit EZH2 expression. Moreover, high levels of miR-138 are associated with long overall and progression-free survival of GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA) data portal. Ectopic expression of miRNA-138 effectively inhibits GBM cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo through inducing cell cycles G1/S arrest. Mechanism investigation reveals that miRNA-138 acquires tumor inhibition through directly targeting EZH2, CDK6, E2F2 and E2F3. Moreover, an EZH2-mediated signal loop, EZH2-CDK4/6-pRb-E2F1, is probably involved in GBM tumorigenicity, and this loop can be blocked by miRNA-138. Additionally, miRNA-138 negatively correlates to mRNA levels of EZH2 and CDK6 among GBM clinical samples from both TCGA and our small amount datasets. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a tumor suppressive role of miRNA-138 in GBM tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential application in GBM therapy.",

We studied the expression, targets, and functional effects of miR-34a in brain tumor cells and human gliomas. Transfection of miR-34a down-regulated c-Met in human glioma and medulloblastoma cells and Notch-1, Notch-2, and CDK6 protein expressions in glioma cells. miR-34a expression inhibited c-Met reporter activities in glioma and medulloblastoma cells and Notch-1 and Notch-2 3'-untranslated region reporter activities in glioma cells and stem cells. Analysis of human specimens showed that miR-34a expression is down-regulated in glioblastoma tissues as compared with normal brain and in mutant p53 gliomas as compared with wild-type p53 gliomas. miR-34a levels in human gliomas inversely correlated to c-Met levels measured in the same tumors. Transient transfection of miR-34a into glioma and medulloblastoma cell lines strongly inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell survival, and cell invasion, but transfection of miR-34a into human astrocytes did not affect cell survival and cell cycle status. Forced expression of c-Met or Notch-1/Notch-2 transcripts lacking the 3'-untranslated region sequences partially reversed the effects of miR-34a on cell cycle arrest and cell death in glioma cells and stem cells, respectively. Also, transient expression of miR-34a in glioblastoma cells strongly inhibited in vivo glioma xenograft growth. Together, these findings represent the first comprehensive analysis of the role of miR-34a in gliomas. They show that miR-34a suppresses brain tumor growth by targeting c-Met and Notch.

The predominant copy number signature in both tumor groups was defined by chromosome-7 gain/chromosome-10 loss, a poor-prognosis genetic signature. We also observed, at frequencies similar to that detected in TCGA GBM tumors, genomic amplification and overexpression of known GBM oncogenes, such as EGFR, MDM2, CDK6, and MYCN, and novel genes, including NUP107, SLC35E3, MMP1, MMP13, and DDX1.

Assessment of gene expression in TCGA-derived GBMs revealed overexpression of MRC cancer genes AURKB, BIRC5, CCNB1, CCNB2, CDC2, CDK2, and FOXM1, which form a transcriptional network important for G2/M progression and/or checkpoint activation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Deletions of chromosome arm 10q are found in most glioblastomas and subsets of lower grade gliomas. Mutations in the PTEN gene at 10q23.3 are restricted to less than half of the 10q-deleted gliomas, suggesting additional glioma-associated tumor suppressors on 10q. We investigated 64 astrocytic gliomas of different malignancy grades for aberrant expression of 16 microRNAs (miRNAs) on 10q. Thereby, we identified four miRNAs (miR-107, miR-146b-5p, miR-346, miR-1287-5p) whose expression was frequently down-regulated in anaplastic astrocytomas and/or glioblastomas. DNA methylation analyses revealed 5'-CpG site hypermethylation of miR-346 in more than two-thirds of primary glioblastomas, while aberrant 5'-CpG site methylation of miR-146b-5p was frequent in IDH1-mutant astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas. Overexpression of either of the four miRNAs in glioma cell lines reduced cell proliferation and/or increased caspase-3/7 activity. Expression analyses of miRNA overexpressing glioma cells and 3'-untranslated region luciferase reporter gene assays revealed evidence that these miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate expression of glioma-relevant genes, including CDK6 (miR-107), EGFR (miR-146b-5p, miR-1287-5p), TERT and SEMA6A (miR-346), all of which are overexpressed in malignant gliomas in situ. In summary, we show that the 10q-located miRNAs miR-107, miR-146b-5p, miR-346 and miR-1287-5p are frequently down-regulated in malignant gliomas and thereby may support overexpression of important glioma growth-promoting genes.

A surgical specimen of R-GBM from a 20-year-old woman was analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES), whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), single nucleotide polymorphism array, and array comparative genomic hybridization. The status of gene expression in R-GBM tissue was compared with that of normal brain tissue and conventional GBM tumor tissue. We identified 23 somatic non-synonymous small nucleotide variants with WES. We identified the BRAF V600E mutation and possible functional changes in the mutated genes, ISL1 and NDRG2. Copy number alteration analysis revealed gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. We found loss of heterozygosity and focal homozygous deletion on 9q21, which includes CDKN2A and CDKN2B. In addition, WTS revealed that CDK6, MET, EZH2, EGFR, and NOTCH1, which are located on chromosomes 7 and 9, were over-expressed, whereas CDKN2A/2B were minimally expressed. Fusion gene analysis showed 14 candidate genes that may be functionally involved in R-GBM, including TWIST2, and UPK3BL. The BRAF V600E mutation, CDKN2A/2B deletion, and EGFR/MET copy number gain were observed. These simultaneous alterations are very rarely found in GBM. Moreover, the NDRG2 mutation was first identified in this study as it has never been reported in GBM. We observed a unique genomic signature in R-GBM compared to conventional GBM, which may provide insight regarding R-GBM as a distinct disease entity among the larger group of GBMs. ",

The p16 coding gene is often mutated in glioblastomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas and melanoma-prone pedigrees, but, until recently, the significance of these allelic variants has remained unclear. Here, we used interaction mating and coprecipitation to measure interaction of seven p16 allelic variants detected in melanoma-prone pedigrees with Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). We found that most variants were deficient in interaction with Cdk4 and Cdk6. One defective variant was found both in cancer prone families and in the control population and therefore previously defined as a common polymorphism. Another variant, which is weakly linked to familial cancer, is only slightly affected in interaction with Cdks. These results are consistent with the idea that p16 allelic variants that decrease Cdk interaction predispose individuals who carry them to an increased risk of cancer. Moreover, they suggest that determination of affinity between p16 mutants and partner proteins may help identify functionally-significant allelic variants not detected by classical human genetic techniques.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The intestinal epithelium is very peculiar for its continuous cell renewal, fuelled by multipotent stem cells localized within the crypts of Lieberkühn. Several lines of evidence have established the evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein Musashi1 as a marker of adult stem cells, including those of the intestinal epithelium, and revealed its roles in stem cell self-renewal and cell fate determination. Previous studies from our laboratories have shown that Musashi1 controls stem cell-like features in medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer cells, and has pro-proliferative and pro-tumorigenic properties in intestinal epithelial progenitor cells in vitro. To undertake a detailed study of Musashi1's function in the intestinal epithelium in vivo, we have generated a mouse model, referred to as v-Msi, overexpressing Musashi1 specifically in the entire intestinal epithelium. Compared with wild type litters, v-Msi1 mice exhibited increased intestinal crypt size accompanied by enhanced proliferation. Comparative transcriptomics by RNA-seq revealed Musashi1's association with gut stem cell signature, cell cycle, DNA replication, and drug metabolism. Finally, we identified and validated three novel mRNA targets that are stabilized by Musashi1, Ccnd1 (Cyclin D1), Cdk6, and Sox4. In conclusion, the targeted expression of Musashi1 in the intestinal epithelium in vivo increases the cell proliferation rate and strongly suggests its action on stem cells activity. This is due to the modulation of a complex network of gene functions and pathways including drug metabolism, cell cycle, and DNA synthesis and repair.",

Toward this end, we sought to validate and extend investigations of the differences between pediatric and adult tumors.;We carried out copy number profiling by array comparative genomic hybridization using a 32K bacterial artificial chromosome platform on 63 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cases of high-grade glioma arising in children and young people (<23 years).;The genomic profiles of these tumors could be subclassified into four categories: those with stable genomes, which were associated with a better prognosis; those with aneuploid and those with highly rearranged genomes; and those with an amplifier genotype, which had a significantly worse clinical outcome. Independent of this was a clear segregation of cases with 1q gain (more common in children) from those with concurrent 7 gain/10q loss (a defining feature of adults). Detailed mapping of all the amplification and deletion events revealed numerous low-frequency amplifications, including IGF1R, PDGFRB, PIK3CA, CDK6, CCND1, and CCNE1, and novel homozygous deletions encompassing unknown genes, including those at 5q35, 10q25, and 22q13. Despite this, aberrations targeting the \"core signaling pathways\" in adult glioblastomas are significantly underrepresented in the pediatric setting.;These data highlight that although there are overlaps in the genomic events driving gliomagenesis of all ages, the pediatric disease harbors a distinct spectrum of copy number aberrations compared with adults.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal primary brain tumor harboring myriad genetic and epigenetic alterations. The recent multidimensional analysis of the GBM genome has provided a more complete view of the landscape of such alterations and their linked pathways. This effort has demonstrated that certain pathways are universally altered, but that the specific genetic events altered within each pathway can vary for each particular patient's tumor. With this atlas of genetic and epigenetic events, it now becomes feasible to assess how the patterns of mutations in a pathway influence response to drugs that are targeting such pathways. This issue is particularly important for GBM because, in contrast to other tumor types, molecularly targeted therapies have failed to alter overall survival substantially. Here, we combined functional genetic screens and comprehensive genomic analyses to identify CDK6 as a GBM oncogene that is required for proliferation and viability in a subset of GBM cell lines and tumors. Using an available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, we sought to determine if the specific pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated the response to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. We showed that codeletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2C serves as a strong predictor of sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Thus, genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify a subset of GBMs likely to respond to CDK4/6 inhibition. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genomic, functional and pharmacologic data can be exploited to inform the development of targeted therapy directed against specific cancer pathways.",
