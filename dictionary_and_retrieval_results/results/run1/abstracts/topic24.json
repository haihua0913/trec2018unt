Recent reports indicate that the APC gene is an intermediary between cell adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton and that it may function as a gatekeeper of colonic epithelial proliferation. The objective of this study was to analyse APC's presence in lentigos, primary melanomas and melanoma metastases. By immunohistochemistry, APC was demonstrated in all lentigos, in 75 out of 88 primary melanomas and in 16 out of 28 melanoma lymphatic metastases. The percentage of immunolabelled tumour cells (APC index) in lentigos ranged between 5 and 69%, in primary melanomas between 0 and 98% and in melanoma metastases between 0 and 52%. Statistically significant differences between lentigos and primary melanomas and between lentigos and metastases in APC expression were found. In a multivariate analysis, APC showed an independent prognostic impact. Analysis of microsatellite instability in the APC locus was performed on 29 melanomas. Microsatellite instability was found in 5/29 melanomas and loss of heterozygosity in 1/29 melanomas. Promoter methylation of APC was found in 6/10 APC-negative primary melanomas and in 9/10 APC-negative melanoma lymphatic metastases investigated. We conclude about important role of APC alterations for melanoma progression.",

In the APC-deficient cells, ectopic expression of wild-type APC eliminated the excess beta-catenin. Cells with stabilized beta-catenin contained a constitutive beta-catenin-Lef-1 complex.

        "Doc_abstract":"High levels of beta-catenin and activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) have been demonstrated in malignant melanomas, implicating dysregulated Wnt signalling in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. We systematically examined melanoma cell lines for activating CTNNB1 mutations as well as genetic and epigenetic alterations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), another key component of the Wnt signalling transduction pathway. Of 40 cell lines tested, one carried a truncating APC mutation and loss of the corresponding wild-type allele, and one carried a CTNNB1 missense mutation. Hypermethylation of APC promoter 1A was present in five of the cell lines (13%) and in nine of 54 melanoma biopsies (17%). Cells with truncating APC or activating CTNNB1 mutations showed increased transcription from endogenous and ectopic beta-catenin/T-cell factor (Tcf)-responsive target genes, consistent with the known effects of these alterations on beta-catenin stability and Tcf transactivation. In contrast, cell lines with APC promoter 1A hypermethylation did not show increased Wnt signalling, probably due to residual APC activity expressed from promoter 1B. Suppression of APC transcripts in melanoma cells by stable expression of short hairpin RNAs led to a Wnt signalling-independent increase in cell proliferation, but also reduced the invasive growth in collagen type I. Collectively, our data suggest that the tumour-suppressive function of APC in melanocytic cells is dose dependent. We propose that epigenetic silencing of promoter 1A may contribute to the development of malignant melanoma by reducing the expression of APC to a level that promotes cell proliferation without compromising the invasive capacity.",

In this study, we have examined the effect of beta-catenin mutation (S37F) or APC loss on the proteasome sensitivity of additional subcellular beta-catenin pools in melanoma cells. In contrast to detergent-soluble beta-catenin, the detergent-insoluble protein remains proteasome-sensitive irrespective of S37F mutation or APC status. This insoluble component appears associated primarily with nuclear cytoskeletal elements. In addition, DNase I treatment solubilized a portion of detergent-insoluble beta-catenin, suggesting that this fraction also contains chromatin-associated protein, and correlating with a proteasome-sensitive elevation in beta-catenin-stimulated reporter activity. Since the detergent-insoluble nuclear component of beta-catenin displays GSK-3beta- and APC-independent proteasome sensitivity, distinct from the soluble nuclear and cytosolic pools of this protein, regulation of beta-catenin proteasome sensitivity and the contribution of this process to beta-catenin function may be more complex than previously appreciated.",

We investigated 37 malignant melanomas (15 primary tumors and 22 metastases) for alterations of 4 genes encoding members of this pathway, i.e., CTNNB1 (beta-catenin gene, 3p22.1), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene, 5q22.2), BTRC (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein gene, 10q24.3) and ICAT (inhibitor of beta-catenin and Tcf-4, 1p36.2). Mutational analysis of CTNNB1 identified somatic mutations in 1 primary melanoma and 1 melanoma metastasis from 2 different patients (5%). Both mutations affected the N-terminal degradation box of beta-catenin, which is important for the regulation of beta-catenin homeostasis. Another primary melanoma carried a somatic APC missense mutation within the known mutation cluster region in exon 15. Fourteen tumors (40%) showed LOH at microsatellite markers on 1p36. None of the tumors had lost both copies of the ICAT gene, but 1 melanoma metastasis carried a somatic point mutation altering the translation start codon of ICAT. Real-time RT-PCR showed markedly reduced ICAT transcript levels (<or=20% relative to normal skin and benign melanocytic nevi) in 28/36 malignant melanomas (78%), including 13/14 tumors with LOH on 1p36. Allelic loss on 10q was detected in 15 tumors (44%). We found neither mutations nor complete loss of expression of the BTRC gene in our melanoma series.

Immunoblot analyses and immunohistochemistry following gene delivery revealed an increase in AP-2alpha expression in the mouse intestinal mucosa and liver. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence for interactions between AP-2alpha, beta-catenin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins in mouse intestinal mucosa, as well as in a primary human colorectal cancer.

Mutations in the putative glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation sites near the beta-catenin amino terminus have been found in some cancers and cancer cell lines. The mutations render beta-catenin resistant to regulation by a complex containing the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, adenomatous polyposis coli, and axin proteins. As a result, beta-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and nucleus and activates T-cell factor/ lymphoid enhancing factor transcription factors. Previously, 6 of 27 melanoma cell lines were found to have beta-catenin exon 3 mutations affecting the N-terminal phosphorylation sites (Rubinfeld B, Robbins P, Elgamil M, Albert I, Porfiri E, Polakis P: Stabilization of beta-catenin by genetic defects in melanoma cell lines. Science 1997, 275:1790-1792). To assess the role of beta-catenin defects in primary melanomas, we undertook immunohistochemical and DNA sequencing studies in 65 melanoma specimens. Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin, a potential indicator of wnt pathway activation, was seen focally within roughly one third of the tumors, though a clonal somatic mutation in beta-catenin was found in only one case (codon 45 Ser-->Pro). Our findings demonstrate that beta-catenin mutations are rare in primary melanoma, in contrast to the situation in melanoma cell lines. Nonetheless, activation of beta-catenin, as indicated by its nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization, appears to be frequent in melanoma, and in some cases, it may reflect focal and transient activation of the wnt pathway within the tumor.",

Rates of increase among Scottish men were higher for every body site and all ages than among Queensland men. Among women, overall melanoma incidence increased more rapidly among Scottish (APC 1.8%) than Queensland women (APC 0.7%). Most discrepant were trends in upper limb melanomas, which underwent large annual increases among Scottish women, but declined among younger Queensland women. Melanoma incidence continues to rise rapidly in all age groups in Scotland and among older people in Queensland.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is a common skin cancer. About 50% of CMM sporadic tumours have lost one copy of the chromosome 9p21 region. To identify genes involved in the initiation and/or progression of CMM we have characterised the 9p21 melanoma deleted region and screened the human expressed sequence tag (EST) databases (dbEST) to search for expressed genes. We have identified the gene that encodes the human orthologue of the rat phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAP). PLAP was considered a potential candidate to be involved in malignant melanoma because it maps to the critical region for CMM and because the PLA2 gene has been identified as a modifier of the APC gene, responsible for the adenomatous polyposis phenotype in the mouse. PLAP encodes a protein of 738 amino acids and has a high DNA (90%) and protein (97%) sequence similarity with the rat and mouse PLAP protein. PLAP has a region of WD40 repeats in the amino-terminus, which allows us to include this protein in the superfamily of beta-transducin proteins. Northern blot hybridisation gave a fragment of 4.5 kb, with higher expression in heart compared to other tissues. PLAP was localised at chromosome 9p21, between marker AFM218xg11 and TEK. SSCP analysis of the coding region of PLAP revealed no variants in the studied samples, but one of six CMM samples analysed by RT-PCR showed specific inactivation of PLAP. Despite PLAP's important role in mediating several cellular responses and its localisation to the chromosome 9p21 region deleted in CMM, it is unlikely that point mutations or deletions in the coding region of PLAP are responsible for the initiation or progression of CMM. Further studies on PLAP inactivation should be performed to clarify its potential involvement in CMM.",

Nasal cavity lesions increased in incidence (APC 2.7%; P < 0.01) over this duration, while the incidence of non-nasal cavity lesions remained stable. The highest rate of increase was in white females ages 55 to 84 (APC 5.1%; P = 0.01). Conclusions. The incidence of MMHN in the United States has been rising since 1987.

        "Doc_abstract":"The Wnt/β-catenin pathway causes accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of the target genes. Without Wnt stimulation, β-catenin forms a complex with axin (axis inhibitor), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase 1α (CK1α), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and undergoes phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. Phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), interestingly, also are components of this degradation complex; therefore, a balance must be reached between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. How this balance is regulated is largely unknown. Here we show that a heat shock protein, HSP105, is a previously unidentified component of the β-catenin degradation complex. HSP105 is required for Wnt signaling, since depletion of HSP105 compromises β-catenin accumulation and target gene transcription upon Wnt stimulation. Mechanistically, HSP105 depletion disrupts the integration of PP2A into the β-catenin degradation complex, favoring the hyperphosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. HSP105 is overexpressed in many types of tumors, correlating with increased nuclear β-catenin protein levels and Wnt target gene upregulation. Furthermore, overexpression of HSP105 is a prognostic biomarker that correlates with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients as well as melanoma patients participating in the BRIM2 clinical study.

Due to the increasing frequency of melanoma it is crucial to detect early the malignant lesions on the basis of physical examination and noninvasive diagnostic methods (dermatoscopy, videodermatoscopy with total body photography). Histopathological examination is conclusive. In diagnostic imaging of early stage melanoma it is very important to evaluate the regional lymph node. In clinical practice, the cross-sectional imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) are widely used to assess lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currenly a valuable and reliable diagnostic procedure for precise staging of patients with clinically no cutaneous melanoma. The presence of SLN metastases is the most important negative factor for clinical outcome in melanoma patients. Introduction of RT-PCR allowed to detect individual cancer cells in tested sample of blood or tissue. Surgical treatment is an essential therapeutic modality in patients with melanoma. Treatment of a primary melanoma involves local excision of the tumour with a margin of skin and subcutaneous tissue. The role of systemic therapy is still a matter of clinical trials. Today's systemic therapy modalities include the use of biological agents (e.g. interferon alfa and interleukin 2) and cytotoxic agents. The efficacy of different types of melanoma vaccines (antigenic, cellular, DNA, GMTV) has been analyzed in numerous clinical trials. Results of these trials are still unsatisfactory. Dendritic cells in melanoma therapy will be very important in the future. Dendritic cells are the most efficient stimulators of T lymphocyte response among professional antygen presenting cells (APC) and the only APC capable to prime naive T lymphocytes with the antygen. A response to weakly immunogenic and tolerogenic tumor antigens can be achived with the use of DC as APC. This review represents an attempt to discuss current evidence on the place of adjuvant and palliative systemic therapy in melanoma.",

Clinical evidence suggesting that MHC class II expression by melanoma is associated with tumor progression led us to postulate a role for MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation in this disease. First, we investigated whether melanoma cells derived from metastases can process antigen and/or present peptide vi MHC class II molecules to a peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell clone. In all cell lines tested, melanoma cells were able to process antigen and present peptide efficiently to CD4+ T cells, resulting in T-cell proliferation increased 5-26-fold over controls. Next, we found that CD28-mediated costimulation was not required, because blocking with CTLA-4Ig had no effect on the T-cell response to either melanoma or B cells as APCs. In contrast, blocking CD54 (ICAM-1) resulted in a decrease in proliferation in response to peptide presentation by melanoma but not B cells. These data demonstrate that MHC class II molecules on melanoma cells are functional and that antigen-processing pathways are intact. In addition, CD54 seems to play a significant role in peptide presentation by melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To determine the role of beta-catenin pathway in human skin carcinogenesis, 135 non-melanoma skin tumors were analyzed for beta-catenin expression and gene mutations. Intense nucleo-cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for C terminus beta-catenin antibodies was observed in all pilomatricomas and in single cases of trichoepithelioma and squamous cell carcinoma showing peculiar signs of matrical differentiation. Moderate increase of beta-catenin nuclear staining was detected in a significant proportion of basal cell carcinomas, Bowen disease, spiroadenomas, and occasionally also in squamous cell carcinomas, but in these neoplasms only a limited fraction of tumor cells accumulated beta-catenin. Molecular analysis revealed that beta-catenin gene mutations are a peculiar feature of skin tumors with matrical differentiation and correlate with a pattern of intense and diffuse beta-catenin nuclear expression. In contrast, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and AXIN2 mutations were not involved in skin tumorigenesis. Analysis of Wnt pathway revealed that TCF-1 and MITF-M were selectively induced in the tumor types harboring beta-catenin mutations, indicating that a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway involving TCF-1 and MITF-M is activated in these tumors. Interestingly, high expression levels of TCF-3 were found in basal cell carcinomas and spiroadenomas. TCF-3 is reported to act as a negative modulator of beta-catenin degradation pathway. Thus, the moderate increase of beta-catenin nuclear staining detected in these tumor types might, at least in part, be due to a TCF-3-dependent mechanism. Finally, we found that the presence of beta-catenin mutations significantly correlated with loss of nuclear immunoreactivity for an antibody raised against the N terminus of beta-catenin (alphaABC). Thus, a combined analysis with C terminus-beta-catenin antibodies and alphaABC Ab may represent a powerful investigative approach for the detection of beta-catenin structural alterations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The Wnt signalling cascade plays an important role during embryonic patterning and cell fate determination and is highly conserved throughout evolution. Factors of the TCF/LEF HMG domain family (Tcfs) are the downstream effectors of this signal transduction pathway. Upon Wnt signalling, a cascade is initiated that results in the translocation of beta-catenin to the nucleus, where it interacts with Tcf to generate a transcriptionally active complex. This bipartite transcription factor is targeted to the upstream regulatory regions of Tcf target genes. In the absence of Wnt signals, beta-catenin is degraded in the cytoplasm via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Several proteins are instrumental in achieving this tight regulation of beta-catenin levels in the cell, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), GSK3 beta, and Axin/Conductin. Deregulation of the Wnt signalling pathway is implicated in several forms of cancer, such as colon carcinoma and melanoma. This deregulation is achieved via mutation of APC, beta-catenin or Axin, resulting in elevated beta-catenin levels and the presence of constitutively active Tcf-beta-catenin complexes in the nucleus. The accompanying inappropriate activation of target genes is considered to be a critical, early event in this carcinogenesis. In addition to regulating beta-catenin levels, normal healthy cells have evolved a second level of regulation, by manipulating the activity of the Tcf proteins themselves. In the absence of Wnt signalling, Tcf complexes with several transcriptional repressor proteins ensuring active repression of Tcf target genes. In this review the dual role of Tcf proteins in the Wnt signalling cascade will be discussed.",

Most of these tumors are sporadic and the genetic alterations responsible for their genesis take place over several cell generations; nevertheless, 5 to 10% of the human tumors are hereditary, with a rapid development. Cancer susceptibility genes have been classified as \"gatekeepers\" (e.g. RB1, ki-ras) and \"caretakers\" (e.g. hMLH1 and hMSH2, BRCA1). The first step in identifying individuals at high risk of developing a specific inherited form of cancer, and who should therefore undergo genetic tests, is the detailed construction of family history (an accurate cancer family history that includes at least three generation pedigrees, an appropriate cancer risk assessment and an effective genetic counseling). At present, the most useful methods of risk assessment are those performed on the following genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2 especially for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, hMLH1 and hMSH2 for hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer, APC for familial adenomatous polyposis, ret for medullary thyroid carcinoma, p53 for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, p16 for melanoma and RB1 for retinoblastoma. In conclusion, the development of new diagnostic tests will permit a more accurate assessment of risk in individuals who have not so far shown any sign or symptom of the disease.",

The mechanism of hsp-dependent cellular immunity has been attributed to a variety of immunological activities mediated by hsp. Hsp have been shown to bind antigenic peptides, trim the bound peptides by intrinsic enzymatic activity, improve endocytosis of the chaperoned peptides by APCs, and enhance the ability of APCs to stimulate peptide-specific T cells. We have investigated the potential capacity of hsp70 and gp96 to function as a mediator for Ag-specific CTL stimulation in an in vitro model for human melanoma. Repetitive stimulation of PBLs by autologous DCs loaded with melanoma-derived hsp did not increase the frequency of T cells directed against immunodominant peptides of melanoma-associated Ags Melan-A and tyrosinase. In contrast, repeated T cell stimulation with peptide-pulsed DCs enhanced the number of peptide-specific T cells, allowing HLA/peptide multimer-guided T cell cloning. We succeeded in demonstrating that the established HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones recognized HLA-A2(+) APCs exogenously loaded with the respective melanoma peptide as well as melanoma cells processing and presenting these peptides in the context of HLA-A2. We were not able to show that these melanoma-reactive CTL clones were stimulated by autologous dendritic cells pulsed with melanoma-derived hsp.

Autoantibody responses to these MAA have been shown to react with melanoma cells and melanocytes, and suggested to play a role in controlling melanoma progression. To assess antibody responses to potential melanoma/melanocyte autoantigens, the open-reading frame sequences of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, TRP-2, and melanoma-associated glycoprotein antigen family (gp100/pmel17) genes were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli. Purified recombinant antigens were employed to detect antibodies in sera of melanoma patients and normal healthy donors. By affinity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting, all recombinant antigens were shown to be antigenic. The main subclass of antibody response to these antigens was IgG. Most importantly this study demonstrated anti-TRP-2 and anti-gp100/pmel17 IgG responses in melanoma patients. Only one of 23 normal donors had an antibody response to the antigens tested. MAA-specific IgG antibodies in sera were assessed in melanoma patients (n = 23) pre- and post-polyvalent melanoma cell vaccine treatment. Polyvalent melanoma cell vaccine treatment enhanced anti-MAA antibody responses; however, only anti-TRP-2 and anti-gp100/pmel17 antibody response was enhanced.

The human homologue of PLA2G2A has been mapped to chromosome 1p36, a region frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma, colon cancer and melanoma. We identified 2 alterations in the PLA2G2A gene in a single neuroblastoma cell line out of 20 examined; however, we found no mutations in 24 melanoma cell lines, 12 lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients having chromosome 1-linked familial melanoma and 10 colon cancer cell lines.

Enzyme from the melanotic melanoma tissue contains bound calcium showing classical sigmoidal allosteric kinetics, whereas enzyme from the amelanotic melanoma yielded normal Michaelis-Menten saturation with substrate. Calcium inhibition can be partially reversed by oxidized thioredoxin. 45Ca has been used to label the amelanotic melanoma enzyme in order to determine the number of calcium-binding sites. These isotope experiments yielded only one calcium-binding site per enzyme molecule. Enzyme labeled with 45Ca was dialyzed for 24 h without loss of radioactivity, but the addition of oxidized thioredoxin to this labeled enzyme caused 60% calcium exchange in 24 h. Comparative studies with Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase showed similar calcium inhibition as well as partial reactivation with oxidized thioredoxin. The enzyme from E. coli previously sequenced by others, showed considerable homology with the first EF-hands calcium-binding site of calmodulin. Detailed calcium-binding studies indicated that 10(-5) M of this fast exchange ion was sufficient to cause allosteric regulation in 10 min. This strong calcium-binding property could explain the allosteric nature of the thioredoxin reductase purified from human metastatic melanotic melanoma and its role in the regulation of melanin biosynthesis.",

All of these could promote tumor escapement of the host's immune surveillance system. We hypothesized that DC-targeted gene silencing of IDO would enhance antitumor immunity and thus restrain tumor growth. Mannose receptors are highly expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including DCs. In this study, we developed a novel APC-targeted small interfering RNA delivery system using mannosed liposomes (Man-lipo) with encapsulated IDO small interfering RNA (Man-lipo-siIDO), which preferentially knocked down IDO expression in draining lymph node and spleen of melanoma-bearing mice. Mice treated with Man-lipo-siIDO displayed a delayed time of onset of implanted murine melanomas, increased survival time, reduced tumor size, and increased reactivity of T cells from spleen and lymph nodes against melanoma antigens. The enhanced antitumor immunity may be linked to inhibition of apoptosis in CD8 and CD4 T cells as well as Treg cells in spleen and lymph nodes. This study is the first to demonstrate that Man-lipo-siIDO can preferentially targets APCs and efficiently silence IDO expression in vitro and in vivo; events expected to enhance antitumor immune reactions against melanoma xenografts. This study supports the hypothesis that Man-lipo-siIDO may possess the potential for development as an immune-targeting therapeutic anticancer agent. ",

With the exception of PALLD gene mutations, which explain only a very modest fraction of familial cases, the genetic basis of familial PC is still obscure. Here the literature was reviewed in order to list the known genes, environmental factors, and health conditions associated with PC or involved in the carcinogenesis of the pancreas. Most of the genes listed are responsible for various well-defined cancer syndromes, such as CDKN2A (familial atypical mole-multiple melanoma, FAMMM), the mismatch repair genes (Lynch Syndrome), TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), APC (familial adenomatous polyposis), and BRCA2 (breast-ovarian familial cancer), where PC is part of the cancer spectrum of the disease. In addition, in this review I ranked known/possible risk factors extending the analysis to the hereditary pancreatitis (HP), diabetes, or to specific environmental exposures such as smoking. It appears that these factors contribute strongly to only a small proportion of PC cases. Recent work has revealed new genes somatically mutated in PC, including alterations within the pathways of Wnt/Notch and DNA mismatch repair. These new insights will help to reveal new candidate genes for the susceptibility to this disease and to better ascertain the actual contribution of the familial forms.",

The deregulation or constitutive activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway may lead to cancer formation. This review focuses on the role of the Wnt/beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway in the melanocyte lineage, and more specifically, in melanoma. Several components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, such as APC, ICAT, LEF1 and beta-catenin are modified in melanoma tumors and cell lines, leading to activation of this signaling. A hallmark of the activation of this pathway is the presence of beta-catenin in the nucleus. Indeed, beta-catenin is found in about 30% of human melanoma nuclei, indicating a potentially specific role for this signaling pathway in this aggressive type of cancer. Beta-catenin can induce ubiquitous genes such as myc or cyclinD1, cell lineage-restricted genes such as Brn2 and melanocyte-specific genes such as Mitf-M and Dct. The Mitf-M and Brn-2 genes encode transcription factors. Mitf plays a critical role in melanocyte survival, proliferation and differentiation. Brn-2 is involved in melanoma proliferation. Determining how the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, alone or with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities represents a major challenge in research into melanoma formation and tumor progression.",

Numerous reports have suggested that melanocytic neoplasms, including cutaneous melanomas, frequently demonstrate low frequency MSI, whilst a small number of tumours exhibit high frequency MSI. Furthermore, loss of expression of DNA mismatch repair proteins has been associated with progression from benign to malignant disease in melanocytic neoplasms, but the presence or absence of mismatch repair defects in uveal melanomas has yet to be determined. This study was designed to establish whether MSI is a feature of these ocular melanomas. To investigate the prevalence of MSI in uveal melanomas, 52 tumours were analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a panel of microsatellite markers selected for their ability to detect tumours exhibiting defects in DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. MSI was rarely detected in the 52 uveal melanomas analysed. All tumours demonstrated stable microsatellites at five of the six microsatellite markers tested (BAT26, BAT40, APC, D2S123 and Mfd15CA). Only one tumour showed the presence of a single unstable allele at a tetranucleotide marker (MYCL1).

Immunohistochemical analysis of melanomas with T311 showed tyrosinase in melanotic and amelanotic variants, and tyrosinase expression correlated with the presence of tyrosinase mRNA. Melanocytes in skin stained with T311, whereas other normal tissues tested were negative. The expression pattern of three melanosome-associated proteins--tyrosinase, TRP-1(gp75), and gp100--in melanoma was also compared. Tyrosinase and gp100 are expressed in a higher percentage of melanomas than TRP-1(gp75), and the expression of these three antigens was discordant. Tyrosinase expression within individual tumor specimen is usually homogenous, distinctly different from the commonly observed heterogeneous pattern of gp100 expression.",

Here we investigated the shuttle function of the HSP gp96 (glycoprotein 96) for a human melanoma peptide antigen MART-1 that was noncovalently bound to gp96 in vitro. This in vitro complexing reaction was optimized using the radioiodinated MART-1 peptide and human gp96. Up to 20% of gp96 molecules could bind the peptide, assuming a 1:1 molar ratio. The binding was temperature-dependent and thus reversible. At -20 degrees C, 95% of the peptide remained complexed after 24 h, but 25% and 60% of the peptide dissociated at 37 degrees C within 6 and 24 h, respectively. This observation suggests that under the physiological conditions in APCs, spontaneous peptide dissociation from gp96 complexes may facilitate the delivery of peptide antigen into antigen presentation pathways. The gp96/MART-1 complexes stimulated an HLA A2-restricted MART-1-specific CTL clone dependent on the amount of complexed peptide and the presence of HLA-A2-positive APCs. The reaction was peptide-specific and could be blocked by an excess of untreated native gp96. These results show for the first time that peptide antigens from in vitro reconstituted gp96/peptide antigen complexes can be cross-presented by human APCs. These findings extend the scientific basis for further evaluating the use of either endogenous or in vitro reconstituted gp96/tumor-antigen complexes as tumor vaccines.",

Previously, we have demonstrated that trogocytosis also takes place between melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and their cognate tumors. In the present study, we took this finding a step further, focusing on the ability of melanoma membrane-imprinted CD8+ T cells to act as APCs (CD8+ T-APCs). We demonstrate that, following trogocytosis, CD8+ T-APCs directly present a variety of melanoma derived peptides to fraternal T cells with the same TCR specificity or to T cells with different TCRs. The resulting T cell-T cell immune synapse leads to (1) Activation of effector CTLs, as determined by proliferation, cytokine secretion and degranulation; (2) Fratricide (killing) of CD8+ T-APCs by the activated CTLs. Thus, trogocytosis enables cross-reactivity among CD8+ T cells with interchanging roles of effectors and APCs. This dual function of tumor-reactive CTLs may hint at their ability to amplify or restrict reactivity against the tumor and participate in modulation of the anti-cancer immune response.",

Th35-1A produces IFN-gamma (a Th1-type cytokine) after autologous tumor cell stimulation, and its proliferative reactivity is HLA class II-restricted. Th cells showed helper activity for PWM responses of PBMCs. Using a panel of HLA class II-matched and unmatched EBV-B cells as APCs and allogeneic melanoma tumor cell lysate as stimulant, DR7 was delineated as the HLA class II restriction element used by the Th cell clone. In agreement with these results, transfection of an allogeneic melanoma cell line with HLA-DR7 isolated from autologous EBV-B cells rendered the cell line stimulatory for Th35-1A cells. Specificity studies using autologous EBV-B cells (EBV-B35) pulsed with a panel of allogeneic tumor cell lysates of various tissue origins indicated that the Th cell clone recognizes an antigen shared by melanoma and glioma cells.

Several melanoma-associated tumor antigens have been identified. These antigens are suitable candidates for a vaccination therapy of melanoma. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) specialized for the induction of a primary T-cell response. Mouse studies have demonstrated the potent capacity of DCs to induce antitumor immunity. In the present clinical pilot study, DCs were generated in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) and were pulsed with tumor lysate or a cocktail of peptides known to be recognized by CTLs, depending on the patient's HLA haplotype. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was added as a CD4 helper antigen and immunological tracer molecule. Sixteen patients with advanced melanoma were immunized on an outpatient basis. Vaccination was well tolerated. No physical sign of autoimmunity was detected in any of the patients. DC vaccination induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivity toward KLH in all patients, as well as a positive DTH reaction to peptide-pulsed DCs in 11 patients. Recruitment of peptide-specific CTLs to the DTH challenge site was also demonstrated. Therefore, antigen-specific immunity was induced during DC vaccination. Objective responses were evident in 5 out of 16 evaluated patients (two complete responses, three partial responses) with regression of metastases in various organs (skin, soft tissue, lung, pancreas) and one additional minor response. These data indicate that vaccination with autologous DCs generated from peripheral blood is a safe and promising approach in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Cell lines established from \"biologically early\" lesions of malignant melanoma were able to present the soluble Ag tetanus toxoid (TT) to autologous and HLA-DR-matched allogeneic, TT-immune T cell clones. Proliferation of T cell clones in response to Ag presented by primary melanoma peaked on day 2 of culture with Ag. Ag presentation was blocked by pretreatment of TT-pulsed and fixed melanoma cells with mAb against HLA-DR, but not HLA-DQ, HLA-DP, or HLA-ABC. Ag processing and presentation were inhibited by treating the melanoma cells with ammonium chloride. In parallel with previous findings from this laboratory demonstrating the inability of cell lines cultured from \"advanced\" primary or metastatic melanoma to induce autologous T cell proliferation, such cell lines also failed to present this exogenous Ag despite the presence of cell-surface HLA-class II molecules. Thus, in contrast to the finding in biologically early melanoma, none of the multiple TT-immune, T cell clones from autologous patients or HLA-DR matched donors was able to respond to TT presented by melanoma cells cultured from advanced disease. Co-incubation studies revealed that metastatic melanoma cells did not secrete inhibitory substances during the APC assay, however, they were able to process TT, rendering it \"immunogenic\" in the presence of fixed, autologous non-T cells. When fixed, autologous melanoma cells were assayed for their ability to present processed Ag; fixed cells of early but not advanced disease were able to present Ag in this setting, indicating that the presenting limb becomes flawed in the evolution of the metastatic phenotype. Finally, studies of chloroquine inhibition of the capacity of melanoma cells derived from early primary disease to stimulate autologous peripheral blood T cells suggest that such cells process and present tumor-associated Ag in the same fashion as the \"model\" Ag TT.",

In this study, we assessed the role of EBI-3 in a model of lung melanoma metastasis. Intravenous injection of the B16-F10 cell line resulted in a significant reduction of lung tumor metastasis in EBI-3(-/-) recipient mice compared with wild-type mice. The immunological finding accompanying this effect was the expansion of a newly described cell subset called IFN-gamma producing killer dendritic cells associated with CD8(+) T cell responses in the lung of EBI-3(-/-) mice including IFN-gamma release and TNF-alpha-induced programmed tumor cell death. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells as well as targeting T-bet abrogated the protective effects of EBI-3 deficiency on lung melanoma metastases. Finally, adoptive transfer of EBI-3(-/-) CD8(+) T cells into tumor bearing wild-type mice inhibited lung metastasis in recipient mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that targeting EBI-3 leads to a T-bet-mediated antitumor CD8(+) T cell responses in the lung.",

A total of eight kinds of proteins were identified by 2DE/LC-MS-MS. One of them, p38 kinase, was selected for further investigation of its involvement in the anti-proliferative effect of RADD on melanoma cells. Phosphorylation of p38 kinase in melanoma cells was detected upon treatment with RADD. Furthermore, the suppression of p38 kinase activity resulted in a decrease in the RADD inhibitory effect on melanoma cell proliferation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) from melanoma patients to take up gp100 protein and stimulate specific autologous CTL. The gp100 used in this study was a recombinant molecule with diminished hydrophobicity, HR-gp100, produced in Escherichia coli bacteria and in Pichia pastoris yeast. Stimulation of CD8+ T cells from melanoma patients with HR-gp100-loaded DC was visualized by confocal microscopy using stained target cells, and was quantitatively measured by the production of IFN-gamma using an ELISPOT assay. The results showed that HR-gp100 protein, produced either in bacteria or in yeast, when loaded on DC from melanoma patients, stimulated autologous CD8+ lymphocytes. By direct visualization, these lymphocytes were found in close contact with dead melanoma cells, and to contain membrane material transferred from stained melanoma cells; in cultures containing control lymphocytes stimulated with unloaded DC, no melanoma cell killing was observed. In ELISPOT assays, increased number of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T lymphocytes from patients, but not from healthy controls, were measured upon stimulation with HR-gp100-loaded DC. HR-gp100 could represent a useful tool to load DC with multiple immunogenic epitopes/antigen-derived epitopes for the immunotherapy of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The vertical growth stage is the most dangerous stage of melanoma and is often associated with a poor prognosis. The increased invasiveness and metastasis that is typical for vertically growing melanoma are mediated by the molecules of cell adhesion (particularly, integrins). Integrin αvβ3, which is abundantly expressed on melanoma cells with high metastatic potentials and is characterized by low expression levels in normal melanocytes, is potentially an attractive target for melanoma diagnostics and therapy. Integrin αvβ3 is known to recognize the arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) sequence, which has been found in a wide variety of its natural ligands. Here expression vectors bearing the genes of fusion proteins have been constructed for producing these proteins in Escherichia coli. Such fusion proteins consist of a peptidic 'address,' targeting the integrins on melanoma cells, linked to an 'adaptor' for the attachment of a diagnostic or toxic agent. The peptidic 'address' contains the RGD motif, which is stabilized by a disulfide bond to achieve the optimal receptor binding conformation. The 'adaptor' is a tetrameric protein, namely, streptavidin, that is able to achieve high-affinity binding of d-biotin (K(d) = 10(-15) M) and confer avidity to the address peptide. This binding ability facilitates the generation of anti-melanoma diagnostic and therapeutic agents using the appropriate biotin derivatives. These recombinant proteins were purified from the periplasm of E.coli using columns with 2-iminobiotin agarose and demonstrated an ability to adhere to the surface of murine and human melanoma cells.",

Thirty-two studies were identified. Surveillance for most hereditary cancers was associated with good psychological outcomes. However, surveillance of individuals at high risk for developing multiple tumors appeared to be associated with increased distress and a lower quality of life.

In contrast with professional APCs such as B cells, class II-positive human melanomas expressed relatively little to no GILT protein or mRNA. Tumor cell GILT expression was partially restored with IFN-gamma treatment but unlike other genes required for class II Ag presentation, GILT was not regulated by CIITA.

The tyrosinase promoter, alone and in combination with a single, or a dual, tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer, was used to regulate expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Transient transfections of these tissue-specific luciferase constructs in human and murine melanoma (Pmel, B16mel) and colon carcinoma (WiDr, MC38) cell lines resulted in melanoma-specific luciferase expression that was amplified 5- and 500-fold with the addition of a single or double enhancer, respectively, to the tyrosinase promoter. When the double enhancer-promoter construct expressed the highly toxic Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, transfection of the same cell lines followed by administration of the prodrug 6-methyl purine deoxyriboside (6-MPDR) at a concentration of 50 microM caused melanoma-specific in vitro cell killing. Within 5 days after prodrug administration methylthiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity assays showed that only 15 and 9% of Pmel and B16mel cells, respectively, remained viable compared with controls. This effect was highly specific, as 90 and 96% of WiDr and MC38 colon carcinoma cells remained viable 5 days after identical treatment. This effect was a direct result of increased tissue-specific conversion of 6-MPDR to the toxic metabolite 6-methylpurine (6-MP), as documented by HPLC analysis of culture supernatants. These results show that the dual tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer provides powerful amplification of the transcriptional targeting of gene expression afforded by use of the tyrosinase promoter. This amplification translates into increased, highly specific cytotoxicity to melanoma by the PNP/6-MPDR enzyme/prodrug system and, therefore, has potential efficacy in the use of gene therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",

The correlation of MGMT expression levels with clinical response to chemotherapy was investigated in 79 patients with metastatic melanoma. There was an inverse relationship between MGMT expression and clinical response to DTIC-based chemotherapy (P=0.05). Polymorphisms in the coding region of the MGMT gene were also investigated in tumours from 52 melanoma patients by PCR/SSCP and nucleotide sequence analyses. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 3 (L53L and L84F) and in exon 5 (I143V/K178R) were identified. There were no differences in the frequencies of these polymorphisms between these melanoma patients and patients with familial melanoma or healthy Swedish individuals. Functional analysis of variants MGMT-I143V and -I143V/K178R was performed by in vitro mutagenesis in Escherichia coli.

Here, we compare the expression of this and related molecules in the two major tissue phenotypes, epithelial and mesenchymal, the latter including normal avian and mammalian fibroblasts and malignant human uveal melanoma cells. Previously, it was proposed that src initiates EMT by tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin/catenin complex resulting in a negative effect on epithelial gene expression. On the contrary, we found that although beta-catenin becomes diffuse in the cytoplasm during embryonic EMT, the cytoplasmic beta-catenin of the embryonic and adult mesenchymal cells we examined is not tyrosine phosphorylated. Pervanadate experiments indicate that cytoplasmic PTPases maintain this dephosphorylation. GSK-3beta is present, but little or no APC occurs in normal and neoplastic mesenchymal cells. The function of the nonphosphorylated cytoplasmic beta-catenin in mesenchyme may be related to invasive motility.

Vaccination with tumor-derived hsp96 induces CD8(+) T cell-mediated tumor regressions in different animal models. In this study, we show that hsp96 purified from human melanoma or colon carcinoma activate tumor- and Ag-specific T cells in vitro and expand them in vivo. HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T cells recognizing Ags expressed in human melanoma (melanoma Ag recognized by T cell-1 (MART-1)/melanoma Ag A (Melan-A)) or colon carcinoma (carcinoembryonic Ag (CEA)/epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)) were triggered to release IFN-gamma and to mediate cytotoxic activity by HLA-A*0201-matched APCs pulsed with hsp96 purified from tumor cells expressing the relevant Ag. Such activation occurred in class I HLA-restricted fashion and appeared to be significantly higher than that achieved by direct peptide loading. Immunization with autologous tumor-derived hsp96 induced a significant increase in the recognition of MART-1/Melan-A(27-35) in three of five HLA-A*0201 melanoma patients, and of CEA(571-579) and EpCAM(263-271) in two of five HLA-A*0201 colon carcinoma patients, respectively, as detected by ELISPOT and HLA/tetramer staining. These increments in Ag-specific T cell responses were associated with a favorable disease course after hsp96 vaccination. Altogether, these data provide evidence that hsp96 derived from human tumors can present antigenic peptides to CD8(+) T cells and activate them both in vitro and in vivo, thus representing an important tool for vaccination in cancer patients.",

This study describes the construction and properties of the chimeric modular recombinant transporters (MRTs) expressed in Escherichia coli and used for PS targeting. These constructs include (1) the alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone as a ligand module, which is internalized by the target cells (mouse melanoma); (2) the optimized SV40 large T-antigen nuclear localization signal; (3) the hemoglobin-like protein from E. coli as a carrier module; (4) the endosomolytic module, the translocation domain of the diphtheria toxin. These MRTs were used for PS targeting to the mouse melanoma cell nuclei, the most PS-damaged intracellular compartment, which resulted in a PS photocytotoxic effect increase of several orders of magnitude.

        "Doc_abstract":"A major prerequisite for the success of tumor vaccines is their effective uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and transport of these APCs to the draining lymph nodes, where the processed and presented tumor-associated antigens activate tumor-specific naive T cells. We previously suggested that the immunogenicity of autologus tumor vaccines in humans may be augmented by engineering vaccinating tumor cell membranes to express alpha-galactosyl (alpha-gal) epitopes (i.e., Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc-R). Subsequent in situ binding of natural anti-Gal IgG molecules to these epitopes would result in the formation of immune complexes that target tumor vaccines for uptake by APCs, via the interaction of the Fc portion of anti-Gal with Fcgamma receptors on APCs. This hypothesis was tested in a unique experimental animal model of knockout mice for alpha1,3galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT) and the mouse melanoma B16-BL6 (referred to here as BL6). Like humans, these mice lack alpha-gal epitopes and produce anti-GaL BL6 melanoma cels are highly tumorigenic, and like human tumor cells, they lack alpha-gal epitopes. Expression of alpha-gal epitopes on these melanoma cells was achieved by stable transfection with alpha,3GT cDNA. The transfected melanoma cells (termed BL6alphaGT) express approximately 2 x 10(6) alpha-gal epitopes per cell and readily form immune complexes with anti-Gal. Vaccination of the mice with 2 x 10(6) irradiated melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes, followed by challenge with 0.5 x 10(6) live parental melanoma cells, resulted in protection for at least 2 months (i.e, no tumor growth) in one-third of the mice, whereas all mice immunized with irradiated parental melanoma cells developed tumors 21-26 days post-challenge. The proportion of protected mice doubled when the mice were immunized twice with irradiated melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes and challenged with 0.2 x 10(6) live BL6 cells. Histological studies on the developing tumors in challenged mice that were immunized with melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes demonstrated extensive infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages, whereas no mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in tumors of mice immunized with parental tumor cells. Overall, these studies imply that immunization of alpha1,3GT knockout mice with BL6 melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes elicits, in a proportion of the population, protective immune response against the same tumor lacking such epitopes. These studies further suggest that similar immunization of cancer patients with autologous tumor vaccines that are engineered to express alpha-gal epitopes may increase the immune response to autologous tumor-associated antigens and, thus, may elicit immune-mediated destruction of metastatic cells expressing these antigens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anti-tumor vaccines capable of activating both CD4 and CD8 T cells are preferred for long lasting T cell responses. Induction of a tumor-specific T-cell response can be induced by tumor vaccines that target innate immunity. The ensuing T-cell response depends on efficient antigen presentation from phagocytosed cargo in the antigen presenting cell and is augmented by the presence of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands within the cargo. Biodegradable polymers are useful for vaccine delivery in that they are phagocytosed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and could potentially be loaded with both the antigen and immune stimulatory TLR agents. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) polymer particles loaded with antigenic tumor lysate and immune stimulatory CpG oligonucleotides on induction of tumor specific immunity in a mouse model of melanoma. We found that after delivery, these immune stimulatory antigen loaded particles (ISAPs) efficiently activated APCs and were incorporated into lysosomal compartments of macrophages and dendritic cells. ISAP vaccination resulted in remarkable T cell proliferation, but only modestly suppressed tumor growth of established melanoma. Due to this discordant effect on tumor immunity we evaluated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) and found that ISAP vaccination or tumor growth alone induced prolific expansion of tumor specific Treg. When the Treg compartment was suppressed with anti-CD25 antibody, ISAP vaccination induced complete antigen-specific immunity in a prophylactic model. ISAP vaccination is a novel tumor vaccine strategy that is designed to co-load the antigen with a TLR agonist enabling efficient Ag presentation. Targeting of T-reg expansion during vaccination may be necessary for inducing effective tumor-specific immunity.",

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed by multiple tumors, and its interaction with PD-1 resulted in tumor escape in experimental models. To investigate the role of PD-1 in impairing spontaneous tumor Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells in melanoma patients, we have examined the effect of PD-1 expression on ex vivo detectable CD8(+) T cells specific to the tumor Ag NY-ESO-1. In contrast to EBV, influenza, or Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD8(+) T cells, NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells up-regulated PD-1 expression. PD-1 up-regulation on spontaneous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells occurs along with T cell activation and is not directly associated with an inability to produce cytokines. Importantly, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in combination with prolonged Ag stimulation with PD-L1(+) APCs or melanoma cells augmented the number of cytokine-producing, proliferating, and total NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells. Collectively, our findings support the role of PD-1 as a regulator of NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cell expansion in the context of chronic Ag stimulation. They further support the use of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade in cancer patients to partially restore NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cell numbers and functions, increasing the likelihood of tumor regression.",

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

When expressing GM-CSF, haptenized M3 melanoma cells were also able to induce a contact hypersensitivity response but, in contrast to bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, not only in syngeneic but also in allogeneic recipients. This argues for a critical role of host APC. To identify their nature, we introduced the beta-galactosidase (betagal) gene into M3-GM cells. Their administration activated betagal-specific, L(d)-restricted CTL in syngeneic BALB/c mice. Evaluation of lymph nodes draining M3-GM-betagal injection sites revealed the presence of cells presenting the respective L(d)-binding betagal peptide epitope.

More recently, following the fortuitous discovery that nifurtimox was clinically active against neuroblastoma, nitrofuran compounds are being investigated for activity against cancer. Herein, we show that nitrofuran compounds are similarly potent to human malignant melanoma and neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, a recently discovered nitrofuran compound, NFN1, was 50- to 175-fold more potent than nifurtimox against human melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. As nitrofuran compounds are known to act as pro-drugs, producing DNA-damaging reactive intermediates upon activation, we investigated the DNA repair pathways involved. We show that, contrary to research in Escherichia coli, the Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway is not required to repair nitrofuran-induced DNA damage in mammalian cells. Instead, we show that inhibiting repair of single-strand DNA breaks with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, Olaparib, enhances nitrofuran toxicity in melanoma and neuroblastoma cells. We propose that this is due to mammalian cells utilising Type 2 nitroreductases for nitrofuran activation producing Reactive Oxygen Species which cause DNA damage that is repaired by the Single Strand Break Repair and/or Base Excision Repair pathways, whereas in bacteria and trypanosomes, Type 1 nitroreductases are also utilised resulting in different DNA lesions. In addition we show that, consistent with Reactive Oxygen Species being formed upon nitrofuran activation and the ability of melanin to absorb Reactive Oxygen Species, production of melanin in melanoma cells offers some protection from NFN1- and hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity. Our data suggest that combinations of Olaparib and nitrofuran compounds may be advantageous for the treatment of melanoma and neuroblastoma, but that the protection offered to melanoma cells by their melanin pigment must be taken into account.

To enhance the immunogenicity of GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell vaccines, a novel approach expressing GM-CSF as a membrane-bound form (mbGM-CSF) on the tumor cell surface was investigated. The intent was to enhance antigen presentation by increasing interactions between the tumor cell lines in the vaccine and GM-CSF receptor positive antigen presenting cells (APC), notably the patient's Langerhans cells residing within the intradermal injection site. B16.F10 cells engineered to express either membrane-bound or secreted GM-CSF were compared in the B16.F10 mouse melanoma model. We observed that mbGM-CSF on the tumor cell surface retarded growth and induced protective immunity to subsequent wild-type tumor challenge more effectively than tumor cells secreting GM-CSF. Vaccination with irradiated mbGM-CSF B16.F10 also provided strong protection from wild-type tumor challenge, improved therapeutic effects against established tumors, and retarded lung metastases. These results demonstrate that mbGM-CSF B16.F10 cells can induce strong systemic immunity that protects against and therapeutically treats B16.F10 melanoma more effectively than analogous vaccines containing only secreted GM-CSF. These data warrant further development and clinical testing of mbGM-CSF tumor cell vaccines.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer immunotherapy centers on modulating the host's tumor-directed immune response. One promising approach involves augmentation of cell-mediated immunity by interrupting T-cell pathways responsible for immune down-regulation or tolerance. The discovery of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and its role as a key negative regulator for T cells has prompted efforts to target this signaling molecule to improve cancer therapy. Activation, or 'priming', of naive T cells in response to tumor-cell invasion comprises a dual-signaling mechanism. Signal 1 requires tumor-associated antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor, while signal 2 occurs through binding of CD80 or CD86 (B7.1 of 2) on the antigen presenting cell (APC) with CD28 on the T cell. Importantly, there is a final step responsible for naturally occurring immune regulation; this occurs in response to competitive binding of CD80/CD86 on the APC by CTLA-4 on the T cell. This 'immune checkpoint' interrupts signal 2 and inhibits the activated T cell. Targeting CTLA-4 as an anticancer strategy: Following proof-of-concept studies in animals, fully human anti-CTLA-4 antibodies were developed and 2 are undergoing clinical evaluation. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab have shown promising antitumor activity, initially in patients with advanced melanoma. Class-specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were common and mostly transient and/or manageable. These events are thought to be mechanism-of-action-related, indicating immune tolerance is broken; this relation may also explain the association between irAEs and response seen in several trials. Interruption of immune inhibitory pathways via CTLA-4 blockade appears to be a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

This cell line expresses both HLA class I and class II antigens, as well as several important accessory molecules at high levels. FM3 cells were shown to function as a stimulator of both allogeneic as well as autologous mixed lymphocyte tumour cell culture (MLTC). From these autologous MLTC we were able to generate cytotoxic T cell clones indicating that FM3 is capable of processing and presenting endogenous antigens. We have used this cell line in a model system to investigate whether these cells were able to initiate and support an immune response with specificity for selected peptide antigens. The FM3 cell line was capable of presenting a HLA-DQ7 restricted ras derived peptide (5-21, 13Gly- >Asp) to a previously established T cell clone, RM70. The ability of FM3 to function as an antigen presenting cell (APC) was comparable to that of an autologous Epstein Barr virus (EBV) transformed B cell line. The CD4+ T cell clone RM70 showed a peptide-specific anti-proliferative effect on FM3 cells. This growth inhibition was not due to cytotoxicity as measured in a standard 4 h chromium release assay. The FM3 cell line also presented a HLA-A2 restricted nonapeptide derived from the influenza matrix protein, M1(58-66) to a CD8+ T cell line specific for this peptide. This resulted in an effective killing of the melanoma cells.

The opportunity to detect pancreatic cancer while it is still curable is dependent on our ability to identify and screen high-risk populations before their symptoms arise. Risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer include multiple genetic syndromes as well as modifiable risk factors. Genetic conditions include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch Syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and ataxia-telangiectasia; having a genetic predisposition can raise the risk of developing pancreatic cancer up to 132-fold over the general population. Modifiable risk factors, which include tobacco exposure, alcohol use, chronic pancreatitis, diet, obesity, diabetes mellitus, as well as certain abdominal surgeries and infections, have also been shown to increase the risk of pancreatic cancer development. Several large-volume centers have initiated such screening protocols, and consensus-based guidelines for screening high-risk groups have recently been published.

This suggests that domains exist on the stress protein for each function. In this study, we determine the ability of grp170 and its structural domains to (a) bind to and present melanoma-associated antigen gp100 to the immune system and (b) to bind to receptors on APCs. A direct correlation between chaperone function, binding to APCs in a receptor-like manner, and antitumor immunity was observed. Two mutants that share no common sequence, yet are both effective in their antitumor activities, compete with one another for APC binding. Studies of other members of the hsp70 superfamily, hsp110 and hsp70, or their domain deletion mutants, further confirmed that APC binding segregates with chaperoning function and not sequence. Therefore, these studies suggest that molecular chaperoning is involved in stress protein interactions with APCs, antigen binding, and in eliciting antitumor immunity, thus bridging this ancient function of stress proteins in prokaryotes to their ability to elicit immunity in higher organisms.",

Functional evaluation of the clones showed that the percentage of trogocytosis-capable T cells closely paralleled each clone's IFN-γ and TNF-α production, lysosome degranulation, and lysis of peptide-pulsed targets and unmodified melanoma. The highly cytotoxic 2E2 clone displayed the highest TCR peptide binding affinity, whereas the low-activity 2D11 clone showed TCR binding to peptide-MHC in a CD8-dependent manner. TCR analysis revealed Vβ16 for clones 2E2 and 2G1 and Vβ14 for 2D11. When peptide-affinity differences were bypassed by nonspecific TCR stimulation, clones 2E2 and 2D11 still manifested distinctive signaling patterns. The high-activity 2E2 clone displayed prolonged phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, an integrator of MAPK and AKT activation, whereas the low-activity 2D11 clone generated shorter and weaker phosphorylation. Screening the two clones with identical TCR Vβ by immunoreceptor array showed higher phosphorylation of NK, T, and B cell Ag (NTB-A), a SLAM family homophilic receptor, in clone 2E2 compared with 2G1. Specific blocking of NTB-A on APCs markedly reduced cytokine production by CD8 lymphocytes, pointing to a possible contribution of NTB-A costimulation to T cell functional diversity.

We studied the role of costimulation of tumor-reactive T cells by B7 in the immune destruction of the K1735-M2 mouse melanoma into which the gene encoding the human melanoma-associated Ag, p97, had been transfected. Previous work has demonstrated that the p97 transfectant cl62 is immunogenic but still grows progressively in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice and that adoptive transfer of p97-specific CD4+ T cells can induce the regression of small established cl62 tumors metastatic to the lungs. We have now shown that expression of B7 in cl62 after retroviral-mediated gene transfer eliminated its ability to grow in immunocompetent mice but not in T cell-deficient nude mice. Mice immunized with B7-transduced p97+ cells had an increased activity of both CD4+ T cells, which could proliferate in response to the p97 Ag, and CD8+ CTL, which could lyse a broad spectrum of cultured syngeneic p97+ and p97- tumor lines but not allogeneic tumor lines or syngeneic lymphoblasts. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were required for tumor rejection, and the depletion of CD4+ T cells in vivo decreased the tumoricidal activity of CD8+ CTL. Treatment of mice bearing an 8-day established s.c. cl62 melanoma by i.p. injection of B7+ cells from 2A, a highly immunogenic p97 transfectant, resulted in complete tumor regression and cure, injection of B7- 2A cells did not. The therapeutic effect was specific for the cl62 tumor. Our results demonstrate that costimulation by B7 can amplify both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against small tumors toward therapeutic benefit.",

In the current study, we firstly aimed to investigate the in vivo maturation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) at the molecular level by following the expression of CD11c, CD86 and MyD88 genes in the mixture of mononuclear cells after treatment of mice with a tumor vaccine composed of C-class CpG oligodeoxynucletides (CpG ODN) and irradiated melanoma B16F1 tumor cells. The second objective was to define whether the tumor vaccine induces generation of memory T cells (CD44hiCD62Llo/hiCD27hi). Finally, based on gene expression pattern we aimed to determine the tissue distribution and homing of the (mature) APCs and memory cells after vaccination. We demonstrated that by tumor vaccine the APCs (including DCs) are manipulated in vivo. By this kind of vaccine, the differentiation and maturation of APCs is triggered primarily in the spleen and is subsequently followed by the migration of these APCs to the bone marrow. Once in the bone marrow, these APCs play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of long-lived memory T cells capable of preventing a relapse of malignant disease. In conclusion, our results provide insight into the nature and scope of the antitumor immune response elicited by this kind of tumor vaccine in vivo.

It has very recently become evident that TCFs interact with the vertebrate WNT effector beta-catenin to mediate axis formation in Xenopus. Likewise, Armadillo (the Drosophila ortholog of beta-catenin) is genetically upstream of a Drosophila TCF in the Wingless pathway. Upon Wingless/Wnt signaling, Armadillo/beta-catenin associate with nuclear TCFs and contribute a trans-activation domain to the resulting bipartite transcription factor. The cytoplasmic tumor-suppressor protein APC binds to beta-catenin causing its destruction. In APC-deficient colon carcinoma cells, beta-catenin accumulates and is constitutively complexed with TCF factors. In APC-positive colon carcinomas and melanomas, dominant mutations in beta-catenin render it indestructable, providing an alternative mechanism to activate transcription of TCF target genes inappropriately. So, transcriptional activation of TCF target genes by beta-catenin appears to be a central event in development and cellular transformation.",

BRAF(V600E) induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAF(V600E). Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAF(V600E) stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAF(V600E) signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAF(V600E) signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis.

In addition, no suppressive effect of plasma d30 was observed when antigen was added as a class II peptide, thus suggesting that the impaired proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of plasma d30 was due to a dysfunction of antigen uptake/processing by APC. Furthermore, dissociation between IgG and TGF- resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity of plasma d30.

SLNs and NSLNs were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or FACS, with counterstaining for leukocyte cell surface markers.;Both radiotracers were effective. Cultured APCs rapidly took up FITC-HSA. Microscopy showed FITC-HSA in the subcapsular sinus of SLNs shortly after injection and subsequent distribution to interfollicular areas. FACS revealed increasing amounts of FITC-HSA in SLNs over time. Cells responsible for uptake were APCs, expressing major histocompatibility (locus) class II.;This report establishes active macromolecule uptake as a mechanism that determines SLN status. This mechanism has important implications for performing SLN biopsy.",

To evaluate the efficacy with which a recombinant tumor-associated protein can induce antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells, we stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with melanoma in vitro with the purified melanoma antigen gp100 produced in Escherichia coli. In preliminary experiments, we observed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells could process and present known HLA-DRbeta1*0401 and HLA-DRbeta1*0701 restricted epitopes to gp100-reactive CD4+ T cell lines after being loaded exogenously with protein. Therefore, we used autologous protein-loaded peripheral blood mononuclear cells as antigen presenting cells. From four of nine patients who expressed both HLA-DRbeta1*0401 and HLA-DRbeta1*0701, we raised five gp100-reactive CD4+ T cell populations that secreted TH1 type cytokines in response to exogenously loaded protein as well as target cells that endogenously expressed gp100 and MHC class II molecules, including transfectants and melanoma cells. Four of the five cultures specifically recognized the known HLA-DRbeta1*0401 and HLA-DRbeta1*0701 restricted epitopes gp100:44-59 and gp100:170-190, respectively. The fifth culture, and 30 T cell clones derived from it, specifically recognized a new peptide, gp100:420-435, in the context of HLA-DRbeta1*0701.

Structurally, MGSA belongs to a superfamily of proteins that includes interleukin-8 (IL-8) and platelet factor 4. These proteins are involved in inflammatory processes, and an understanding of their mechanism of action should provide insight into their pathophysiology. In this study, we report the high level expression of recombinant human MGSA in Escherichia coli. The structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. Receptor binding studies were carried out in a human melanoma cell line, Hs294T, and in U937 cells. Direct binding experiments with 125I-MGSA in Hs294T cells have allowed us to identify a novel MGSA receptor in these cells, with a KD of 3.9-4.25 nM and approximately 52,960-67,758 binding sites/cell. These MGSA-binding sites were specific and could not be displaced by unlabeled IL-8. The MGSA receptor in these cells is biologically active, and the addition of ligand induces cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In U937 cells, unlabeled IL-8 and MGSA were able to completely displace radiolabeled IL-8. Scatchard analysis of the displacement binding data was consistent with binding to a single class of binding sites, and the calculated KD values were 2.4 +/- 0.6 nM for IL-8 and 3.2 +/- 0.80 nM for MGSA. Treatment of U937 cells with IL-8 or MGSA produced a rapid increase in Ca2+ flux; however, subsequent incubation with either ligand failed to produce any further Ca2+ flux. The IL-8 receptor in U937 cells was covalently labeled with 125I-IL-8 to reveal a protein with a molecular mass of 69 kDa.",

Immunological studies of treated and control mice revealed that the antitumour activity of OM-174, alone or in combination with CY, is mediated by the stimulation of natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses as well as by a significant increase in the absolute number of NK1.1, CD4 and CD8 positive cells.

One common approach, which uses APC pulsed with synthetic peptides, can sometimes generate ineffective immune responses. This failure may, in part, be attributed to the formation of HLA/synthetic pulsed peptide complexes that possess different conformations compared with those of endogenously presented peptides. In addition, endogenous peptides may undergo post-translational modifications, which do not occur with synthetic peptides. Because our goal is to induce immunity that can recognize TAA that are endogenously presented by tumors, we designed an APC that would not only express the required immunoaccessory molecules but also naturally process and present target antigenic peptides. In this study, we generated an artificial APC (aAPC) that can endogenously present any chosen HLA-A*0201 (A2)-restricted peptide by processing a fusion protein that contains a unique \"LTK\" sequence linked to the antigenic peptide. Proteasome-dependent processing is so effective that the presented peptide can be directly eluted from the cell surface and identified by biochemical methods. Furthermore, we found that aAPC, engineered to endogenously present peptide derived from the melanoma antigen MART1, can be used to prime and expand antitumor CTL that target MART1-expressing tumor cells in a HLA-A2-restricted manner. Our engineered aAPC could serve as an \"off-the-shelf\" APC designed to constitutively express class I-restricted TAA peptides and could be used to generate effective T-cell responses to treat human disease.",

Some autonomous parvoviruses (H-1, minute virus of mice) and derived recombinant vectors are currently under preclinical evaluation. Still not fully understood, their antitumor properties involve more than just tumor cell killing. Because wild-type parvovirus-mediated tumor cell lysates (TCLs) may trigger antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to augment the host immune repertoire, we analyzed phagocytosis, maturation, and crosspresentation of H-1-induced TCLs by human dendritic cells (DCs). We first established H-1-mediated oncolysis in two HLA-A2(+) and A2(-) variant melanoma cell clones. Monocyte-derived immature DCs phagocytosed H- 1-infected TCLs as well as ultraviolet-induced apoptotic TCLs and better than freeze-thaw-induced necrotic TCLs. Immature DCs incubated with H-1-induced TCLs acquired specific maturation markers comparable to a standard cytokine cocktail. Furthermore, A2(+) DCs pulsed with H-1-infected A2(-) TCLs cross-presented melanoma antigens to specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and released proinflammatory cytokines. This shows for the first time that tumor cell killing by a wild-type oncolytic virus directly stimulates human APCs and CTLs. Because H-1-infected tumors enhance the immune repertoire, the clinical perspectives of parvoviral vectors are even more promising.",

Monocyte-derived APCs (MD-APCs) are then grown in the presence of exogenous target antigens (tumour cell debris, or apoptotic bodies) to become fully mature APCs. (2) Functionality for antigen presentation to T cells of ex vivo MD-APCs is evaluated in vivo. (3) Cellular vaccines are tested in selected rodent animal models. Efficiency and immune response are monitored in pertinent experimental systems for cancer. Pharmacological data are generated for clinical investigation. Tolerance and biologic effects are documented in primates. (4) The first clinical trials on cancer patients are taking place in 1998 on melanoma and prostate cancer to validate the concept. Specialized cell processors with dedicated software and standardized controls are being developed and used for the preparation of cellular vaccines. (5) The evaluation of new non-viral vectors and the validation of new non-viral transfection methods of mononuclear cells with marker genes is in progress and will lead to the ex vivo transfection of genes coding for immunostimulating cytokines or for tumour antigens in MD-APCs. Efficiency will be validated in vitro and in animal models. The ex vivo and animal model studies validate the clinical relevance of this new cellular immunotechnology.

Optimal induction of CD8+ CTL depends on the amount of relevant peptide/MHC-I complexes and the presence of co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC). The antigen-processing defective mutant cell line RMA-S, when cultured at low temperature, expresses high amounts of MHC-I molecules that do not contain endogenously derived peptides. These \"empty\" MHC-I molecules can be stabilized by addition of MHC-binding peptides. RMA-S cultured at low temperatures with selected peptides have been used for in vitro CTL induction with conflicting results. RMA-S cells do not express detectable amounts of B7 co-stimulatory molecule. This could explain their unpredictable efficiency as APC. We have evaluated whether RMA-S cells, stably transfected with cDNA encoding for the human B7.1 molecule could provide effective co-stimulation for CD8+ T lymphocytes. RMA-S/B7 cells, loaded with different synthetic peptides, demonstrated a high and sometimes unique efficiency for in vitro primary CTL induction, even when \"sub-optimal\" antigen peptides were used. Most importantly, RMA-S/B7 cells pulsed with naturally processed peptides extracted from the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma cells were able to prime CD8+ cells against B16 melanoma. We conclude that the use of RMA-S/B7 cells as APC represents an ideal strategy for in vitro CTL immunization without prior in vivo priming. This system may also help to address the issue of the different contributions of co-stimulation and relative occupancy of MHC-I by single peptide epitopes in CTL priming.",

Several repeated intratumoral injections of DNA-liposome complexes followed by intraperitoneal administrations of 5-fluorocytosine, which is converted to 5-fluorouracil, caused strong retardation of murine melanoma B16(F10) tumor growth and, in some cases, rejection of the pre-established tumor. The inhibition of tumor growth expressed as the increased survival of mice is better seen in the case of using DNA-DDAB/DOPE complexes as compared to DNA-DC-Chol/DOPE ones. It seems that the observed therapeutic effect appears to result from several factors: 5-fluorouracil generation by transfected cells, liposome toxicity (DDAB is more toxic than DC-Chol and hence more tumor cells are killed), increased transfection efficiency of surviving cancer cells (in this case DDAB is a better transfection agent than DC-Chol) and, finally, the bystander effect which causes destruction of cells untransfected with CD gene by easily diffusible 5-fluorouracil.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The increasing ability to augment antitumor immunity in model systems has led to increased numbers of clinical trials. However, progress in detecting immune responses by patients against autologous tumors has been slow. Although a considerable number of tumor antigens, as well as peptides derived from them, and the MHC determinants together with which they are presented have been identified for melanoma, this is not so for the majority of solid tumors. Furthermore, tumor cells themselves are poor stimulators of immunity. Thus, approaches that do not depend upon defined antigens or using tumor cells as stimulators would be desirable. To attempt to measure immune responses in these situations, we tested whether total peptides, prepared from autologous tumor tissue, stimulated cytokine release by T cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were mixed with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), pulsed with tumor peptides, and tested in the ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma secretion. Few spots were obtained when PBMCs were cultured with unpulsed APCs or in wells with peptide-pulsed APC alone. In contrast, a strong response was seen when PBMCs were cultured with APCs that had been pulsed with autologous total tumor peptides. This system should help to identify those immunotherapeutic approaches that induce responses against tumor cells in vivo. Because different cytokine profiles are associated with distinct arms of the immune response, testing in the ELISPOT assay may also help us understand the mechanisms responsible.",

We applied a novel liposomal formulation (AVE3) for efficient delivery of antigenic peptides into APCs of the skin. These liposomes resulted in a long-lasting deposition of encapsulated compounds at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes. Using a peptide from the melanocyte differentiation antigen tyrosinase-related protein (TRP2) 2 we could show that vaccination with liposome-encapsulated peptide in combination with oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG ODNs) as adjuvant leads to the induction of tumor cell-specific cytotoxic T cells. The most potent immune response was observed when both, TRP2 peptide and CpG ODNs, were encapsulated into AVE3. Importantly, in contrast to vaccination with free TRP2 liposomal TRP2 peptide generated T cells which respond to 1000-fold lower antigen concentration. Using the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma model we could demonstrate that vaccination with liposomal TRP2 peptide plus CpG ODNs but not vaccination with free peptide or adjuvant alone resulted in tumor protection in subcutaneous and metastatic tumor models. In summary, vaccination with liposome-encapsulated peptide antigen and CpG ODN allows for the in vivo loading and activation of DC, thereby generating reactive CTL populations even against poorly immunogenic self-peptide presenting tumors resulting in a potent anti-tumor immune response.",

Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with peptide-pulsed RMA-S cells or with adherent splenocytes (enriched for professional APC) caused a significant reduction in lung metastases. The antimetastatic effect of peptide-pulsed splenocytes could be further enhanced by pretreating the cells with antisense oligonucleotides directed against the TAP-2 gene which was previously shown to increase the density of specific peptide/MHC class I complexes and thereby improve the APC function of the treated cells (Nair et el., J.

Native u-PA purified from urine induced a mitogenic response in quiescent IF6 and M14 cells that ranged from 25 to 40% of the mitogenic response obtained by fetal calf serum. The half-maximum response in M14 and IF6 cells was reached at u-PA concentrations of approximately 35 and 60 nM, respectively. Blocking the proteolytic activity of u-PA resulted in a 30% decrease of the mitogenic effect, whereas inhibition of plasmin activity did not alter the mitogenic effect. No mitogenic response was elicited by low molecular weight u-PA, lacking the growth factor domain and the kringle domain. The ATF domain of u-PA induced a mitogenic response that was similar to complete u-PA. Defucosylated ATF and recombinant u-PA purified from Escherichia coli lacking all post-translational modifications did not induce a mitogenic response. Blocking the interaction of u-PA with u-PAR, using a specific monoclonal antibody, did not alter the mitogenic effect induced by u-PA. The binding of radiolabeled u-PA to M14 and IF6 cells was characterized by high affinity binding mediated by u-PAR and low affinity binding to an unknown binding site. These results demonstrate that proteolytically inactive u-PA is able to induce a mitogenic response in quiescent melanoma cells in vitro by a mechanism that involves the ATF domain but is independent of high affinity binding to u-PAR. Furthermore, it suggests that u-PA is able to bind with low affinity to a hitherto unidentified membrane associated protein that could be involved in u-PA-induced signal transduction.",

Human DC were transfected with A27L-mutated MART-1 RNA (A27L RNA) or native MART-1 RNA, and then used to stimulate autologous T cells from a series of 8 HLA-A2+ volunteers. After three stimulations, all CTL induced with DC/A27L RNA exhibited more tetramer+ cells, and demonstrated stronger antigen-specific IFNgamma-secreting activity compared to CTL induced with DC/native RNA. A potent MART-1-specific, and predominantly class-I-restricted lysis was detected in most CTL induced with DC/A27L RNA, while native RNA-induced CTL showed minimal and non-specific lysis. HLA-A2+ DC and MART-1 negative/A2+ melanoma cells transfected with the A27L RNA were recognized and killed by MART-1-specific CTL, suggesting that these APC efficiently processed the A27L RNA and presented correct MART-1-specific epitope(s). In summary, introducing an A27L mutation into the MART-1 full-length mRNA sequence enhanced the immunogenicity of the encoded MART-1 Ag.

CC addition to the vaccine coculture allowed efficient Ag uptake while attaining strong vaccine maturation with an immunostimulatory profile. The use of CC not only increased CCR7 expression and the vaccine chemokine responsiveness but also upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion, which regulated its invasive migration in vitro. Neither IL-6 nor prostaglandin E2 had a negative effect on vaccine preparation. In fact, all CC components were necessary for complete vaccine maturation. Subcutaneously injected DC/Apo-Nec vaccine migrated rapidly to draining LNs in nude mice, accumulating regionally after 48 h. The migrating cells of the CC-matured vaccine augmented in proportion and range of distribution, an effect that increased further with the topical administration of imiquimod cream. The migrating proportion of human DCs was detected in draining LNs for at least 9 days after injection. The addition of CC during DC/Apo-Nec preparation enhanced vaccine performance by improving maturation and response to LN signals and by conferring a motile and invasive vaccine phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, the vaccine could be combined with different adjuvants. Therefore, this DC-based vaccine design shows great potential value for clinical translation.",

The four cell lines resulted sensitive to the bleomycin/lipoplexes system in both spatial configurations. Survival rates values were lower than 20% in monolayers of the four tested lines and lower than 30% in three lines (Ak, Bk and Rkb) when grown as spheroids. The sensitization to bleomycin depended on lipoplexes in Ak and Rkb while Bk (in both spatial configurations) and Br (as monolayers) were sensitive to bleomycin alone. Although some degree of sensitivity to bleomycin was induced by cationic lipids alone in Ak and Rkb monolayers, the maximal bleomycin effects appeared in the presence of lipoplexes. The sensitization was independent of transcriptional activity. The co-administration of lipoplexes diminished bleomycin IC50: 10-fold in Ak and Rkb monolayers; and sensitized the Ak and Rkb resistant spheroids. The bleomycin cytotoxic effects depended on lipoplexes concentration and diminished when cells were incubated at 8°C.

        "Doc_abstract":"The development of versatile vaccine platforms is a priority that is recognized by health authorities worldwide; such platforms should induce both arms of the immune system, the humoral and cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte responses. In this study, we have established that a vaccine platform based on the coat protein of papaya mosaic virus (PapMV CP), previously shown to induce a humoral response, can induce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I cross-presentation of HLA-A*0201 epitopes from gp100, a melanoma antigen, and from influenza virus M1 matrix protein. PapMV proteins were able to assemble into stable virus-like particles (VLPs) in a crystalline and repetitive structure. When we pulsed HLA-A*0201+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the recombinant PapMV FLU or gp100, we noted that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were highly reactive to these APCs, demonstrating that the epitope from the VLPs were processed and loaded on the MHC class I complex. APCs were preincubated with two different proteasome inhibitors, which did not affect the efficiency of peptide presentation on MHC class I. Classical presentation from an endogenous antigen was abolished in the same conditions. Clearly, antigen presentation mediated by the PapMV system was proteasome independent. Finally, PapMV-pulsed APCs had the capacity to expand highly avid antigen-specific T cells against the influenza virus M1 HLA-A*0201 epitope when cocultured with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This study demonstrates the potential of PapMV for MHC class I cross-presentation and for the expansion of human antigen-specific T cells. It makes VLPs from PapMV CP a very attractive platform to trigger cellular responses for vaccine development against chronic infectious diseases and cancers.",

Patients with family histories of CRC, hereditary nonpolyposis CRC, familial adenomatous polyposis, inflammatory bowel disease, carcinoid, squamous carcinoma or melanoma were excluded. The two ethnic groups were compared with regard to clinical features, tumor characteristics, disease stage, overall survival rate, disease-free survival rate and cancer-specific survival rate. The factors predicting long-term survival were assessed via both univariate and multivariate analysis.;Among the 1421 patients with CRC enrolled in this study, 1210 patients were Han/Chinese (mean age, 62.3 ± 4.5 years; range, 19-92 years), while 211 patients were Uyghur (mean age, 52.4 ± 15.6 years; range, 17-87 years). There were significant differences in proportions of gender, age, blood type, occupation and histopathological type between the Han/Chinese and Uyghur patients (P < 0.05). The median overall, disease-free and cancer-specific survival time were 45, 62 and 65 mo for the Han/Chinese patients and 42, 49 and 61 mo for the Uyghur patients (P = 0.000, P = 0.005, P = 0.007). The cumulative 5-year survival of the Uyghur patients was significantly worse than that of the Han patients (P = 0.000).

We designed and constructed synthetic cDNA that encodes a chimeric protein comprising abrin-a (ABRaA) toxin A-chain and human VEGF(121). Expression of the ABRaA-VEGF(121) chimeric protein was carried out in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). ABRaA-VEGF(121) preparations were isolated from inclusion bodies, solubilized and purified by affinity and ion-exchanged chromatography (Ni-agarose and Q-Sepharose). Finaly, bacterial endotoxin was removed from the recombinant protein. Under non-reducing conditions, the recombinant protein migrates in polyacrylamide gel as two bands (about 84 kDa homodimer and about 42 kDa monomer). ABRaA-VEGF(121) is strongly cytotoxic towards PAE cells expressing VEGFR-2, as opposed to VEGFR-1 expressing or parental PAE cells. The latter are about 400 times less sensitive to the action of this fusion protein. The biological activity of the ABRaA domain forming part of the chimeric protein was assessed in vitro: ABRaA-VEGF(121) inhibited protein biosynthesis in a cell-free translation system. Preincubation of ABRaA-VEGF(121) with antibody neutralizing the biological activity of human VEGF abolished the cytotoxic effect of the chimeric protein in PAE/KDR cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer vaccines are based on the concept that tumors express novel antigens and thus differ from their normal tissue counterparts. Such putative tumor-specific antigens should be recognizable by the immune system. However, malignant cells are of self origin and only poorly immunogenic, which limits their capability to induce an anticancer immune response. To overcome this problem, tumor cells have been isolated, genetically engineered to secrete cytokine gene products and administered as cancer vaccines. We used adenovirus-enhanced transferrinfection (AVET), which allows high-level transient transgene expression, to introduce cytokine gene expression vectors into murine melanoma cells. The efficiency of AVET makes laborious selection and cloning procedures obsolete. We administered such modified tumor cells as cancer vaccines to syngeneic animals and investigated their impact on the induction of anticancer immunity. We found that IL-2 or GM-CSF gene-transfected murine melanoma cells are highly effective vaccines. Both of these cytokine-secreting vaccines cured 80% of animals which bore a subcutaneous micrometastasis prior to treatment, and induced potent antitumor immunity. The generation of antitumor immunity by these cytokine-secreting vaccines requires three different steps: (1) tumor antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the site of vaccination; (2) migration of these APCs into the regional lymph nodes where T-cell priming occurs; (3) recirculation of specific, activated T-cells that recognize distinct tumor load and initiate its elimination. Extending our previously reported studies, we have now comprehensively analysed the requirements for effective antitumor vaccination in animals. This may also become the basis for treatment of human cancer patients.",

We evaluated the antitumor activity of a series of semisynthetic sulfaminoheparosan sulfates (SAHSs) with different degree and distribution of sulfates, obtained by chemical modifications of the E. coli K5 polysaccharide, namely type A, B, and C compounds. B16-BL6 melanoma cells (10 5 cells/mouse) were injected intravenously (i.v.) in a lateral tail vein of C57BL6 mice at a dose of 0.5 mg/ mouse together with test compounds. Tumor lung nodules were significantly reduced as compared with controls only by H (95.5 +/- 1.0% inhibition), SAHS-2 (84.2 +/- 5.0% inhibition), and SAHS-4 (91.1 +/- 4.2% inhibition), among compounds tested. SAHS-2 and SAHS-4 are type B compounds, with a sulfate/carboxylate ratio similar to that of H. A typical mammalian HS showed only 54.8% inhibition. Supersulfated low-molecular-weight heparin and heparan sulfate (ssLMWH and ssLMWHS) showed an activity similar to that of unfractionated compounds. H and SAHS-4 inhibited dose dependently B16-BL6 lung colonies, with IC-50 values of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mouse, respectively. The relationship with ex vivo anticoagulant potency was evaluated by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) on mouse plasma at different time intervals after i.v. injection (0.1 to 0.5 mg/mouse) of the compound. H showed a dose-dependent anticoagulant activity lasting up to 2 hours, whereas SAHS-4 showed a potent anticoagulant effect only at a dose of 0.5 mg/mouse. Accordingly, H but not SAHS-4 consistently inhibited B16-BL6 lung colonies when given 1 hour before tumor cells. SAHS-4 derivatives, with different size and/or affinity depleted of AT binding sites, showed an inhibitory effect on B16-BL6 melanoma similar to that of SAHS-4, suggesting that the greater antitumor effect of H was not due to AT-mediated inhibition of blood clotting. Interactions with other blood inhibitors, such as heparin cofactor II or tissue factor pathway inhibitory protein cannot be ruled out. The better effect of H may be due to persistence in the circulation and/or ability to inhibit tumor neoangiogenesis.",

We have previously shown that H-ferritin inhibits anti-CD3-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and that this was due to increased production of interleukin-10 (IL-10). In the present study we have shown that induction of IL-10 production was due to effects of H-ferritin on adherent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in blood and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). IL-10 was produced by a subpopulation of CD4 T cells, which expressed the CD25 component of the IL-2 receptor and the CTLA-4 receptor characteristic of regulatory T cells. The changes induced in MoDCs were compared with those induced by CD40L and their significance tested by inhibition with monoclonal antibodies. These studies indicated that H-ferritin induced relatively greater expression of CD86 and B7-H1 on MoDCs and that monoclonal antibodies against their receptors, CTLA-4 and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), inhibited IL-10 production from the regulatory T cells. H-ferritin did not appear to induce direct production of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, or interferon-gamma from the DCs. These results are consistent with the thesis that H-ferritin induces B7-H1 and CD86 (B7-2) on APCs, which in turn induce IL-10 production from regulatory T cells. This is possibly one mechanism by which melanoma cells may induce changes in APCs in the vicinity of the tumor and result in suppression of immune responses by induction of regulatory T cells.",

The present study demonstrates the ability of alpha-gal glycolipids treatment to prevent development of metastases at distant sites and to protect against tumor challenge in the treated mice. Adoptive transfer studies indicate that this protective immune response is mediated by CD8+ T cells, activated by tumor lesions turned vaccine. This T cell activation is potent enough to overcome the suppressive activity of Treg cells present in tumor bearing mice, however it does not elicit an autoimmune response against antigens on normal cells.

The present study was based on 20 general and 2 specific populationbased cancer registries. Overall, we analysed 818,017 incident cases and 342,444 cancer deaths for the time period 1998-2005. Seventy percent of the analysed population was from the North of Italy, 17% from the Centre, and 13% from the South. A joinpoint analysis was carried out to detect the point in time where the trend changed; trends are described by means of the estimated annual percent change (APC), with appropriate 95% confidence intervals. Crude and standardized incidence and mortality rates were computed for 36 cancer sites, for both sexes, three age-classes (0-49, 50-69 and 70+ years), and three geographic areas (North, Centre, and South of Italy). Specific chapters are devoted to long-term trends (1986-2005), differences among age-groups, and international comparisons.;In 1998-2005, cancer mortality for all sites showed a statistically significant decrease among men (APC - 1.7) and women (- 0.8). Mortality significantly decreased in both sexes for stomach cancer, rectum cancer, liver cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality also decreased among men for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, prostate, urinary bladder, and leukaemia. Among women mortality decreased for cancers of the colon, bone, breast, and uterus not otherwise specified. An increase in mortality was recorded for lung cancer among women (+1.5) and melanoma among men (+2.6). Incidence for all cancers together (except non-melanoma skin cancers) increased among men (APC +0.3) and remained stable among women. Cancer sites which showed increasing incidence were thyroid and melanoma in both sexes, colon, testis, soft tissue among men, and lung and Hodgkin lymphoma among women. For several cancer sites incidence decreased, e.g., stomach and Kaposi sarcoma (men and women), upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, urinary bladder, myeloma and leukaemia (men), gallbladder, cervix uteri and ovary (women).;this monograph presents a detailed description of cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy.

We show here the successful establishment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24-restricted CTL (TcLHK2 line1) from a pleural effusion of lung cancer patient, using B7.1 (CD80) transduced autologous lung cancer cells as an antigen-presenting cell (APC). TcLHK2 line1 recognized autologous lung adenocarcinoma cell line LHK2 in an HLA-A24-restricted fashion. Moreover, this CTL line also recognized allogeneic HLA-A24-positive lung adenocarcinoma cell line, gastric carcinoma cell line and melanoma cell line. These data raise the possibility that co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 (CD80) plays important role to overcome the immunological tolerance. Furthermore, TcLHK2 line1 is a useful tool for the identification of widely expressed shared antigens restricted by HLA-A24.

Codelivery of U-Omp19 with the Ag can reduce intracellular Ag digestion and increases Ag half-life in dendritic cells (DCs). U-Omp19 retains the Ag in Lamp-2(+) compartments after its internalization and promotes a sustained expression of MHC class I/peptide complexes in the cell surface of DCs. Consequently, U-Omp19 enhances Ag cross-presentation by DCs to CD8(+) T cells. U-Omp19 s.c. delivery induces the recruitment of CD11c(+)CD8α(+) DCs and monocytes to lymph nodes whereas it partially limits in vivo Ag proteolysis inside DCs. Accordingly, this protein is able to induce CD8(+) T cell responses in vivo against codelivered Ag. Antitumor responses were elicited after U-Omp19 coadministration, increasing survival of mice in a murine melanoma challenge model.

In addition, the inclusion of TAT significantly improved the antitumor T cell immune response to a gp96 vaccine in the B16 melanoma model. These results provide evidence that the efficient transduction of gp96 into APCs can significantly enhance the outcome of gp96-based immunotherapy, and therefore provide a basis for more efficient approaches to improving the immunoregulatory and adjuvant functions of this unique T cell adjuvant.",

In this study, we compared the potential of adenoviral (Ad)-transduced versus peptide-pulsed DC to induce melanoma-antigen (Ag)-specific T-cell responses in vitro. Whereas gp100-peptide-pulsed DC induced long-lasting specific CD8+ T-cell responses against single peptides, Ad-transduced DC induced broad and strong, specific immunity against various peptides of the gp100-Ag. Surprisingly, several restimulations led to decreasing gp100-specific and in parallel to increasing anti-adenoviral T-cell responses. Nevertheless, those anti-adenoviral T-cell responses provided an \"adjuvant\" effect by inducing an early release of high amounts of IL-2/IFN-gamma, therewith enhancing CTL induction in the initiation phase. Based on these data, we suggest a prime/boost vaccination strategy in melanoma patients--combining the use of Ad-DC and peptide-pulsed DC--to obtain efficient and long-term antitumor T-cell responses.",

A crucial step for mounting an anti-tumour response is the capture, processing and presentation of tumour antigens (TA) to cognate T cells by professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), followed by their activation and clonal proliferation. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent APC with the unique ability to stimulate primary immune responses. Animal models have demonstrated that TA-charged DC can activate specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and even regression of established tumours in cancer-bearing hosts. These findings, as well as the elaboration of methods for generating large numbers of DC ex vivo, have provided a compelling rationale for using DC as potent adjuvants to deliver TA to the immune system in order to trigger or amplify an inadequate response. The capacity of TA-pulsed DC to induce significant CTL immunity translating into occasional therapeutic benefit has been documented in several clinical settings including B cell lymphoma, myeloma, melanoma, prostate, colon, ovarian and renal cell carcinoma. In this review, we summarize key biological functions of DC and focus on recent DC-based vaccination trials of breast, ovarian and cervical cancer.",

In C57BL/6J mice immunized with pUB-AQP-1, the growth of B16F10 melanoma was profoundly inhibited. The antitumor effect of the pUB-AQP-1 DNA vaccine was largely mediated by CD8 T cells, which secrete IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme-B in the presence of APCs transfected with pUB-AQP-1. AQP-1-specific CD8 T cells possessed cytotoxic activity both in vivo and in vitro. After tumor challenge, the microvessel density decreased and the ratio of total blood vessel area to tumor area was significantly reduced as compared with control mice, resulting in a dramatic suppression of tumor growth. The immunization effect was completely abrogated in immunoproteasome-deficient mice. Strikingly this pUB-AQP-1 DNA vaccine was also effective against Colon 26 colon tumors (BALB/c) and MBT/2 bladder tumors (C3H/HeN).

        "Doc_abstract":"This study describes a novel cancer immunotherapy treatment that exploits the natural anti-Gal Ab to destroy tumor lesions and convert them into an endogenous vaccine targeted to APC via FcgammaR. Anti-Gal constitutes 1% of immunoglobulins in humans and interacts specifically with alpha-gal epitopes (Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R). The binding of anti-Gal to alpha-gal epitopes on pig cells mediates xenograft rejection. The proposed method uses glycolipid micelles with multiple alpha-gal epitopes (alpha-gal glycolipids). These glycolipids are extracted from rabbit red cell membranes and are comprised of ceramides with carbohydrate chains containing 5-25 carbohydrates, all capped with alpha-gal epitopes. Efficacy of this treatment was demonstrated in alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout mice producing anti-Gal and bearing B16 melanoma or B16/OVA producing OVA as a surrogate tumor Ag. These mice are unique among nonprimate mammals in that, similar to humans, they lack alpha-gal epitopes and can produce the anti-Gal Ab. Intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids results in local inflammation mediated by anti-Gal binding to the multiple alpha-gal epitopes and activation of complement. These glycolipids spontaneously insert into tumor cell membranes. The binding of anti-Gal to alpha-gal expressing tumor cells induces the destruction of treated lesions as in anti-Gal-mediated xenograft rejection. Anti-Gal further opsonizes tumor cells within the lesion and, thus, targets them for effective uptake by APC that transport the tumor Ags to draining lymph nodes. APC further cross-present immunogenic tumor Ag peptides and elicit a systemic anti-tumor immune response. Similar intratumoral injection of alpha-gal glycolipids in humans is likely to induce the destruction of treated lesions and elicit a protective immune response against micrometastases.",

Here, we show that a His-tagged flagellin-derived peptide (denoted 9Flg), previously reported to promote binding of liposomal antigen to TLR5-expressing cells, can be used to target near-neutral pDNA-lipoplexes incorporating the chelator lipid NTA(3)-DTDA (3(nitrilotriacetic acid)-ditetradecylamine) to DCs and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Thus, we show that pDNA-lipoplexes engrafted with 9Flg target pDNA to APCs in vitro and in vivo. Following i.v. administration, radiolabelled 9Flg-lipoplexes exhibited increased accumulation in spleen, lung and liver. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with 9Flg-lipoplexes containing either pcDNA3.1-SIIN (pSIIN) or a Kunjin virus replicon-based vector (pKUN), each encoding the epitope OVA(257-264) (SIINFEKL), induced Ag-specific T cell priming, and elicited strong cellular immunity as reflected by a marked increase in the number of Ag-responsive IFN-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, compared to i.m. injection of these SIINFEKL-encoding pDNAs in naked form, the i.v. administration of pSIIN or pKUN in 9Flg-lipoplexes to C57BL/6 mice induced a significantly more potent anti-tumour response in the B16-OVA melanoma tumour model.

The gastrointestinal tract may either be affected by direct invasion, intraperitoneal dissemination or hematogenous cancer spread, the latter most often originating from malignant melanoma, breast and lung carcinomas. Metastatic deposits primarily develop within the submucosa. Secondary involvement of the mucosa typically leads to centrally depressed and/or ulcerated (volcano-like) nodular lesions. In histology, lack of a mucosal in situ component favors diagnosis of metastasis, whereas presence of an adenomatous precursor lesion is regarded to be characteristic of primary tumors. This concept, however, has recently been challenged by demonstrating metastatic cancer growth along intact basement membranes within the mucosal layer, i.e. mucosal colonization. The histopathological, immunohistochemical and clinical features of secondary gastrointestinal tumors are discussed in detail, focusing on criteria for differential diagnosis. The prognosis of affected patients is generally poor.",

In this system paraformaldehyde fixation of E. coli/LLO provided an additional safety feature without compromising vaccine efficacy. We therefore reasoned that paraformaldehyde-fixed recombinant E. coli expressing LLO would be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of human tumour antigens to human DCs. In the present study, we demonstrate that fixed E. coli expressing LLO are taken up efficiently by human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) with minimal toxicity.

Furthermore, we show that fixed E. coli/LLO expressing the well-characterised human melanoma antigen, MART1, efficiently deliver the HLA-A2-restricted MART1(27-35) epitope for processing and presentation on human MoDCs, suggesting the potential of this system as a novel strategy for human tumour immunotherapy.",

In this study, the efficacy of vaccination with DC pulsed with apoptotic B16 melanoma cells opsonized with an anti-CD44 IgG (B16-CD44) was explored. Immature bone marrow derived DC grown in vitro with IL-4 and GM-CSF were pulsed with B16-CD44. After 48 h of pulsing, maturation of DC was demonstrated by production of IL-12 and upregulation of CD80 and CD40 expression. To test the efficacy of vaccination with DC+B16-CD44, mice were vaccinated subcutaneously Lymphocytes from mice vaccinated with DC+B16-CD44 produced IFN-gamma in response to B16 melanoma lysates as well as an MHC class I restricted B16 melanoma-associated peptide, indicating B16 specific CD8 T cell activation. Upon challenge with viable B16 cells, all mice vaccinated with DC alone developed tumor compared to 40% of mice vaccinated with DC+B16-CD44; 60% of the latter mice remained tumor free for at least 8 months. In addition, established lung tumors and distant metastases were significantly reduced in mice treated with DC+B16-CD44. Lastly, delayed growth of established subcutaneous tumors was induced by combination therapy with anti-CD44 antibodies followed by DC injection.

Cases with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial retinoblastoma, familial melanoma and HNPCC were also searched among these 1068 families.;There were only four families (0.4%) in which more than three relatives were affected by lung cancer. Two successive generations were affected in 36 families (3.4%). Patients with lung cancer before the age of 50 were present in 165 families (15.5%). However, no family conformed to all three criteria.

We have used adenovirus-enhanced transferrinfection (AVET) for the generation of cancer vaccines. This is a highly efficient method to deliver various genes into a large proportion of tumor cells, making further selection unnecessary. We found in the mouse M-3 melanoma model that two consecutive vaccinations with transfected cells secreting IL-2 protect animals from tumor development by a subsequent challenge, and result in long-lasting tumor-specific immunity dependent on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Patterns of lymphocyte recirculation and the need for CD4+ T cells indicated that the role of IL-2 is not merely local 'replacement of help', as has been proposed before. Instead, our findings suggest a three-stage process for the generation of effector T cells after vaccination with IL-2 secreting tumor cells: (1) tumor antigen uptake and processing at the site of injection by APCs, (2) migration of APCs into the regional draining lymph nodes where T-cell priming occurs, and (3) recirculation of activated cytotoxic T cells, that recognize and eliminate distant tumor cells.

Recent studies have shown that mda-7 gene transfer inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other tumor types through activation of various intracellular signaling pathways. In the current study, we demonstrate that Ad-mda7 transduction of human pancreatic cancer cells results in G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell killing. Cytotoxicity is mediated via apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Tumor cell killing correlates with regulation of proteins involved in the Wnt and PI3K pathways: beta-catenin, APC, GSK-3, JNK, and PTEN. Additionally, we identify bystander cell killing activated by exposure of pancreatic tumor cells to secreted human MDA-7 protein. In pancreatic tumor cells, exogenous MDA-7 protein activates STAT3 and kills cells via engagement of IL-20 receptors. The specificity of bystander killing is demonstrated using neutralizing anti-MDA-7 antibodies and anti-receptor antibodies, which inhibit the apoptotic effects. In sum, we show that Ad-mda7 is able to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells via inhibition of the Wnt/PI3K pathways and identify a novel bystander mechanism of MDA-7 killing in pancreatic cancer that functions via IL-20 receptors.",

Bone-metastatic tumors have been characterized by decreased NM23 and increased c-met and p53 expressions. C-erbB2 genotype of the primary tumor was not maintained frequently in bone metastases. Application of DNA-microarray and quantitative PCR technologies improved the prediction of therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancers. Colorectal cancer studies revealed regional inhomogenities (clusters) in various geographical regions of Hungary, which were distinct in the case of colonic and rectal cancers. To increase the sensitivity of fecal blood test of colorectal cancer screening, a new double-antibody test was developed and tested in a large cohort of patients. Genetic analysis revealed that hypermethylation is a significant factor in microsatellite instability which, and plays a role in silencing of APC and E-cadherin genes as well. The Hungarian pattern of TS polymorphism was also determined and was correlated not only with the efficacy of 5-FU treatment but with the progression of the disease as well. Population-based studies have been carried out in head and neck cancer patients (HNC) and smokers as well to reveal the genetic background of increasing tumor incidence. These studies revealed polymorphism in XRCC1/3 methylation enzyme gene which has preventive role. Other studies found frequent local immunosuppression in HNC patients. Studies indicated that the success of irradiation in this cancer type is dependent on the anti-vascular effects. Pediatric cancer studies determined the parameters of neuroblastoma screening based on VMA measurements. New splice variants of the WT1 gene involved in the monitoring of MRD of ALL patients was also described this year. We also obtained positive experimental data for the retinoic acid therapy of ALL. Melanoma studies extensively used DNA-microarray technology which identified 4 melanoma-specific and 2 melanoma progression-specific genes. In experimental human melanoma xenograft models we have identified 3 anti-metastatic agents: low molecular weight heparin, 2-methoxyestradiol and erythropoietin-alpha, where the later was characterized by specific effects on tumor vasculature.",

At this point, pain, anorexia, early satiety, sleep problems and weight loss are present. Back pain also may be prominent, which predicts unresectability and shortened survival after resection. However, earlier recognition of symptoms of pancreatic cancer might improve early detection of the cancer. For example, 25% of patients have symptoms compatible with upper abdominal disease up to 6 months prior to diagnosis and 15% of patients may seek medical attention more than 6 months prior to diagnosis. These symptoms erroneously may be attributed to problems such as irritable syndrome. Symptoms, however, may be less common. For example a quarter of patients with pancreatic cancer may have no pain at diagnosis, and half, particularly those with pancreatic head tumors, may have little pain compared with patients with body-tail tumors. However, if the tumor is suspected because of predisposing conditions, earlier diagnosis may be possible. These conditions include diseases such as chronic pancreatitis, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT), and recent onset of diabetes mellitus, particularly if the diabetes occurs during or beyond the sixth decade. In addition inherited syndromes also are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer including familial pancreatic cancer, hereditary pancreatitis, familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome (FAP) and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome (hereditary dysplastic nevus syndrome). Of these conditions, recent onset of diabetes may be the best clue and should be included in a clinical profile of patients prior to the onset of symptoms to identify a high-risk group to apply screening strategies for detection of early disease. Contrary to a clinical aphorism that pancreatic cancer patients are elderly, lean and recently may have developed diabetes, we found that patients who develop pancreatic cancer are overweight prior to onset of symptoms compared to controls (body mass index, 28 vs 25). Forty percent had the diagnosis of diabetes made at the time of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and more patients with a resectable tumor had diabetes (58%) compared to patients with locally unresectable or metastatic disease (37%). Perhaps, screening overweight persons who have new-onset diabetes may lead to a diagnosis of asymptomatic, early, resectable pancreatic cancer.",

To assess the role of quantity and quality of peptide-MHC presentation in eliciting T cell activation and suppression functions, we genetically engineered human T cells with two TCRs that recognize HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides derived from either HIV or melanoma antigens. The engineered-TCRs are highly functional in both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as assessed by the upregulation of activation markers, induction of cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. We further demonstrated that engineered-TCRs can also be expressed on naïve human T cells, which are stimulated through APCs presenting specific peptides to induce T cell proliferation and acquire effector functions. Furthermore, regulatory T cells (Tregs) ectopically expressing the engineered-TCRs are activated in an antigen-specific fashion and suppress T cell proliferation. In this system, the inhibitory activity of peptide-stimulated Tregs require the presence of dendritic cells (DCs) in the culture, either as presenters or as bystander cells, pointing to a critical role for DCs in suppression by Tregs. In conclusion, the engineered-TCR system reported here advances our ability to understand the differentiation pathways of naïve T cells into antigen-specific effector cells and the role of antigen-specific signaling in Treg-mediated immune suppression.",

In the present work, these two antigen-presenting cells (APC) were prepared in humans from circulating mononuclear cells (MNC). MPH were obtained from MNC that were cultured in hydrophobic plastic bags and purified by elutriation. DC were from the culture of adherent elutriation-purified monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). The two APC were prepared in parallel from the same donors and their phenotype and antigen-presenting capacity were compared. DC differed from MPH by a higher expression of HLA-DR and CD23 and a lower expression of CD14, CD64 and of adhesion molecules. DC and MPH were comparably effective in (a) enhancing the mitotic response of autologous lymphocytes to immobilized anti-CD3 (accessory function); (b) presenting melanoma peptides to specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones; and (c) stimulating the generation of CTL directed against a myxovirus influenza peptide. However, DC were more effective than MPH in inducing the mitotic response of allogeneic peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL), possibly because of their higher expression of HLA class II molecules. In conclusion, DC and MPH prepared from blood MNC did not differ substantially in their ability to activate HLA class I-restricted T-cell responses by exogenous peptide presentation.",

Clone formation assay in soft agar was used to measure the inhibition activity of OSM on the proliferation of high metastatic human lung cancer cells 95-D. Cell attachment assay, cell migration assay and cell invasion assay were used to evaluate inhibition by OSM on 95-D cells of the adhesion ability, the migration ability, and the ability of cells to cross tissue barriers, respectively. Inhibition of OSM on secretion of MMP-2 and -9 secretion in 95-D cells was determined by Western blot. The in vivo inhibitory effect of OSM on metastasis of murine melanoma cells B16BL6 was examined in the pulmonary metastasis model. In vitro studies showed that OSM inhibited the proliferation of 95-D cells at low concentration. OSM also reduced the adhesion and invasion ability of 95-D cells and inhibited the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in OSM treated cells. In vivo results showed that OSM (20 microg/kg/d for 7 days) inhibited pulmonary metastasis at a rate of 20.7%. There were no differences in animal weights among the groups. These results suggest that OSM has the potential of being a clinical inhibitor on metastasis of some cancer cells.",

When engrafted onto liposomes, two flagellin-related peptides, denoted as 9Flg and 42Flg, promoted strong liposome binding to murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and CD11c(+) splenocytes, and cell binding correlated with expression of TLR5. Liposomes engrafted with 9Flg or 42Flg induced functional MyD88-dependent maturation of dendritic cells in vivo.

Importantly, the vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with syngeneic B16-OVA-derived plasma membrane vesicles, engrafted with 9Flg or 42Flg, potently inhibited tumor growth/metastasis and induced complete tumor regression in the majority of mice challenged with the syngeneic B16-OVA melanoma, in the lung and s.c. tumor models.

In the present study, we performed a clinicopathologic analysis and investigated p16 and cyclin D1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 14 cases. Furthermore, we investigated genetic changes of various tumor suppressor genes and an oncogene, including p16INK4a/p14ARF, p53, beta-catenin, and APC, in 11 cases. The 5-year overall survival rate in all the patients was 33.3%. A high mitotic rate was a significant adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.004). Decreased expression of p16 was observed in 4 (28.6%) of 14 cases. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was observed in 9 cases (64.3%). SSCP analysis followed by DNA direct sequencing revealed point mutations of the p16INK4a gene in 2 of 11 cases (18.2%).

Even though the tumor cells lacked expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86 costimulatory molecules, the i.v. injection of tumor/Gal resulted in IFN-gamma secretion by NKT and NK cells. These innate responses to tumor/Gal, including the induction of IL-12p70, were comparable to or better than alpha-GalCer-loaded DCs. B16 melanoma cells that were stably transduced to express higher levels of CD1d showed an increased capacity relative to wild-type B16 cells to present alpha-GalCer in vivo. Three different tumor cell lines, when loaded with alpha-GalCer, failed to establish tumors upon i.v. injection, and the mice survived for at least 6 mo. The resistance against tumor cells was independent of CD4 and CD8 T cells but dependent upon NKT and NK cells. Mice were protected from the development of metastases if the administration of live B16 tumor cells was followed 3 h or 3 days later by the injection of CD1d(high)-alpha-GalCer-loaded B16 tumor cells with or without irradiation.

The clinical features at the time of presentation were analyzed for their impact on the main outcomes using a series of Cox proportional hazards regressions.;The most common referring diagnosis included choroidal nevus (26%), choroidal melanoma (15%), CHRPE (9%), and unspecified lesion (48%). The median age at diagnosis was 45 years (range, 1-80 years), and there were no patients with familial adenomatous polyposis or related colon cancer, although a history of cancer was noted in 8% of patients, most commonly breast cancer (3%). The lesion most frequently was located inferotemporally (31%) and at the equatorial region (45%). Rarely, it was located in the macula (1%) or peripapillary region (1%). The median largest basal diameter was 4.5 mm, and the lesion was flat in all cases except in 5 (1.5%), in which there was an intralesional lesion nodule. The lesion was pigmented in 88% of cases and nonpigmented in 12%. Lacunae were noted in 43% of the pigmented CHRPE, and the lacunae showed gradual enlargement in 32%. Factors related to lacunae enlargement included number and relative size of lacunae. Flat enlargement of the lesion was documented in 46% of patients with comparative photographic follow-up and in 83% of those followed up for more than 3 years. The median rate of enlargement was 10 micro m per month. The most important factor associated with flat lesion enlargement was relative size of the lacunae within CHRPE. There were no cases of CHRPE in which a nodule developed while the patient was being followed up. Of the 5 lesions that had a nodule, progressive enlargement of the nodule was found in 3.;Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium generally has been regarded as a benign, stable lesion, but subtle, flat enlargement was noted in most patients (83%) followed up for 3 or more years using meticulous photographic comparison. Flat enlargement of the lesion appeared to be related to percentage of the mass occupied by lacunae.",

As expected, it binds with high affinity to heparin-Sepharose like FGF-2 and can displace the binding of radiolabeled FGF-2 to its high affinity receptor. In contrast, the fusion protein only has much lower ribosome-inactivating activity than free saporin, although full ribosome-inactivating protein activity can be generated by proteolytic removal of the FGF-2 moiety. Cytotoxicity experiments with B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells establish that the fusion protein is active as a chemical conjugate against these intact cells. Presumably these cells have the ability to activate the SAP component of the fusion protein through an intra-cellular metabolism of the fusion protein. Because we also show the fusion protein has tumor growth inhibition properties and antimetastatic activity in in vivo models of melanoma, the findings support the hypothesis that FGF-based ligand-mediated cytotoxicity can serve to target cytotoxic agents in vivo.",

Cases were obtained fromRegistro de Câncer de Base Populacional de Goiânia(Goiania's Population-Based Cancer File). Frequency, trends, and incidence of cases with single and multiple lesions were analyzed; transplants and genetic skin diseases were found in cases with multiple lesions.RESULTS Over the period, 1,995 skin cancer cases were observed to found, of which 1,524 (90.3%) cases had single lesions and 164 (9.7%) had multiple lesions. Regarding single lesions, incidence on men was observed to have risen from 2.4 to 3.1/100,000 inhabitants; it differed significantly for women, shifting from 2.3 to 5.3/100,000 (Annual percentage change - [APC] 3.0%, p = 0.006). Regarding multiple lesions, incidence on men was observed to have risen from 0.30 to 0.98/100,000 inhabitants; for women, it rose from 0.43 to 1.16/100,000 (APC 8.6%, p = 0.003). Genetic skin diseases or transplants were found to have been correlated with 10.0% of cases with multiple lesions - an average of 5.1 lesions per patient. The average was 2.5 in cases without that correlation.CONCLUSIONS Skin cancer on women under 40 years of age has been observed to be increasing for both cases with single and multiple lesions. It is not unusual to find multiple tumors in young people - in most cases, they are not associated with genetic skin diseases or transplants. It is necessary to avoid excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation from childhood. ",

Wnt/wg signaling results in beta-catenin accumulation and transcriptional activation of specific target genes during development. It is now apparent that deregulation of beta-catenin signaling is an important event in the genesis of a number of malignancies, such as colon cancer, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, medulloblastoma pilomatricomas, and prostate cancer. beta-catenin mutations appear to be a crucial step in the progression of a subset of these cancers, suggesting an important role in the control of cellular proliferation or cell death. The APC/beta-catenin pathway is highly regulated and includes players such as GSK3-beta, CBP, Groucho, Axin, Conductin, and TCF. c-MYC and cyclin D1 were recently identified as a key transcriptional targets of this pathway and additional targets are likely to emerge.

Here we used Apriori algorithm to find the frequent mutational gene sets (FMGSs) from 4,904 tumors across 11 cancer types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort and then mined the hidden association rules (ARs) within these FMGSs. Intriguingly, we found that well-known cancer driver genes such as BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, and TP53 were often co-occurred with other driver genes and FMGSs size peaked at an itemset size of 3~4 genes. Besides, the number and constitution of FMGS and ARs differed greatly among different cancers and stages. In addition, FMGS and ARs were rare in endocrine-related cancers such as breast carcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, but abundant in cancers contact directly with external environments such as skin melanoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we observed more rules in stage IV than in other stages, indicating that distant metastasis needed more sophisticated gene regulatory network.",

The inhibitor-induced inactivation of the catalytic subunit protein R2 was measured at 77 degrees K by observing the decrease of the typical EPR signal from the functionally essential protein-linked tyrosyl free radical. p-Methoxy-, p-ethoxy-, p-propoxy-, and p-allyloxyphenol were about 2 orders of magnitude more effective in inhibiting mouse R2, compared with E. coli R2. Among the p-alkoxyphenols studied, p-propoxyphenol was the most effective inhibitor of mouse R2 (IC50, 0.7 microM) and p-methoxyphenol was the least effective (IC50, 11 microM); p-ethoxy- and p-allyloxyphenol were intermediate. The observed half-maximal inhibition values characterized p-alkoxyphenols as a new class of strong inhibitors of the R2 protein of mammalian RR. p-Propoxy-, p-ethoxy-, and p-allyloxyphenol could be considered as new candidates for anticancer drugs. A special cellular inhibition assay of RR in proliferating tumor cells, in which the tyrosyl radical of R2 at natural concentration was monitored by EPR, showed that the four para-substituted alkoxyphenols also inhibited the enzyme with high efficiency in tumor cells (IC50, between 0.5 microM and 5 microM). Our results with inactivation of protein R2 of RR imply that the cytostatic effect of p-alkoxyphenols on melanoma cells, which has been hitherto explained by inhibition of tyrosinase [Melanoma Res. 2:295-304 (1992)], may be caused at least partly by inhibition of RR.

The main improvements include manipulation with dense suspensions of E. coli, use of lactose instead of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside as an inducer and a cheaper but not less efficient buffer for solubilization of arginine deiminase inclusion bodies. In addition, supplementation of the storage culture medium with glucose and substrate (arginine) significantly stabilized the recombinant arginine deiminase producer.

We show in this study that, in that regimen, hsp70 acts as a potent immune adjuvant through TLR-4 signaling and local induction of TNF-alpha. hsp70 is required for migration of APC resident in the skin to the draining lymph nodes to present Ags, derived from the killing of normal melanocytes, to naive T cells. The addition of a plasmid expressing CD40L increased therapeutic efficacy, such that only six plasmid injections were now required to cure large, 9-day established tumors. Generation of potent immunological memory against rechallenge in cured mice accompanied these therapeutic gains, as did induction of aggressive autoimmune symptoms. Expression of CD40L, along with hsp70, increased both the frequency and activity of T cells activated against melanocyte-derived Ags. In this way, addition of CD40L to the hsp70-induced inflammatory killing of melanocytes can be used to cure large established tumors and to confer immunological memory against tumor cells, although a concomitant increase in autoimmune sequelae also is produced.",

Recently, activating mutations within BRAF have been reported in a high percentage of melanomas and colorectal carcinomas and shown to have oncogenic capabilities. Further, their association to mismatch-repair-deficient tumors has suggested the involvement of the RAS/RAF pathway in the tumorigenesis of microsatellite-unstable colon cancers, and that RAS and RAF mutations are alternative genetic events. We determined whether colorectal mismatch-repair-deficient tumors with BRAF mutations show a specific genotype when compared with tumors with wild-type BRAF, and whether they can be associated with a particular clinicopathological feature. Here, we report a striking association of BRAF, but not of APC, KRAS2, AXIN2, and TP53 mutations, with proximal mismatch-repair-deficient colon tumors and MLH1 hypermethylation. Our results support the hypothesis that proximal and distal colorectal tumors with mismatch repair deficiency harbor different genetic alterations, and we suggest that the involvement of the RAS/RAF pathway in colorectal tumorigenesis is differentially modulated according to tumor location and MLH1 inactivation.",

The nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1 is a potent alarmin that binds TLR4 and induces antigen-specific Th1 immune responses, but its contributions to antitumor immunity have not been explored. We found that ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing EG7 mouse thymoma cells grew much faster in Hmgn1-deficient mice than littermate-matched controls. Tumor-bearing Hmgn1(-/-) mice generated fewer OVA-specific CD8 cells in the spleen than EG7-bearing Hmgn1(+/+) mice, suggesting that HMGN1 supported T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. In addition, EG7 tumors expressing HMGN1 grew more slowly than control EG7 tumors, suggesting greater resistance to HMGN1-expressing tumors. This resistance relied on T cell-mediated immunity because it was abolished by in vivo depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, mice vaccinated with a DNA vector expressing an HMGN1-gp100 fusion protein manifested gp100-specific, Th1-polarized immune responses, acquiring resistance to challenge with mouse B16F1 melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent insights in antigen presentation, the identification of human tumor antigens, and the demonstration of MHC class-I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of peptides encoded by tumor antigen have renewed the interest and enthusiasm for the development of cancer vaccines. Melanoma serves as a paradigm of an immunogenic human tumor, and several tumor antigens, including MAGE, MART-1/Melan-A and gp100, recognized by CTLs, have now been isolated. Candidate antigens for novel vaccine trials may include HLA class-I-binding tumor peptides that serve as CTL epitopes, whole tumor protein, or DNA-based vaccines. Requirements for the use of peptides are that the patient's tumor presents the relevant CTL epitopes as used in the vaccine and expresses the appropriate MHC class-I-restricting molecule. Immunological monitoring may be facilitated when using peptide-based vaccines. Because optimal presentation of tumor antigens may depend on provision of appropriate costimulatory signals, it may be more advantageous to administer professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with tumor peptide or protein, to cancer patients. Developments in molecular genetics have led to a new approach in vaccines consisting of cancer cells genetically engineered to express immunomodulatory molecules. This may result in increased antitumor responses to both gene-modified as well as unmodified tumor cells. The therapeutic approach is extended to vaccination trials with recombinant viruses containing the genes encoding tumor antigens, minigenes containing multiple CTL epitopes, or double recombinant vectors engineered to express both the tumor antigen and immunostimulatory molecules. Clinical peptide, protein and DNA-based vaccine trials have recently been initiated. Thus far, exciting clinical remissions were obtained in melanoma patients following vaccination with HLA-A1-binding MAGE-3 peptide and in B-cell lymphoma patients immunized with autologous DCs pulsed with anti-idiotype protein, i.e., the individual patient's unique tumor antigen. Also, following injection of foreign HLA-B7 DNA into cutaneous melanoma metastases, T-cell migration into treated lesions and enhanced cellular immunity at the site of the tumor were shown in some patients. These encouraging results suggest that effective new vaccines in cancer will be identified.",

The trans-presentation of IL-15 by neighboring cells is more effective for NK cell activation than its soluble IL-15. In this study, the fusion protein dsNKG2D-IL-15, which consisted of two identical extracellular domains of human NKG2D coupled to human IL-15 via a linker, was engineered in Escherichia coli. DsNKG2D-IL-15 could efficiently bind to major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related protein A (MICA) of human tumor cells with the two NKG2D domains and trans-present IL-15 to NK or CD8+ T cells. We transplanted human gastric cancer (SGC-7901) cells into nude mice and mouse melanoma cells with ectopic expression of MICA (B16BL6-MICA) into C57BL/6 mice. Then, we studied the anti-tumor effects mediated by dsNKG2D-IL-15 in the two xenografted tumor models. Human dsNKG2D-IL-15 exhibited higher efficiency than IL-15 in suppressing gastric cancer growth. Exogenous human dsNKG2D-IL-15 was centrally distributed in the mouse tumor tissues based on in vivo live imaging. The frequencies of human CD56+ cells infiltrated into the tumor tissues following the injection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells into nude mice bearing human gastric cancer were significantly increased by human dsNKG2D-IL-15 treatment. Human dsNKG2D-IL-15 also delayed the growth of transplanted melanoma (B16BL6-MICA) by activating and recruiting mouse NK and CD8+ T cells. The anti-melanoma effect of human dsNKG2D-IL-15 in C57BL/6 mice was mostly decreased by the in vivo depletion of mouse NK cells.

Immunization with appropriate variants of syngeneic antigens can achieve this. However, improvements in vaccine design are needed for efficient cancer immunotherapy. Here we explore nine different chimeric vaccine designs, in which the antigen of interest is expressed as an in-frame fusion with polypeptides that impact antigen processing or presentation. In DNA immunization experiments in mice, three of nine fusions elevated relevant CD8(+) T-cell responses and tumor protection relative to an unfused melanoma antigen. These fusions were: Escherichia coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, and VP22 protein of herpes simplex virus-1. The gains of immunogenicity conferred by the latter two are independent of epitope presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). This finding has positive implications for immunotherapy in individuals with CD4(+) T-cell deficiencies. We present evidence that antigen instability is not a sine qua non condition for immunogenicity. Experiments using two additional melanoma antigens identified different optimal fusion partners, thereby indicating that the benefits of fusion vectors remain antigen specific. Therefore large fusion vector panels such as those presented here can provide information to promote the successful advancement of gene-based vaccines.",

Immunization of mice with HSP70 isolated from tumor tissues has been proved to elicit specific protective immunity against the original tumor. Recent researches have demonstrated that the ATPase domain of HSP70 and the tumor antigenic peptide that binds to Hsp70 were the crucial parts eliciting tumor-specific immunity. These findings suggested that a recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli, comprising a covalently fused fragment of tumor rejection antigen to ATPase domain of HSP70, could be used as a tumor vaccine. However, high-level expressions of heterologous recombinant proteins in E. coli often lead to the formation of inclusion bodies, resulting in defects in solubility and bioactivity. In the present work, we found an approach to resolve these problems, focusing on a refolding procedure via gel-filtration chromatography for denatured inclusion body proteins. Here, we expressed, purified and refolded a fusion protein comprising murine heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) N-terminal ATPase domain (Hsc70NTD) and a portion of TRP2 (aa153-417) as a model protein. The refolding effectivities were assessed according to their ATPase activities, the vaccine function was assessed according to immunization effect in inducing antigen-specific CTLs and to in vivo tumor protection.

The immunogenicity of SSX-2 has been previously corroborated by detection of specific humoral and CD8(+) T cell responses in cancer patients.

The absence of detectable response in healthy donors and other patients suggests that SSX-2-specific CD4(+) T cells in the responder patient had been previously expanded in vivo in response to the autologous tumor. The epitope did not appear to be presented on the surface of tumor cells at levels sufficient to allow direct recognition.

These modified antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were then used to induce RGS1-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in vitro. The CTLs generated from several healthy donors and a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) elicited an antigen-specific and HLA-A2- and -A3-restricted cytolytic activity against tumor cells endogenously expressing the RGS1 protein including renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), melanoma, ovarian carcinoma and the primary autologous CLL-blasts. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the in vitro induction of RGS1-specific CTLs by RNA-transfected DCs is feasible and highly effective. Since this molecule is (over-) expressed in a broad variety of malignancies it might represent an interesting novel TAA in the context of cancer vaccines designed to target RGS1 expressing tumor cells.",

IL-10 has been described as a cytokine of the Th2 response; it is able to suppress antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and may lead to down-regulation of HLA class I and II molecules on dendritic cells and to anergy of T-lymphocytes. We evaluated pretreatment serum levels of soluble IL-10 and various clinical parameters to determine their prognostic value in 80 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients seen at our institution between May 1990 and April 1996. For statistical evaluation we used both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. An elevated pretreatment serum level of IL-10 was a statistically independent predictor of unfavourable outcome (P < 0.0028), in addition to the well-known clinical and biochemical risk factors. These data support risk stratification for future therapeutic trials and identify a predictor which needs to be validated in prospective studies and may potentially influence decision making in palliative management of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. These data also suggest a potential role of IL-10 in the development of advanced renal cell carcinoma and in the future design of therapeutic strategies.",

For example KRAS mutations are very frequent in pancreatic cancers but relatively rare in melanomas. The opposite is true for BRAF mutations. Somatic mutations in the gene encoding for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KCA) catalytic subunit, PIK3CA, occur at high frequency in many solid cancers. We have examined whether PI3K oncogenic mutations (exons 9 and 20) might exhibit gender and/or tissue specificity. By examining large cohorts of breast and colorectal cancers affecting both men and women we found that the pattern of PIK3CA mutations is distinctive. In colorectal cancers, PIK3CA (but not KRAS, APC, or TP53) mutations display a gender bias occurring at higher frequencies in women. We also found that male breast cancers display PIK3CA mutations at an overall frequency similar to that observed in female breast tumors. In male breast cancers, however, PIK3CA mutations are found mainly in exon 20. We conclude that PI3KCA mutations affecting exons 9 and 20 display gender- and tissue-specific patterns, thus suggesting that the different amino acid changes could exert distinct functional effects on the oncogenic properties of this enzyme. Furthermore, we propose that sexual dimorphisms and tissue specific factors might directly or indirectly influence the occurrence of PI3KCA cancer alleles.",

A significant preventive antitumor immunity was achieved with the vaccine and two additional injections of CpG ODN (the proportion of protected mice was between 75% and 100%). In more than 80% of survivors, a long-lasting immunity was triggered. The therapy with the vaccine and two additional injections of CpG ODN significantly prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice. The rates of cured mice were 21.1% and 11.1% in mice with smaller or larger tumor masses, respectively. The mechanism of stimulation of the immune system by this kind of vaccine is likely to be through the augmentation of APC maturation (a significantly increased proportion of CD86+ CD11c+ was determined in vaccinated mice), consequent activation of T lymphocytes (the proportions of CD25+ and CD69+ splenic lymphocytes increased after the exposure to activated DCs) and establishment of memory cells.

Integrins play an essential role in cancer survival and invasion, and they have been major targets for drug development and design. Both native and recombinant disintegrins have been widely investigated for their anti-cancer activities in biological systems as well as in vitro and in vivo systems. Here, three new cDNAs encoding ECD disintegrin-like domains of metalloproteinase precursor sequences obtained from a Venezuelan mapanare (Bothrops colombiensis) venom gland cDNA library have been cloned. Three different N- and C-terminal truncated ECD disintegrin-like domains of metalloproteinases named colombistatins 2, 3, and 4 were amplified by PCR, cloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and tested for inhibition of platelet aggregation and inhibition of adhesion of human skin melanoma (SK-Mel-28) cancer cell lines on collagen I. Purified recombinant colombistatins 2, 3, and 4 were able to inhibit ristocetin- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. r-Colombistatins 2 showed the most potent inhibiting SK-Mel-28 cancer cells adhesion to collagen.

By studying HMGB1 release mechanisms, here we identify a role for double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR, also known as EIF2AK2) in inflammasome activation. Exposure of macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation. PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminium, rotenone, live Escherichia coli, anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection and Salmonella typhimurium infection. PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL-1β, IL-18 and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), NLRP1, NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC, also known as PYCARD) and pro-caspase-1 reconstitutes inflammasome activity.

An intelligenetics computer analysis yielded a single EF-hands calcium binding site on E. coli thioredoxin reductase with homology to the first EF-hands site on calmodulin. Calcium exchange from the enzyme requires the addition of the natural electron acceptor oxidized thioredoxin which causes a concentration dependent slow exchange. Due to the large conformational change caused by calcium binding to thioredoxin reductase it has been possible to separate Calcium-free and Calcium-bound enzyme by FPLC chromatography. Human keratinocytes contain 5% thioredoxin reductase in their acidic protein cytosol fraction. The influence of extracellular calcium concentration on the intracellular equilibrium between calcium bound versus calcium free thioredoxin reductase has been assessed.

Non-essential gene sequences located in highly conserved regions of virus genomes are considered particularly useful to integrate heterologous DNA.

Disruption of the F11L coding sequence by integration of an expression cassette for the Escherichia coli lacZ and guanine phosphoribosyltransferase marker genes resulted in the isolation of replication competent knockout viruses. Growth of F11L-knockout viruses in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts was unimpaired in comparison to wild type-virus. To test the generation of vector viruses, an insertion plasmid was constructed that contains F11L-specific sequences for homologous recombination, the E. coli lacZ and gpt genes as transient selectable marker, and the vaccinia virus early/late promoter P7.5 for transcriptional control of target gene expression. The coding sequence of the melanoma-associated antigen tyrosinase was chosen as model recombinant gene. Isolation of tyrosinase-recombinant viruses, which produced stably the insert, demonstrated the usefulness of the F11L-insertion site for the generation of fowlpox vectors.

In addition, evidence of clinical efficacy in advanced prostate cancer has been reported.

Because of these findings, we investigated the effects of PC-SPES in vitro in colon cancer cell lines SW480, SW620, and DLD-1 and in vivo in the Apc(min) mouse, a murine model for intestinal carcinogenesis. For the in vitro studies, colon cancer cell lines were exposed to an ethanolic extract of PC-SPES compared with a diluent control [ethanol < or = 0.3% (v/v)]. PC-SPES resulted in a marked suppression of cell proliferation in all colon cancer cells studied. PC-SPES (3 micro l/ml) caused a 95% inhibition of cell proliferation of the DLD-1 colon cancer cell line, and similar results were observed in the SW480 and SW620 colon cancer cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated a drastic (> or =60%) accumulation of cells in the G(2)-M phase with a concomitant decrease of cells in the G(0)-G(1) phase in all colon cancer cell lines studied after treatment with PC-SPES (1.5 micro l/ml for 48 h). Western blot analysis demonstrated a decrease in protein levels of beta-tubulin in the SW620 cell line exposed to PC-SPES. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling analysis revealed an increase in apoptotic colon cancer cells incubated with PC-SPES. For the in vivo studies, female 4-5-week-old Apc(min) mice were randomized to two groups: a PC-SPES-treated group (n = 11) received 250 mg/kg/day (0.2 ml) PC-SPES via gastrointestinal gavage; and a control group (n = 10) received 0.2 ml of the vehicle solution (1.5% carboxymethylcellulose with 0.2% Tween 20) via gastrointestinal gavage. Both groups were treated five times a week for 10 weeks. After treatment, the gastrointestinal tract was dissected for polyp scoring by two observers blinded to treatment. The Apc(min) mice given PC-SPES had a 58% reduction in tumor number and a 56% decrease in tumor load. No effect on either food intake or body weight was observed in the treated versus sham groups. The present study is the first to report the potent activity of PC-SPES against colon cancer. Both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis occurred after treatment with PC-SPES.

Herein we report the prevalence of childhood tumors (diagnosed<or=18 years of age) in families identified with mutation in the BRCA1/2, MMR and CDKN2A genes. Using pedigrees at the Regional Oncogenetic Clinic at Lund University Hospital, the prevalence of childhood cancer was estimated in families with mutations in the BRCA1 (n=98), BRCA2 (n=43) MMR (MLH1, MSH2 MSH6) (n=31) and CDKN2A (n=15) genes in comparison with population based control families (n=854).

Expression of the tPA gene in this vector was regulated by the inducible Escherichia coli lac elements, as well as a strong phage-T5-derived promoter and ribosome-binding site preceding the polylinker. The 5' end of the tPA gene corresponding to the N terminus of mature t-PA was fused in phase to the third codon present in the polylinker region of the expression vector, p602/22, to form p602-t-PA. B. subtilis containing p602-t-PA, when induced with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, produced large amounts of immunoreactive t-PA (approx. 20 micrograms/ml). As expected, t-PA was not secreted into the culture media, but was localized in intracellular inclusion bodies and was found to be enzymatically inactive. However, enzymatic activity could be regained following complete reduction followed by slow oxidation of the solubilized inclusion bodies. The recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) showed, after purification, a smaller molecular size than melanoma t-PA, probably due to lack of glycosylation in the Bacillus system.

Sequence analysis shows that CD53 is related to three other recently described molecules: a melanoma Ag, ME491; a B cell Ag, CD37; and the broadly distributed hemopoietic cell Ag S5.7. Comparison of NH2-terminal protein sequence of OX44 rat Ag and CD53 suggest that CD53 is the human homologue of OX44. In addition, CD53 is distantly related to Escherichia coli lac Y permease, a type III integral membrane protein that ferries lactose into the bacterial cell. CD53 transcripts increase in prevalence after mitogenic stimulation, suggesting that the protein may be involved in the transport of factors essential for cell proliferation.",

However, these agents are associated with the development of other nonmelanoma skin lesions, in particular squamoproliferative lesions such as keratoacanthomas (KAs), squamous cell carcinomas, and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses. The molecular pathogenesis of these lesions is of interest, not only for therapeutic reasons, but also for the insight it might provide into the development of similar lesions in a sporadic setting. We used next-generation sequencing to compare the mutational profiles of lesions after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, with similar lesions arising sporadically. HRAS mutations were common among the BRAF inhibitor-induced lesions, being identified in 56%, compared with 14% of lesions in the sporadic group (P = 0.002). Thus, despite similar histomorphological appearances, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be different. In addition, within the BRAF inhibitor-associated group, the lesions designated as KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses had a similar mutational profile (mutations in PIK3CA, APC, and HRAS), which was distinct to that seen in squamous cell carcinomas (FGFR3, CDKN2A, and STK11). We have previously noted histological overlap between KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses, and this finding supports the notion that they may represent morphological or temporal variants of a single lesion type.

Here, we developed a human-mouse chimeric model that allows us to investigate the roles of the frequency and self-reactivity of antigen-specific T cells in determination of the immunogenicity of an epitope (amino acids 209-217) derived from a human melanoma antigen, gp100. In these transgenic mice, CD8+ T cells express the variable regions of a human T cell receptor (hTCR) specific for an HLA-A*0201-restricted gp100(209-217). Immunization of hTCR-transgenic mice with gp100(209-217) peptide elicited minimal T cell responses, even in mice in which the epitope was knocked out. Conversely, a modified epitope, gp100(209-217(2M)), was significantly more immunogenic. Both biological and physical assays revealed a fast rate of dissociation of the native peptide from the HLA-A*0201 molecule and a considerably slower rate of dissociation of the modified peptide. In vivo, the time allowed for dissociation of peptide-MHC complexes on APCs prior to their exposure to T cells significantly affected the induction of immune responses. These findings indicate that the poor immunogenicity of some self/tumor antigens is due to the instability of the peptide-MHC complex rather than to the continual deletion or tolerization of self-reactive T cells.",

This study examined whether inoculation of DCs fused with poorly immunogenic tumor cells elicited tumor-reactive T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. DCs derived from bone marrow of C57BL/6 (B6) mice were fused with syngeneic B16 melanoma or RMA-S lymphoma cells by polyethylene glycol. The B16/DC and RMA-S/DC fusion hybrids expressed MHC class I, class II Ags, costimulatory molecules, as well as DC-specific and tumor-derived surface markers. The tumor/DC hybrids were capable of processing and presenting tumor-derived Ags, and immunization of B6 mice with irradiated B16/DC or RMA-S/DC vaccine elicited tumor-specific CTL activities. Vaccination of B6 mice with irradiated B16/DC fusion preparations induced partial host protective immunity against B16 tumor challenge. Reduced tumor incidence and prolonged survival time were observed. Adoptive transfer of T cells derived from B16/DC vaccine-primed lymph nodes into B16 tumor-bearing mice greatly reduced the number of established pulmonary metastases with or without in vivo administration of IL-2. Moreover, adoptive transfer of RMA-S/DC vaccine-primed, cultured lymph node T cells eradicated disseminated FBL-3 tumor.

The use of recombinant IFN-gamma has the advantage of being devoid of contaminating lymphokines. Two preparations of IFN-gamma were utilized, one which was not glycosylated and which was highly purified from Escherichia coli another which was glycosylated and which was from transfected COS-7 monkey cells. Both preparations of recombinant IFN-gamma activated murine macrophages to kill lymphoma and melanoma tumor targets, suggesting that glycosylation of the protein or the presence of other mammalian proteins is not essential for activation. Significant levels of cytolytic activity were induced from IFN-gamma (1 to 10 units/ml). This activity was undiminished by treatment of the IFN-gamma preparations with polymixin B at doses which neutralized endotoxin (50 micrograms/ml). Similarly, IFN-gamma, at low concentrations, induced an inhibition of migration by macrophages. Based on antiviral activity, IFN-gamma was shown to be 100 to 1000 times more potent than was IFN-beta as a macrophage-activating agent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that murine IFN-gamma is a macrophage-activating factor which is effective at physiological concentrations.

Data for each cancer site and sex were categorized into 10-year intervals by time period and age group. Significance testing for the curvilinear effects (which are estimable functions) of age (A), period (P), and cohort (C) in the 44 data sets led to no clear choice of model for three data sets; an APC model for 20, an AP model for 7, and an AC model for 14. These choices were corroborated by the RA2 index. Limitations in the interpretation of the results were enumerated. Presentation of population-based cancer rates by implicitly assuming an AP model is valuable (e.g., for studying age distribution in different regions or for age-adjustment in examining international variation or time trends). However, the assumption of an AP model may often be incorrect, as was shown to be the case for most of these 44 data sets.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a growth factor for myeloid progenitors of monocytes and dendritic cells (DC), which upon maturation are antigen-presenting cells (APC). The adjuvant effects of inoculation of DNA encoding GM-CSF into skin were studied. Initial experiments examined whether the GM-CSF gene injected into the skin of mice could affect the density of epidermal DC (Langerhans cells). DNA encoding GM-CSF delivered by particle bombardment into skin resulted in a significant increase of epidermal DC at the inoculation site. Kinetic analysis of epidermal recruitment after GM-CSF inoculation showed an increase in DC that peaked at seven days. This increase was accompanied by recruitment of DC into draining lymph nodes. The adjuvant effects of DNA encoding GM-CSF inoculated into skin were measured by the ability to augment antibody and T-cell responses against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Peptide immunization at skin sites containing epidermal DC newly recruited by GM-CSF DNA elicited T-cell responses against mutant p53, whereas peptide immunization of control skin sites did not elicit any detectable T-cell responses. Likewise, generation of antibodies following immunization with DNA encoding human gp75TRP1, a tyrosinase family member expressed by melanomas, was accelerated and protection from tumor challenge augmented by GM-CSF DNA.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Current research and development of antigens for vaccination often center on purified recombinant proteins, viral subunits, synthetic oligopeptides or oligosaccharides, most of them suffering from being poorly immunogenic and subject to degradation. Hence, they call for efficient delivery systems and potent immunostimulants, jointly denoted as adjuvants. Particulate delivery systems like emulsions, liposomes, nanoparticles and microspheres may provide protection from degradation and facilitate the co-formulation of both the antigen and the immunostimulant. Synthetic double-stranded (ds) RNA, such as polyriboinosinic acid-polyribocytidylic acid, poly(I:C), is a mimic of viral dsRNA and, as such, a promising immunostimulant candidate for vaccines directed against intracellular pathogens. Poly(I:C) signaling is primarily dependent on Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and on melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5), and strongly drives cell-mediated immunity and a potent type I interferon response. However, stability and toxicity issues so far prevented the clinical application of dsRNAs as they undergo rapid enzymatic degradation and bear the potential to trigger undue immune stimulation as well as autoimmune disorders. This review addresses these concerns and suggests strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of immunostimulatory dsRNA formulations. The focus is on technological means required to lower the necessary dosage of poly(I:C), to target surface-modified microspheres passively or actively to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), to control their interaction with non-professional phagocytes and to modulate the resulting cytokine secretion profile.

DinB is known to synthesize accurately across a number of N(2)-dG lesions. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a common byproduct of the ubiquitous glycolysis pathway and induces the formation of N(2)-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-CEdG) as the major stable DNA adduct. Here, we found that N(2)-CEdG could be detected at a frequency of one lesion per 10(7) nucleosides in WM-266-4 human melanoma cells, and treatment of these cells with MG or glucose led to a dose-responsive increase in N(2)-CEdG formation. We further constructed single-stranded M13 shuttle vectors harboring individual diastereomers of N(2)-CEdG at a specific site and assessed the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of the lesion in wild-type and bypass polymerase-deficient Escherichia coli cells. Our results revealed that N(2)-CEdG is weakly mutagenic, and DinB (i.e., polymerase IV) is the major DNA polymerase responsible for bypassing the lesion in vivo. Moreover, steady-state kinetic measurements showed that nucleotide insertion, catalyzed by E. coli pol IV or its human counterpart (i.e., polymerase kappa), opposite the N(2)-CEdG is both accurate and efficient. Taken together, our data support that N(2)-CEdG, a minor-groove DNA adduct arising from MG, is an important endogenous substrate for DinB DNA polymerase.",

The murine monoclonal antibody designated ZME-018 recognizes a high molecular weight glycoprotein present on most human melanoma cells and biopsy specimens and has been utilized for clinical imaging studies in patients with melanoma. The plant toxin gelonin is a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) with n-glycosidase activity similar to that of ricin A chain. In previous studies by our group, the gelonin toxin was sequenced, cloned and expressed in E. coli. The purified recombinant gelonin (RG) was found to have identical protein synthesis inhibitory activity to that of natural gelonin (NG). For comparative purposes, chemical conjugates of antibody ZME and either RG or NG were produced using the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents SPDP and SMPT. The ZME-NG and ZME-RG immunotoxins were found to be 10(4)- to 10(5)-fold more cytotoxic to antigen-positive human melanoma cells than free toxin. NG toxin alone was cytotoxic to intact cells (IC(50) = 100 nM) while RG was nontoxic to cells at doses up to 1 microM. Both ZME-NG and ZME-RG immunoconjugates were nontoxic to antigen-negative (Me-180) cells. ZME-RG immunotoxins constructed with the more stable SMPT reagent were slightly more effective in culture than conjugates made with SPDP. Tissue distribution studies in tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated that tumor uptake of the ZME-RG immunotoxin was similar to that of the intact ZME antibody with reduced distribution to normal organs compared to an immunoconjugate produced with NG. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the terminal-phase plasma half-life of ZME-RG was similar to that of ZME itself (42 h vs 50 h) and almost threefold higher than that of ZME-NG (11.5 h). The area under the concentration curve (Cxt) for ZME-RG was 50% lower than that for ZME due to an increased apparent volume of distribution (Vd(a)) but was almost tenfold higher than the Cxt for ZME-NG. These studies suggest that immunoconjugates comprising RG demonstrate identical in vitro cytotoxic effects to immunoconjugates produced with NG and immunotoxins with RG display improved in vivo pharmacodynamics and tissue distribution compared to immunotoxins containing NG.",

Here it functions as a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling receptor via NH(2)-terminal domain ligation. Auto-antibodies to this domain may appear in cancer patient serum where they are a poor prognostic indicator. Conversely, GRP78 COOH-terminal domain ligation is pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative. There is no method to disrupt cell-surface GRP78 without compromising the total GRP78 pool, making it difficult to study cell-surface GRP78 function. We studied six cell lines representing three cancer types. One cell line per group expresses high levels of cell-surface GRP78, and the other expresses low levels (human hepatoma: Hep3B and HepG2; human prostate cancer: PC3 and 1-LN; murine melanoma: B16F0 and B16F1). We investigated the effect of Escherichia coli subtilase cytoxin catalytic subunit (SubA) on GRP78. We report that SubA specifically cleaves cell-surface GRP78 on HepG2, 1-LN, and B16F1 cells without affecting intracellular GRP78. B16F0 cells (GRP78(low)) have lower amounts of cleaved cell-surface GRP78. SubA has no effect on Hep3B and PC3 cells. The predicted 28-kDa GRP78 COOH-terminal fragment is released into the culture medium by SubA treatment, and COOH-terminal domain signal transduction is abrogated, whereas pro-proliferative signaling mediated through NH(2)-terminal domain ligation is unaffected. These experiments clarify cell-surface GRP78 topology and demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain is necessary for pro-apoptotic signal transduction occurring upon COOH-terminal antibody ligation. SubA is a powerful tool to specifically probe the functions of cell-surface GRP78.",

Although Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients frequently present with neoplasms of the colon, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, breast, ovaries, and cervix, somatic mutations appear to be rare in the sporadic tumor types thus far studied (colorectal, gastric, testicular, and breast cancers). To evaluate whether somatic mutations of LKB1 contribute to the tumorigenesis of yet unstudied tumor types, we screened 14 cell lines and 129 tumor specimens from different cancers for a genetic defect in LKB1. Six melanoma and eight myeloma cell lines were scrutinized for LKB1 somatic mutations by genomic sequencing. No changes were found in the coding LKB1 sequence and exon/intron boundaries. Next, we analyzed 12 pancreatic, 8 gastric, 12 ovarian granulosa cell, 26 cervical, 28 lung, 24 soft tissue, and 19 renal tumors by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Three changes in LKB1 coding nucleotide sequence were identified. One base pair deletion at A957 and G958 substitution by T occurred in a cervical adenocarcinoma sample, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon at position 335. Substitution of A581 by T occurred in a lung adenocarcinoma sample, resulting in the change of aspartic acid at position 194 to valine. A loss of another allele was detected in this sample. One silent change, C1257T, was found in a pancreatic carcinoma sample. The changes were not present in the matched normal tissue DNA samples.

She was healthy without any medical conditions or medications. No family history of intestinal polyposis or mucosal melanosis existed. At presentation, she had less than 20 brownish-black, 2- to 10-mm irregular macules over the volar aspect of the thumbs and index fingers, left greater than right hand, associated with erythema, scale, and a negative potassium hydroxide examination. In addition, she had melanotic macules of her lips, buccal mucosa, and conjuctiva. No nail or anogenital macules were found. Biopsy demonstrated a region of epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and interface dermatitis associated with melanophages and sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. Melanin staining revealed diffuse pan-epidermal hypermelanization, dermal melanin, and dendritic melanocytes, which expressed HMB-45. After 1-year follow-up and treatment with topical corticosteroid, the volar macules have faded to tan brown. Based on the location, avocation, and coexisting mucosal melanotic macules, an irritant phytodermatitis with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was diagnosed in the setting of Laugier-Hunziker syndrome-a disorder denoted by macular hyperpigmentation of nail, volar, and/or mucosal surfaces in healthy adults. Volar melanotic macules can also complicate 5-flourouracil therapy, tinea pedis, and other inflammatory disorders; be associated with acral melanomas; or represent a cutaneous manifestation of systemic disease such as Addison disease, Peutz-Jegher syndrome, Leopard syndrome, Carney syndrome, AIDS, and neurofibromatosis.",

In contrast, combination treatments composed of IFN-alpha A and IFN beta 1 yielded inconsistent results. Some combinations reflected additive responses, whereas others were antagonistic. To examine correlations between IFN-induced biological activities and interactions of the different IFNs with cell surface receptors, in vivo [35S]methionine-labeled IFN-alpha A was prepared. Binding studies indicated the presence of 2,980 +/- 170 receptors per cell, each with an apparent Kd of (8.4 +/- 1.3) X 10(-11) M. Results from competitive binding studies suggested that Hs294T cells possess at least two types of IFN receptors: one which binds IFN-alpha A and IFN-beta 1 and another to which IFN-gamma binds.",

The overall infection rate of operations, classified as clean, clean--contaminated, and contaminated and dirty, was 13%. The surgical wound infection rate of 3% after clean operations was mainly caused by an elevated infection rate of 13% after clean operations of a prolonged duration and hyperthermic perfusion of the extremities in patients with melanoma. There is also a difference in nosocomial infection rates at the general surgery ward (11%) and at the intensive care unit (29%). At the intensive care unit candida and coagulase negative staphylococci are mainly isolated whereas Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis dominated the general surgery ward. Different operations show different distributions of isolates; operations on the pancreas are prone to have infections with coagulase negative staphylococci, candida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic susceptibility tests for the most commonly used antibiotics revealed no resistance problems for E. coli, E. faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, common pathogens at the general surgery ward, but did for coagulase-negative staphylococci where we can consider only a few antibiotics like amikacin in obvious infections at the intensive care unit.",

Based on the discovery that the adenylate cyclase from Bordetella pertussis binds to the CD11b/CD18 integrin, we developed a highly efficient detoxified adenylate cyclase-based vector (CyaA) capable of delivering a large variety of Ags to the APC. This vector allows the induction of protective and therapeutic immunity against viral and tumoral challenges as well as against transplanted tumors in the absence of any added adjuvant. Two therapeutic vaccine candidates against human papilloma viruses and melanoma have been developed recently, based on the CyaA vector, and are currently in clinical trials. We took advantage of one of these highly purified vaccines, produced under good manufacturing practice-like conditions, to decipher the mechanisms by which CyaA induces immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that CyaA binds both human and mouse CD11b(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and induces their maturation, as shown by the upregulation of costimulatory and MHC molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, we show that DCs sense CyaA through the TLR4/Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β pathway, independent of the presence of LPS. These findings show that CyaA possesses the intrinsic ability to not only target DCs but also to activate them, leading to the induction of strong immune responses. Overall, this study demonstrates that Ag delivery to CD11b(+) DCs in association with TLR4/Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β activation is an efficient strategy to promote strong specific CD8(+) T cell responses.

However, its therapeutic efficiency is limited to only production of prophylactic immunity against tumors. T cells can uptake DC-released EXO. However, the functional effect of transferred exosomal molecules on T cells is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that OVA protein-pulsed DC-derived EXO (EXO(OVA)) can be taken up by Con A-stimulated, nonspecific CD4(+) T cells derived from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The active EXO-uptaken CD4(+) T cells (aT(EXO)), expressing acquired exosomal MHC I/OVA I peptide (pMHC I) complexes and costimulatory CD40 and CD80 molecules, can act as APCs capable of stimulating OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and inducing efficient CD4(+) Th cell-independent CD8(+) CTL responses in vivo. The EXO(OVA)-uptaken CD4(+) aT(EXO) cell vaccine induces much more efficient CD8(+) T cell responses and immunity against challenge of OVA-transfected BL6-10 melanoma cells expressing OVA in wild-type C57BL/6 mice than EXO(OVA). The in vivo stimulatory effect of the CD4(+) aT(EXO) cell to CD8(+) T cell responses is mediated and targeted by its CD40 ligand signaling/acquired exosomal CD80 and pMHC I complexes, respectively. In addition, CD4(+) aT(EXO) vaccine stimulates a long-term, OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell memory. Therefore, the EXO(OVA)-uptaken CD4(+) T cells may represent a new, effective, EXO-based vaccine strategy in induction of immune responses against tumors and other infectious diseases.",

Our metaanalysis shows that in the majority of cases (more than 3100 patients), tumor growth positively correlates with the copper status indexes. Nude athymic CD-1 nu/nu mice with subcutaneous tumors of human origin, C57Bl/6J mice with murine melanoma and Apc(Min) mice with spontaneously developing adenomas throughout the intestinal tract were studied to experimentally determine the relationship between tumor progression, liver copper metabolism, and copper status indexes. We showed that the copper status indexes increased significantly during tumor growth. In the liver tissue of tumor-bearing mice, ceruloplasmin gene expression, as well as the expression of genes related to ceruloplasmin metallation (CTR1 and ATP7B), increased significantly. Moreover, the presence of an mRNA splice variant encoding a form of ceruloplasmin anchored to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidyl inositol, which is atypical for hepatocytes, was also detected. The ATP7A copper transporter gene, which is normally expressed in the liver only during embryonic copper metabolism, was also activated. Depletion of holo-ceruloplasmin resulted in retardation of human HCT116 colon carcinoma cell growth in nude mice and induced DNA fragmentation in tumor cells. In addition, the concentration of cytochrome c increased significantly in the cytosol, while decreasing in the mitochondria.

We provide evidence that patients with advanced breast and ovarian cancer can be efficiently vaccinated with autologous DC pulsed with HER-2/neu- or MUC1-derived peptides. In 5 of 10 patients, peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) could be detected in the peripheral blood using both intracellular IFN-gamma staining and Cr-release assays.

In a second patient immunized with the HER-2/neu peptides, MUC1-specific T lymphocytes were induced after seven immunizations, suggesting that antigen spreading in vivo might occur after successful immunization with a single tumor antigen. Currently we are analyzing the effect of T-helper epitopes and IL-2 on the CTL induction using peptide pulsed DC.

These subpopulations were ultrastructurally and immunophenotypically similar before culture. After a 20- to 96-h culture either alone, with recombinant human granulocyte-monocyte CSF, or with endotoxin, greater up-regulation of costimulatory molecule expression was observed among iDC than among monocytes, and only iDC expressed the activation molecule CD83. Treatment with rhIL-4 caused many MOMC to develop morphologic properties of dendritic cells within 96 h, but costimulatory molecule up-regulation and CD14 down-regulation were heterogeneous, and CD83 expression was infrequent. In contrast, calcium ionophore (CI) treatment induced rapid and consistent effects in MOMC from both healthy volunteers and cancer patients, including down-regulated CD14 expression, acquisition of dendritic cell morphologic properties, up-regulated MHC and costimulatory molecule expression, and de novo CD83 expression. Many such effects occurred within 20 h of treatment. CI treatment activated purified CD14+ monocytes and also enhanced the spontaneous activation of purified CD14-/dim iDC in culture. Unfractionated MOMC, purified monocytes, and purified iDC displayed equivalently enhanced T cell-sensitizing efficiency following CI treatment. CD4+ T cell sensitization to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and CD8+ T cell sensitization to MART-1 melanoma-associated peptide were achieved in a single culture stimulation.

BGs are ideally suited as an advanced drug delivery system (ADDS) for toxic substances in tumor therapy. The inner space of BGs can be loaded with either single components or combinations of peptides, drugs or DNA which provides an opportunity to design new types of (polyvalent) drug delivery vehicles. Uptake of BGs loaded with Doxorubicin (Dox) by CaCo2 cells led to effective Dox release from endo-lysosomal compartments and accumulation in the nucleus. Viability and proliferative capacity of the cells were significantly decreased (2-3 orders of magnitude) after internalization of Dox loaded BGs as compared to cells incubated with free Dox. The same effect was observed with leukemia cells. Melanoma cells also revealed a high capability to internalize BGs. These results indicate that BGs are able to target a range of types of cancer. BGs have also been investigated as DNA delivery vectors.

However, large-scale production of L49-sFv-bL from refolded E. coli inclusion bodies has been problematic due to inefficient refolding and instability of the fusion protein. Sequence analysis of the L49-sFv framework regions revealed three residues in the framework regions at positions L2, H82B, and H91, which are not conserved for their position, occurring in <1% of sequences in Fv sequence databases. One further unusual residue, found in <3% of variable sequences, was observed at position H39. Each unusual residue was mutated to a conserved residue for its position and tested for refolding yield from inclusion bodies following expression in E. coli. The three V(H) single mutants showed improvement in the yield of active protein and were combined to form double and triple mutants resulting in a 7-8-fold increased yield compared to the parental protein. In an attempt to further improve yield, the orientation of the triple mutant was reversed to create a bL-L49-sFv fusion protein resulting in a 3-fold increase in expressed inclusion body protein and producing a 20-fold increase in the yield of purified protein compared to the parental protein. The triple mutants in both orientations displayed increased stability in murine plasma and binding affinity was not affected by the introduced mutations. Both triple mutants also displayed potent in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor activity against p97 expressing melanoma cells and tumor xenografts, respectively. These results show that a rational protein-engineering approach improved the yield, stability, and refolding characteristics of L49-sFv-bL while maintaining binding affinity and therapeutic efficacy.",

Here we describe the design, production, and characterization of the effects of bacterially expressed modular recombinant transporters for PSs comprising 1) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone as an internalizable, cell-specific ligand; 2) an optimized nuclear localization sequence of the SV40 large T-antigen; 3) an Escherichia coli hemoglobin-like protein as a carrier; and 4) an endosomolytic amphipathic polypeptide, the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin. These modular transporters delivered PSs into the nuclei, the most vulnerable sites for the action of PSs, of murine melanoma cells, but not non-MSH receptor-overexpressing cells, to result in cytotoxic effects several orders of magnitude greater than those of nonmodified PSs.

The tTA vector encodes a transactivator protein and the tetP vector contains a responsive operator-promoter element (tetP) that controls gene expression depending on tTA binding. Establishment of cell lines expressing a gene of interest under tetP control requires two subsequent rounds of transfection and clonal selection after each transfection. Here we describe a modification of this system in which the tetP element is placed in an episomal EBNA-based plasmid that can be stably maintained in primate but not in rodent cells. Using HeLa and human melanoma cells, we show that upon transient or stable transfection a reporter gene is expressed in a Tc-regulated manner similar to the original system.

In order to study the molecular mechanisms of heme-mediated induction of human heme oxygenase, we have isolated and characterized the genomic clones for heme oxygenase. The human heme oxygenase gene (HO gene) is about 14 kb long and organized into five exons. The transcription initiation site was identified by S1 nuclease mapping and primer-extension analyses. Using HeLa whole cell extracts, we confirmed that the transcription of the cloned HO gene is initiated accurately at the assigned initiation site. In its 5'-flanking region, a potential heat-shock element (HSE) is present 367 bp upstream from the initiation site, although, in contrast to rat heme oxygenase, human enzyme is not induced by heat shock. We therefore analyzed the effects of heat shock on the transient expression of chimeric fusion genes harboring the promoter of the human HO gene ligated to the Escherichia coli gene gpt in mouse amelanotic melanoma cells. The 5'-flanking region of the human HO gene bearing a potential HSE failed to confer the heat-inducibility of gpt RNA production, suggesting that the HSE of the human HO gene is not functional.",

In both treatments, the heme oxygenase activity started to increase after a lag period of about 1 h and reached a maximum value at 5 h. There was an apparent additive effect of both treatments on the heme oxygenase induction. Studies with actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggested that both heat shock and hemin acted at the transcriptional level to induce heme oxygenase.

Magainins are broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents exhibiting cidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and protozoa. In addition these peptides lyse many types of murine and human cancer cells at concentrations 5-10-fold lower than normal human cells. Because of their selectivity, broad spectrum, low degree of bacterial resistance and ease of chemical synthesis, magainins are being developed as human therapeutic agents. The most advanced candidate is MSI-78, a 22-residue magainin analogue. This peptide is currently in human Phase IIb/III clinical trials in studies intended to evaluate its efficacy as a topical agent for the treatment of impetigo.

To selectively target the methionine dependence of tumors for treatment on a large-scale preclinical and clinical basis, the L-methionine alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (methioninase, METase) gene from Pseudomonas putida has been cloned in Escherichia coli using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The METase gene was then ligated into the pT7-7 overexpression plasmid containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and recloned in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The pAC-1 clone was isolated by its yellow-orange color which is due to high enrichment of the pyridoxal phosphate-containing recombinant methioninase (rMETase) and distinguished rMETase-overproducer from rMETase-negative colonies. A scale-up production protocol which contained a heat step, two DEAE Sepharose FF ion-exchange, and one ActiClean Etox endotoxin-affinity chromatography columns has been established. The pAC-1 clone produces rMETase at approximately 10% of the total soluble protein and up to 1 g/liter in shake-flask culture. The protocol can produce therapeutic rMETase at the multi-gram level per batch with high yield (> 60%), high purity (> 98%), high stability, and low endotoxin. Purified rMETase is stable to lyophilization. The t1/2 of rMETase was 2 h when rMETase was administered by i.v. injection in mice. Studies of the antitumor efficacy of rMETase in vitro and in vivo on human tumors xenografted in nude mice demonstrated that all types of human tumors tested including those from lung, colon, kidney, brain, prostate, and melanoma were sensitive to rMETase. In contrast, normal cells were insensitive to rMETase in vitro and correspondingly, no toxicity was detected in vivo at the effective doses. In conclusion, the overexpression clone and large-scale production protocols for rMETase have enabled rMETase to be used as a tumor-selective therapeutic with broad indication and high promise for effective, low-toxicity human cancer therapy.",

Most MMPs are composed of a regulatory, a catalytic, and a hemopexin subunit. In many tumors the expression of MMP-9 correlates with local tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. To analyze the role of the hemopexin domain in these processes, the MMP-9 hemopexin domain (MMP-9-PEX) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After proteolytic cleavage, the isolated PEX domain was purified by size exclusion chromatography. In a zymography assay, MMP-9-PEX was able to inhibit MMP-9 activity. The association and dissociation rates for the interaction of MMP-9-PEX with gelatin were determined by plasmon resonance. From the measured rate constants, the dissociation constant was calculated to be K(d) = 2,4 x 10(-8) m, demonstrating a high affinity between MMP-9-PEX and gelatin. In Boyden chamber experiments the recombinant MMP-9-PEX was able to inhibit the invasion of melanoma cells secreting high amounts of MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrate for the first time that the hemopexin domain of MMP-9 has a high affinity binding site for gelatin, and the particular recombinant domain is able to block MMP-9 activity and tumor cell invasion. Because MMP-9 plays an important role in metastasis, this antagonistic effect may be utilized to design MMP inhibition-based cancer therapy.",

By immunostaining, ADAM 12 (meltrin alpha) was up-regulated in several human carcinomas and could be detected along the tumor cell membranes. Because of this intriguing staining pattern, we investigated whether human ADAM 12 supports tumor cell adhesion. Using an in vitro assay using recombinant polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli, we examined the ability of individual domains of human ADAM 12 and ADAM 15 to support tumor cell adhesion. We found that the disintegrin-like domain of human ADAM 15 supported adhesion of alphavbeta3-expressing A375 melanoma cells. In the case of human ADAM 12, however, recombinant polypeptides of the cysteine-rich domain but not the disintegrin-like domain supported cell adhesion of a panel of carcinoma cell lines. On attachment to recombinant polypeptides from the cysteine-rich domain of human ADAM 12, most tumor cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, were rounded and associated with numerous actin-containing filopodia and used a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan to attach. Finally, we demonstrated that authentic full-length human ADAM 12 could bind to heparin Sepharose. Together these results suggest a novel role of the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM 12 -- that of supporting tumor cell adhesion.",

Purified hIL4-PE4E was very cytotoxic to cancer cell lines of both hematopoietic and solid tumor origin. In the HUT 102 T cell leukemia and Daudi B cell lymphoma cell lines, protein synthesis was inhibited by 50% (ID50) at a hIL4-PE4E concentration of 2 and 7 ng/ml (25 and 86 pM, respectively). hIL4-PE4E was also very cytotoxic to cell lines derived from carcinomas of the colon, breast, stomach, liver, adrenals, and prostate, as well as melanoma and epidermoid carcinoma, indicating that hIL4 receptors are widely expressed on human malignancies. We also found that human phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes were extremely sensitive to hIL4-PE4E with an ID50 of 0.2 ng/ml (2.5 pM).

Glucan sulfate was derived from insoluble beta-1,3-D-glucan isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proposed repeating unit empirical formula of glucan sulfate is [(C6H10O5)5.3H2SO4]n. Two polymer peaks were resolved by aqueous high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) with on-line multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) photometry and differential viscometry. Peak 1 (MW = 1219697 Da) represents approximately 1% of the total polymers, while peak 2 (MW = 8884 Da) accounts for approximately 99% of polymers. 13C-NMR spectroscopy suggests that glucan sulfate polymer strands may be partially cross-linked. Glucan sulfate (250 mg/kg, i.v.) increased (P less than 0.01) macrophage vascular clearance of 131I-reticuloendothelial emulsion by 42% (P less than 0.01) and in vitro bone marrow proliferation by 46% (P less than 0.05).

In addition, glucan sulfate immunoprophylaxis increased resistance of mice to challenge with Escherichia coli, Candida albicans or Mouse Hepatitis Virus strain A-59. We concluded that: (1) insoluble beta-1,3-D-glucan can be converted to a water soluble sulfated form; (2) glucan sulfate activates macrophages and stimulates bone marrow; (3) glucan sulfate exerts antitumor therapeutic activity, and (4) glucan sulfate immunoprophylaxis will modify the course of experimental infectious disease.",

At concentrations of 2-10 micro g/ml, RDD exhibited inhibitory activities in a variety of in vitro functional assays, including endothelial cell proliferation and adhesion on the integrin substrates fibronectin, vitronectin, and fibrinogen. RDD (10 micro g/ml) totally abrogated endothelial cell migration and blocked most capillary formation in a three-dimensional fibrin gel. To test RDD efficacy in vivo, the RDD gene inserted into pBi vector containing a tetracycline-inducible promoter was electrotransferred into nude mouse muscle. RDD was successfully synthesized by muscle cells in vivo as shown by immunolabeling and Western blotting. In addition, 78% less MDA-MB-231 tumor growth, associated with strong inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, was observed in athymic mice bearing electrotransferred RDD. Moreover, in the presence of RDD, 74% fewer B16F10 melanoma lung metastases were found in C57BL/6 mice. Taken together, these results identified this RDD as a potent intrinsic inhibitor of angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis, making it a promising tool for use in anticancer treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Historically, chemotherapy has remained the most commonly utilized therapy in patients with metastatic cancers. In prostate cancer, chemotherapy has been reserved for patients whose metastatic disease becomes resistant to first line castration or androgen deprivation. While chemotherapy palliates, decreases serum prostate specific antigen and improves survival, it is associated with significant side effects and is only suitable for approximately 60% of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. On that basis, exploration of other therapeutic options such as active secondary hormone therapy, bone targeted treatments and immunotherapy are important. Until recently, immunotherapy has had no role in the treatment of solid malignancies aside from renal cancer and melanoma. The FDA-approved autologous cellular immunotherapy sipuleucel-T has demonstrated efficacy in improving overall survival in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in randomized clinical trials. The proposed mechanism of action is reliant on activating the patients' own antigen presenting cells (APCs) to prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) fused with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and subsequent triggered T-cell response to PAP on the surface of prostate cancer cells in the patients body. Despite significant prolongation of survival in Phase III trials, the challenge to health care providers remains the dissociation between objective changes in serum PSA or on imaging studies after sipleucel-T and survival benefit. On that basis there is an unmet need for markers of outcome and a quest to identify immunologic or clinical surrogates to fill this role. This review focuses on the impact of sipuleucel-T on the immune system, the T and B cells, and their responses to relevant antigens and prostate cancer. Other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy, corticosteroids and GM-CSF and host factors can also affect immune response. The optimal timing for immunotherapy, patient selection and best sequencing with other prostate cancer therapies remain to be determined. A better understanding of immune response may help address these issues. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The T cells of many cancer patients are naturally sensitized to tumor-associated antigens (Ag), or they can readily be sensitized with vaccine maneuvers. In melanoma patients, the adoptive transfer of such T cells can often be causally linked to the objective regression of established tumors. So far, few patients have shown sustained clinical benefit from such therapy, but preclinical mouse studies have now clearly delineated the hurdles that must be overcome to render T-cell-based antitumor therapy effective. Contrary to earlier expectations, it is now established that remarkably potent CD4+ and CD8+ pre-effector T cells are naturally sensitized even in mice bearing progressive, weakly immunogenic tumors. However, such T cells often display signal transduction impairments as a consequence of the tumor environment, which limit their acquisition of optimal effector function. Extracorporealization and culture of these tumor-sensitized T cells with appropriate activation stimuli not only restores normal signal transduction, but also confers resolute effector activity that can often sustain tumor rejection upon reinfusion. In mouse studies, the L-selectin(low) fraction of T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) constitutes the potent pre-effector population and comprises both CD4+ and helper-independent CD8+ T cells. Appropriate in vitro activation confers an apparently unrestricted trafficking capacity to this fraction, and even the ability to proliferate within the tumor bed, leading to unprecedented tumor rejection at anatomic sites (e.g., subcutaneous and intracranial) that were historically refractory to such treatment. Such results underscore the surprising capacity of appropriately activated effector T cells to withstand the immunosuppressive, tolerogenic, and apoptotic influences of the typical tumor environment. Given the increasingly appreciated and critical communications between T cells and host Ag-presenting cells (APC), which cross-present tumor Ag, it is likely that dendritic cell-based vaccine maneuvers that promote sensitization of T1-committed L-selectin(low) antitumor T cells will play an increasingly important role in adoptive therapy strategies.",

However, many of the details of the modes of action of septins in general remain unclear, and little is known of their detailed molecular architecture. Here, we define explicitly and characterize the domains of human SEPT4. Regions corresponding to the N-terminal, GTPase, and C-terminal domains as well as the latter two together were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble form and purified by affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies. The purified domains were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and small-angle X-ray scattering, as well as with bioinformatics tools. Of the three major domains that comprise SEPT4, the N-terminal domain contains little regular secondary structure and may be intrinsically unstructured. The central GTPase domain is a mixed alpha/beta structure, probably based on an open beta sheet. As defined here, it is catalytically active and forms stable homodimers in vitro. The C-terminal domain also forms homodimers and can be divided into two regions, the second of which is alpha-helical and consistent with a coiled-coil structure.

We present a gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) approach to target tumours in vivo by modifying endothelial cells (ECs) with the Escherichia coli nitroreductase (ntr) gene. Firstly, we isolated two ntr-transfected clones of the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUV-EC-C/ntr+) that showed a differential sensitivity in vitro to the prodrug, dinitroaziridinylbenzamide (CB1954), with respect to untransfected HUV-EC-C cells (HUV-EC-C/ntr-). Then, these cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, either in association with the murine melanoma cell line, B16-F10 ('co-injected' groups), or into tumour-bearing animals ('post-injected' groups). After intratumoural injection, we demonstrated, using PCR analysis, that human ECs resided in the site of the injection without spreading to other organs, such as the liver or lung. After the treatment of mice with CB1954, we observed a prolonged survival of animals carrying the HUV-EC-C/ntr+ clones with respect to control animals injected with HUV-EC-C/ntr- cells. Significant differences in tumour growth were also observed and, after immuno-histological analysis, tumours carrying HUV-EC-C/ntr+ clones showed large areas of tumour necrosis, probably due to tumour ischemia, as well as the presence of major histocompatibility complex class-II (MHC-II) positive cells. Collectively, our data indicate that targeting of the tumour vasculature by this GDEPT strategy may be an efficient approach for cancer treatment in vivo, depending on two possible bystander mechanisms based on tumour ischemia and immune cell activation.",

Its effectiveness against brain tumors such as glioblastomas has not been studied. The meningitis-causing bacterium Neisseria meningitidis also harbors an azurin-like protein. Unlike all other known azurins, Neisserial azurin, termed Laz, is surface-exposed and has in its N-terminal region a 39 amino acid epitope called H.8. Upstream of this H.8 moiety is a lipobox that results in the truncation of the protein at the N-terminal cysteine residue with modification by a lipid group. No function of Laz is known. We demonstrate that while Paz is deficient in entering glioblastoma cells and exhibits low cytotoxicity, Laz is much more proficient in entering glioblastoma cells and shows a higher level of cytotoxicity. When the Neisserial H.8 moiety containing the lipobox is fused in frame with Paz either in its N-terminal (H.8-Paz) or in its C-terminal (Paz-H.8), both had high cytotoxicity for glioblastoma cells and a higher level of internalization. When expressed in E. coli, H.8-Paz was much more exposed on the surface than Paz-H.8. The replacement of the Laz N-terminal cysteine residue involved in acylation with an alanine residue abolished the surface display, but had no effect on cytotoxicity or entry in glioblastoma cells, suggesting a role of the H.8 moiety, but not its lipidation, in disrupting the entry barrier in brain tumor cells.",

To develop a potential laboratory test for DNS, we utilized the observation that an ultraviolet light (UV)-treated mutagenesis plasmid shuttle vector has an abnormally increased frequency of mutations after transfection into lymphoblastoid cells from a patient with familial DNS. pSP189 (containing the bacterial suppressor tRNA gene supF as a marker for mutations and a gene for ampicillin resistance for selection) was treated with UV and transfected into familial DNS, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XP-A), and normal lymphoblastoid cells by electroporation or diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran. Untreated plasmid pZ189K (containing a gene for kanamycin resistance) was co-transfected as an internal standard to reduce the variability of plasmid survival measurements. After 2 d, plasmids were extracted, used to transform an indicator strain of Escherichia coli, and assayed on plates containing ampicillin or kanamycin. Counting light blue or white colonies (containing mutated supF in the plasmid) and blue colonies (with wild type supF) permitted measurement of the plasmid survival and mutation frequency. Transfection by electroporation or DEAE dextran resulted in abnormally reduced survival of UV-treated plasmid after passage through the XP-A but normal survival in the three DNS lines. Transfection of UV-treated plasmid by DEAE dextran yielded a greater hypermutability with the familial DNS lines than by electroporation. These results suggest that pSP189 UV hypermutability with normal UV survival using DEAE dextran transfection may form the basis of a potential laboratory assay for familial DNS.",

As well as potentially having important physiological actions, it is of interest as a therapeutic agent due to its lack of calcemic activity. In the current study we have examined the ability of CYP24A1, the enzyme that inactivates 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), to metabolize 20(OH)D(3). Rat CYP24A1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and assayed with substrates incorporated into phospholipid vesicles which served as a model of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this system CYP24A1 metabolized 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) with a catalytic efficiency 1.4-fold higher than that seen for 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)). CYP24A1 hydroxylated 20(OH)D(3) to several dihydroxy-derivatives with the major two identified by NMR as 20,24-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (20,24(OH)(2)D(3)) and 20,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (20,25(OH)(2)D(3)). The catalytic efficiency of CYP24A1 for 20(OH)D(3) metabolism was more than 10-fold lower than for either 25(OH)D(3) or 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and no secondary metabolites were produced. The two major products, 20,24(OH)(2)D(3) and 20,25(OH)(2)D(3), caused significantly greater inhibition of colony formation by SKMEL-188 melanoma cells than either 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) or the parent 20(OH)D(3), showing that CYP24A1 plays an activating, rather than an inactivating role on 20(OH)D(3).",

In this report, recombinant PEBP1 was successfully expressed in an Escherichia coli system. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PEBP1 with high specificity and affinity was generated and characterized using ELISA, western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining and immunohistochemical staining. PEBP1 expression in normal 293 cells and a few pancreatic cancer cell lines was detected with mAb 7F12 in western blot analysis. To screen for a pair of mAbs with optimal binding affinity to soluble PEBP1, ForteBio's Octet system was used. Sandwich ELISA with mAb pair 4F10 and 8E2 showed a linear correlation between absorbance and PEBP1 protein concentration over a range of 7 to 100 ng/ml. MAb 4A11 detected a high level expression of PEBP1 in normal pancreatic tissue, and cancer adjacent normal pancreatic tissue in a pancreatic tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 80 human tissue cores. Pancreatic cancer tissues show a no or very weak staining intensity of PEBP1. In 69 valid cases, PEBP1 expression was significantly lower in tumor than in normal pancreas (p=8.40E-14) and adjacent normal tissue (p=8.46E-17). PEBP1 expression in pancreatic cancer was not associated with pTMN stage, differentiation grade and pathologic diagnosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that PEBP1 overexpresses in normal pancreas but significantly decreases its expression in pancreatic cancer tissues.

NMHE has a methyl group at nitrogen 2 on the ellipticine ring while DHE possesses a basic diethylaminoethyl chain at this position. Compared to NMHE, the presence of the diethylaminoethyl side chain results in the following: a significant increase in the lipophilicity of the drug; no significant modification in either the binding constant values to DNA or the ability to intercalate between DNA base pairs; a marked decrease in the unwinding angle value of supercoiled DNA; and no significant change in the alteration of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II in vitro. DHE appears to act as a simple reversible intercalating agent as shown by the selective mutagenic effect on Salmonella TA 1977 tester strain and by its inability to induce the SOS functions in a sfiA lac fusion containing Escherichia coli strain. From a pharmacological point of view, the presence of the diethylaminoethyl chain results in a 2-fold increase in the cytotoxicity to L1210 cultured cells, a strong increase in the antitumor efficiency on experimental murine tumors such as L1210 and P388 leukemia, B16 melanoma, M 5076 reticulosarcoma, and colon 38 adenocarcinoma, and finally an objective decrease in the acute and subacute toxicity in mice, rat, and macaque. The absence of significant differences in the interaction of NMHE and DHE with their potential targets in vitro leads to the hypothesis that the superiority of DHE in terms of cytotoxicity and antitumor efficiency may be due to an increase in the diffusion across cellular membrane and a more favorable biodistribution in vivo.",

One reason is the shortage of suitable radiotracer methods. We report a novel methodology using recombinant human S100A4 as potential probe for molecular imaging and functional characterization of this interaction. Therefore, human S100A4 was cloned as GST fusion protein in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-1 and expressed in E. coli strain BL21. Purified recombinant human S100A4 was radiolabeled with the positron emitter fluorine-18 ((18)F) by conjugation with N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB). The radioligand [(18)F]fluorobenzoyl-S100A4 ((18)F-S100A4) was used in cell binding experiments in RAGE-bearing human melanoma cells and endothelial cells in vitro, and in both biodistribution experiments and small animal positron emission tomography (PET) studies in normal rats in vivo. The cellular association and tissue-specific distribution of (18)F-S100A4 in vitro and in vivo correlated well with the protein expression and anatomical localization of RAGE, e.g., in the vascular system and in lung. Compared to other S100 RAGE radioligands, the overall findings of this study indicate that extracellular S100A4 in vivo shows only a moderate interaction with RAGE and, furthermore, exhibits a substantially faster metabolic degradation. On the other hand, the approach allows the use of quantitative small animal PET and provides a novel probe to both delineate functional expression and differentiate multiligand interaction of RAGE under normal and pathophysiological conditions in rodent models of disease.",

They play an antimutagenic role by preventing the incorporation of promutagenic 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA. MTH1 gene expression is higher in some physiological types of mammalian cells and in numerous cancer cells, but the mechanism of that upregulation still remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that MTH1 expression might be associated with a proliferation rate of the cells. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the functional levels of MTH1 gene expression measured as the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity of its protein products in normal mouse livers and hepatectomized regenerating livers. Although the proliferation rate of the hepatocytes in the regenerating livers was much higher than that in control livers, as confirmed by immunohistochemical assay of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was not different. In a second approach, we used 57 lines of human cancer cells in which 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was measured and confronted with cell population doubling time. No significant correlations between 8-oxo-dGTPase activity and proliferation rate were observed within groups of six leukemia, eight melanoma, nine lung, seven colon, six central nervous system, six ovarian, eight renal, and seven breast cancer cell lines. Thus, we conclude that the MTH1 expression manifested as the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity of its protein products in mammalian cells is not associated with proliferation rate.

The mode of action of the Escherichia coli homolog DnaK is representative of all HSP70 chaperones, including the endoplasmic reticulum variant BiP/GRP78. DnaK has been shown to be effective in assisting refolding of a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, including the alpha-helical homodimeric secretory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We screened solid-phase peptide libraries from human and mouse IFN-gamma to identify DnaK-binding sites. Conserved DnaK-binding sites were identified in the N-terminal half of helix B and in the C-terminal half of helix C, both of which are located at the IFN-gamma dimer interface. Soluble peptides derived from helices B and C bound DnaK with high affinity in competition assays. No DnaK-binding sites were found in the loops connecting the alpha-helices. The helix C DnaK-binding site appears to be conserved in most members of the superfamily of interleukin (IL)-10-related cytokines that comprises, apart from IL-10 and IFN-gamma, a series of recently discovered small secretory proteins, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22/IL-TIF, IL-24/MDA-7 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene), IL-26/AK155, and a number of viral IL-10 homologs. These cytokines belong to a relatively small group of homodimeric proteins with highly interdigitated interfaces that exhibit the strongly hydrophobic character of the interior core of a single-chain folded domain. We propose that binding of DnaK to helix C in the superfamily of IL-10-related cytokines may constitute the hallmark of a novel conserved regulatory mechanism in which HSP70-like chaperones assist in the formation of a hydrophobic dimeric \"folding\" interface.",

A live attenuated purine-auxotrophic strain of S. typhimurium (SC36) was used to carry the pEGFP-C1-ePNP vector that contains a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an ePNP gene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.

We also observed a high bystander effect induced by the ePNP/MePdR system with a very low proportion (1%) of ePNP-positive cells. The killing effect and increased apoptosis induced by SC/ePNP (SC36 carrying the ePNP expression vector) infection were detected by cytotoxicity assay and PI staining flow cytometry analysis, in combination with MePdR administration. Furthermore, SC/ePNP was administered orally into mice bearing melanomas or pulmonary tumors, and its anti-tumor effect was evaluated. When the tumor was huge (500 mm(3)) at the beginning of MePdR administration, SC/ePNP plus MepdR significantly inhibited tumor growth by about 59-80% and prolonged survival of mice. Complete tumor regression and long-term cure were achieved by MePdR administration, even when the tumor was large (100 mm(3)) at the beginning of MePdR treatment.

IL-2 has been demonstrated to have substantial activity alone or in combination with the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer cells in murine tumor models. IL-2 derived from both natural (Jurkat human T-cell tumor) and recombinant (Escherichia coli) sources has been studied in Phase I protocols designed to evaluate toxicity in patients with a variety of solid tumors and to ascertain improvement in clinical parameters and immunologic status. A total of 16 patients (7 with acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS] and 9 with non-AIDS malignancies) were treated with Jurkat derived IL-2. The total maximum dose (1.3 X 10(5) U/kg) was limited only by supply of this reagent. A total of 25 patients have been treated with recombinant IL-2 (RIL-2) alone. Dose-limiting toxicity manifested by marked malaise and weight gain was achieved with doses of RIL-2 of 10(6) U/kg as a single bolus or 3000 U/kg/hr. IL-2 could be administered intraperitoneally with similar toxicity. Minimal renal or hepatic toxicity was demonstrated. Hematologic toxicity was limited to mild anemia (25/25), thrombocytopenia (10/25), and marked reversible eosinophilia (15/25). Pronounced weight gain greater than 2 kg (16/25) occurred in most patients, primarily those who received cumulative doses of greater than 1-3 X 10(5) U/kg of IL-2. The weight gain amounted to as much as 10% to 20% of the pretreatment weight over 3 weeks of treatment and limited our ability to give higher doses. Two partial responses (greater than 50% decrease in cross sectional diameters) were seen in two patients with melanoma metastatic to the lung.",

Comparison of the properties of strongly metastatic variants to their related, less metastatic counterparts offers a generally accepted approach to the discovery of metastasis-associated characteristics. The chemically induced murine lymphoma line Eb and its spontaneously arising variant ESb with increased potential for lung and liver colonization, the virally induced lymphosarcoma cell line RAW117-P and its in vivo selected variant H10 with increased potential for liver colonization, and the B16-F1 melanoma line and its in vivo selected variant F10 with increased potential for lung colonization, were chosen. A panel of 12 types of chemically glycosylated E. coli beta-galactosidase, exposing the pivotal carbohydrate residues for specific carbohydrate-dependent cell binding, was employed to study the expression of respective cell-surface sugar receptors on these cell lines. Specific binding occurred in a non-uniform manner for the individual probes. Systematic measurements at a non-saturating ligand concentration revealed quantitative differences between the 2 cell lines of each system. However, there were no consistent changes associated with the metastatic phenotype. A similar result was obtained employing Scatchard analyses for quantitative evaluation of binding characteristics in several cases. Surface receptor expression was responsive to chemical induction of differentiation in the lymphosarcoma model. Analyses of sugar-inhibitable cell adhesion to neoglycoprotein-coated plastic wells for the lymphoma and lymphosarcoma cells revealed that the presence of cell-surface sugar receptors, even at similar densities to those defined by neoglycoenzyme binding, will not necessarily translate into an identical adhesive response. Several carbohydrates, especially N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, can differentially affect this interaction at a non-toxic concentration in both model systems.",

Primary cell cultures derived from these tumors adsorbed technetium-99m labeled, antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (99mTc EA) as determined either by visual scoring of adherence or radioisotopic quantitation. Depending upon the tumor tested, from 20% to greater than 95% of the target cells absorbed 99mTc EA. All cells lost their reactivity after 1 or 2 passages in vitro, but this was regained after a single passage in vivo. Indicator erythrocytes coated with F(ab')2 fragments of the sensitizing sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) antiserum did not adhere thereby demonstrating that the hemadsorption required an intact Fc portion of the antibody molecule. Adherence of 99mTc EA was blocked by soluble immune complexes prepared with ovalbumin and rabbit antibody directed against it and Escherichia coli 055:B5 lipopolysaccharide and mouse antibody directed against it. Normal rabbit or mouse serum, immune serum, or antigen alone did not block adherence of 99mTc EA thereby demonstrating that the receptors had greater affinity for immune complexes than for either antigen or antibody alone. The existence of membrane receptors on tumor-derived cells which react with the Fc portion of antigen-antibody complexes may provide an explanation for the mechanism by which immune complexes are capable of blocking cell-mediated tumor cell destruction irrespective of whether the receptors are on the tumor cells themselves or on admixed lymphocytes and macrophages.",

Previously, we demonstrated that intralesional injection of the recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene driven by an osteocalcin (OC) promoter (Ad-OC-TK) effectively suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells in vitro and tumors in vivo in a tumor-specific manner when supplemented with the prodrug acyclovir (ACV). In this communication, we studied the potential efficacy of the treatment of osteosarcoma pulmonary metastases with a systemic delivery route of Ad-OC-TK supplemented with ACV. We established osteosarcoma lung metastases in nude mice by the intravenous injection of rat osteosarcoma cells, ROS 17/2.8. These cells colonized and formed tumor nodules within 1 week in the lungs of nude mice. Whereas systemic delivery of a recombinant Ad vector containing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene driven by a Rous sarcoma virus universal promoter (Ad-RSV-beta-gal) resulted in the nonspecific expression of beta-gal activity in the lung parenchyma, Ad-OC-beta-gal administration resulted in specific beta-gal expression in tumor cells deposited in the lung. When nude mice bearing ROS 17/2.8 lung tumors were treated with systemic Ad-OC-TK through tail vein administration, subsequent intraperitoneal ACV treatment significantly decreased the number of tumor nodules (P < .0001) and the net lung wet weight (P = .0005) while significantly increasing (.005 < P < .01) the survival of animals, when compared with untreated and Ad-OC-TK- or ACV-treated control groups.

The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443).

Enhanced cytosolic bioavailability of tumor-specific antigens improves access to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules for more efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte generation. Various cell-penetrating domains (CPDs) are known to ferry covalently linked heterologous antigens to the intracellular compartment by traversing the plasma membrane.;To determine whether generating melanoma antigen family A, 3 (MAGE-A3), a tumor-specific cancer-testis antigen, as a fusion protein with CPD will enhance the cytosolic bioavailability of MAGE-A3.;MAGE-A3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using complementary DNA from renal tissue and cloned in frame with a CPD (YARKARRQARR) at the amino-terminal end and hexahistidine at the carboxy-terminal end to generate CPD-MAGE-A3 in a pQE-70 expression vector. Cultures were grown in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3-pLysS) cells followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification of recombinant proteins.;Measurement of DC membrane penetration of CPD-MAGE-A3 vs MAGE-A3 and determination of the effect of CPD-MAGE-A3 pulsing on DC phenotypic expression of cell-surface antigens.;Media composition and isopropyl-d-thiogalactosidase induction were optimized to achieve high levels of protein expression followed by purification.

Purified CPD-MAGE-A3 exhibited more efficient DC membrane penetration than did MAGE-A3 alone as confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. High-level expression of several unique DC markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR) by flow cytometry was consistent with a mature DC phenotype, indicating that pulsing with CPD-MAGE-A3 did not alter specific cell-surface antigens required for T-cell activation.;We have demonstrated for the first time, to our knowledge, that cloning and purification of MAGE-A3 with CPD enhances its cytosolic bioavailability in DCs without altering cell-surface antigens, potentially making it a more potent therapeutic cancer vaccine compared with existing MAGE-A3 protein and peptide vaccines.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Model systems to study the effects of chemicals of environmental concern on bacterial and parasitic diseases as well as the immunosurveillance and destruction of transplantable tumor cells were described and evaluated. Studies were conducted in female B6C3F1 mice following adult or pre/postnatal exposure to several prototype chemicals. The prototype chemicals employed included the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P), and the carcinogenesis promoting agent 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-0-acetate (TPA). The host resistance models employed depend primarily on functional thymus-dependent immunity, although humoral immunity is suggested to have a role in the parasite model as well. These models include: subcutaneous challenge with a dose of PYB6 tumor cell causing a 10-20% incidence (TD(10-20)) of tumor; intravenous challenge with B16 melanoma cells; challenge with a dose of Listeria monocytogenes causing a 10-20% incidence of mortality (LD(10-20)); challenge with a dose of E. coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin causing a 10-20% incidence of lethality (LD(10-20)); and challenge with larvae of Trichinella spiralis for parasite expulsion kinetic studies. Increased mortality was observed following Listeria monocytogenes challenge in DES-exposed mice. B(a)P and TPA exposure did not alter host resistance to this organism. The increased mortality observed following DES was associated with a significant increase in the number of viable Listeria in the spleens and livers at 4 days, a time when T-cell immunity is thought to be expressed, but bacterial counts were similar to control mice at day 1, a time when MPhi are thought to exert their greatest effect. These data suggest that the increased Listeria susceptibility found following DES exposure may result from a T-cell defect, although the intracellular killing capacity of DES-treated Mvarphi's has not been well examined. Tumor susceptibility studies following challenge with 5 x 10(3) viable syngeneic PYB6 tumor cells revealed that nontreated adult B6C3F1 mice resisted tumor formation, with only a 10-20% incidence of tumor formation. In contrast, mice exposed to DES or TPA as adults had a tumor frequency of from 70-100% following TPA and up to 90% following DES exposure. In all cases the tumors were progressive and resulted in death. B(a)P did not alter the frequency of tumor incidence from controls in this model. Preliminary data, using the B16 melanoma intravenous challenge model and (125)IUdR to quantitate tumor mass revealed this model was sensitive to non-specifically activated macrophage kill. DES treated mice with activated macrophages did not demonstrate increased tumor mass, while mice exposed to TPA or the potent immunosuppressive agent cyclophosphamide had a significantly increased tumor mass in their lungs. Expulsion of Trichinella spiralis adults from the gut also apparently required functional T-cells and possibly some element of humoral immunity. Mice exposed to DES and B(a)P exhibited increased numbers of adult worms in the gut at day 14. Sensitivity to gram-negative endotoxin (LPS) was apparently increased following exposure to DES or B(a)P. These data suggest that the detoxification of LPS is related to an intact Mvarphi population. The data presented here demonstrate the sensitivity of the host resistance assay panel proposed for detecting immune alteration. Alteration of T-cell function appeared to correlate with increased susceptibility to bacterial and tumor cell challenge.",

In an in vitro model system, we coated a recombinant vaccinia construct containing the E. coli beta-galactosidase gene with antibody to the murine class I MHC molecule Db. Target cells were B78H1 murine melanoma cells transduced with either the Db gene or, as a control, the Kb gene. Infectivity was assessed by staining target cells with x-gal to demonstrate expression of virally delivered beta-galactosidase. This technique was also assessed in a second system with vaccinia/beta-gal targeted to the murine B7.2 molecule. The infectivity of the resulting construct was assessed for murine SA1 fibrosarcoma cells transfected with the B7.2 gene and for wild-type, B7.2-negative SA1. Experiments were repeated in each system with similar results.;This strategy demonstrated antibody-mediated viral targeting in both the B78H1 and the SA1 models. Importantly, addition of the targeting coat diminished the infectivity of the modified vaccinia for control cells but preserved infectivity for targeted cells. In the B78H1 system, Db-targeted vaccinia consistently had 2- to 3-fold greater infectivity for B78H1Db than B78H1Kb. Increasing the number of avidin molecules used per virion in the synthesis of the viral coat led to greater selectivity but decreased overall infectivity. In the SA1 system, B7.2-targeted vaccinia demonstrated completely ablated infectivity for control SA1 cells, but maintained infectivity for target SA1/B7.2 cells.;Recombinant viral vectors such as vaccinia may be coated with biotin/avidin and linked to biotinylated antibodies to preferentially target specific cell types in vitro. Such an approach may be useful in targeting recombinant lytic viruses to tumors for destruction and in immune up-regulation in vivo. Similarly, this approach may enhance nonlytic viruses for gene therapy applications.",

Human ribonucleases could provide an alternative basis for the construction of less immunogenic reagents. Two members of the human RNase family, angiogenin and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), have been fused to a single chain antibody against the transferrin receptor, which is known to be internalised by endocytosis. The fusion proteins proved to be very efficient inhibitors of protein synthesis using various cell lines. It is not yet known whether the side effects of angiogenin and EDN will compromise their potential use as immunotoxins.;The goal of this work was to construct a human immunotoxin with no harmful side effects. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease has been shown to be as potent as ricin at abolishing protein synthesis on injection into oocytes. We therefore decided to clone its human analogue, which is fairly ubiquitous and per se non-toxic. An immunofusion of human pancreatic RNase with a single chain antibody against the transferrin receptor was tested for its ability to inhibit protein synthesis in three different human tumor cell lines.;DNA coding for the human pancreatic RNase was cloned partially from a human fetal brain cDNA library and then completed by PCR using a human placental cDNA library as a template. The RNase gene was then fused with a DNA coding for an single chain antibody against the transferrin receptor (CD71). After expressing the fusion protein in E. coli, the gene product was isolated from inclusion bodies and tested for cytotoxicity.;This fusion protein inhibited the protein synthesis of three human tumor cell lines derived from a melanoma, a renal carcinoma and a breast carcinoma, with IC50s of 8, 5 and 10 nM, respectively. These values were comparable with those using a similar fusion protein constructed with eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) as the toxic moiety (IC50s of 8, 1.2 and 3 nM, respectively). The slightly lower activities of the human pancreatic RNase-scFv (pancRNase-scFv) with two of the cell lines suggests that fewer molecules are reaching the cytoplasmic compartment, since it was twice as active as EDN-scFv in inhibiting the protein synthesis of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate.;These results demonstrate that the human pancreatic RNase, which is expected to have a very low immunogenic potential in humans with no inherent toxicity, may be a potent cytotoxin for tumor cells after antibody targeting.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare tumors in the head and neck, and even more so in the parotid gland. The mass-like clinical presentation and histologic features result in frequent misclassification, resulting in inappropriate clinical management. There are only a few reported cases in the English literature. Twenty-one patients with parotid gland solitary fibrous tumor were compiled from the English literature (Medline 1960-2011) and integrated with this case report. The patients included 11 males and 11 females, aged 11-79 years (mean, 51.2 years), who presented with a parotid gland painless mass gradually increasing in size or with compression symptoms, with a mean duration of symptoms of 24.7 months. The mean tumor size was 4.5 cm. Grossly, all tumors were described as well-circumscribed to encapsulated, firm, homogenous white to tan masses. Seven patients had a preoperative fine needle aspiration performed, with the majority interpreted to represent pleomorphic adenoma or cementifying fibroma. Histologically, the tumors were well circumscribed, although many tumors showed focally entrapped normal salivary gland acini and ducts at the edge. The tumors were cellular, arranged in haphazard short interlacing fascicles of spindled to epithelioid cells. The spindled cells showed tapering cytoplasm with monotonous, round to oval nuclei with coarse nuclear chromatin distribution. Keloid-like to wiry collagen was present between the neoplastic cells. Mitoses were identified in most cases, while necrosis was absent. Isolated, patulous vessels were present, but a well developed \"hemangiopericytoma-like\" vascular pattern was not seen. Three tumors were classified as malignant, showing marked nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitoses. When immunohistochemistry was performed, all tumors showed strong and diffuse vimentin, with a majority showing CD34, bcl-2 and CD99 immunoreactivity; all cases tested were negative for S100 protein, cytokeratin, EMA, CAM5.2, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, desmin, MYOD1, myogenin, CD117, GFAP, CD31, FVIII-RAg, collagen IV, p63, p53, calponin, caldesmon, CD56, NFP, and ALK-1. The principle differential diagnoses include pleomorphic adenoma, myoepithelioma, nodular fasciitis, schwannoma, fibromatosis coli, spindle cell \"sarcomatoid\" carcinoma, and spindle cell melanoma. All patients were managed with surgery, while two patients also received radiation therapy. Metastatic disease was identified in one patient immediately after excision. All patients with follow-up were alive without evidence of disease (n = 18), but the average follow-up is only 1.9 years. One patient is alive with disease at 12 months. Parotid gland SFT is a rare tumor, usually presenting in middle aged adults as a slowly growing mass. Characteristic histologic appearance with CD34 and bcl-2 immunoreactivity support the diagnosis. Surgery is the treatment of choice to yield a good outcome.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years the idea of using gene therapy as a modality in the treatment of diseases other than genetically inherited, monogenic disorders has taken root. This is particularly obvious in the field of oncology where currently more than 100 clinical trials have been approved worldwide. This report will summarize some of the exciting progress that has recently been made with respect to both targeting the delivery of potentially therapeutic genes to tumor sites and regulating their expression within the tumor microenvironment. In order to specifically target malignant cells while at the same time sparing normal tissue, cancer gene therapy will need to combine highly selective gene delivery with highly specific gene expression, specific gene product activity, and, possibly, specific drug activation. Although the efficient delivery of DNA to tumor sites remains a formidable task, progress has been made in recent years using both viral (retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus) and nonviral (liposomes, gene gun, injection) methods. In this report emphasis will be placed on targeted rather than high-efficiency delivery, although those would need to be combined in the future for effective therapy. To date delivery has been targeted to tumor-specific and tissue-specific antigens, such as epithelial growth factor receptor, c-kit receptor, and folate receptor, and these will be described in some detail. To increase specificity and safety of gene therapy further, the expression of the therapeutic gene needs to be tightly controlled within the target tissue. Targeted gene expression has been analyzed using tissue-specific promoters (breast-, prostate-, and melanoma-specific promoters) and disease-specific promoters (carcinoembryonic antigen, HER-2/neu, Myc-Max response elements, DF3/MUC). Alternatively, expression could be regulated externally with the use of radiation-induced promoters or tetracycline-responsive elements. Another novel possibility that will be discussed is the regulation of therapeutic gene products by tumor-specific gene splicing. Gene expression could also be targeted at conditions specific to the tumor microenvironment, such as glucose deprivation and hypoxia. We have concentrated on hypoxia-targeted gene expression and this report will discuss our progress in detail. Chronic hypoxia occurs in tissue that is more than 100-200 microns away from a functional blood supply. In solid tumors hypoxia is widespread both because cancer cells are more prolific than the invading endothelial cells that make up the blood vessels and because the newly formed blood supply is disorganized. Measurements of oxygen partial pressure in patients' tumors showed a high percentage of severe hypoxia readings (less than 2.5 mmHg), readings not seen in normal tissue. This is a major problem in the treatment of cancer, because hypoxic cells are resistant to radiotherapy and often to chemotherapy. However, severe hypoxia is also a physiological condition specific to tumors, which makes it a potentially exploitable target. We have utilized hypoxia response elements (HRE) derived from the oxygen-regulated phosphoglycerate kinase gene to control gene expression in human tumor cells in vitro and in experimental tumors. The list of genes that have been considered for use in the treatment of cancer is extensive. It includes cytokines and costimulatory cell surface molecules intended to induce an effective systemic immune response against tumor antigens that would not otherwise develop. Other inventive strategies include the use of internally expressed antibodies to target oncogenic proteins (intrabodies) and the use of antisense technology (antisense oligonucleotides, antigenes, and ribozymes). This report will concentrate more on novel genes encoding prodrug activating enzymes, so-called suicide genes (Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, Escherichia coli nitroreductase, E.
