        "Doc_abstract":"CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)) is a crucial tumor suppressor involved in many cancers. Our recent investigations revealed that FOXA1 as a forkhead transcription factor mediates CDKN2A activation in cellular senescence. However, the contribution of this axis in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, using a comprehensive collection of cancer microarray data, we found FOXA1 is down-regulated in many cancers compared to their normal counterparts and the positive correlation between FOXA1 and CDKN2A could be observed in prostate and breast cancers with lower EZH2 (epigenetic repressor for CDKN2A) expression. Experimentally, epistasis analysis in prostate and breast cancer cells indicated that higher expression of FOXA1 opposes EZH2-mediated CDKN2A repression, as further depletion of FOXA1 reverts the de-silencing of CDKN2A caused by EZH2 inhibition. Concomitantly, EZH2-depletion suppresses cancer cell cycle progression and this regulation is optimized in the presence of FOXA1 and CDKN2A. A further oncogenic transformation assay suggested that overexpression of EZH2 is insufficient to block RAS-induced CDKN2A activation and loss of FOXA1 is mandatory to potentiate EZH2-mediated CDKN2A silencing and to bypass the senescence barrier. Importantly, using an in vitro histone methyltransferase (HMTase) system, we found FOXA1 directly inhibits EZH2's histone methyltransferase activity through its C-terminal histone binding motif. These data support that positive regulation of CDKN2A by FOXA1 counteracts its tumorigenic repression of by EZH2 in cancers. ",

We analyzed families with two or more cases of melanoma for germline mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 to elucidate the contribution of these gene defects to familial malignant melanoma and to the occurrence of other cancer types.;: The entire CDKN2A coding region and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene of an affected member of each of 52 families from southern Sweden with at least two cases of melanoma in first- or second-degree relatives were screened for mutations by use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided.;: CDKN2A mutations were found in 10 (19%) of the 52 families. Nine families carried an identical alteration consisting of the insertion of arginine at position 113 of p16(INK4a), and one carried a missense mutation, in which the valine at position 115 was replaced with a glycine. The 113insArg mutant p16(INK4a) was unable to bind cdk4 and cdk6 in an in vitro binding assay. Six of the 113insArg families had at least one member with multiple primary melanomas; the 113insArg families also had a high frequency of other malignancies-in particular, breast cancer (a total of eight cases compared with the expected 2.1; P =.0014) and pancreatic cancer (a total of six cases compared with the expected 0.16; P<.0001). Families with breast cancer also had a propensity for multiple melanomas in females, suggesting that a sex-dependent factor may modify the phenotypic expression of CDKN2A alterations.;: Our findings confirm that the majority of CDKN2A-associated melanoma families in Sweden are due to a single founder mutation. They also show that families with the CDKN2A 113insArg mutation have an increased risk not only of multiple melanomas and pancreatic carcinoma but also of breast cancer.",

This study is the first to compare survival in germline CDKN2A mutated (mut) and nonmutated melanoma cases.;Melanoma-prone families participating in this study were identified through a nationwide predictive program starting in 1987.

Previous studies demonstrated that the loss of function of CDKN2A is mainly caused by the hypermethylation of CDKN2A gene promoter; however, whether or not it is associated with the incidence of pancreatic cancer still remains unclear. In this study, we systematically reviewed the association between CDKN2A promoter methylation and pancreatic cancer using meta-analysis methods. The pooled data were analyzed by Review Manager 5.2. Fourteen studies eligible studies, including 418 pancreatic cancer, 155 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) and 45 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients were analyzed. We observed that the frequency of CDKN2A methylation was significantly higher in pancreatic cancer patients than in normal healthy controls, the pooled OR = 17.19, 95% CI = 8.72-33.86, P < 0.00001.

Herein we report the prevalence of childhood tumors (diagnosed<or=18 years of age) in families identified with mutation in the BRCA1/2, MMR and CDKN2A genes.

CDKN2A and CDKN2B inhibit cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 and control cellular proliferation by preventing entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Their inactivation may contribute to uncontrolled growth in human cancer. We previously described CDKN2A exon 2 mutations in a pilot study of 43 esophageal cancers. In order to determine whether CDKN2A and CDKN2B are frequent targets of 9p21 deletion in esophageal carcinogenesis, we have now analyzed 60 primary esophageal cancers for mutations in both exons 1 and 2 of CDKN2A and CDKN2B by direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomic DNAs. In conjunction with our previously published data, we have identified a total of eight nucleic acid substitutions among 60 esophageal carcinomas; here, we describe one new CDKN2B nonsense mutation and one new silent CDKN2B mutation that occurred somatically. Taken together, these results suggest that intragenic mutations in CDKN2A and CDKN2B occur in esophageal cancer, but that they are infrequent events. In view of the known high frequency of loss of heterozygosity at the chromosome 9p21 locus in esophageal cancers, the current data suggest that intragenic mutation is not the predominant mode of inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B or that other genes are targets of deletion at this locus in these cancers.",

Genetic abnormalities in CDKN2A gene have been well documented in human melanoma but their involvement in human nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and in particular in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is less clear. Several studies have shown that human SCCs harbour unique mutations in the p53 gene as well as inactivation of the CDKN2A gene. While mutations in the p53 gene are induced by UV radiation and represent tumor initiating events, the majority of alterations detected in the CDKN2A gene do not appear to be UV-dependent.

Frequencies of mutations that alter the coding of p16INK4 or p14ARF were quantified overall and in subgroups. Penetrance and likelihood of carrying mutations by family history were estimated. Among 1537 cases, 9 (0.6%) carried germline mutations in CDKN2A, including three previously unreported mutations.

We hypothesized that this predisposition might be due to germ-line CDKN2A mutations.;We used the polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing to identify germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the disease. A quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the functional importance of the CDKN2A variants.;Of 33 patients with multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 27 percent) had germ-line CDKN2A mutations.

In three families, CDKN2A mutations identical to those in the probands were found in other family members. In two families with mutations, we uncovered previously unknown evidence of family histories of melanoma.;Some patients with multiple primary melanomas but without family histories of the disease have germ-line mutations of the CDKN2A gene.

Our goal was to estimate the involvement of \"high risk\" genes in patients presenting these two neoplasia, selected irrespectively from family history and age at diagnosis.;Eighty two patients with BC and CMM were screened for BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, CDKN2A and CDK4 (exon 2) germline mutations.;Deleterious mutations were identified in 6 patients: two carriers of a BRCA1 germline mutation, two carriers of TP53 germline mutations (one of which also harbored a BRCA2 deleterious mutation, the other one a BRCA2 unclassified variant), and two carriers of a CDKN2A germline mutation. In addition, 6 variants of unknown signification were identified in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Regarding family history, 3/13 (23%) patients with a positive family history of BC or CMM were carriers of a germline mutation, whereas only 3/69 (4%) patients without family history were carriers of a germline mutation.;Our findings show that few patients with BC and CMM who lacked family histories of these cancers are carriers of deleterious germline mutations in four of the five genes we examined. We describe for the first time, two simultaneous BRCA2 and TP53 mutations, suggesting that analysis in more than one gene could be performed if a patient's personal or familial history does not match a single syndrome.",

There is also an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a subset of families with mutations, however, the precise relationship between the CDKN2A gene and pancreatic cancer remains unknown. The relationships between familial melanoma, pancreatic cancer and germline CDKN2A mutations were examined using published data. There were 67 different CDKN2A mutations in 189 melanoma-prone families. Forty-two families (18 mutations) had pancreatic cancer reported. For families without reported pancreatic cancer, the most common types of mutations were missense (56%), frameshift (12%), and deletions (12%). For families with pancreatic cancer, missense (56%), splicing (17%), and frameshift (11%) mutations were most common. Seventy percent of the mutations were observed only once, while the remainder recurred in different families. Comparison of 147 melanoma-prone families without pancreatic cancer to the 42 families that had pancreatic cancer reported showed no significant differences in the types or locations of mutations. However, there was a significant difference (p=0.002) in the distribution of families across the four ankyrin repeats. This finding primarily resulted from the six most frequent mutations where the distribution of pancreatic cancer varied significantly (p=0.02) from at least 30% in c.301G>T (p.G101W), c.225_243del19 (p.P75fs), c.337_338insGTC (p.R112_L113insR), and c.377T>A (p.V126D) families to less than 10% in c.71G>C (p.R24P) and c.159G>C (p.M53I) families.

Thus, we analyzed a series of astrocytomas to assess the association between CDKN2A expression and methylation of grade I-IV tumors (WHO) and clinicopathological parameters. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of 93 astrocytic tumors was available for CDKN2A promoter methylation analysis and p16(INK4A) expression by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A strong negative correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining and CDKN2A promoter methylation was found. Additionally, a significant negative correlation between CDKN2A promoter methylation and age was observed; also, female patients had statistically more CDKN2A methylated promoters (p = 0.036) than men. In conclusion, CDKN2A inactivation by promoter methylation is a frequent event in astrocytomas and it is related to the age and sex of patients. ",

However, the relationship between methylated CDKN2A and carcinogenesis in cervical cancer is inconsistent, and the diagnostic accuracy of methylated CDKN2A is underinvestigated. In this study, we attempted to quantify the association between CDKN2A methylation and the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer, and its diagnostic power.;We systematically reviewed four electronic databases and identified 26 studies involving 1,490 cervical cancers, 1,291 CINs, and 964 controls. A pooled odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated to evaluate the association between methylated CDKN2A and the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. Specificity, sensitivity, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the diagnostic odds ratio were computed to assess the effect of methylated CDKN2A in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.;Our results indicated an upward trend in the methylation frequency of CDKN2A in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer (cancer vs control: OR =23.67, 95% CI =15.54-36.06; cancer vs CIN: OR =2.53, 95% CI =1.79-3.5; CIN vs control: OR =9.68, 95% CI =5.82-16.02).

This study investigates the role of selecting tumor samples with a silenced as compared to deleted CDKN2A locus when assessing the efficacy of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, zebularine, combined with the HDAC inhibitor, depsipeptide. Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with defined CDKN2A status were analyzed by MTS assay to determine the effect of zebularine or zebularine combined with depsipeptide on tumor cell growth. We observed that zebularine treatment resulted in inhibition of cell growth in 11 out of 12 lung cancer cell lines with silenced CDKN2A, but no cell growth inhibition was detected in the 7 lung cancer cell lines tested with deleted CDKN2A (p>0.001). In addition, we found that the combination of 30 microM zebularine and 6 or 7 nM depsipeptide resulted in a synergistic inhibition of cell growth in tumor cells with silenced CDKN2A (p<0.001, CI=0.70 and 0.57, respectively) but not in tumor cells with deleted CDKN2A. In conclusion, tumor cells with methylated CDKN2A are more sensitive to zebularine than cell lines with deleted CDKN2A and the combination of zebularine/depsipeptide results in a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition that is also linked with the presence of silenced CDKN2A. Thus, combination of DNA methyltransferase and HDAC inhibitors may be a potential treatment for lung cancer patients, but careful selection of patients will be needed to optimize the benefit of this regimen.",

Patients had never been submitted to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, nor did they have any other diagnosed cancer. None of the gastric cancer samples presented methylated DNA sequences for ANAPC1 and TP53. CDKN2A methylation was not detected in any normal gastric mucosa; however, the CDKN2A promoter was methylated in 30.4% of gastric cancer samples, with 35% methylation in diffuse-type and 26.9% in intestinal-type cancers. CDKN2A methylation was associated with the carcinogenesis process for ~30% diffuse-type and intestinal-type compared to non-neoplastic samples.

Significantly lower risk involved the colorectum, stomach, pancreas and metachronous breast with different histology. A significant excess was found of melanoma and total second breast cancers, including the contralateral. The excessive skin melanoma in breast cancer survivors was attributed to the relationship with BRCA2 and CDKN2A mutation-positive patients. The excess risk due to the CDKN2A mutation should also include pancreatic cancer which, in the present study, presented a significantly lower risk.",

Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications.",

One patient, who also had a family history of melanoma, had a 24-bp deletion that included codons 62-69. An in vitro binding assay established that the resulting mutant p16 protein was unable to bind cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Two patients without a family history of melanoma had CDKN2A alterations: (a) one had a mutation in the 5' noncoding sequence (-14C/T); and (b) the other had an insertion of an extra T in codon 28, which results in a stop signal in codon 43. The median age at diagnosis of the first melanoma was significantly lower, the number of primary melanomas was significantly higher, and the presence of a family history of melanoma was significantly more common in patients with CDKN2A mutations than in those without germ-line mutations.

In many types of cancer, alterations of Cdkn2a abrogate the functions of both suppressors, implying that both are integral to the genesis of certain cancer types. While this has been observed in mouse lung adenocarcinogenesis, recent observations also suggested that naturally occurring variation at the Cdkn2a locus is probably operative in the development of these tumors. Firstly, two common haplotypes of mouse Cdkn2a have been identified, each of which encodes cosegregating variants of p16INK4a and p19ARF. The p16INK4a variants differ at amino acids 18 (histidine or proline) and 51 (valine or isoleucine), whereas the p19ARF variants differ only at amino acid 72 (histidine or arginine). Secondly, genetic resistance to lung tumor formation appears to segregate with one particular haplotype, which also is deleted preferentially in lung adenocarcinomas of Cdkn2a heterozygous mice. Here we attempt to explain these observations and to characterize further the roles of p16INK4 and p19ARF in mouse lung tumorigenesis by examining the function and expression of each of the variants of Cdkn2a. Functional analysis showed that the proline 18/isoleucine 51 p16INK4a variant was diminished in cdk6 binding, cdk6 inhibition and NIH/3T3 fibroblast growth suppression compared with the histidine 18/valine 51 variant, whereas both of the p19ARF variants suppressed growth with similar potencies. Also, the different alleles for p16INK4a and p19ARF were transcribed equally in the normal lungs of Cdkn2a heterozygotes, as determined by comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. These results indicate that strain-specific variation in p16INK4a function is exploited in mouse lung tumorigenesis and strongly implicate a role for p16INK4a in lung cancer predisposition and development.",

Despite these results, there are significant perioperative risks associated with this aggressive procedure that necessitate consideration of prognostic markers during patient selection. The molecular pathogenesis of peritoneal mesothelioma remains relatively unknown, but extrapolation of findings from their pleural counterpart would suggest frequent alterations in CDKN2A, NF2, and BAP1. Homozygous deletions in CDKN2A portend a worse overall survival in peritoneal mesothelioma. However, the prevalence and prognostic significance of NF2 and BAP1 abnormalities has not been studied. Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using CDKN2A and NF2 locus-specific probes and BAP1 immunohistochemistry identified homozygous CDKN2A deletions (n=25, 29%), hemizygous NF2 loss (n=30, 35%), and/or loss of BAP1 protein expression (n=49, 57%) in 68 of 86 (79%) peritoneal mesotheliomas. Homozygous CDKN2A deletions or hemizygous NF2 loss correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P<0.02) and poor overall survival (P<0.03). Moreover, the significance of these findings was cumulative. Patients harboring both homozygous CDKN2A deletions and hemizygous NF2 loss had a 2-year progression-free survival rate of 9% with a median of 6 months (P<0.01) and overall survival rate of 18% with a median of 8 months (P<0.01). By multivariate analysis, combined homozygous CDKN2A deletions and hemizygous NF2 loss was a negative prognostic factor for both progression-free survival and overall survival, independent of patient age, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, and extent of invasion. In contrast, loss of BAP1 was not associated with clinical outcome. In summary, homozygous deletions in CDKN2A and hemizygous loss of NF2 as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization would confer a poor clinical outcome and may guide future treatment decisions for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma.

We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC.

Detailed molecular analyses indicated the absence of homozygous deletions and point mutations involving these genes in all investigated tumor samples. However, when loss of heterozygostity for chromosome 9p21 (the region where CDKN2A and CDKN2B are localized) was investigated, 16% of cases showed abnormalities in an area telomeric to the CDKN2A locus. To study transcriptional silencing of the CDKN2A gene, the methylation status of exon 1 was examined. In about 35% of cases, a partial methylation was evidenced. Analysis of the CDKN2A mRNA expression, however, did not show any relationship between methylation status and gene transcription. Finally, expression of the CDKN2B gene was demonstrated in all stage IV neuroblastomas, whereas none of stage I tumors expressed this gene.

Disruption of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus occurs in most cases of T-ALL and is thought to contribute to leukemic transformation. To determine whether loss of function of CDKN2A cooperates with HMGA1 in T-ALL, we crossed HMGA1a transgenics onto a Cdkn2a null background. We discovered that T-ALL is markedly accelerated in HMGA1a transgenic Cdkn2a null mice. In addition, these mice recapitulate salient clinical and pathologic features of human T-ALL.

Molecular markers such as gene methylation, microsatellite instability and KRAS mutations, are becoming increasingly important in guiding treatment decisions in colorectal cancer. However, their association with clinicopathologic variables and utility in the management of rectal cancer is still poorly understood. We analyzed CDKN2A gene methylation, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability and KRAS/BRAF mutations in a cohort of 381 rectal cancers with extensive clinical follow-up data. BRAF mutations (2%), CIMP-high (4%) and microsatellite instability-high (2%) were rare, whereas KRAS mutations (39%), CDKN2A methylation (20%) and CIMP-low (25%) were more common. Only CDKN2A methylation and KRAS mutations showed an association with poor overall survival but these did not remain significant when analyzed with other clinicopathologic factors. In contrast, this prognostic effect was strengthened by the joint presence of CDKN2A methylation and KRAS mutations, which independently predicted recurrence of cancer and was associated with poor overall and cancer-specific survival. This study has identified a subgroup of more aggressive rectal cancers that may arise through the KRAS-p16 pathway. It has been previously shown that an interaction of p16 deficiency and oncogenic KRAS promotes carcinogenesis in the mouse and is characterized by loss of oncogene-induced senescence. These findings may provide avenues for the discovery of new treatments in rectal cancer. ",

Inactivation of p16 is a common finding in many cancers; however, there is little data on CDKN2A gene abnormalities in oral precancer. In this longitudinal study, we examined changes in the CDKN2A gene locus in sequential epithelial dysplasias and oral carcinomas from 11 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from laser-microdissected lesional tissue, and exons 1alpha, 1beta, and 2 were analyzed by duplex PCR. Immunohistochemistry was done to identify p16 and p14ARF protein expression. Two adjacent polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for allelotyping. Homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha was identified in 2 of 17 (12%) precancerous lesions. Loss of either exon 1alpha, exon 2, or both was seen in seven of nine (78%) carcinomas. In five of these carcinomas, there was loss of only exon 1alpha. No case showed deletion of exon 1beta. In 5 of 11 patients, microsatellite markers showed differing patterns of allelic imbalance in the precancerous lesions and the subsequent carcinoma, suggesting a complex genetic pattern of progression from dysplasia to carcinoma. We conclude that during oral carcinogenesis homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha of the CDKN2A gene is common but that deletion of exon 2 and 1beta is less frequent. Moreover, our results suggest that the progression from oral precancer to cancer, in some cases, is more complex genetically than predicted by linear models of carcinogenesis.",

We selected 100 patients who displayed multiple primary melanoma (MPM) without any known melanoma cases recorded within their families and looked for germline mutations in the two melanoma-predisposing genes identified to date, CDKN2A and CDK4 exon 2. Nine patients (9%) had germline mutations in CDKN2A, whereas none carried germline mutations in exon 2 of CDK4. Seven cases displayed a recurrent missense mutation, G101W, already described in more than 20 melanoma-prone families; one case carried a missense mutation never reported to date (P114S), and the last case was a carrier of a 6 bp insertion at nucleotide 57 resulting in a duplication of codons 18 and 19. To ascertain whether the G101W was a mutational hot spot for de novo mutations or a common founder mutation, we genotyped eight microsatellite markers flanking the CDKN2A gene. After allowing for recombination over time, haplotype sharing provided evidence for an original G101W mutation common to 6 out of 7 sporadic MPM cases.

The effects of missense variants on protein function and pathogenicity are often unclear. Multiple methods (e.g., laboratory, computational, epidemiological) have been developed to analyze whether a missense variant is pathogenic or not. It is not yet clear how to integrate these data types into a strategy for variant classification. We studied 51 CDKN2A missense variants using a cell cycle arrest assay. There was a continuum of results ranging from full wild-type effect through partial activity to complete loss of arrest. A reproducible decrease of 30% of cell cycle arrest activity correlated with FM association. We analyzed missense CDKN2A germline variants using a Bayesian method to combine multiple data types and derive a probability of pathogenicity. When equal to or more than two data types could be evaluated with this method, 22 of 25 FM-associated variants and 8 of 15 variants of uncertain significance were classified as likely pathogenic with >95% probability. The other 10 variants were classified as uncertain (probability 5-95%). For most variants, there were insufficient data to draw a conclusion. The Bayesian model appears to be a sound method of classifying missense variants in cancer susceptibility genes.",

To this end we set-up primary skin cell co-cultures from siblings of melanoma prone-families that were later analyzed using the expression array approach. As a result, we found that 1535 transcripts were deregulated in CDKN2A mutated cells, with over-expression of immunity-related genes (HLA-DPB1, CLEC2B, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, SP110 and IFNK) and down-regulation of genes playing a role in the Notch signaling pathway. 3570 transcripts were deregulated in MC1R variant carriers. In particular, genes related to oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways were up-regulated as well as genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer and Huntington. Finally, we observed that the expression signatures indentified in phenotypically normal cells carrying CDKN2A mutations or MC1R variants are maintained in skin cancer tumors (melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma). These results indicate that transcriptome deregulation represents an early event critical for skin cancer development. ",

Given that large deletions involving CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) account for only 2% of cases, we describe a family that highlights the co-occurrence of both melanoma and neural system tumours to aid clinical recognition and propose a management strategy. A patient with multiple neurofibromas was referred with a provisional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior molecular testing, though, had failed to identify an NF1 mutation by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. His family history was significant for multiple in situ/malignant melanomas at young ages and several different cancers reminiscent of an underlying syndrome. A search of the Familial Cancer Database, FaCD Online, highlighted several families with cutaneous melanoma and nervous system tumours who were subsequently identified to have large deletions spanning CDKN2A. Although sequencing of CDKN2A and TP53 failed to identify a mutation, a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion was identified by targeted array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH and SNP analysis identified an interstitial deletion of at least 1.5 Mb within 9p21.3 and spanning approximately 25 genes. Identification of the underlying molecular abnormality permits predictive testing for at-risk relatives. Given the young cancer diagnoses, a surveillance regimen was developed and a clinical team organised for ongoing management so that genetic testing could be offered to both adults and minor children. Surveillance recommendations addressed cancer risks associated with FAMMM, and other cancers exhibited by this family with a large contiguous gene deletion.",

We performed LOH studies on chromosome bands 9p21-p22 and searched for genetic alterations of CDKN2A and CDKN2B in 56 ESCCs from a high-risk Chinese population. Seventy-three percent of patients were found to have LOH at one or more loci on chromosome bands 9p21-p22, and LOH occurred more frequently in patients with a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer than in those with a negative family history (P = 0.01, global permutation test).

The familial predisposition to this disease is often associated with dysplastic nevus syndrome, a condition in which afflicted family members have multiple dysplastic nevi (atypical moles). The chromosome region 9p21 and markers on chromosomes 1p and 6p have been linked to melanoma susceptibility. The tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B have been mapped to the 9p21 region, and genetic analyses have revealed the presence of germline CDKN2A alterations in melanoma families. The reported frequencies of such alterations, however, vary among these families.;The present investigation was carried out to determine the frequencies of CDKN2A and CDKN2B germline gene mutations among members in a population-based cohort of Swedish melanoma families (i.e., melanoma kindreds).;DNA was prepared from blood samples obtained from 181 individuals belonging to 100 melanoma kindreds. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and nucleotide sequence analyses, were used to identify the types and frequencies of mutations in exons 1, 1beta, 2, and 3 of the CDKN2A gene and in exons 1 and 2 of the CDKN2B gene.;CDKN2A gene aberrations were independently identified by both SSCP and nucleotide-sequence analyses. Nucleotide-sequence analysis identified a single point mutation leading to a substitution of leucine for proline in codon 48 of exon 1 in a family with a history of melanoma and several other cancers. A second abnormality, leading to an insertion of an extra arginine residue at codon number 113 of exon 2, was seen in four separate families. The CDKN2A exon-3 coding region had the wild-type sequence in all samples. No germline mutations were found in the alternative exon 1beta of the CDKN2A gene or in exons 1 and 2 of the CDKN2B gene.;The present investigation demonstrates that CDKN2A germline gene mutations were observed in 7.8% of the 64 Swedish melanoma kindreds that each included at least two first-degree relatives with melanoma and dysplastic nevus syndrome.

Here, we present an analysis of 86 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for inactivation of this locus. Multiplex quantitative PCR analysis for five microsatellites around the locus showed that 34 tumors (39%) had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) generally encompassing the entire region. Of these, 17 tumors (20%) carried homozygous deletions of at least one CDKN2A exon and of flanking microsatellites, as detected by quantitative PCR. Analysis by restriction enzyme PCR and methylation-specific PCR showed that only three specimens, each with LOH across 9p21, had bona fide hypermethylation of the CDKN2A exon 1alpha CpG-island in the remaining allele. Like most other specimens, these three specimens displayed substantial genome-wide hypomethylation of DNA as reflected in the methylation status of LINE L1 sequences. The extent of DNA hypomethylation was significantly more pronounced in TCC with LOH and/or homozygous deletions at 9p21 than in those without (26% and 28%, respectively, on average, versus 11%, p < 0.0015). No association of LOH or homozygous deletions at 9p21 with tumor stage or grade was found. The data indicate that DNA hypermethylation may be rare in TCC and that deletions are the most important mechanism for inactivation of the CDKN2A locus. The predominance of allelic loss may be explained by its correlation with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, which is thought to favor chromosomal instability and illegitimate recombination.",

Mutations, mainly homozygous deletions, of the CDKN2A (p16INK4A/MTSI) gene have been recently found in tumor cell lines and in many primary tumors. We looked for homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B (p15INK4B), and CDKN2C (p18) in 12 primary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) specimens and in five cell lines established from this cancer type. By means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), we analyzed the presence of biallelic gene deletion or point mutation causing gene function loss. All the examined tumor cell lines (100%) and three of 12 (25%) primary tumors showed homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. Furthermore, no aberrant bands in primary tumors were detected via SSCP, suggesting the absence of mutations in the coding region. In all cases the deleted area at 9p21 also involved the CDKN2B gene. Conversely, no homozygous deletion or point mutations were detected when CDKN2C was analyzed. Our results strongly indicate that the p16INK4A (and/or p15INK4B) protein plays a key role in the development and/or progression of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and suggest that this CDK-inhibitor protein might control proliferation and/or differentiation of human muscle cells. Moreover, alteration of CDKN2C does not appear to be involved in the genesis of rhabdomyosarcoma.",

A lead SNP was found to occur on chromosome 9p21.3, a region that is deleted in 30% of childhood ALLs, suggesting the presence of causal polymorphisms linked to ALL risk. We used SNP genotyping and imputation-based fine-mapping of a multiethnic ALL case-control population (Ncases = 1,464, Ncontrols = 3,279) to identify variants of large effect within 9p21.3. We identified a CDKN2A missense variant (rs3731249) with 2% allele frequency in controls that confers three-fold increased risk of ALL in children of European ancestry (OR, 2.99; P = 1.51 × 10(-9)) and Hispanic children (OR, 2.77; P = 3.78 × 10(-4)). Moreover, of 17 patients whose tumors displayed allelic imbalance at CDKN2A, 14 preferentially retained the risk allele and lost the protective allele (PBinomial = 0.006), suggesting that the risk allele provides a selective advantage during tumor growth. Notably, the CDKN2A variant was not significantly associated with melanoma, glioblastoma, or pancreatic cancer risk, implying that this polymorphism specifically confers ALL risk but not general cancer risk. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that coding polymorphisms of large effect can underlie GWAS \"hits\" and that inherited polymorphisms may undergo directional selection during clonal expansion of tumors.",

The exploratory study cohort comprised 17 breast cancer patients with multiple benign and/or in situ lesions concurrently present with invasive carcinoma within a tumor biopsy. DNA from tumor tissue, normal breast epithelium when present, benign lesions (fibroadenoma, hyperplasia, papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia), and in situ lesions of lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma were interrogated for promoter methylation status in 22 tumor suppressor genes using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). Methylation specific PCR was performed to confirm hypermethylation detected by MS-MLPA. Promoter methylation was detected in 11/22 tumor suppressor genes in 16/17 cases. Hypermethylation of RASSF1 was most frequent, present in 14/17 cases, followed by APC in 12/17, and GSTP1 in 9/17 cases with establishment of an epigenetic monocloncal progression continuum to invasive breast cancer. Hypermethylated promoter regions in normal breast epithelium, benign, and premalignant lesions within the same tumor biopsy implicate RASSF1, APC, GSTP1, TIMP3, CDKN2B, CDKN2A, ESR1, CDH13, RARB, CASP8, and TP73 as early events.

Additionally, the above results pushed us to hypothesize that genetic homogeneity will be seen in Poland in studies of other genes.

However, the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in restoring abnormal DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether miRNA-29b, due to its complimentarity to the 3'- untranslated region of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and DNMT3B, could restore normal DNA methylation patterns in human breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that transfection of pre-miRNA-29b into less aggressive MCF-7 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal cells, inhibited cell proliferation, decreased DNMT3A and DNMT3B messenger RNA (mRNA), and decreased promoter methylation status of ADAM23 , CCNA1, CCND2, CDH1, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, HIC1, RASSF1, SLIT2, TNFRSF10D, and TP73 tumor-suppressor genes. Using methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time PCR, we also demonstrated that the methylation status of several critical tumor-suppressor genes increased as stage of breast disease increased, while miRNA-29b mRNA levels were significantly decreased in breast cancers versus normal breast. This increase in methylation status was accompanied by an increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3B mRNA in advanced stage of human breast cancers and in MCF-7, MDA-MB-361, HCC70, Hs-578T, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to normal breast specimens and MCF-10-2A, a non-tumorigenic breast cell line, respectively.

We show that the majority of methylation variability is associated with intragenic repetitive elements. Detailed validation of the tiled region around ATM was performed by bisulphite modification and pyrosequencing of the same samples and in a second set of peripheral blood DNA from 190 bilateral breast cancer patients compared with 190 controls. We show significant hypermethylation of one intragenic repetitive element in breast cancer cases compared with controls (P = 0.0017), with the highest quartile of methylation associated with a 3-fold increased risk of breast cancer (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.78-5.86, P = 0.000083). Increased methylation of this locus is associated with lower steady-state ATM mRNA level and correlates with age of cancer patients but not controls, suggesting a combined age-phenotype-related association. This research demonstrates the potential for gene-body epigenetic misregulation of ATM and other cancer-related genes in peripheral blood DNA that may be useful as a novel marker to estimate breast cancer risk.

To clarify the association, we here quantified methylation levels of promoter CGIs of 11 genes, which are unlikely to confer growth advantage to cells, in 63 human breast cancers. The number of methylated genes in a cancer did not obey a bimodal distribution, and the 63 cancers were classified into those with frequent methylation (n = 16), moderate methylation (n = 26) and no methylation (n = 21). The incidence of HER2 amplification was significantly higher in the cancers with frequent methylation (11 of 16) than in those with no methylation (2 of 21, P = 0.001). Also, the number of methylated genes correlated with the degree of HER2 amplification (r = 0.411, P = 0.002).

Moreover, combination therapy using PLX4720 plus the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-specific inhibitor PD0332991 further extended survival relative to either monotherapy.

Results were correlated with aberrant methylation of the CDKN2A (alias p16(INK4A)), retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB), methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and death-associated-protein (DAP) kinase genes in the tumors. In comparison with an age-matched control, none of the polymorphisms were associated with increased lung cancer risks. In male patients, however, the MPO -463 GG homozygous state was associated with CDKN2A (alias p16(INK4A)) methylation (odds ratio OR=3.63, 95% confidence interval CI=1.26-10.51), and the XRCC1 26304 T allele in the heterozygous/homozygous state was associated with methylation of CDKN2A (OR=6.13, 95% CI=1.55-24.16) and RARB (OR=7.67, 95% CI=1.62-36.18). In female patients, the GSTP1 G allele in the heterozygous/homozygous state was associated with RARB methylation (OR=18.0, 95% CI=0.76-427.29).

Global statistical modeling and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were applied to identify a multi-gene binary classifier with high sensitivity and specificity.

Individual-gene performances showed sensitivities of 63-79 %, 53-84 % specificities, positive predictive values of 59-83 % and negative predictive values of 63-80 %. When modelled together, these seven genes reached a sensitivity of 93 %, 100 % specificity, a positive predictive value of 100 % and a negative predictive value of 93 %, with high statistical power. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering independently confirmed these findings, in close agreement with the accuracy measurements.

DNA hypermethylation profiles differ significantly by HPV status suggesting that a specific subset of methylated CpG loci could give mechanistic insight into HPV-driven OPSCC. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation of primary tumor samples and adjacent normal mucosa from 46 OPSCC patients undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M value). From these analyses, we identified a 22 CpG loci panel for HPV+ OPSCC that included four CDKN2A loci downstream of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) transcription start sites. This panel was significantly associated with overall HPV detection (P < 0.05; ROC area under the curve = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.0) similar to the subset of four CDKN2A-specific CpG loci (0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99) with equivalence to the full 22 CpG panel. DNA hypermethylation correlated with a significant increase in alternative open reading frame (ARF) expression in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors, but not to the other transcript variant encoded by the CDKN2A locus.

We demonstrate that an Mre11-mediated DDR restrains mammary hyperplasia by effecting an oncogene-induced G2 arrest. Impairment of Mre11 complex functions promotes the progression of mammary hyperplasias into invasive and metastatic breast cancers, which are often associated with secondary inactivation of the Ink4a-Arf (CDKN2a) locus.

Recently, genetic variations have been considered as important factors to cancer susceptibility and prognosis. More specifically, genetic polymorphisms have been associated with the development and prognosis of HNSCC. The purpose of the current study was to investigate an association among p16 (CDKN2A) gene polymorphism at rs11515, age, and HNSCC aggressiveness. PCR-RFLP analysis was used to investigate the p16 (CDKN2A) gene in 96 patients with HNSCC and in 100 individuals without HNSCC. A case group was categorized by age in younger (<60 years) and older (≥ 60 years) patients. Differences between the case and control groups were determined using Fisher and chi-squared tests. Time of survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or to the date of death using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and comparing this to the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. In the present study, no association was established between HNSCC and rs11515 polymorphism, as indicated in a previous study. We found that HNSCC individuals with large-sized tumors and with metastatic disease presented worse overall survival, consistent with fundamental concepts that establish the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis to HNSCC outcomes.

To identify predictors of response, we determined the in vitro sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly characterized human breast cancer cell lines.;Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized cell lines representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated with PD 0332991 to determine IC50 values. These data were analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with PD 0332991 response.;Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes were most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450 differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and cyclin D1 were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was decreased in the most sensitive lines.

In this study, we have investigated if the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) expresses BMI-1 and whether it functions as an oncogene in this highly aggressive group of bone and soft tissue tumors. Our data show that BMI-1 is highly expressed by ESFT cells and that, although it does not significantly affect proliferation or survival, BMI-1 actively promotes anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Moreover, we find that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of both p16 wild-type and p16-null cell lines, demonstrating that the mechanism of BMI-1 oncogenic function in ESFT is, at least in part, independent of CDKN2A repression. Expression profiling studies of ESFT cells following BMI-1 knockdown reveal that BMI-1 regulates the expression of hundreds of downstream target genes including, in particular, genes involved in both differentiation and development as well as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Gain and loss of function assays confirm that BMI-1 represses the expression of the adhesion-associated basement membrane protein nidogen 1. In addition, although BMI-1 promotes ESFT adhesion, nidogen 1 inhibits cellular adhesion in vitro. Together, these data support a pivotal role for BMI-1 ESFT pathogenesis and suggest that its oncogenic function in these tumors is in part mediated through modulation of adhesion pathways.",

It is important to distinguish whether these tumours are de novo or recurrences of the primary tumour in order to guide the appropriate therapy. Our aim was to investigate the use of DNA methylation profiling and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to determine whether the second tumour is clonally related to the first tumour.;Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting was used to screen promoter methylation in a panel of 13 genes reported as methylated in breast cancer (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, CDH13, RARβ, BRCA1, CDH1, CDKN2A, TP73, and GSTP1) in 29 tumour pairs (16 ipsilateral and 13 contralateral). Using the methylation profile of these genes, we employed a Bayesian and an empirical statistical approach to estimate clonal relationship. Copy number alterations were analysed using aCGH on the same set of tumour pairs.;There is a higher probability of the second tumour being recurrent in ipsilateral tumours compared with contralateral tumours (38 % versus 8 %; p <0.05) based on the methylation profile. Using previously reported recurrence rates as Bayesian prior probabilities, we classified 69 % of ipsilateral and 15 % of contralateral tumours as recurrent. The inferred clonal relationship results of the tumour pairs were generally concordant between methylation profiling and aCGH.;Our results show that DNA methylation profiling as well as aCGH have potential as diagnostic tools in improving the clinical decisions to differentiate recurrences from a second de novo tumour.",

Accordingly, mutations in these genes are present in a wide variety of spontaneous human cancers and CDKN2A germ line mutations are found in familial melanoma. The TBX2 gene encoding a key developmental transcription factor is amplified in pancreatic cancer cell lines and preferentially amplified and overexpressed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated breast tumors. Overexpression of Tbx2 and the related factor Tbx3, which is also overexpressed in breast cancer and melanomas, can suppress senescence in defined experimental systems through repression of ARF expression. However, it is not known how Tbx2 mediates its repressive effect nor whether endogenous Tbx2 or Tbx3 perform a similar antisenescence function in transformed cells. This is a particularly important question because the loss of CDKN2A in many human cancers would, in principle, bypass the requirement for Tbx2/3-mediated repression of ARF in suppressing senescence. We show here that Tbx2 is overexpressed in melanoma cell lines and that Tbx2 targets histone deacetylase 1 to the p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) initiator. Strikingly, expression of an inducible dominant-negative Tbx2 (dnTbx2) leads to displacement of histone deacetylase 1, up-regulation of p21(Cip1) expression, and the induction of replicative senescence in CDKN2A-null B16 melanoma cells. In human melanoma cells, expression of dnTbx2 leads to severely reduced growth and induction of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. The results suggest that the activity of endogenous Tbx2 is critically required to maintain proliferation and suppress senescence in melanomas.",

In this study, we aimed to identify DNA methylation based biomarkers to distinguish patients with locally advanced breast cancer who may benefit from neoadjuvant doxorubicin treatment.;We investigated quantitatively the methylation patterns in the promoter regions of 14 genes (ABCB1, ATM, BRCA1, CDH3, CDKN2A, CXCR4, ESR1, FBXW7, FOXC1, GSTP1, IGF2, HMLH1, PPP2R2B, and PTEN) in 75 well-described pre-treatment samples from locally advanced breast cancer and correlated the results to the available clinical and molecular parameters. Six normal breast tissues were used as controls and 163 unselected breast cancer cases were used to validate associations with histopathological and clinical parameters.Aberrant methylation was detected in 9 out of the 14 genes including the discovery of methylation at the FOXC1 promoter. Absence of methylation at the ABCB1 promoter correlated with progressive disease during doxorubicin treatment. Most importantly, the DNA methylation status at the promoters of GSTP1, FOXC1 and ABCB1 correlated with survival, whereby the combination of methylated genes improved the subdivision with respect to the survival of the patients. In multivariate analysis GSTP1 and FOXC1 methylation status proved to be independent prognostic markers associated with survival.;Quantitative DNA methylation profiling is a powerful tool to identify molecular changes associated with specific phenotypes. Methylation at the ABCB1 or GSTP1 promoter improved overall survival probably due to prolonged availability and activity of the drug in the cell while FOXC1 methylation might be a protective factor against tumour invasiveness. FOXC1 proved to be general prognostic factor, while ABCB1 and GSTP1 might be predictive factors for the response to and efficacy of doxorubicin treatment. Pharmacoepigenetic effects such as the reported associations in this study provide molecular explanations for differential responses to chemotherapy and it might prove valuable to take the methylation status of selected genes into account for patient management and treatment decisions.",

Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a transcription/translation factor that promotes the formation of tumors in transgenic mice; however, the underlying molecular events are not understood. To explore this in a human model system, YB-1 was expressed in mammary epithelial cells under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. The induction of YB-1 promoted phenotypes associated with malignancy in three-dimensional breast acini cultures. This was attributed to YB-1 enhancing the expression and activity of the histone acetyltransferase p300 leading to chromatin remodeling. Specifically, this relaxation of chromatin allowed YB-1 to bind to the BMI1 promoter. The induction of BMI1 engaged the Polycomb complex resulting in histone H2A ubiquitylation and repression of the CDKN2A locus. These events manifested functionally as enhanced self-renewal capacity that occurred in a BMI1-dependent manner. Conversely, p300 inhibition with anacardic acid prevented YB-1 from binding to the BMI1 promoter and thereby subverted self-renewal. Despite these early changes, full malignant transformation was not achieved until RSK2 became overexpressed concomitant with elevated human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity. The YB-1/RSK2/hTERT expressing cells formed tumors in mice that were molecularly subtyped as basal-like breast cancer. We conclude that YB-1 cooperates with p300 to allow BMI1 to over-ride p16(INK4a) -mediated cell cycle arrest enabling self-renewal and the development of aggressive breast tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Familial melanoma predisposition is associated with germline mutations at the CDKN2A/ARF locus in up to 40% of families. The exact role of the two proteins encoded by this complex locus in this predisposition is unclear. Most mutations affect either CDKN2A only or products of both genes. Recently a deletion affecting ARF-specific exon 1beta was reported in a family with melanoma and neural tumours. However, the possibility of this deletion also altering the CDKN2A transcript could not be excluded. More convincingly, a 16 base pair insertion in exon 1beta has been reported in an individual with multiple melanomas suggesting a direct role for ARF in melanoma predisposition. We report here a splice mutation in exon 1beta in a family with melanoma that results in ARF haploinsufficiency. The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma. A sibling of the mother with breast cancer also had this mutation. Analysis of the melanoma from one individual revealed a 62 bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both CDKN2A and ARF. These somatic events suggest that concomitant inactivation of both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser predisposition. In this situation, the events follow a 'three-hit' model as observed in tumours from FAP patients with an attenuated phenotype. Overall, the data suggest a direct role for ARF haploinsufficiency in melanoma predisposition and co-operation between ARF and CDKN2A in tumour formation, consistent with recent observations in Cdkn2a-specific knockout mice.",

Given our previous study showing loss of pRb in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin and the clinicopathological similarities between SCLC and MCC, we wished to determine if this was also the case in MCC. Twenty-nine MCC specimens from 23 patients were examined for deletions at 10 loci on 9p and 1 on 9q. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was seen in 9 patients including 2 for which tumour and cell line DNAs were examined. Four patients had LOH for all informative loci on 9p. Ten tumours showed more limited regions of loss on 9p, and from these 2 common regions of deletion were determined. Half of all informative cases had LOH at D9S168, the most telomeric marker examined, and 3 specimens showed loss of only D9S168. A second region (IFNA-D9S126) showed LOH in 10 (44%) cases, and case MCC26 showed LOH for only D9S126, implicating genes centromeric of the CDKN2A locus. No mutations in the coding regions of p16 were seen in 7 cell lines tested, and reactivity to anti-p16 antibody was seen in all 11 tumour specimens examined and in 6 of 7 cell lines from 6 patients. Furthermore, all cell lines examined reacted with anti-p14(ARF) antibody.

MS-HRM is a less expensive technique compared with pyrosequencing but is usually more limited because it gives a range of methylation estimates rather than a single value. Here, we developed a method for deriving single estimates, rather than a range, of methylation using MS-HRM and compared the values obtained in this way with those obtained using the gold standard quantitative method of pyrosequencing. We derived an interpolation curve using standards of known methylated/unmethylated ratio (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of methylation) to obtain the best estimate of the extent of methylation for each of our samples. We observed similar profiles of methylation and a high correlation coefficient between the two techniques.

We included 531 patients: 271 patients with multiple primary melanoma (MPM) without mutations affecting p16INK4A (wild-type p16INK4A); 191 probands from melanoma-prone families with a single melanoma diagnosis and without mutations affecting p16INK4A, and 69 probands from different families carrying CDKN2A mutations affecting p16INK4A. A population-based series of 499 age- and sex-matched cancer-free individuals from the Spanish National Bank of DNA were included as controls. Patients were recruited between January 1, 1992, and June 30, 2014; data analysis was conducted from September 1 to November 30, 2014.;The genetic results of the MITF p.E318K variant were correlated with clinical and phenotypic features.;Among the 531 patients, the prevalence of the MITF p.E318K variant was calculated among the different subsets of patients included and was 1.9% (9 of 462) in all melanoma patients with wild-type p16INK4A, 2.6% (7 of 271) in those with MPM, and 2.9% (2 of 69) in the probands of families with p16INK4A mutations. With results reported as odds ratio (95% CI), the MITF p.E318K was associated with an increased melanoma risk (3.3 [1.43-7.43]; P < .01), especially in MPM (4.5 [1.83-11.01]; P < .01) and high nevi count (>200 nevi) (8.4 [2.14-33.19]; P < .01).

Stages II and III sporadic colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant FOLFOX were included. Eight CpG island loci (CACNA1G, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CDKN2A (p16), RUNX3 and SOCS1) and five microsatellite markers were examined. Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed according to CIMP and MSI status. A total of 322 patients were included: male/female 192/130, median age 61 years (range 30-78), proximal/distal location 118/204 and Stages II/III 43/279. CIMP status was high in 25 patients (7.8%) and 21 patients (6.5%) had MSI-high tumor.

We demonstrate that germline knockout of one allele of each of these genes causes accelerated onset and progression of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma compared with asbestos-exposed Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice. Ascites from some Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung, suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). Malignant mesothelioma cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type mice. Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC population. Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of c-Met.

In contrast to tumour cells, high expression of p16 in the surrounding stromal cells was not associated with the stage and grade, but was associated with longer survival. When all parameters were combined in a multivariate analysis, high p16 expression in stromal cells was not an independent predictor for survival, indicating that low p16 expression in stromal cells is associated with other markers of tumour progression.

Identification of markers that could predict the response to a particular regimen would thus be critically important for patient care. In cell lines or animal models, tumor protein p53 (TP53) plays a critical role in modulating the response to genotoxic drugs. TP53 is activated in response to DNA damage and triggers either apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest, which have opposite effects on cell fate. Yet, studies linking TP53 status and chemotherapy response have so far failed to unambiguously establish this paradigm in patients. Breast cancers with a TP53 mutation were repeatedly shown to have a poor outcome, but whether this reflects poor response to treatment or greater intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor is unknown.;In this study we analyzed 80 noninflammatory breast cancers treated by frontline (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Tumor diagnoses were performed on pretreatment biopsies, and the patients then received six cycles of a dose-dense regimen of 75 mg/m(2) epirubicin and 1,200 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide, given every 14 days. After completion of chemotherapy, all patients underwent mastectomies, thus allowing for a reliable assessment of chemotherapy response. The pretreatment biopsy samples were used to determine the TP53 status through a highly efficient yeast functional assay and to perform RNA profiling. All 15 complete responses occurred among the 28 TP53-mutant tumors. Furthermore, among the TP53-mutant tumors, nine out of ten of the highly aggressive basal subtypes (defined by basal cytokeratin [KRT] immunohistochemical staining) experienced complete pathological responses, and only TP53 status and basal subtype were independent predictors of a complete response. Expression analysis identified many mutant TP53-associated genes, including CDC20, TTK, CDKN2A, and the stem cell gene PROM1, but failed to identify a transcriptional profile associated with complete responses among TP53 mutant tumors. In patients with unresponsive tumors, mutant TP53 status predicted significantly shorter overall survival. The 15 patients with responsive TP53-mutant tumors, however, had a favorable outcome, suggesting that this chemotherapy regimen can overcome the poor prognosis generally associated with mutant TP53 status.;This study demonstrates that, in noninflammatory breast cancers, TP53 status is a key predictive factor for response to this dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen and further suggests that the basal subtype is exquisitely sensitive to this association. Given the well-established predictive value of complete responses for long-term survival and the poor prognosis of basal and TP53-mutant tumors treated with other regimens, this chemotherapy could be particularly suited for breast cancer patients with a mutant TP53, particularly those with basal features.",

Significant differences in three genes were found between colorectal cancer and hyperplastic polyp, colorectal cancer and healthy control, colon adenoma and hyperplastic polyp, colon adenoma and healthy control(all P<0.05). The diagnostic sensitivity by combining three methylation markers was 92.8% in colorectal cancer, 70.8% in colon adenomas, significantly higher than FOBT examination (29.0% in colorectal cancer and 25.0% in colon adenomas, all P<0.05).

Seven CDKN2A mutations were detected in 14 (2.5%) CMM patients. Relative risk of carrying a CDKN2A mutation for CMM patients was demonstrated to significantly increase with the presence of familial recurrence of melanoma (risk ratio (RR)=6.31; p=0.0009), multiple primary melanomas (RR=3.43; p=0.0014), and early onset age (RR=4.56; p=0.0026).

Phyllodes tumours, unlike fibroadenomas, have the ability to recur and metastasise. Although these lesions can be distinguished by their stromal cellularity, mitotic index, presence or absence of stromal overgrowth and cellular atypia, there is overlap and not infrequently a definitive diagnosis cannot be made, particularly on biopsy. We sought to evaluate whether DNA promoter methylation profiling using selected genes known to be methylated in cancer would allow us to learn more about the biology of these tumours, and whether it could identify methylation markers that could differentiate phyllodes tumours from fibroadenomas and/or distinguish phyllodes tumours of different grades. Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) was used to screen promoter DNA methylation changes in 86 phyllodes tumours (15 benign, 28 borderline, 43 malignant) and 26 fibroadenomas. A panel of 11 genes (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, RARβ, CDKN2A, CDH1, TP73 and MLH1) was tested. Methylation status was correlated with histology and with clinicopathological parameters. Five of the gene promoters showed some methylation in a proportion of phyllodes tumours; RASSF1A, 45.3%; TWIST1, 10.7%; APC, 4.1%; WIF1, 2.9% and MGMT, 1.3%. Only two genes showed any methylation in fibroadenomas usually at background levels; RASSF1A, 53.8% and MGMT, 8.3%. No CDKN2A methylation was observed in either tumour type, contrary to previous reports. Overall, the methylation patterns differed little from that which might be seen in normal cells. However, significant levels of methylation of RASSF1A (24.4%) and TWIST1 (7.1%) was observed in some phyllodes tumours. Elevated RASSF1A and/or TWIST1 methylation was significantly associated with phyllodes tumours compared with fibroadenomas (P = 0.02), TWIST1 methylation correlated with increasing malignancy in phyllodes tumours (P < 0.001). In conclusion, assessment of methylation of RASSF1A and TWIST1 may aid in the diagnosis of phyllodes tumours. The absence of frequent methylation in fibroadenomas supports a non-neoplastic origin.",

In the present study, miRNA and mRNA expression profiles (GSE40355) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. These consisted of healthy bladder samples (n=8) and urothelial carcinoma samples (low-grade, n=8 and high-grade, n=8). DE-miRNAs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package and the Benjamin and Hochberg method from the multtest package in R. Target genes of DE-miRNAs were screened. Associations between DEGs were investigated using STRING, and an interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for DEGs from the interaction network. 87 DE-miRNAs and 2058 DEGs were screened from low-grade bladder cancer samples, and 40 DE-miRNAs and 2477 DEGs were screened from high-grade bladder cancer samples. DE-target genes were significantly associated with the regulation of cell apoptosis. Bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer biological pathways were found to be enriched. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2F transcription factor 1, which is targeted by miR-106b, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog-2, which are targeted by miR-125b, participate in the bladder cancer pathway.

Melanoma susceptibility genes CDKN2A and CDK4 play a role in the development of melanoma, especially among some familial melanoma kindreds. The functions of CDKN2A and CDK4 in melanoma development, however, are currently incompletely understood. Therefore, at this time, predictive genetic testing for CDKN2A mutations outside of defined research protocols is not recommended because of the low likelihood of detecting mutations even in high-risk groups, the present inadequacy of interpreting a test result due to variations in penetrance and unclear associations with other cancers, and the minimal influence knowledge of mutation status currently has on medical management.

We showed that loss of PTEN cooperates with HRAS activation, leading to increased development of melanoma and emergence of metastasis. Moreover, we observed that RNA i-mediated PTEN inactivation in RAS-driven melanomas enhanced migration and invasion with concomitant downregulation of E-cadherin, the major regulator of epithelial and mesenchymal transition, and enhanced AKT2 phosphorylation, which has been previously linked to invasion and metastasis of several cancer types, including breast and ovary.

This study was carried out to analyze the miRNA expression profile of 17 MM samples using miRNA microarray. The analysis distinguished the overall miRNA expression profiles of tumor tissue and normal mesothelium. Differentially expressed miRNAs were found in tumor samples compared with normal sample. Twelve of them, let-7b*, miR-1228*, miR-195*, miR-30b*, miR-32*, miR-345, miR-483-3p, miR-584, miR-595, miR-615-3p, and miR-885-3p, were highly expressed whereas the remaining nine, let-7e*, miR-144*, miR-203, miR-340*, miR-34a*, miR-423, miR-582, miR-7-1*, and miR-9, were unexpressed or had severely reduced expression levels.

The functional role of DBC1 in normal cells and the role of DBC1 loss in cancer are not entirely clear.

High DBC1 expression correlated significantly with favorable clinicopathologic variables. Furthermore, in survival analysis, the high-DBC1 expression group showed a better survival rate compared to the low-DBC1 expression group.

In addition, loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D9S942, D9S1748, and D12S99 markers. Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications.

To address this limitation, we developed a novel bisulfite-microfluidic temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis (bisulfite-μTGCE) platform for gene methylation analysis by combining bisulfite treatment and slantwise radiative heating system-based μTGCE. Bisulfite-treated genomic DNA (gDNA) was amplified with universal primers for both methylated and unmethylated sequences, and introduced into glass microfluidic chip to perform electrophorectic separation under a continuous temperature gradient based on the formation of heteroduplexes. Eight CDKN2A promoter model fragments with different number and location of methylation sites were prepared and successfully analyzed according to their electrophoretic peak patterns, with high stability, picoliter-scale sample consumption, and significantly increased detection speed. The bisulfite-μTGCE could detect methylated gDNA with a detection limit of 7.5pg, and could distinguish as low as 0.1% methylation level in CDKN2A in an unmethylated background. Detection of seven colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with known and unknown methylation statuses of CDKN2A promoter and 20 tumor tissues derived from CRC patients demonstrated the capability of detecting hypermethylation in real-world samples. The wider adaptation of this platform was further supported by the detection of the CDKN2A and MLH1 promoters' methylation statuses in combination. This highly sensitive, fast, and low-consumption platform for methylation detection shows great potential for future clinical applications.",

Further markers on chromosomes 3 and 9 were analyzed individually.;Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified in 63% of tumors, most frequently on chromosome 3 (52%), in association with epithelioid cells (P = 0.0002) and microvascular loops (P = 0.0008). In the majority of cases, LOH on chromosome 3 was detected at all informative markers. The second most common alteration was LOH at an RB1 intragenic marker (21% tumors), with retention of a more centromeric 13q marker (near BRCA2). The pattern of LOH on chromosome 9p was consistent with the involvement of a region telomeric to CDKN2A. LOH at TP53 was infrequent.;In the majority of cases, chromosome 3 LOH involves an entire chromosome homologue, which hampers identification of the relevant suppressor loci. This LOH correlates with the presence of microvascular loops and epithelioid cells, two of the recognized histologic indicators of poor prognosis.

One of the issues is whether soy genistein has a genotoxic effect at physiological concentrations. To address this question using an in vitro model, we first established MCF-10A/G0 and MCF-10A/G1 cell lines, which were MCF-10A cells exposed to 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (as vehicle control), i.e., MCF-10A/G0, or 1 micromol/L of genistein for 3 months, MCF-10A/G1, respectively. Chromosomal changes were compared between the two cell lines by routine G-banded chromosome analyses and both regular and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. After 3 months of exposure to genistein, the cell line MCF-10A/G1 showed loss of a normal chromosome 8 and gain of an extra chromosome 20, as well as loss of a chromosomal segment on the short arm of chromosome 9, leading to a homozygous deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (alias p16(INK4a)) and CDKN2B (alias p15(INK4b)).

Two mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines were established which showed different phenotype in vivo: a non-metastatic cell line, Panc02, and a highly metastatic cell line, Panc02-H7, a derivative of Panc02. In order to investigate whether the genetic mutations of key genes in pancreatic cancer such as KRAS, TP53 (p53), CDKN2A (p16), SMAD4, ZIP4, and PDX-1 contribute to the phenotypic difference of these two mouse pancreatic cancer cells, we sequenced the exonic regions of these key genes in both cell lines and in the normal syngeneic mouse pancreas and compared them with the reference mouse genome sequence. The exons of KRAS, SMAD4, CDKN2A (p16), TP53 (p53), ZIP4, and PDX-1 genes were amplified and the genotype of these genes was determined by Sanger sequencing. The sequences were analyzed with Sequencher software. A mutation in SMAD4 was identified in both cell lines. This homozygote G to T mutation in the first position of codon 174 (GAA) generated a stop codon resulting in the translation of a truncated protein. Further functional analysis indicates that different TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways were involved in those two mouse cell lines, which may explain the phonotypic difference between the two cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KRAS gene (TAT to TAC at codon 32) was also identified in the normal pancreas DNA of the syngenic mouse and in both derived tumoral Panc02 and Panc02-H7 cells. No mutation or SNP was found in CDKN2A (p16), TP53 (p53), ZIP4, and PDX-1 genes in these two cell lines. The absence of mutations in genes such as KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A, which are considered as key genes in the development of human pancreatic cancer suggests that SMAD4 might play a central and decisive role in mouse pancreatic cancer. These results also suggest that other mechanisms are involved in the substantial phenotypic difference between these two mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular pathways that lead to the aggressive metastatic potential of Panc02-H7.",

Because of this heterogeneity, we provide a conservative estimate that about 5% (1,460) of PC cases in the US annually are hereditary. Although this number is relatively small, members of hereditary PC families serve as excellent models for studying the etiology, natural history, biomarkers, pathogenesis, potential carcinogenic exposures and their perturbation of underlying genetic events, and treatment of PC.

With increasing numbers of large-scale genomic datasets available, integrating these genomic data to identify driver genes from aberration regions of cancer genomes becomes an important goal of cancer genome analysis and investigations into mechanisms responsible for cancer development. A computational method, MAXDRIVER, is proposed here to identify potential driver genes on the basis of copy number aberration (CNA) regions of cancer genomes, by integrating publicly available human genomic data. MAXDRIVER employs several optimization strategies to construct a heterogeneous network, by means of combining a fused gene functional similarity network, gene-disease associations and a disease phenotypic similarity network. MAXDRIVER was validated to effectively recall known associations among genes and cancers. Previously identified as well as novel driver genes were detected by scanning CNAs of breast cancer, melanoma and liver carcinoma.

A majority of these deletions in lymphoid leukemia have been indicated to be mediated by illegitimate V(D)J recombination. In the present study, to elucidate the molecular processes of 9p21 deletions in nonlymphocytic malignancies, breakpoints for these deletions were analysed in 21 lung cancer cell lines and 32 nonlymphocytic cancer cell lines of nine other histological types. In all, 32 breakpoints in 21 lung cancer cell lines and 56 breakpoints in 32 nonlung cancer cell lines were mapped in a 450-kb segment encompassing the CDKN2A locus with a 10-kb resolution. The largest number of breakpoints (i.e., seven breakpoints in lung cancer and 12 breakpoints in nonlung cancers) was mapped in a 10-kb region containing the CDKN2A gene. More precise mapping of these seven and 12 breakpoints revealed that none of these breakpoints were located within 50-bp intervals to each other in this 10 kb region. Cloning and sequencing of breakpoints in 18 representative cell lines (six lung and 12 nonlung cancers) further revealed that there were no significant homologies among breakpoints in these 18 cell lines. In 11 (61%) cell lines, 1-5-bp nucleotides were overlapped at breakpoint junctions. These results indicate that DNA double-strand breaks triggering 9p21 deletions do not occur at specific DNA sequences, although they preferentially occur in or near the CDKN2A locus. It was also indicated that two broken DNA ends are rejoined by nonhomologous end-joining repair, preferentially utilizing microhomologies of DNA ends, in the occurrence of 9p21 deletions.",

To do so, we compared genetic profiles between EGFR mutated adenocarcinomas (ADC) and KRAS mutated ADC from 24 women with localized lung cancer.;Patterns of alterations were different between EGFR and KRAS mutated tumors and specific chromosomes alterations were linked to the EGFR mutated group. Indeed chromosome regions 14q21.3 (p = 0.027), 7p21.3-p21.2 (p = 0.032), 7p21.3 (p = 0.042) and 7p21.2-7p15.3 (p = 0.043) were found significantly amplified in EGFR mutated tumors. Within those regions 3 genes are of special interest ITGB8, HDAC9 and TWIST1. Moreover, homozygous deletions at CDKN2A and LOH at RB1 were identified in EGFR mutated tumors. We therefore tested the existence of a link between EGFR mutation, CDKN2A homozygous deletion and cyclin amplification in a larger series of tumors. Indeed, in a series of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (n = 98) we showed that homozygous deletions at CDKN2A were linked to EGFR mutations and absence of smoking whereas cyclin amplifications (CCNE1 and CCND1) were associated to TP53 mutations and smoking habit.;All together, our results show that genome wide patterns of alteration differ between EGFR and KRAS mutated lung ADC, describe two models of oncogenic cooperation involving either EGFR mutation and CDKN2A deletion or cyclin amplification and TP53 inactivating mutations and identified new chromosome regions at 7p and 14q associated to EGFR mutations in lung cancer.",

A case-control study, conducted in 240 patients with pre-B ALL and 277 healthy controls, combined with a family-based analysis using 135 parental trios, all of French-Canadian origin, were used to evaluate single-site genotypic as well as multilocus haplotypic associations for a total of 10 pSNPs. Using both study designs, we showed evidence of association between variants CDKN2A -222A, CDKN2B -593A, and CDKN1B -1608A, and an increased risk of ALL.

The data were examined with respect to clinical parameters including TNM staging, histologic grade, S phase, and ploidy.;Tumors from BRCA2 carriers of luminal and basal/triple-negative phenotypes (TNPs) differ with respect to patterns of DNA copy-number changes. The basal/TNP subtype was characterized by lack of pRb (RB1) coupled with high/intense expression of p16 (CDKN2A) gene products. We found increased proportions of Ki-67-positive cells to be significantly associated with loss of the wild-type (wt) BRCA2 allele in luminal types, whereas BRCA2wt loss was less frequent in BRCA2 tumors displaying basal/TNP phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that deletions at 13q13.1, involving the BRCA2wt allele, represents a part of a larger network of co-occurring genetic changes, including deletions at 6q22.32-q22.33, 11q14.2-q24.1, and gains at 17q24.1. Importantly, copy-number changes at these BRCA2-linked networking regions coincide with those associated with advanced progression, involving the capacity to metastasize to the nodes or more-distant sites at diagnosis.;The results presented here demonstrate divergent paths of tumor evolution in BRCA2 carriers and that deletion of the wild-type BRCA2 allele, together with co-occurring changes at 6 q, 11 q, and 17 q, are important events in progression toward advanced disease.",

In contrast, little is known about the function(s) of exon 2 of ARF, which contains the majority of mutations in human cancer. In addition to controlling TP53 stability, ARF also has a role in the induction of autophagy. However, whether the principal molecule involved is full-length ARF, or a small molecular weight variant called smARF, has been controversial. Additionally, whether tumor-derived mutations in exon 2 of CDKN2A affect ARF's autophagy function is unknown. Finally, whereas it is known that silencing or inhibiting TP53 induces autophagy, the contribution of ARF to this induction is unknown. In this report we used multiple autophagy assays to map a region located in the highly conserved 5' end of exon 2 of CDKN2A that is necessary for autophagy induction by both human and murine ARF. We showed that mutations in exon 2 of CDKN2A that affect the coding potential of ARF, but not p16INK4a, all impair the ability of ARF to induce autophagy. We showed that whereas full-length ARF can induce autophagy, our combined data suggest that smARF instead induces mitophagy (selective autophagy of mitochondria), thus potentially resolving some confusion regarding the role of these variants. Finally, we showed that silencing Tp53 induces autophagy in an ARF-dependent manner.

The canonical function of PRC2 is the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine residue 27. This epigenetic modification is associated with gene silencing. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions have been reported for PRC2, depending on cellular context. In leukemia mediated by the leukemogenic fusion MLL-AF9, complete ablation of canonical PRC2 function by genetic inactivation of the core component embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) or by combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PRC2 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 has a strong anti-leukemic effect, and this effect has been linked to de-repression of the PRC2 target locus Cdkn2a. We asked whether inactivation of Cdkn2a is sufficient to restore leukemic activity of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 leukemia cells, using combined genetic inactivation of Cdkn2a and Eed. We found that Cdkn2a inactivation partially rescues in vitro and in vivo growth of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 cells. However, the growth of Eed-null Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9 cells in the absence of Cdkn2a remained severely compromised in vitro and in vivo, compared with that of their Eed-floxed Cdkn2a-null counterparts. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that several genes previously implicated in inefficient growth of MLL-AF9-transformed cells, including Gata2, Egr1, and Cdkn2b were de-repressed as a consequence of Eed inactivation. Furthermore, we found that direct binding targets of MLL fusion proteins are negatively enriched in Eed-inactivated Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9-transformed cells.

However, arsenic trioxide has been recently reported to act via inhibition of DNA hypermethylation in some solid tumors. The goal of this study was to explore the mechanism of arsenic trioxide induced demethylation of the CDKN2B and CDKN2A promoters in the hematologic malignant cell lines Molt4, MUTZ-1, U937, U266 and CA46. We used bisulphate modification and nested-methylation specific PCR to determine the levels of methylated and unmethylated promoter sequences in untreated and As2O3-treated cells. We used semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting to quantify CDKN2B and CDKN2A mRNA and protein levels, respectively. We measured DNMT activity in nuclear extracts of untreated and treated cells using radiolabeled SAM as a methyl donor. The CDKN2B promoter was hypermethylated in Molt4 and MUTZ-1 cells, while the CDKN2A promoter was hypermethylated in U937, U266 and CA46 cells. As2O3 treatment caused demethylation associated with an increase in mRNA levels of the CDKN2B and CDKN2A genes. We also demonstrated a concomitant inhibition in DNMT activity and DNMT mRNA levels in As2O3-treated cells. In summary, As2O3 restored expression levels of tumor suppressor genes in hematologic malignant cells by causing promoter demethylation along with an inhibition of DNMTs 1, 3a and 3b.",

For comparison, sera from patients with other skin tumors (nine basal cell cancers, five Kaposi's sarcoma), different metastasized cancers (five breast cancers, five colon cancers), and several chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 12) were also analyzed. In addition, we examined if methylation was involved in silencing transcription of these genes in 12 melanoma specimens.

The aim of this study was to verify the associations between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and the methylation status of three gastric cancer-related genes. The influence of H. pylori strains was also assessed. DNA extracted from 71 gastric tumor samples was available for MTHFR C677T genotyping by PCR-RFLP, promoter methylation identification by MS-PCR and H. pylori detection and posterior subtyping (cagA and vacA genes) by PCR. In the distal tumors, a positive correlation was found between the methylation of CDKN2A and the allele T carriers (r=0.357; p=0.009). Considering the eldest patients (age ≥60 years old), this correlation was even higher (r=0,417; p=0.014). H. pylori infection by highly pathogenic strains (cagA+/vacAs1m1) was also found correlated to promoter methylation of CDKN2A and the allele T carriers in distal tumors (r=0.484; p=0.026). No significant correlation was verified between MTHFR C677T genotype and promoter methylation status when we analyzed the general sample. DNA methylation in CDKN2A associated to the MTHFR 677T carrier is suggested to be a distal tumor characteristic, especially in those 60 years old or older, and it seems to depend on the infection by H. pylori cagA/vacAs1m1 strains.",

The studies in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) reveal that Kras-activating mutations predispose mice to early onset tumors in the lung, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, most of these tumors do not have metastatic phenotypes. Metastasis occurs when tumors acquire additional genetic changes in other cancer driver genes. Studies on clinical specimens also demonstrated that KRAS mutations are present in premalignant tissues and that most of KRAS mutant human cancers have co-mutations in other cancer driver genes, including TP53, STK11, CDKN2A, and KMT2C in lung cancer; APC, TP53, and PIK3CA in colon cancer; and TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and MED12 in pancreatic cancer. Extensive efforts have been devoted to develop therapeutic agents that target enzymes involved in RAS posttranslational modifications, that inhibit downstream effectors of RAS signaling pathways, and that kill RAS mutant cancer cells through synthetic lethality. Recent clinical studies have revealed that sorafenib, a pan-RAF and VEGFR inhibitor, has impressive benefits for KRAS mutant lung cancer patients. Combination therapy of MEK inhibitors with either docetaxel, AKT inhibitors, or PI3K inhibitors also led to improved clinical responses in some KRAS mutant cancer patients. This review discusses knowledge gained from GEMMs, human cancer cells, and patient-related studies on RAS-mediated tumorigenesis and anti-RAS therapy. Emerging evidence demonstrates that RAS mutant cancers are heterogeneous because of the presence of different mutant alleles and/or co-mutations in other cancer driver genes. Effective subclassifications of RAS mutant cancers may be necessary to improve patients' outcomes through personalized precision medicine.",

An interesting feature of this disease is the relatively young age of the affected women. The average age in the present cohort of 100 sporadic cases of invasive ductal carcinomas was 45 years, with a median of 46 years (range between 19-81 years). In an effort to understand the molecular signature of BC in the Saudi population, we undertook this study to profile the methylation events in a series of key genes including Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 1 isoform a (RASSF1A), hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), paired-like homeodomain 2 (PITX2), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1), and slit homolog 2 (SLIT2), using MethyLight analysis in archival tumour samples. Interestingly, the overall methylation levels were low in this cohort, with only 84% of the cases displaying methylation in one or more of the analysed genes. The frequency of RASSF1A methylation was the highest (65%), while there was almost complete absence of methylation of the ESR1 and the CDH1 genes (1% and 3%, respectively). Several statistically significant correlations were identified between specific methylation events and clinical parameters which gained more significance when analysis was limited to the estrogen receptor positive samples. Although there was no significant correlations between any methylation event and disease-specific survival, methylation of MYOD1 or RASSF1A was associated with lower disease-free survival and increased chance of disease recurrence. Furthermore, multivariate (Cox) regression analysis identified RASSF1A as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in terms of disease-free survival in this cohort. Our findings provide further evidence on the usefulness of RASSF1A methylation status as an informative prognostic biomarker in BC in a Saudi population.",

Three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%. DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral CT, improving early detection. In lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum. To date the penetrance of DNA methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. We used the real-time PCR-based method MethyLight to examine DNA methylation quantitatively at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples from non-lung cancer patients.;We identified thirteen loci showing significant differential DNA methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor lung; eight of these show highly significant hypermethylation in adenocarcinoma: CDH13, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1, OPCML, RASSF1, SFPR1, and TWIST1 (p-value << 0.0001). Using the current tissue collection and 5-fold cross validation, the four most significant loci (CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML) individually distinguish lung adenocarcinoma from non-cancer lung with a sensitivity of 67-86% and specificity of 74-82%. DNA methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers. We applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.;The identification of eight CpG island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum. The four most highly ranked loci, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML, which show significant DNA methylation even in stage IA tumor samples, merit further investigation as some of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date.",

Importantly, these molecular findings may fuel significant clues to cancer control. This background is mentioned since surveillance and management of pancreatic cancer, a major concern of this manuscript, has been uniformly unsuccessful as evidenced by the close correspondence between its incidence and its mortality. Yet knowledge about its genetic and molecular pathology will hopefully ameliorate this vexing problem. One molecular genetic clue is the recently identified palladin mutation in two pancreatic cancer prone families. However, caution must be used toward the palladin mutation, as several recent publications have questioned its significance as a pancreatic cancer causing mutation.

This knowledge should help clinicians and basic scientists seize on the opportunity to develop more sensitive and specific screening and management programs in this disease; while a relatively small subset of pancreatic cancer may be readily identifiable through its FAMMM phenotype, coupled with its CDKN2A mutation, this hereditary disorder, given a keen knowledge of its natural history and molecular genetics, may prove to be an effective clinical preventive model.",

Patient A is a girl treated for anaplastic astrocytoma at 10 years and for multiple melanomas on the scalp associated to dysplastic nevi two years later. Her monozygotic twin sister carried dysplastic nevi and a slow growing, untreated cerebral lesion. Direct sequencing analysis showed no alterations in melanoma susceptibility genes including CDKN2A, CDK4, MC1R and MITF or in TP53. By microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array comparative genomic hybridization a deletion including the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2BAS gene cluster was detected in both twin sisters, encompassing a large region at 9p21.3 and occurring de novo after the loss of one paternal allele.Patient B is a boy of 7 years when treated for astrocytoma then developing melanoma associated to congenital nevi on the head 10 years later: sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed a normal profile of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B/CDKN2BAS region. Array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed the absence of deletions at 9p21.3 and failed to reveal known pathogenic copy number variations.;By comparison with the other germ line deletions at the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2BAS gene cluster reported in melanoma susceptible families, the deletion detected in the two sisters is peculiar for its de novo origin and for its extension, as it represents the largest constitutive deletion at 9p21.3 region identified so far.In addition, the two studied cases add to other evidence indicating association of melanoma with exposure to ionizing radiation and with second neoplasm after childhood cancer.

Hybrid fish can spontaneously develop melanomas deriving from the inheritance of melanistic pigment patterns and the simultaneous absence of proper genetic regulation. A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene, termed CDKN2X, was mapped to a genomic region that is implicated in fish melanoma tumor suppression. The related human tumor suppressor locus CDKN2A (P16, INK4A, MTS1) is deleted, mutated or transcriptionally repressed through methylation of cytosine bases within the 5' CpG island in a variety of neoplasms, including melanoma. The fish CDKN2X locus harbors a CpG island within its promoter and first exon, analogous in location to CpG islands in human CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci. The methylation state of individual CpG dinucleotides was investigated in genomic DNA derived from control tissues and melanomas within the CDKN2X 5' CpG island. The studied genomic area was found to be virtually unmethylated in all tested tissues including melanomas. In addition, RNA expression studies of the fish CDKN2X locus revealed that it is significantly overexpressed in melanoma, in contrast to what has been reported for the human CDKN2A locus in melanoma. Such overexpression may be a consequence of the pronounced upregulation of the Xmrk-2 receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene reported in several Xiphophorus melanoma models.",

The role for CDKN2A and ARF in tumorigenesis is well established, but whether MTAP loss directly affects tumorigenesis is unclear. MTAP encodes the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway. To determine if loss of MTAP plays a functional role in tumorigenesis, we have created an MTAP-knockout mouse. Mice homozygous for a MTAP null allele (Mtap(lacZ)) have an embryonic lethal phenotype dying around day 8 postconception. Mtap/Mtap(lacZ) heterozygotes are born at Mendelian frequencies and appear indistinguishable from wild-type mice during the first year of life, but they tend to die prematurely with a median survival of 585 days. Autopsies on these animals reveal that they have greatly enlarged spleens, altered thymic histology, and lymphocytic infiltration of their livers, consistent with lymphoma. Immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicate that these lymphomas are primarily T-cell in origin. Lymphoma-infiltrated tissues tend to have reduced levels of Mtap mRNA and MTAP protein in addition to unaltered levels of methyldeoxycytidine. These studies show that Mtap is a tumor suppressor gene independent of CDKN2A and ARF.",

Frequent loss of the whole chromosome suggests the presence of at least one relevant tumor suppressor gene on each arm. Candidate regions identified by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis include a region at 9p21 containing CDKN2A, which encodes p16 and p14(ARF), a large region at 9q12-31 including PTCH and many other genes, a small region at 9q32-33, which includes the DBCCR1 gene, and a region at 9q34 including the TSC1 gene. Experimental replacement of genes or chromosomes into tumor cells with appropriate deletions or mutations represents an important approach to test the functional significance of candidate tumor suppressor genes. Loss of an entire copy of chromosome 9 in many bladder tumor cell lines provides no indication of which gene or genes are affected, and selection of appropriate recipient cells for gene replacement is difficult. We have investigated three candidate tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, DBCCR1, and TSC1), at the DNA level and by expression analysis in a panel of bladder tumor cell lines, many of which have probable LOH along the length of the chromosome, as indicated by homozygosity for multiple polymorphic markers. Cytogenetically, we found no reduction in the numbers of chromosomes 9 relative to total chromosome count. Homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus was frequent but homozygous deletion of TSC1 was not found. A new cell line, DSH1, derived from a pT1G2 transitional cell carcinoma with known homozygous deletion of DBCCR1, is described. This study identifies suitable cell lines for future functional analysis of both CDKN2A and DBCCR1.",

We screened 150 histologically confirmed cervical cancer cases along with equal number of healthy controls with normal cervical cytology. PCR-RFLP method was employed for genotyping of SNPs in p16 C540G (rs11515), C580T (rs3088440) in the 3'-UTR of exon 3 and RB1 A153104G (rs4151580) located in the intron 18 and confirmed by direct sequencing. Both patients and controls were screened for HPV infection. In this case-control study 84.67% (127/150) of cases were found to be positive for HPV DNA sequence. Women carrying p16 C540G carrier genotypes 540 (CG/GG) may have protective effect for the development of cervical cancer (P=0.0001, OR=0.31, 95% CI=0.17-0.56).

Contrary to this, SNP at A153104G of RB1 gene showed statistically significant association (P=0.035, OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.06-2.68) with increased susceptibility for the development of cervical cancer.

The 3p14 translocation breakpoint occurs within BAC RP11-795e22, which accommodates only the TAFA1 gene, a novel cysteine-rich secreted protein thought to be involved in cytokine signaling. TAFA1 is expressed in normal breast tissue, not in MCF10A, and shows differential expression in a range of breast cancer cell lines. The 9p translocation breakpoint results in a deletion of approximately 4 megabases on the derivative chromosome 9, which includes the CDKN2A (p16) gene. Array CGH and FISH analysis demonstrated that BAC 149i22, which contains the CDKN2A/B genes, is also deleted specifically on the apparently normal copy of chromosome 9, making MCF10A null for the p16/p15 genes.

To examine whether a correlation between TSG inactivation and viral infection can be found in MCC, we investigated the promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A, TP73, PTPRG, FHIT, and CDKN2A and the presence of MCPyV and SV40 in 98 MCC by PCR.

However, little is known regarding the function of p15INK4B translated from the same locus. To determine the frequency of CDKN2AB loss in human mutant KRAS lung cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was interrogated. Two-hit inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B occurs frequently in patients with mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, p15INK4B loss occurs in the presence of biallelic inactivation of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), suggesting that p15INK4B loss confers a selective advantage to mutant KRAS lung cancers that are p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) deficient. To determine the significance of CDKN2AB loss in vivo, genetically engineered lung cancer mouse models that express mutant Kras in the respiratory epithelium were utilized. Importantly, complete loss of CDKN2AB strikingly accelerated mutant Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis, leading to loss of differentiation, increased metastatic disease, and decreased overall survival. Primary mutant Kras lung epithelial cells lacking Cdkn2ab had increased clonogenic potential. Furthermore, comparative analysis of mutant Kras;Cdkn2a null with Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice and experiments with mutant KRAS;CDKN2AB-deficient human lung cancer cells indicated that p15INK4B is a critical tumor suppressor. Thus, the loss of CDKN2AB is of biologic significance in mutant KRAS lung tumorigenesis by fostering cellular proliferation, cancer cell differentiation, and metastatic behavior.;These findings indicate that mutant Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice provide a platform for accurately modeling aggressive lung adenocarcinoma and testing therapeutic modalities.",

We have adapted a high-throughput genotyping platform to determine the mutation status of a large panel of known cancer genes. OncoMap v.4.4 was used to evaluate genomic DNA isolated from a set of 92 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors, consisting of matched paired samples of initially diagnosed and recurrent tumors from 46 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Mutations were observed in 33.7% of the samples, with 29.3% of these samples having a single mutation and the remaining 4.3% having two or more mutations. Among the 41 genes analyzed, 35 mutations were found in four genes, namely, CDKN2A (2.2%), KRAS (6.5%), MLH1 (8.2%) and TP53 (20.7%). TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene, but there was no correlation between the presence of mutation in any gene and clinical prognosis. Furthermore, somatic mutations did not differ between primary and recurrent ovarian carcinomas. Every mutation present in recurrent samples was detected in the corresponding primary sample. In conclusion, these OncoMap data of Korean EOC samples provide that somatic mutations were found in CDKN2A, KRAS, MLH1, and TP53. No differences in mutational status between primary and recurrent samples were detected. To understand the biology of tumor recurrence in epithelial ovarian cancer, more studies are necessary, including epigenetic modifications or additional mutations in other genes. ",

We have recently shown a positive correlation between MSI/CIMP and loss of nuclear p27. However, no study has examined cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization in relation to CIMP and MSI in colorectal cancer. Using MethyLight assays, we quantified DNA methylation in 8 CIMP-specific gene promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) in 853 colorectal cancer samples obtained from 2 large prospective cohorts. We assessed expressions of nuclear and cytoplasmic p27 and nuclear p53 by immunohistochemistry. Cytoplasmic p27 expression was inversely associated with loss of nuclear p27 (P < .0001), CIMP-high (P < .0001), MSI-H (P < .0001), and BRAF mutations (P < .0001). The inverse association of cytoplasmic p27 with CIMP-high (or MSI-H) was independent of MSI (or CIMP) status. In addition, the inverse association of cytoplasmic p27 with CIMP-high was independent of KRAS/BRAF status. BRAF and CDKN2A (p16) methylation were not correlated with cytoplasmic p27 after stratification by CIMP status. The inverse associations of cytoplasmic p27 with MSI-H and CIMP-high were much more pronounced in p53-negative than p53-positive tumors. In conclusion, cytoplasmic p27 expression is inversely associated with MSI-H and CIMP-high, particularly in p53-negative tumors, suggesting interplay of functional losses of p27 and p53 in the development of various molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.",

A recent deletion mapping study of chromosome 9p has also identified a site of deletion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) centered around D9S126. The Hel-N1 (human elav-like neuronal protein 1) gene encodes a neural-specific RNA binding protein that is expressed in SCLC. We have mapped this potentially important gene in lung tumorigenesis to within 100 kb of the D9S126 marker at chromosome band 9p21 by using homozygously deleted tumor cell lines and fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal metaphase spreads. Hel-N1 is, therefore, a candidate target suppressor gene in both SCLC and NSCLC. We have determined the genomic organization and intron/exon boundaries of Hel-N1 and have screened the entire coding region for mutations by sequencing 14 primary SCLCs and cell lines and 21 primary NSCLCs preselected for localized 9p21 deletion or monosomy of chromosome 9. A homozygous deletion including Hel-N1 and CDKN2a was found in a SCLC cell line, and a single-base polymorphism in exon 2 of Hel-N1 was observed in eight tumors.

It is of utmost importance to know the clonal relationships between multiple tumor localizations, enabling differentiation between multiple primaries or metastatic disease with consequences for therapy and prognosis. We evaluated the value of targeted next generation sequencing in the diagnostic workup of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with ≥2 tumor localizations and uncertain tumor origins. Forty-two female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with ≥2 tumor localizations were selected. Patients with inconclusive tumor origin after histopathological revision were 'cases'; patients with certain tumor origin of ≥3 tumors served as 'controls'. Tumors of cases and controls were analyzed by targeted next generation sequencing using a panel including CDKN2A, PTEN and TP53, hotspot mutation sites for 27 different genes and 143 single nucleotide polymorphisms for detection of loss of heterozygosity. Based on prevalence of identical or different mutations and/or loss of heterozygosity patterns, tumors were classified as 'multiple primaries' or 'one entity'. Conventional histopathology yielded a conclusive result in 38/42 (90%) of patients. Four cases and 10 controls were analyzed by next generation sequencing. In 44 tumor samples, 48 mutations were found; 39 (81%) concerned TP53 mutations. In all 4 cases, the intra-patient clonal relationships between the tumor localizations could be unequivocally identified by molecular analysis. In all controls, molecular outcomes matched the conventional histopathological results. In most BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with multiple tumors routine pathology work-up is sufficient to determine tumor origins and relatedness. In case of inconclusive conventional pathology results, molecular analyses using next generation sequencing can reliably determine clonal relationships between tumors, enabling optimal treatment of individual patients.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 9 September 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.145.",

About 90% of CUP represent adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. Since therapy regimens are only modestly effective, identification of the molecular landscape of these neoplasms might be a promising approach to direct CUP therapy and aid in tumor classification. We screened a cohort of 128 patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma meeting the definition of CUP. Massive parallel multigene sequencing of 50 genes, which had been selected due to their relevance as oncogenic drivers or druggable molecular targets could ultimately be performed on samples from 55 patients for whom complete clinical datasets were also available. Overall, 60 tumor-specific mutations and 29 amplifications/deletions, as revealed by coverage analysis, were detected in 46 cases (84%). The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (30 cases, 55%), KRAS (9 cases, 16%), CDKN2A (5 cases, 9%), and SMAD4 (5 cases, 9%). The most frequently deleted gene was CDKN2A (8 cases, 15%). KRAS and CDKN2A mutations significantly correlated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and, in case of KRAS, overall survival (OS). WIldtype TP53 and female sex defined a relatively favorable category, with favorable PFS and OS. 8 cases (15%) harbored mutations that may be targetable by currently approved drugs.

To date, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), which was identified as the first melanoma susceptibility gene more than 20 years ago, is the main high-risk gene for melanoma. A few years later cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was also identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene. The technologic advances have allowed the identification of new genes involved in melanoma susceptibility: Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) associated protein 1 (BAP1), CXC genes, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), protection of telomeres 1 (POT1), ACD and TERF2IP, the latter four being involved in telomere maintenance. Furthermore variants in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) give a moderately increased risk to develop melanoma. Melanoma genetic counseling is offered to families in order to better understand the disease and the genetic susceptibility of developing it. Genetic counseling often implies genetic testing, although patients can benefit from genetic counseling even when they do not fulfill the criteria for these tests. Genetic testing for melanoma predisposition mutations can be used in clinical practice under adequate selection criteria and giving a valid test interpretation and genetic counseling to the individual.

However, a choice of markers for CIMP has been controversial. A recent extensive investigation has selected five methylation markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) as surrogate markers for epigenomic aberrations in tumor. The use of these markers as a CIMP-specific panel needs to be validated by an independent, large dataset. Using MethyLight assays on 920 colorectal cancers from two large prospective cohort studies, we quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific markers [the above five plus CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, and MLH1]. A CIMP-high cutoff was set at > or = 6/8 or > or = 5/8 methylated promoters, based on tumor distribution and BRAF/KRAS mutation frequencies. All but two very specific markers [MLH1 (98% specific) and SOCS1 (93% specific)] demonstrated > or = 85% sensitivity and > or = 80% specificity, indicating overall good concordance in methylation patterns and good performance of these markers. Based on sensitivity, specificity, and false positives and negatives, the eight markers were ranked in order as: RUNX3, CACNA1G, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CRABP1, SOCS1, and CDKN2A. In conclusion, a panel of markers including at least RUNX3, CACNA1G, IGF2, and MLH1 can serve as a sensitive and specific marker panel for CIMP-high.",

Exposure to BPA for 1 week at the early stage at passage 8 increased the proliferation and sphere size of HMEC at the later stage up to passage 16, suggesting that BPA has the capability to modulate cell growth in breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, the number of human heterochromatin protein-1γ positive cells, which is a marker of senescence, was also increased among BPA-treated cells. Consistent with these findings, the protein levels of both p16 and cyclin E, which are known to induce cellular senescence and promote proliferation, respectively, were increased in BPA-exposed HMEC. Furthermore, DNA methylation levels of genes related to development of most or all tumor types, such as BRCA1, CCNA1, CDKN2A (p16), THBS1, TNFRSF10C and TNFRSF10D, were increased in BPA-exposed HMEC.

Frequencies of deletions at the 18 regions were evaluated by genomic polymerase chain reaction in 78 lung cancer cell lines. Seven regions, 2q24, 3p14, 5q11, 9p21, 9p23, 11q14, and 21q21, were homozygously deleted in two or more cell lines.

The use of these mutations as diagnostic markers is challenging, because tumor cells are frequently admixed with normal cells, particularly in early stage tumor samples, and thus the samples contain a high background of normal DNA. Detection is further confounded by the fact that the rearrangement boundaries are not conserved across individuals, and might vary over hundreds of kilobases. Here, we present an algorithm for designing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and oligonucleotide probes to assay for these variant rearrangements. Specifically, the primers and probes tile the entire genomic region surrounding a rearrangement, so as to amplify the mutant DNA over a wide range of possible breakpoints and robustly assay for the amplified signal on an array. Our solution involves the design of a complex combinatorial optimization problem, and also includes a novel alternating multiplexing strategy that makes efficient detection possible. Simulations show that we can achieve near-optimal detection in many different cases, even when the regions are highly non-symmetric. Additionally, we prove that the suggested multiplexing strategy is optimal in breakpoint detection. We applied our technique to create a custom design to assay for genomic lesions in several cancer cell-lines associated with a disruption in the CDKN2A locus. The CDKN2A deletion has highly variable boundaries across many cancers. We successfully detect the breakpoint in all cell-lines, even when the region has undergone multiple rearrangements. These results point to the development of a successful protocol for early diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. For online Supplementary Material, see www.liebertonline.com.",

CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a phenotype of colorectal cancer with extensive promoter methylation, and associated with high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and BRAF mutations. We have recently shown that both CIMP and MSI-H are inversely associated with downregulation of p21 (CDKN1A or CIP1), another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. However, no study to date has examined relationship between p27 and CIMP status in colorectal cancer. Using MethyLight assays, we measured DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters {CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, MLH1 and NEUROG1} in 706 colorectal cancer samples obtained from two large prospective cohorts. Among the 706 tumors, 112 (16%) were CIMP-high tumors with >or=4/5 methylated promoters. We assessed p27 and p53 expressions by immunohistochemistry. Loss of nuclear p27 expression {observed in 231 tumors (33%)} was significantly associated with CIMP-high, MSI-H and BRAF mutations, and these associations were much more pronounced among p53-negative tumors than p53-positive tumors. When CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high tumors were stratified by MSI status (or KRAS and BRAF status), CIMP-high and MSI-H (but not BRAF mutations) were still significantly associated with nuclear p27 loss. Nuclear p27 loss did not appear to be directly related to CDKN2A (p16) methylation. We conclude that downregulation of nuclear p27 is associated with CIMP-high and MSI-H in colorectal cancer. These associations are stronger among p53 wild-type tumors, implying important interplay of p27 and p53 functions (or dysfunctions) in the development of various molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.",

We investigated the involvement of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and p53 genes in AK and in the progression of AK to SCC. Mutational analysis on exons 1a, 1b and 2 of the CDKN2A locus and exon 1 of the CDKN2B locus as well as allelic imbalance was performed in 26 AK specimens. Expression levels of the genes p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a) and p53 were examined in 16 AKs and 12 SCCs by real-time RT-PCR. A previously described polymorphism of p16(INK4a) (Ala148Thr) was detected at an allelic frequency of 12%. Six samples carried novel mutations at codon 71 of the CDKN2A locus and one sample presented an additional mutation at codon 65. Two AK samples carried a not-previously described non-UV type missense mutation at codon 184 (Val184Glu) of exon 1b in the p14(ARF) gene. Regarding the CDKN2B locus a new mutation at codon 50 (Ala50Thr) and another at codon 24 (Arg24Arg), were detected. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was found in 15% of AKs in at least one marker, indicating that genetic instability has some implication in the development of AK. Down-regulation of p16(INK4a) and p53 mRNA levels was noted in SCC compared to AK. TSGs expression levels in sun-exposed morphologically normal-appearing skin, suggests that abnormal growth stimuli might exist in these tissues as well. Furthermore, we suggest a possible role of p15(INK4b), independently from the intracellular pathway mediated by p16(INK4a), and of p14(ARF) in AK development, as well as in the progression of AK to SCC. The deregulation of the expression profiles of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and p53 genes may, independently of mutations and LOH at 9p21, play a significant role in AK and progression of AK to SCC.",

Transcriptional repressor Id1 is overexpressed in many malignancies including melanoma, and Id1 targets include tumor suppressor genes TSP1, CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN1A (p21), which are frequently epigenetically silenced in cancer. We confirmed that both TSP1 and CDKN2A have abnormal promoter region DNA methylation in primary melanoma, but the mechanism by which this silencing occurs remains unknown. Here we explore the effects of stable lentiviral Id1 overexpression on the expression of these Id1 target genes in human melanoma cell lines. Overexpressed Id1 was functional and bound transcriptional activator E2A, but did not sequester E2A from gene promoters and repress gene expression. Therefore, these Id1 target genes were resistant to Id1-mediated gene silencing. Our results suggest that Id1 activation may need to occur at discrete stages in cooperation with additional gene dysregulation to repress and induce epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes during melanoma progression.",

The wild-type 5'-UTR sequence, containing a reported SNP (c.-33G > C) and a known melanoma-predisposing mutation (c.-34G > T), was included as controls. Results revealed that the variants at -21 and -34 severely reduced the reporter activity. The variants at -56 and at -25&-180 exhibited a milder impact, while results with c.-67G > C were dependent on the plasmid type. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA indicated that the effects of the variants were mainly post-transcriptional. Using a bicistronic dual-luciferase reporter plasmid, we confirmed that c.-21C > T and c.-34G > T had a severe negative impact in both cell lines. We also applied a polysomal profiling technique to samples heterozygous for the 5'-UTR variants, including patient-derived lymphoblasts. Analysis of allelic imbalance indicated that in addition to the c.-21C > T variant, the c.-56T > G and c.-67G > C variants also reduced mRNA translation efficiency. Overall, our results suggest that the c.-21C > T sequence variant is a melanoma-predisposing mutation.

The MTHFR gene has genetic variants (C667T and A1298C), which cause reduced enzyme activity. Impaired folate metabolism by these genetic variants of MTHFR could change the methylation pattern of DNA including promoter hypermethylation, which has been frequently observed in cancer. In this study, we compared the MTHFR genotypes and haplotype to the features of colorectal cancer focusing on the promoter methylation of tumor DNA.;Genomic DNA was isolated from 194 colorectal cancer tissues and subjected to MTHFR genotyping by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The MTHFR haplotype was determined by combination of C667T and A1298C genotype and classified into 2 groups, high (H-haplotype) or low (L-haplotype) enzymatic activity of MTHFR. The methylation level of tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A, hMLH1, ARF and TIMP3) was measured by a fluorescence-based, real-time methylation specific PCR method.;There was no significant association of the clinicopathological features with either C667T genotype, A1298C genotype or haplotype of MTHFR. The methylation level of CDKN2A was higher in cancer with the L-haplotype of MTHFR than in that with the H-haplotype when cancers of proximal origin were considered (p=0.029). hMLH1 methylation also tended to be higher in proximal colon cancers of MTHFR L-haplotype (p=0.059). In addition, the proximal colon cancers showing CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) were significantly more frequent in L-haplotype than in H-haplotype.;These results suggest that the haplotype with low enzymatic activity of MTHFR is linked with promoter hypermethylation and consequently modifies the risk of CIMP(+) proximal colon cancer development in the Japanese people. The relationship between MTHFR polymorphism and DNA methylation in the Japanese is contrary to the previous results in Caucasians. Further study is needed focusing on ethnic variations in the relationships among MTHFR polymorphism, DNA methylation and the development of CIMP(+) colorectal cancer.",

We report here a clinical-epidemiological study, including the presence of additional neoplasias, in 14 apparently unrelated kindreds coming from a small geographic region of Northern Italy (Liguria), having therefore lived for generations in similar environmental conditions.

In addition, the inactive-X is marked by the histone macroH2A, a variant of H2A with a large non-histone region of unknown function. Studying tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) silenced in cancer cell lines, we find that when active, these promoters are associated with H2A.Z but become enriched for macroH2A1 once silenced. Knockdown of macroH2A1 was not sufficient for reactivation of silenced genes. However, when combined with DNA demethylation, macroH2A1 deficiency significantly enhanced reactivation of the tumor suppressor genes p16, MLH1 and Timp3 and inhibited cell proliferation.

Identification of new molecular targets is clearly needed to improve therapeutic outcomes of this devastating human disease. Activating mutations in K-Ras oncogene and increased expression of FOXM1 protein are associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Transgenic expression of activated Kras(G12D) in mouse respiratory epithelium is sufficient to induce lung adenocarcinomas; however, transcriptional mechanisms regulated by K-Ras during the initiation of lung cancer remain poorly understood. Foxm1 transcription factor, a downstream target of K-Ras, stimulates cellular proliferation during embryogenesis, organ repair and tumor growth, but its role in tumor initiation is unknown. In the present study, we used transgenic mice expressing Kras(G12D) under control of Sftpc promoter to demonstrate that Foxm1 was induced in type II epithelial cells before the formation of lung tumors. Conditional deletion of Foxm1 from Kras(G12D)-expressing respiratory epithelium prevented the initiation of lung tumors in vivo. The loss of Foxm1 inhibited expression of K-Ras target genes critical for the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, including Ikbkb, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, Rela, Jnk1, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a. Transgenic overexpression of activated FOXM1 mutant was sufficient to induce expression of these genes in alveolar type II cells. FOXM1 directly bound to promoter regions of Ikbkb, Nfkb2, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a, indicating that these genes are direct FOXM1 targets.

The methylation status of CDKN2A and RASSF1 promoters was examined by pyrosequencing. UHRF1 was knocked down by short hairpin RNA in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.;All 4 genes were overexpressed in a coordinated manner in the lung tumor tissues, and their expression correlated with that of E2F1. Higher UHRF1 expression in tumor tissues correlated with the hypermethylation of CDKN2A (P = .005) and RASSF1 promoters (P = .034), and the relationship with a combined epigenotype was even stronger (P = 2.3 × 10(-4) ). When UHRF1 was knocked down in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, lower methylation levels of RASSF1, CYGB, and CDH13 promoters were observed. Also, UHRF1 knockdown clones demonstrated reduced proliferation and decreased cell migration properties.;Our data demonstrate that UHRF1 is a key epigenetic switch, which controls cell cycle in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma through its ability to sustain the transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes by maintaining their promoters in a hypermethylated status. Thus, UHRF1 should be considered, along with DNMTs, among the potential targets for cancer treatment and/or therapeutic stratification.",

We explored next-generation sequencing to detect mutations with the analytical sensitivity required to predict concurrent high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with Barrett's esophagus by testing nonneoplastic BIM. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) routine biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection samples from 32 patients were tested: nonprogressors to HGD or EAC (BIM-NP) with BIM, who never had a diagnosis of dysplasia or EAC (N = 13); progressors to HGD or EAC (BIM-P) with BIM and a worse diagnosis of HGD or EAC (N = 15); and four BIM-negative samples. No mutations were detected in the BIM-NP (0 of 13) or BIM-negative samples, whereas the BIM-P samples had mutations in 6 (75%) of 8 cases in TP53, APC, and CDKN2A (P = 0.0005), detected in samples with as low as 20% BIM. We found that next-generation sequencing from routine FFPE nonneoplastic Barrett's esophagus samples can detect multiple mutations in minute areas of BIM with high analytical sensitivity. Next-generation sequencing panels for detection of TP53 and possibly combined mutations in other genes, such as APC and CDKN2A, may be useful in the clinical setting to improve dysplasia and cancer surveillance in patients with Barrett's esophagus.

Integrating data from comprehensive genomic profiling of cancer cell lines and from functional characterization of cancer cell dependencies, we discovered that loss of the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) confers a selective dependence on protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and its binding partner WDR77. MTAP is frequently lost due to its proximity to the commonly deleted tumor suppressor gene, CDKN2A. We observed increased intracellular concentrations of methylthioadenosine (MTA, the metabolite cleaved by MTAP) in cells harboring MTAP deletions. Furthermore, MTA specifically inhibited PRMT5 enzymatic activity. Administration of either MTA or a small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitor showed a modest preferential impairment of cell viability for MTAP-null cancer cell lines compared with isogenic MTAP-expressing counterparts. Together, our findings reveal PRMT5 as a potential vulnerability across multiple cancer lineages augmented by a common \"passenger\" genomic alteration. ",

The exposures were performed in spring and autumn, with identical study procedures. In each season, healthy Wistar rats were exposed to TRAP at for 4 h, 7 d, 14 d, or 28 d.

The DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between spring and autumn. When spring and autumn data were analyzed together, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 exposures were associated with changes in%5mC (95% CI) in LINE-1, iNOS, p16(CDKN2A), and APC ranging from -0.088 (-0.150, -0.026) to 0.102 (0.049, 0.154) per 1 μg/m(3) increase in the pollutant concentration. Prolonged exposure to a high level of TRAP was negatively associated with LINE-1 and iNOS methylation, and positively associated with APC methylations in the DNA from lung tissues but not blood.

For these particular tumours, its proposed role in tumour suppression is supported both by the observation of methylation-based silencing of DBCCR1 in a large fraction of bladder cancers and by re-expression studies in bladder cancer-derived cell lines. A more general involvement of DBCCR1 in tumour development might be inferred from recent chip-based expression studies in other tumours. The present study addressed expression of DBCCR1 in gliomas, specifically in astrocytomas, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on 25 tumours of different malignancy grade and on 5 control brain tissue samples. Genomic deletion of the DBCCR1 locus at 9q32-33 was also investigated, together with the CDKN2A locus at 9p21, by loss of heterozygosity analysis in a second series of 26 astrocytic tumours. We found that DBCCR1 mRNA expression is markedly reduced in the majority of tumour samples compared to controls, and that this reduction significantly correlates with tumour grade. Genomic loss of the DBCCR1 region was found in only 5 of 24 (21%) informative samples, with no obvious correlation to tumour grade, while loss of the CDKN2A locus was observed in 13 of 21 (62%) informative samples with high-grade tumours being affected more often. If present, LOH at 9q coincided with LOH at 9p and is then likely to reflect loss of the entire chromosome rather than a specific, potentially causative event. In contrast to the situation in bladder cancer, the prevalent inactivation of DBCCR1 seen at the expression level in astrocytomas is not primarily caused by genomic loss of the gene.

Therefore, mammary nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) may become a specific target for novel anti-breast cancer therapies. Toward this goal, we investigated the difference in the ACh receptor repertoires between normal and malignant BECs, determined effects of nicotinic ligands on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells, and characterized reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP (secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1)-1 on the expression of nAChR subunits and several oncogenes and tumor-suppressing genes in BECs. Both the non-malignant MCF10A and malignant MCF7 breast cells expressed α3, α5, α7, α9, α10, β1, β2, γ, δ and ε nAChR subunits and M(1), M(3), M(4) and M(5) muscarinic receptor subtypes. The malignancy was associated with expression of α1, α4 and β4 nAChR subunits and M(2) subtype. Malignant transformation of BECs was also associated with overexpression of α7-, and α9-made nAChRs. NNK upregulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, stimulated expression of the gene encoding the tumor-promoter HGF, downregulated expression of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, and induced tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells. Compared to the canonical nAChR antagonists, SLURP-1 showed the highest ability to abolish the nAChR-mediated effects of NNK in both cell-signaling and cell-transformation assays and reversed many effects of NNK on gene expression. SLURP-1 also markedly upregulated the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2B, RUNX3 and TP73. Altogether, the obtained results provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms of nAChR-mediated oncogenic effects of NNK on BECs and demonstrated the ability to abolish or reverse these effects by SLURP-1.",

Surveillance of high-risk groups, may facilitate detection of PDAC at an early stage. The aim of this study was to assess whether surveillance aids detection of early-stage PDAC or precursor lesions (PRLs) and improves the prognosis.;Screening outcomes were collected from three European centers that conduct prospective screening in high-risk groups including families with clustering of PDAC (familial pancreatic cancer [FPC]) or families with a gene defect that predisposes to PDAC. The surveillance program consisted of annual magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and/or endoscopic ultrasound.;Four hundred eleven asymptomatic individuals participated in the surveillance programs, including 178 CDKN2A mutation carriers, 214 individuals with FPC, and 19 BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutation carriers. PDAC was detected in 13 (7.3%) of 178 CDKN2A mutation carriers. The resection rate was 75%, and the 5-year survival rate was 24%. Two CDKN2A mutation carriers (1%) underwent surgical resection for low-risk PRL. Two individuals (0.9%) in the FPC cohort had a pancreatic tumor, including one advanced PDAC and one early grade 2 neuroendocrine tumor. Thirteen individuals with FPC (6.1%) underwent surgical resection for a suspected PRL, but only four (1.9%) had high-risk lesions (ie, high-grade intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or grade 3 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms). One BRCA2 mutation carrier was found to have PDAC, and another BRCA2 mutation carrier and a PALB2 mutation carrier underwent surgery and were found to have low-risk PRL. No serious complications occurred as consequence of the program.;Surveillance of CDNK2A mutation carriers is relatively successful, detecting most PDACs at a resectable stage. The benefit of surveillance in families with FPC is less evident.",

Therefore, detection of promoter hypermethylation is becoming important for diagnosis, prognosis, and aiding the design of cancer therapies. We describe a novel isothermal method for the detection of DNA hypermethylation.;Methylation-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MS-LAMP) is a novel adaptation of LAMP. MS-LAMP was used for the highly specific detection of hypermethylated CpGs in the promoters of the CDKN2A [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4)], GATA5 (GATA binding protein 5), and DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1) genes. The reactions occurred under isothermal conditions with 3 primer sets specific for methylated promoters. Both turbidimetry and fluorescence were used for detection. The MS-LAMP assay was validated with bisulfite-treated plasmid and genomic DNA controls of known methylation status and was applied to detect hypermethylation in 18 clinical tumor samples. A multiplex MS-LAMP for CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1 was also validated with the aid of synthetic positive and negative controls.;The MS-LAMP assay showed high specificity with plasmid and genomic DNA targets in reactions carried out in <1 h. The assay had a detection limit of approximately 30 copies of methylated target sequence and a selectivity of 0.5% methylated DNA in a mixture with unmethylated DNA. Compared with methylation-specific PCR, the MS-LAMP assay detected lower rates of methylation in lung adenocarcinoma samples. Simultaneous multiplex detection of hypermethylation in the 3 targets (CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1) was readily achieved with the MS-LAMP assay in both the turbidimetric and fluorescence detection formats.;MS-LAMP provides a highly specific isothermal method for methylation detection and is well suited for multiplex approaches.",

Herein, we investigate the clinicopathological and molecular features of ESOSA and explore potential parameters that may affect outcome. Thirty-two cases were retrieved and histomorphology was reviewed. Clinical history and follow-up were obtained through electronic record review. DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was extracted and processed from 27 cases. Genome-wide DNA copy number (CN) alterations and allelic imbalances were analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism array using Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Assay. Massive high-throughput deep parallel sequencing was performed using a customized panel targeting 410 cancer genes. Log rank, Fisher's exact test and Cox proportional hazards were used for statistical analysis. In this series of 32 patients (male n = 12, female n = 20), the average age was 66 years (19-93) and median follow up was 24 months (range 6-120 months). Frequent genomic alterations included CN losses in tumour suppressor genes including CDKN2A (70%), TP53 (56%) and RB1 (49%). Mutations affecting methylation/demethylation, chromatin remodeling and WNT/SHH pathways were identified in 40%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. PIK3CA and TERT promoter variant mutations were identified in 11% of the cases. Cases harbouring simultaneous TP53 and RB1 biallelic CN losses were associated with worse overall survival and local recurrence (p = 0.04, p = 0.02, respectively). CDKN2A losses and positive margins were also associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.002; p = 0.03, respectively). Our findings suggest that age above 60, positive margin status, simultaneous biallelic TP53 and RB1 losses and CDKN2A loss are associated with a worse outcome in ESOSA. Comparison between conventional paediatric osteosarcoma and ESOSA shows that, while both share genetic similarities, there are notable dissimilarities and mechanistic differences in the molecular pathways involved in ESOSA.

Most lung cancer is caused by the accumulation of genomic alterations due to tobacco exposure. To uncover its mutational landscape, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 31 NSCLCs and their matched normal tissue samples. We identified both common and unique mutation spectra and pathway activation in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, two major histologies in NSCLC. In addition to identifying previously known lung cancer genes (TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and RB1), the analysis revealed many genes not previously implicated in this malignancy. Notably, a novel gene CSMD3 was identified as the second most frequently mutated gene (next to TP53) in lung cancer. We further demonstrated that loss of CSMD3 results in increased proliferation of airway epithelial cells. The study provides unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular pathways and gene networks associated with lung cancer. Of potential immediate clinical relevance, several highly mutated genes identified in our study are promising druggable targets in cancer therapy including ALK, CTNNA3, DCC, MLL3, PCDHIIX, PIK3C2B, PIK3CG and ROCK2.",

We then used the presence of tumor methylation as a marker to investigate the presence of occult metastasis in corresponding histologically negative lymph nodes. Of the primary tumors, 73 of 90 (81%) displayed promoter hypermethylation in at least one of the genes studied: 17% (15 of 90) at p16 (CDKN2A); 16% (14 of 90) at O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase; 8% (7 of 90) at GSTP1; 72% (65 of 90) at APC; and 17% (15 of 90) at DAPK.

Genetic mutations, such as activation of the KRAS2 oncogene, inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene CDKN2A, inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 and deleted in pancreatic cancer 4 (DPC4) gene defects are seen in those with pancreatic cancer. Approximately 80% of those patients, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, are identified as having concomitant diabetes with a poor prognostic factor. Damaged pancreatic tissue, secondary to pancreatic cancer, leads to diabetes as islet cells and beta cells are taken over by malignancy. Additionally, those on certain anti-diabetic regimens are shown to be at a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer due to the effect of stimulation on the pancreatic beta and islet cells. Therefore, diabetes is thought to be both a potential cause and effect of pancreatic cancer. Diabetes has become a pandemic, and pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of malignancy known. In order to better understand these diseases and how they are associated, more research needs to be done.

This study was designed to determine at what stage, in the progression from BE to EAC, methylation of key genes occurs.;We examined nine genes (APC, CDKN2A, ID4, MGMT, RBP1, RUNX3, SFRP1, TIMP3, and TMEFF2), frequently methylated in multiple cancer types, in a panel of squamous (19 biopsies from patients without BE or EAC, 16 from patients with BE, 21 from patients with EAC), BE (40 metaplastic, seven high grade dysplastic) and 37 EAC tissues. The methylation frequency, the percentage of samples that had any extent of methylation, for each of the nine genes in the EAC (95%, 59%, 76%, 57%, 70%, 73%, 95%, 74% and 83% respectively) was significantly higher than in any of the squamous groups. The methylation frequency for each of the nine genes in the metaplastic BE (95%, 28%, 78%, 48%, 58%, 48%, 93%, 88% and 75% respectively) was significantly higher than in the squamous samples except for CDKN2A and RBP1. The methylation frequency did not differ between BE and EAC samples, except for CDKN2A and RUNX3 which were significantly higher in EAC. The methylation extent was an estimate of both the number of methylated alleles and the density of methylation on these alleles. This was significantly greater in EAC than in metaplastic BE for all genes except APC, MGMT and TIMP3. There was no significant difference in methylation extent for any gene between high grade dysplastic BE and EAC.;We found significant methylation in metaplastic BE, which for seven of the nine genes studied did not differ in frequency from that found in EAC. This is also the first report of gene silencing by methylation of ID4 in BE or EAC.

Cell-cycle progression is arrested at G1/S, mediated at least partially through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. In addition, agonist-induced apoptosis is mediated by PTEN, through the upregulation of proapoptotic machinery involving caspases and BID, and the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is apparently less central to its involvement in tumorigenesis. It is involved in the inhibition of focal adhesion formation, cell spreading and migration, as well as the inhibition of growth factor-stimulated MAPK signaling. Therefore, the combined effects of the loss of PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase activity may result in aberrant cell growth and escape from apoptosis, as well as abnormal cell spreading and migration. In melanoma, PTEN loss has been mostly observed as a late event, although a dose-dependent loss of PTEN protein and function has been implicated in early stages of tumorigenesis as well. In addition, loss of PTEN and oncogenic activation of RAS seem to occur in a reciprocal fashion, both of which could cooperate with CDKN2A loss in contribution to melanoma tumorigenesis.",

Familial PC (FPC) patients with a personal history or family history of melanomas are therefore offered CDKN2A-mutation analysis. In contrast, CDKN2A testing in FPC families without a history of melanomas is not generally recommended. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of CDKN2A-mutations in FPC families without melanomas.;Data were gathered from PC family registers. FPC families were defined as families with clustering of PC without meeting diagnostic criteria of familial cutaneous malignant melanoma (familial CMM) or other inherited cancer syndromes. Blood samples were obtained for DNA isolation from PC patients or first degree relatives and analysed for CDKN2A-mutations.;Among 40 FPC families, DNA analyses were carried out in 28 families (70%), leading to identification of CDKN2A-mutations in six families (21%). None of the CDKN2A-mutation-positive families fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for familial CMM and in three CDKN2A families no melanomas were observed. Two CDKN2A-mutations were found; the Dutch founder mutation p16-Leiden (c.225_243del, p.Ala76fs) and the c.19_23dup, p.Ser8fs-mutation. After disclosure of the CDKN2A-mutation in one of the families, a curable melanoma was diagnosed at dermatological surveillance in a 17-year-old family member.;CDKN2A-mutation can be found in a considerable proportion of families with FPC. CDKN2A-mutation analysis should therefore be included in genetic testing in FPC families, even in the absence of reported melanomas. This strategy will enhance the recognition of individuals at risk for PC and facilitate the early detection of melanomas.",

However, even for a specific rearrangement, the breakpoints may vary between individuals, such as the recurrent CDKN2A deletion. Characterizing the exact breakpoints for structural variants (SVs) is useful for designating patient-specific tumor biomarkers. We propose AmBre (Amplification of Breakpoints), a method to target SV breakpoints occurring in samples composed of heterogeneous tumor and germline DNA. Additionally, AmBre validates SVs called by whole-exome/genome sequencing and hybridization arrays. AmBre involves a PCR-based approach to amplify the DNA segment containing an SV's breakpoint and then confirms breakpoints using sequencing by Pacific Biosciences RS. To amplify breakpoints with PCR, primers tiling specified target regions are carefully selected with a simulated annealing algorithm to minimize off-target amplification and maximize efficiency at capturing all possible breakpoints within the target regions. To confirm correct amplification and obtain breakpoints, PCR amplicons are combined without barcoding and simultaneously long-read sequenced using a single SMRT cell. Our algorithm efficiently separates reads based on breakpoints. Each read group supporting the same breakpoint corresponds with an amplicon and a consensus amplicon sequence is called. AmBre was used to discover CDKN2A deletion breakpoints in cancer cell lines: A549, CEM, Detroit562, MOLT4, MCF7, and T98G. Also, we successfully assayed RUNX1-RUNX1T1 reciprocal translocations by finding both breakpoints in the Kasumi-1 cell line. AmBre successfully targets SVs where DNA harboring the breakpoints are present in 1:1000 mixtures. ",

Our goal was to study the association between key molecular alterations and outcome parameters. We evaluated the characteristics and outcomes (overall survival (OS), time to metastasis/recurrence, and best progression-free survival (PFS)) of 392 patients for whom next generation sequencing (182 or 236 genes) had been performed. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used for our analysis, and results were subjected to internal validation using a resampling method (bootstrap analysis). In a multivariable analysis (Cox regression model), the parameters that were statistically associated with a poorer overall survival were the presence of metastases at diagnosis (P = 0.014), gastrointestinal histology (P < 0.0001), PTEN (P < 0.0001), and CDKN2A alterations (P = 0.0001). The variables associated with a shorter time to metastases/recurrence were gastrointestinal histology (P = 0.004), APC (P = 0.008), PTEN (P = 0.026) and TP53 (P = 0.044) alterations. TP53 (P = 0.003) and PTEN (P = 0.034) alterations were independent predictors of a shorter best PFS. A personalized treatment approach (matching the molecular aberration with a cognate targeted drug) also correlated with a longer best PFS (P = 0.046). Our study demonstrated that, across diverse cancers, anomalies in specific tumor suppressor genes (PTEN, CDKN2A, APC, and/or TP53) were independently associated with a worse outcome, as reflected by time to metastases/recurrence, best PFS on treatment, and/or overall survival.

We therefore prospectively evaluated individuals with a p16-Leiden germline variant, participating in a pancreatic surveillance programme, for the occurrence of cancer (n=150). Tobacco use was assessed at the start of the surveillance programme. We found a significantly increased risk for melanoma (relative risk (RR) 41.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 22.9-74.6) and pancreatic cancer (RR 80.8; 95% CI 44.7-146).

Current smokers developed significantly more cancers of the lip, mouth and pharynx, respiratory system and pancreas compared with former and never-smokers.

Despite tremendous progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance, overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors remains an unmet medical need. Constitutive activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 as a result of genetic aberrations including CDKN2A inactivation and CCND1 amplification is common across many cancer types and frequently co-occurs with oncogenic BRAF mutations. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression is a common feature of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here we review CDK4/6 as a therapeutic target in BRAF mutant cancers and discuss emerging evidence supporting a critical role of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 axis in de novo and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Co-targeting CDK4/6 and BRAF could be a more effective therapy to augment clinical response of BRAF inhibitors and overcome resistance in BRAF mutant cancers. ",

In the present study, we investigated UHRF1 expression and function in GC proliferation and explored its downstream regulatory mechanism. The results demonstrated that UHRF1 overexpression was an independent and significant predictor of GC prognosis. Downregulation of UHRF1 suppressed GC proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo, and UHRF1 upregulation showed opposite effects. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 reactivated 7 TSGs, including CDX2, CDKN2A, RUNX3, FOXO4, PPARG, BRCA1 and PML, via promoter demethylation.

In this study, we applied quantitative profiling of DNA methylation states in a panel of cancer-associated genes to a case-control study of UADT cancers. Our analyses revealed a high frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of several genes, including MYOD1, CHRNA3 and MTHFR in UADT tumors, whereas CDKN2A was moderately hypermethylated. Among differentially methylated genes, we identified a new gene (the nicotinic acetycholine receptor gene) as target of aberrant hypermethylation in UADT cancers, suggesting that epigenetic deregulation of nicotinic acetycholine receptors in non-neuronal tissues may promote the development of UADT cancers. Importantly, we found that sex and age is strongly associated with the methylation states, whereas tobacco smoking and alcohol intake may also influence the methylation levels in specific genes.

Their data show that gastric cancer is not one disease but rather comprises four major classes: EBV-positive, microsatellite instability (MSI), genomically stable and chromosome instability. The EBV-positive class has even more marked CpG methylation than does the MSI class, and viral cancers have a unique pattern of methylation linked to the downregulation of CDKN2A (p16) but not MLH1. EBV-positive cancers often have mutated PIK3CA and ARID1A and an amplified 9p24.1 locus linked to overexpression of JAK2, CD274 (PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2). Multiple noncoding viral RNAs are highly expressed. Patients who fail standard therapy may qualify for enrollment in clinical trials targeting cancer-related human gene pathways or promoting destruction of infected cells through lytic induction of EBV genes. Genomic tests such as the GastroGenus Gastric Cancer Classifier are available to identify actionable variants in formalin-fixed cancer tissue of affected patients. ",

The Lynch syndrome is discussed as a clinical model wherein the presence of mismatch repair mutations provides a high level of diagnostic certainty for the initiation of targeted cancer screening and management. The familial atypical multiple mole melanoma-pancreatic cancer (FAMMM-PC) syndrome, on the other hand, provides another model with cancer-control potential. Given its phenotypic features of multiple atypical nevi, high total body mole count and cutaneous malignant melanoma, coupled with the integral association of PC in a subset of FAMMM kindreds with the CDKN2A germline mutation, this may result in a perhaps lower level of diagnostic certainty when compared with the Lynch syndrome. This knowledge may impact upon progress in the earlier diagnosis of melanoma and provide an impetus for creative diagnostic methods in PC, a disease that, at this time, demonstrates a mortality rate virtually identical to its incidence rate.",

Distinguishing significant consensus events (SCEs) from random background CNAs in a set of subjects has been proven to be a valuable tool to study cancer. In order to identify SCEs with an acceptable type I error rate, better computational approaches should be developed based on reasonable statistics and null distributions. In this article, we propose a new approach named TAGCNA for identifying SCEs in somatic CNAs that may encompass cancer driver genes. TAGCNA employs a peel-off permutation scheme to generate a reasonable null distribution based on a prior step of selecting tag CNA markers from the genome being considered. We demonstrate the statistical power of TAGCNA on simulated ground truth data, and validate its applicability using two publicly available cancer datasets: lung and prostate adenocarcinoma. TAGCNA identifies SCEs that are known to be involved with proto-oncogenes (e.g. EGFR, CDK4) and tumor suppressor genes (e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN2B), and provides many additional SCEs with potential biological relevance in these data. TAGCNA can be used to analyze the significance of CNAs in various cancers. It is implemented in R and is freely available at http://tagcna.sourceforge.net/.",

Despite the utility of current genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of lung cancer, most do not allow temporal dissociation of the cardinal events involved in lung tumor initiation and cancer progression. Here we describe a novel two-switch GEM model for BRAF(V600E)-induced lung carcinogenesis allowing temporal dissociation of these processes. In mice carrying a Flp recombinase-activated allele of Braf (Braf(FA)) in conjunction with Cre-regulated alleles of Trp53, Cdkn2a, or c-MYC, we demonstrate that secondary genetic events can promote bypass of the senescence-like proliferative arrest displayed by BRAF(V600E)-induced lung adenomas, leading to malignant progression. Moreover, restoring or activating TP53 in cultured BRAF(V600E)/TP53(Null) or BRAF(V600E)/INK4A-ARF(Null) lung cancer cells triggered a G1 cell-cycle arrest regardless of p19(ARF) status. Perhaps surprisingly, neither senescence nor apoptosis was observed upon TP53 restoration.

In contrast, advanced tumors have evaded senescence. Remarkably, we discovered that the majority of advanced medulloblastomas display either spontaneous, somatic p53 mutations or Cdkn2a locus inactivation. Consistent with senescence evasion, these p53 mutations are always subsequent to Ptch1 LOH.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the immunohistochemical expression of p16 (INK4a) in 40 oropharynx and 35 larynx from HNSCC patients treated in a single institution and followed-up at least for 10 years in order to explore potential associations with clinicopathological outcomes and prognostic implications.

Importantly, on the basis of negative p16 (INK4a) expression, it was possible to predict a probability of lower survival (P = 0.055) as well as tumors presenting lymph node metastasis (P = 0.050) and capsular rupture (P = 0.0010). Furthermore, increased risk of recurrence was observed in tumors presenting capsular rupture (P = 0.0083).

To identify prognostic genomic markers in high-grade UCB, we used capture-based massively parallel sequencing to analyze 109 tumors. Mutations were detected in 240 genes, with 23 genes mutated in ≥5% of cases. The presence of a recurrent phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation was associated with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35; p=0.014) and improved cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR: 0.35; p=0.040) in patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC). In multivariable analyses controlling for pT and pN stages, PIK3CA mutation remained associated with RFS (HR: 0.39; p=0.032). The most frequent alteration, TP53 mutation (57%), was more common in extravesical disease (69% vs 32%, p=0.005) and lymph node-positive disease (77% vs 56%, p=0.025).

Mutations in chromatin-modifying genes were highly prevalent but not associated with outcomes. In UCB patients treated with RC, PIK3CA mutations are associated with favorable outcomes, whereas TP53 and CDKN2A alterations are associated with poor outcomes. Genomic profiling may aid in the identification of UCB patients at highest risk following RC.;Using next-generation sequencing, we identified genomic subsets of high-grade urothelial bladder cancer associated with favorable and unfavorable outcomes.

Conventional 2-year rodent cancer studies of aspartame are considered negative, although a small number of neoplasms of the brain were observed in a rat study (Fed. Regist., 1981a,b). The NTP has explored the use of genetically altered mouse models as adjuncts to the 2-year rodent cancer assay. These models may prove to be more rapid, use fewer animals, and provide some mechanistic insights into neoplastic responses. As part of the evaluation of new mouse cancer screening models, aspartame was tested for potential toxicity and carcinogenicity in two relatively well-studied models, the Tg.AC hemizygous strain and the p53 haploinsufficient strain, and an uncharacterized model, the Cdkn2a deficient strain. Male and female Tg.AC hemizygous, p53 haploinsufficient, and Cdkn2a deficient mice were given feed containing aspartame (greater than 98% pure) for 9 months. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, rat bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 9-MONTH STUDY IN Tg.AC HEMIZYGOUS MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female Tg.AC hemizygous mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 490, 980, 1,960, 3,960, or 7,660 mg aspartame/kg body weight to males and 550, 1,100, 2,260, 4,420, or 8,180 mg/kg to females) for 40 weeks. Exposure to aspartame had no effect on survival. The mean body weights of 50,000 ppm females were greater than those of the controls from week 15 until the end of the study. Feed consumption by the exposed groups was similar to that by the control groups throughout the study. There were no neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions that were attributed to exposure to aspartame. 9-MONTH STUDY IN p53 HAPLOINSUFFICIENT MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female p53 haploinsufficient mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 490, 970, 1,860, 3,800, or 7,280 mg/kg to males and 630, 1,210, 2,490, 5,020, or 9,620 mg/kg to females) for 40 weeks. Exposure to aspartame had no effect on survival or mean body weights. Feed consumption by the exposed groups was similar to that by the control groups throughout the study. No neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions were attributed to exposure to aspartame. 9-MONTH STUDY IN Cdkn2a DEFICIENT MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female Cdkn2a deficient mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame for 40 weeks (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately of approximately 490, 960, 1,900, 3,700, and 7,400 mg/kg to males and 610, 1,200, 2,390, 4,850, and 9,560 mg/kg to females). Survival of all exposed groups was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 3,125 and 6,250 ppm males were less than those of the controls after weeks 29 and 16, respectively. Mean body weights of female mice were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. The incidences of minimal to mild cytoplasmic vacuolization of periportal hepatocytes were significantly greater than controls in males exposed to 6,250, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame.;Aspartame was tested for induction of gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium. No mutagenicity was detected in strains TA98, TA100, or TA1535 with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). In addition, a single test in TA1537 with 30% rat liver S9 gave negative results. In TA97 with 30% rat liver S9, however, a reproducible small increase in mutant colonies was observed, and this response was judged to be equivocal. No mutagenicity was detected in TA97 without S9 or with hamster liver S9. An acute bone marrow micronucleus test was conducted with aspartame administered by gavage to male F344/N rats. No increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed at any dose level. Peripheral blood micronucleus tests were conducted after 9 months exposure of Tg.AC hemizygous, p53 haploinsufficient, and Cdkn2a deficient mice to aspartame in dosed feed. Negative results were obtained in male and female Tg.AC hemizygous and Cdkn2a deficient mice. Negative results were also obtained with male p53 haploinsufficient mice. In female p53 haploinsufficient mice, the results of the micronucleus test were judged to be positive, based on a significant trend test and a small but statistically significant increased frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in the 50,000 ppm group.;Under the conditions of this 9-month feed study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of aspartame in male or female p53 haploinsufficient mice exposed to 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm.

To address these issues, we analyzed 43 bladder tumor genomes from 22 patients using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and tissue expression of multiple DDR proteins, including Timeless and its interaction partner Tipin. The SNP profiles confirmed and extended known copy number alterations (CNAs) at high resolution, showed clustering of CNAs at nine common fragile sites, and revealed that most metachronous tumors were clonally related. The occurrence of many novel uniparental disomy regions (UPDs) was of potential functional importance in some tumors because UPDs spanned mutated FGFR3 and PIK3CA alleles, and also homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus. The DDR signaling as evaluated by phospho-epitope-specific antibodies against Ser139-phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γH2AX), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) was commonly activated in tumors with both moderate and high extent of accumulated genomic aberrations, the latter tumors showing a more frequent loss of ATM expression. Strikingly, the tumor genomes exhibiting the most complex alterations were associated with a high Ki67-proliferation index, abundant Timeless but not Tipin expression, aberrant p53 expression, and homozygous CDKN2A deletions. Of clinical relevance, evaluation of a tissue microarray (TMA; n=319) showed that abundant Timeless expression was associated with risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease (P<0.0005; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.8) and higher T stage (P<0.05). Univariate analysis confirmed this association (P=0.006) in an independent cohort (n=241) but statistical significance was not reached in a multivariate model. Overall, our results are consistent with DDR activation preceding the accumulation of genomic aberrations. Tumors with extensive genomic rearrangements were associated with inactivation of CDKN2A, excessive proliferation, and robust Timeless expression, the latter also correlating with the risk of disease progression. Moreover, we provide evidence to suggest that UPDs likely contribute to bladder tumorigenesis. ",

We assessed genome-wide DNA copy number and mutation of key tumor suppressor genes in T-cell lymphomas arising after weekly irradiation of female B6C3F1 mice with 1.2Gy X-rays for 4 consecutive weeks starting during infancy (1 week old), adolescence (4 weeks old) or as young adults (8 weeks old). Although T-cell lymphoma incidence was similar, loss of heterozygosity at Cdkn2a on chromosome 4 and at Ikaros on chromosome 11 was more frequent in the two older groups, while loss at the Pten locus on chromosome 19 was more frequent in the infant-irradiated group. Cdkn2a and Ikaros mutation/loss was a common feature of the young adult-irradiation group, with Ikaros frequently (50%) incurring multiple independent hits (including deletions and mutations) or suffering a single hit predicted to result in a dominant negative protein (such as those lacking exon 4, an isoform we have designated Ik12, which lacks two DNA binding zinc-finger domains). Conversely, Pten mutations were more frequent after early irradiation (60%) than after young adult-irradiation (30%). Homozygous Pten mutations occurred without DNA copy number change after irradiation starting in infancy, suggesting duplication of the mutated allele by chromosome mis-segregation or mitotic recombination. Our findings demonstrate that while deletions on chromosomes 4 and 11 affecting Cdkn2a and Ikaros are a prominent feature of young adult irradiation-induced T-cell lymphoma, tumors arising after irradiation from infancy suffer a second hit in Pten by mis-segregation or recombination. This is the first report showing an influence of age-at-exposure on genomic alterations of tumor suppressor genes and their relative involvement in radiation-induced T-cell lymphoma. These data are important for considering the risks associated with childhood exposure to radiation. ",

Using real-time methylation-specific PCR, we assessed the extent of hypermethylation at 16 CpG islands in DNA from seven prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, LAPC-4, CWR22Rv1, VCaP, and C42B), normal prostate epithelial cells, normal prostate stromal cells, 73 primary prostate cancers, 91 metastatic prostate cancers, and 25 noncancerous prostate tissues. We found that CpG islands at GSTP1, APC, RASSF1a, PTGS2, and MDR1 were hypermethylated in >85% of prostate cancers and cancer cell lines but not in normal prostate cells and tissues; CpG islands at EDNRB, ESR1, CDKN2a, and hMLH1 exhibited low to moderate rates of hypermethylation in prostate cancer tissues and cancer cell lines but were entirely unmethylated in normal tissues; and CpG islands at DAPK1, TIMP3, MGMT, CDKN2b, p14/ARF, and CDH1 were not abnormally hypermethylated in prostate cancers. Receiver operator characteristic curve analyses suggested that CpG island hypermethylation changes at GSTP1, APC, RASSF1a, PTGS2, and MDR1 in various combinations can distinguish primary prostate cancer from benign prostate tissues with sensitivities of 97.3-100% and specificities of 92-100%. Hypermethylation of the CpG island at EDNRB was correlated with the grade and stage of the primary prostate cancers. PTGS2 CpG island hypermethylation portended an increased risk of recurrence. Furthermore, CpG island hypermethylation patterns in prostate cancer metastases were very similar to the primary prostate cancers and tended to show greater differences between cases than between anatomical sites of metastasis.",

It has been highlighted that the cancer risk is linked to both environmental and genetic factors. Available studies allow to estimate that genetic factors play a role in 5-10% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Beside other carcinomas, pancreatic cancer occurs in hereditary neoplastic syndromes associated with gene mutations, including CDKN2A, CHEK2, BRCA2. It has also been suggested that BRCA1 mutation is involved given the fact that BRCA1 mutation carriers are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. However, a role of this mutation is not fully understood.;The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between BRCA1 gene mutation and pancreatic cancer in Polish population.;88 pancreatic cancer patients (56 males and 35 females) and 3784 carriers of BRCA1 mutation from 1637 families were enrolled in the study. Almost 65% of pancreatic cancer patients were cigarette smokers. Genotyping for constitutive BRCA1 gene mutation was performed in all patients with pancreatic cancer. ASA-PCR and PCR-RFLP methods were used to detect BRCA1 (5382insC, C61G, 4153delA) mutations. The frequency of pancreatic cancer in families of BRCA1 mutation carriers was evaluated.;No carriers of BRCA1 mutation were identified in patients with pancreatic cancer. Only in 11 families (0.7%) with BRCA1 mutation carriers, pancreatic cancer was diagnosed.;Our results suggest that there is no relationship between BRCA1 mutation and pancreatic cancer development in Polish population.",

We developed the computer program CGMIM to search for entries in OMIM that are related to one or more cancer types. We performed manual searches of OMIM to verify the program results.;In the OMIM database on September 30, 2004, CGMIM identified 1943 genes related to cancer. BRCA2 (OMIM *164757), BRAF (OMIM *164757) and CDKN2A (OMIM *600160) were each related to 14 types of cancer. There were 45 genes related to cancer of the esophagus, 121 genes related to cancer of the stomach, and 21 genes related to both. Analysis of CGMIM results indicate that fewer than three gene entries in OMIM should mention both, and the more than seven-fold discrepancy suggests cancers of the esophagus and stomach are more genetically related than current literature suggests.;CGMIM identifies genetically-related cancers and cancer-related genes. In several ways, cancers with shared genetic etiology are anticipated to lead to further etiologic hypotheses and advances regarding environmental agents.

However, the relationship of p16 with prognostic and clinicopathological parameters in patients with bladder cancer remains unclear. Data inclusion criteria were articles reporting on the relationship between p16 expression and the prognosis or clinicopathology in patients with bladder cancer. Meta-analyses were performed with Stata software. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate the relative risks. The source of heterogeneity was analyzed by subgroup analysis. A total of 37 studies with 2246 cases were included and analyzed. The results identified an important link between downregulated p16 expression and poor prognosis in patients with bladder cancer in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and some clinicopathological parameters including clinical staging, pathological degree, and lymph node metastasis. Subgroup analysis also showed that low p16 expression could function as a warning sign for RFS and PFS in patients with early-stage (Ta-T1) bladder cancer. In conclusion, p16 might play an essential role in the deterioration of bladder cancer and could serve as a biomarker for the prediction for patients' progression and prognosis. ",

Understanding the mechanisms driving the subtypes may be key in development of novel therapeutics but is challenged by lineage-specific expression signals. Using a t-test statistics approach, we compared gene expression subtypes across 12 tumor types, which identified eight transcriptional superclusters characterized by commonly activated disease pathways and similarities in gene expression. One of the largest superclusters was determined by the upregulation of a proliferation signature, significant enrichment in TP53 mutations, genomic loss of CDKN2A (p16(ARF)), evidence of increased numbers of DNA double strand breaks and high expression of cyclin B1 protein. These correlations suggested that abrogation of the P53-mediated apoptosis response to DNA damage results in activation of cell cycle pathways and represents a common theme in cancer. A second consistent pattern, observed in 9 of 11 solid tumor types, was a subtype related to an activated tumor-associated stroma. The similarity in transcriptional footprints across cancers suggested that tumor subtypes are commonly unified by a limited number of molecular themes. ",

We show here that Kaiso represses methylated tumor suppressor genes and can bind in a methylation-dependent manner to the CDKN2A in human colon cancer cell lines. The contribution of Kaiso to epigenetic silencing was underlined by the fact that Kaiso depletion induced tumor suppressor gene expression without affecting DNA methylation levels. As a consequence, colon cancer cells became susceptible to cell cycle arrest and cell death mediated by chemotherapy. The data suggest that Kaiso is a methylation-dependent \"opportunistic\" oncogene that silences tumor suppressor genes when they become hypermethylated. Because Kaiso inactivation sensitized colon cancer cell lines to chemotherapy, it is possible that therapeutic targeting of Kaiso could improve the efficacy of current treatment regimens.",

We have previously shown that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) and that this is mediated independently of CDKN2A repression. In this study, we have discovered that high levels of BMI-1 confer resistance to contact inhibition in ESFT cells. Using stable retroviral transduction, we evaluated the consequences of BMI-1 knockdown on the growth of CDKN2A wild-type and mutant ESFT cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions. Although knockdown of BMI-1 had no effect on proliferation in low-density cultures, at high cell densities it resulted in cell cycle arrest and death. The normal cell contact inhibition response is mediated, in large part, by the recently described Hippo pathway which functions to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death by inactivating the Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). Significantly, we found that YAP levels, activity and expression did not diminish in confluent ESFT cells that expressed high levels of BMI-1. In contrast, YAP expression and nuclear localization were reduced in confluent BMI-1 knockdown cells suggesting that silencing of BMI-1 restored contact inhibition by restoring normal activation of the Hippo-YAP growth-suppressor pathway. Importantly, knockdown of YAP in ESFT cells resulted in profound inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation suggesting that stabilization and continued expression of YAP is critical for ESFT growth and tumorigenicity. Together, these studies reveal a previously unrecognized link between BMI-1, contact inhibition and the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggest that resistance to contact inhibition in BMI-1 overexpressing cancer cells may be in part a result of Hippo inhibition and aberrant stabilization of YAP.",

Therefore, GTF2I mutation correlated with better survival. GTF2I β and δ isoforms were expressed in TETs, and both mutant isoforms were able to stimulate cell proliferation in vitro. Thymic carcinomas carried a higher number of mutations than thymomas (average of 43.5 and 18.4, respectively). Notably, we identified recurrent mutations of known cancer genes, including TP53, CYLD, CDKN2A, BAP1 and PBRM1, in thymic carcinomas. These findings will complement the diagnostic assessment of these tumors and also facilitate development of a molecular classification and assessment of prognosis and treatment strategies. ",

Integrative analysis of functional genomics data was applied to determine the role of C9orf14 in CMM development. An analysis of genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in melanoma tumors revealed the loss of the C9orf14 locus, located proximal to CDKN2A, in approximately one-fourth of tumors. Analysis of gene expression data in cancer cell lines and melanoma tumors suggests a loss of C9orf14 expression in melanoma tumorigenesis.

Chromatin remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF complex are involved in making DNA accessible to transcription factors and thereby are implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations and altered expression of chromatin remodeling complex genes have been described in cancer cells. Indeed, non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have been shown to harbor mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a member of the SWI/SNF complex, but evidence has been less clear in primary tumors. Recently, inactivating mutations in AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) were found in liver cancer related to HCV infection and in melanoma. Here, we explored, using a genome-wide strategy and subsequent sequencing of targeted genes, whether chromatin remodeling is implicated in primary lung adenocarcinoma. Two genes were individualized from the genome screening as homozygously deleted in a set of samples: JARID2 and ARID2. Subsequent analysis of the entire coding sequences showed that ARID2 loss-of-function mutations were found in 5% of nonsmall cell lung cancers, thereby constituting one of the most frequently mutated genes in this cancer type after TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and STK11.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancers that develop after middle age usually exhibit genomic instability and multiple mutations. This is in direct contrast to pediatric tumors that usually develop as a result of specific chromosomal translocations and epigenetic aberrations. The development of genomic instability is associated with mutations that contribute to cellular immortalization and transformation. Cancer occurs when cancer-initiating cells (CICs), also called cancer stem cells, develop as a result of these mutations. In this paper, we explore how CICs develop as a result of genomic instability, including looking at which cancer suppression mechanisms are abrogated. A recent in vitro study revealed the existence of a CIC induction pathway in differentiating stem cells. Under aberrant differentiation conditions, cells become senescent and develop genomic instabilities that lead to the development of CICs. The resulting CICs contain a mutation in the alternative reading frame of CDKN2A (ARF)/p53 module, i.e., in either ARF or p53. We summarize recently established knowledge of CIC development and cellular immortality, explore the role of the ARF/p53 module in protecting cells from transformation, and describe a risk factor for genomic destabilization that increases during the process of normal cell growth and differentiation and is associated with the downregulation of histone H2AX to levels representative of growth arrest in normal cells.

The aim of this study was to examine loss of MCC expression due to promoter hypermethylation and its clinicopathologic significance in colorectal cancer. Correspondence of MCC methylation with gene silencing was demonstrated using bisulfite sequencing, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. MCC methylation was detected in 45-52% of 187 primary colorectal cancers. There was a striking association with CDKN2A methylation (P<0.0001), the CpG island methylator phenotype (P<0.0001) and the BRAF V600E mutation (P<0.0001). MCC methylation was also more common (P=0.0084) in serrated polyps than in adenomas. In contrast, there was no association with APC methylation or KRAS mutations. This study demonstrates for the first time that MCC methylation is a frequent change during colorectal carcinogenesis. Furthermore, MCC methylation is significantly associated with a distinct spectrum of precursor lesions, which are suggested to give rise to cancers via the serrated neoplasia pathway.",

Recent studies have shown that astrocytoma formation is the result of the deregulation of several pathways, including the RB/E2F pathway, which is commonly deregulated in various human cancers via genetic or epigenetic mechanisms. On the basis of the assumption that the study of the mechanisms controlling the INK4/ARF locus can help elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of astrocytic tumors, identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, and help select appropriate clinical treatments, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare methylation patterns using bisulfite sequencing PCR and evaluate the gene expression profile using real-time PCR in the genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDC6, Bmi-1, CCND1, and RB1 in astrocytic tumors. Our results indicate that all the evaluated genes are not methylated independent of the tumor grade. However, the real-time PCR results indicate that these genes undergo progressive deregulation as a function of the tumor grade. In addition, the genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and RB1 were underexpressed, whereas CDC6, Bmi-1, and CCND1 were overexpressed; the increase in gene expression was significantly associated with decreased patient survival. Therefore, we propose that the evaluation of the expression levels of the genes involved in the RB/E2F pathway can be used in the monitoring of patients with astrocytomas in clinical practice and for the prognostic indication of disease progression.

Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization. Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role. Furthermore, Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates Kras(G12D) activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a Kras(G12D)-cooperating oncogene required for Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.",

Together, these cancers represent over 1.5 million cases and are the cause of about 1.25 million deaths annually. This group of cancers encompasses diseases with marked disparities in etiology, geographic distribution, histopathological features and frequency. Based on histological origin, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC), which arises through a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence within the squamous mucosa, is a completely different cancer than junction, stomach and duodenal cancers, which develop within glandular epithelia through cascades involving inflammation, metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma. At the frontline between these two histological domains, cancers of the esophago-gastric junction constitute a mixed group of glandular tumors including distal esophageal adenocarcinomas and cancers arising within the most proximal part of the stomach - the cardia. Most of UGIT cancers are sporadic, although familial susceptibility genes have been identified for stomach and rare cases of ESCC. We have used the COSMIC database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) to identify genes commonly mutated in UGIT cancers. Regardless of etiology and histopathology, three genes are mutated in at least 5% of UGIT cancers: TP53, CDKN2a and PIK3CA. Another three genes, NFE2L2, PTCH1 and NOTCH1, are mutated in ESCC only. Conversely, genes of the RAS family and of the CDH1/APC/CTNNB1 pathway are mutated only in non-squamous cancers, with differences in mutated genes according to topography.

In FM, a single inherited \"hit\" occurs in every somatic cell, enabling interrogation of cultured normal skin fibroblasts (SFs) from FM gene carriers as surrogates for the cell of tumor origin, namely the melanocyte. We compared the gene expression profile of SFs from FM individuals with two distinct CDKN2A/p16 mutations (V126D-p16 and R87P-p16) with the gene expression profile of SFs from age-matched individuals without p16 mutations and with no family history of melanoma. We show an altered transcriptome signature in normal SFs bearing a single-hit inherited mutation in the CDKN2A/p16 gene, wherein some of these abnormal alterations recapitulate changes observed in the corresponding cancer. Significantly, the extent of the alterations is mutation-site specific with the R87P-p16 mutation being more disruptive than the V126D-p16 mutation. We also examined changes in gene expression after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to define potential early biomarkers triggered by sun exposure. UV treatment of SFs from FM families induces distinct alterations in genes related to cell cycle regulation and DNA damage responses that are also reported to be dysregulated in melanoma. Importantly, these changes were diametrically opposed to UV-induced changes in SF from normal controls. We posit that changes identified in the transcriptome of SF from FM mutation carriers represent early events critical for melanoma development. As such, they may serve as specific biomarkers of increased risk as well as molecular targets for personalized prevention strategies in high-risk populations.",

Wilms' tumour is the most common childhood kidney tumour, but relatively little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. Thus TSGs such as WT1, p16(CDKN2a) and p53 are inactivated in only a minority of cases. In view of the involvement of RASSF1A in adult renal cancers we investigated RASSF1A as a candidate Wilms' TSG.

In contrast to RASSF1A, only a minority (10.3%) of Wilms' tumours demonstrated p16 promoter methylation.

There was no correlation between RASSF1A and p16 methylation in colorectal cancer.

In this study, we compared 14 SCLC cell lines against 27 NSCLC cell lines using an integrated array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression profiling approach to identify subtype-specific disruptions. Using stringent criteria, we have identified 159 of the genes that are responsible for the different biology of these cell types. Sorting of these genes by their biological functions revealed the differential disruption of key components involved in cell cycle pathways. Our novel comparative combined genome and transcriptome analysis not only identified differentially altered genes, but also revealed that certain shared pathways are preferentially disrupted at different steps in these cell types. Small cell lung cancer exhibited increased expression of MRP5, activation of Wnt pathway inhibitors, and upregulation of p38 MAPK activating genes, while NSCLC showed downregulation of CDKN2A, and upregulation of MAPK9 and EGFR. This information suggests that cell cycle upregulation in SCLC and NSCLC occurs through drastically different mechanisms, highlighting the need for differential molecular target selection in the treatment of these cancers.",

Because amplicon of the classic MethyLight procedure only partially overlapped with the MSP amplicon, we further designed a 115-bp novel MethyLight assay in which the amplicon on the sense-strand fully overlapped with the MSP amplicon on the antisense-strand. Using the 115-bp MethyLight assay, we observed methylated-p16 in 26 of 44 MSP-positive samples and 2 of 58 MSP-negative ones (P = 0.000). These results were confirmed with clone sequencing. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using the 115-bp MethyLight assay were 59.1%, 98.3%, and 57.4%, respectively. Significant differences in the oral cancer rate were observed during the followup between patients (≥60 years) with and without methylated-p16 as detected by the 115-bp MethyLight assay (6/8 vs. 6/22, P = 0.034, two-sided).;The 115-bp MethyLight assay is a useful and practical assay with very high specificity for the detection of p16 methylation clinically.",

These variants were analyzed as an exploratory research study to determine whether pathogenic variants exist within the germline of patients undergoing tumor-germline sequencing. Patients were unselected with respect to indicators of hereditary cancer predisposition.;Variants indicative of hereditary cancer predisposition were identified in 19 (4.3%) patients. For about half (10/19), these findings represent new diagnostic information with potentially important implications for the patient and their family. The others were previously identified through clinical genetic evaluation secondary to suspicion of a hereditary cancer predisposition. Genes with pathogenic variants included ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, and CHEK2 In contrast, a substantial proportion of patients (178, 40.5%) had Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), 24 of which had VUS in genes pertinent to the presenting cancer.

Novel chemotherapeutic strategies exploiting the selective loss of MTAP function in cancers have been proposed. The MTAP gene, on chromosome 9p21, is frequently included within homozygous deletions of the p16INK4A/ CDKN2A gene. Biallelic deletions of the p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene are found in 40% of pancreatic cancers, suggesting that the MTAP gene may be frequently inactivated in pancreatic cancer and that selected patients with pancreatic cancer may benefit from therapies targeting this loss. We immunolabeled six xenografted pancreatic cancers with known MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A gene status and found that immunolabeling mirrored gene status. Loss of expression of both MTAP and p16 was observed only in those pancreatic cancers with homozygous deletions that encompassed both the MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A genes. We then immunolabeled a series of 320 microarrayed infiltrating pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 35 biliary adenocarcinomas, 54 ampullary cancers, and 35 noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Immunolabeling for MTAP was lost in 91 of the 300 (30%) evaluable pancreatic cancers, 9 of 54 (17%) ampullary cancers, 4 of 33 (12%) biliary cancers, and in 1 of 35 (3%) IPMNs. All neoplasms with loss of MTAP labeling also demonstrated loss of p16 labeling. These results suggest that MTAP expression is lost in approximately 30% of infiltrating pancreatic cancers and in a lower percentage of other periampullary neoplasms, that this loss is the result of homozygous deletions encompassing both the MTAP and p16INK4A/CDKN2A genes. Thus, pancreatic cancer is a promising cancer type in which to explore novel chemotherapeutic strategies to exploit the selective loss of MTAP function.",

Three days of treatment of ACs at 0.5, 5, and 25 μg/ml suppressed activity and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116, Caco2 and SW480 cells. Promoters of CDKN2A, and SFRP2, SFRP5, and WIF1, upstream of Wnt pathway, were demethylated by ACs. mRNA expression of some of these genes was increased. mRNA expression of β-catenin and c-Myc, downstream of Wnt pathway, and cell proliferation were decreased; apoptosis was increased. ACs were taken up into HCT116 cells and were differentially localized with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the same cells visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Although it was reported that DNMT3B is regulated by c-Myc in mouse lymphoma, DNMT3B did not bind with c-Myc in HCT116 cells.

Although this frequency is not significantly higher than that in unselected Caucasian controls, we observed multiple cancer types in the melanoma families, suggesting that some germline POLE mutations may predispose to a broad spectrum of cancers, including melanoma.

Under the hypothesis that additional genes may play a role in drug sensitivity, a predictive model for lapatinib response was constructed from genome-wide DNA copy number data from 24 cancer cell lines. An optimal predictive model which consists of aberrations at nine distinct genetic loci, includes gains of HER2, EGFR, and loss of CDKN2A. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of approximately 0.85 (80% confidence interval, 0.70-0.98; P < 0.01), and correctly classified the sensitivity status of 8 of 10 head and neck cancer cell lines.

Currently, prevention or early diagnosis at a curable stage is exceedingly difficult; patients rarely exhibit symptoms and tumours do not display sensitive and specific markers to aid detection. Pancreatic cancers also have few prevalent genetic mutations; the most commonly mutated genes are KRAS, CDKN2A (encoding p16), TP53 and SMAD4 - none of which are currently druggable. Indeed, therapeutic options are limited and progress in drug development is impeded because most pancreatic cancers are complex at the genomic, epigenetic and metabolic levels, with multiple activated pathways and crosstalk evident. Furthermore, the multilayered interplay between neoplastic and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment challenges medical treatment. Fewer than 20% of patients have surgically resectable disease; however, neoadjuvant therapies might shift tumours towards resectability. Although newer drug combinations and multimodal regimens in this setting, as well as the adjuvant setting, appreciably extend survival, ∼80% of patients will relapse after surgery and ultimately die of their disease. Thus, consideration of quality of life and overall survival is important. In this Primer, we summarize the current understanding of the salient pathophysiological, molecular, translational and clinical aspects of this disease.

To determine CIMP status, we quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1] by real-time polymerase chain reaction (MethyLight). PIK3CA mutation was significantly associated with mucinous tumors [P = .0002; odds ratio (OR) = 2.44], KRAS mutation (P < .0001; OR = 2.68), CIMP-high (P = .03; OR = 2.08), phospho-ribosomal protein S6 expression (P = .002; OR = 2.19), and FASN expression (P = .02; OR = 1.85) and inversely with p53 expression (P = .01; OR = 0.54) and beta-catenin (CTNNB1) alteration (P = .004; OR = 0.43). In addition, PIK3CA G-to-A mutations were associated with MGMT loss (P = .001; OR = 3.24) but not with MGMT promoter methylation. In conclusion, PIK3CA mutation is significantly associated with other key molecular events in colorectal cancer, and MGMT loss likely contributes to the development of PIK3CA G>A mutation. In addition, Pyrosequencing is useful in detecting PIK3CA mutation in archival paraffin tumor tissue. PIK3CA mutational data further emphasize heterogeneity of colorectal cancer at the molecular level.",

To evaluate if current hairdressers have elevated risks of adverse health effects, we measured several biomarkers related to cancer-related DNA alterations. We enrolled 295 hairdressers and 92 non-hairdressers (all female non-smokers) from Stockholm and southern Sweden. Questionnaire data were collected for each participant, including work tasks for the hairdressers. We measured telomere length in peripheral blood leucocytes using quantitative PCR and DNA methylation status of genes relevant for bladder cancer using methylation sensitive high resolution melting analysis. The hairdressers had shorter telomeres (β = -0.069, P = 0.019) compared with non-hairdressers. Shorter telomeres were found in hairdressers up to 32 years old performing hair waving more than once per week as compared with hairdressers in the same age group performing hair waving less often (β = -0.12, P = 0.037). Hair waving was associated with less frequent CDKN2A methylation (odds ratio, OR = 0.19, P = 0.033). Shorter telomeres in hairdressers may indicate a genotoxic effect. Performing hair waving was associated with short telomere length, although the effect was only observed in young hairdressers. No clear patterns were discerned with regard to DNA methylation of bladder cancer-related genes. The observed changes of methylation were not all in the expected direction and warrant further investigation.",

Copy number aberrations in stomach cells of H pylori-infected mice and gastric tissues (normal and tumor) from H pylori-positive patients were also analyzed.;In human gastric cells, aberrant AID activity induced copy number changes at various chromosomal loci. In AID-expressing cells and gastric mucosa of AID transgenic mice, point mutations and reductions in copy number were observed frequently in the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Oral infection of wild-type mice with H pylori reduced the copy number of the Cdkn2b-Cdkn2a locus, whereas no such changes were observed in the gastric mucosa of H pylori-infected AID-deficient mice. In human samples, the relative copy numbers of CDKN2A and CDKN2B were reduced in a subset of gastric cancer tissues compared with the surrounding noncancerous region.;H pylori infection leads to aberrant expression of AID and might be a mechanism of the accumulation of submicroscopic deletions and somatic mutations in gastric epithelial cells.

However, introducing new morphological criteria such as intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) might facilitate colorectal polyp diagnoses. Additionally, the phenotype-genotype correlation needs to be updated as the terminology has repeatedly changed. This study analysed 516 polyps, consisting of 118 classical adenomas (CAD), 116 hyperplastic polyps (HPP), 179 SSAs, 41 SSA-Ds, and 62 TSAs. The lesions were analysed in relation to the patients' clinical parameters including gender, age, localisation, and size. The inflammatory background of the polyps was quantified and BRAF and KRAS mutations as well as MLH1 and CDKN2A promoter methylation were assessed. In multivariate analyses, an increase in IELs was an independent and robust new criterion for the diagnosis of SSA-D (p < 0.001). Superficial erosions and acute neutrophil granulocytes led to reactive changes potentially resembling dysplasia. KRAS and BRAF mutations were associated with CAD/TSA and HPP/SSA, respectively. However, almost half of TSAs had a BRAF mutation and were KRAS wild type. CDKN2A seems to precede MLH1 hyper-methylation within the serrated carcinogenesis model. The genotyping of WHO-based entities - and especially SSA - has sharpened in comparison to previously published data. TSAs can be sub-grouped according to their mutation status. Of note, the higher number of IELs in SSA-D reflects their close relationship to colorectal cancers with micro-satellite instability. Therefore, IELs might represent a new diagnostic tool for SSA-D.

Our objective was to analyze the methylation pattern of some of the genes involved in carcinogenesis of the gallbladder, examining the immunohistochemical expression of proteins, clinical features, and patient survival time.;Twenty cases of gallbladder cancer were selected from the frozen tumor bank. The DNA extracted was analyzed by means of a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction test for the CDKN2A (p16), MLH1, APC, FHIT, and CDH1 (E-cadherin) genes. Morphological and clinical data and follow-up information were obtained.;All cases were in an advanced stage: histologically moderate or poorly differentiated tumors (95%). Methylation of the promoter area of genes was observed in 5%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 65% of cases, and an altered immunohistochemical pattern (AIP) in 5%, 35%, 21%, 25%, and 66% for the MLH1, CDKN2A, FHIT, APC, and CDH1 genes, respectively. The Kappa concordance index between methylation of the promoter area and AIP for the MLH1 and CDH1 genes was very high (K > 0.75) and substantial for APC (K > 0.45). No correlation was found between survival time and the methylation of the genes studied.;The high frequency of gene methylation (with the exception of MLH1) and the high agreement between AIP and methylation of the gene promoter area for the MLH1, APC, and CDH1 genes suggest that the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and of the genes related to the control of cellular proliferation through this mechanism is involved in gallbladder carcinogenesis.",

This study analyzed the presence and genotype of high risk HPVs, viral DNA load and transcription of the E6/E7 mRNAs, in 231 consecutive HNSCC. Twelve out of 30 HPV16 DNA-positive tumors displayed high E6/E7 mRNAs levels and were localized in the oropharyngeal region. While HPV-free and non-transcriptionally active HPV-related patients showed similar 5-years survival rates, E6/E7 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This emphasizes the importance of considering the transcriptional status of HPV-positive tumors for patient stratification. A gene expression profiling analysis of these different types of tumors was carried out. The most significant differentially expressed gene was CDKN2A, a known biomarker for HPV-related cancer. Assessing both the expression level of the E6/E7 mRNAs and of CDKN2A in HNSCC is required to detect active HPV infection. Chromosomic alterations were investigated by Comparative Genomic Hybridation (CGH) analysis of tumors with transcriptionally active HPV and HPV-negative tumors. The loss of the chromosomal region 16q was found to be a major genetic event in HPV-positive lesions. A cluster of genes located in 16q21-24 displayed decreased expression levels, notably APP-BP1 that is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of p53. In conclusion, this study highlights important criteria required to predict clinically active HPV infection, identifies new biological pathways implicated in HPV tumorigenesis and increases the understanding of HPV-HNSCC physiopathology that is required to develop new targets for therapy.",

The need to develop more accurate cancer risk assessment tools is imperative to improve the ability to identify individuals at greatest risk of developing disease. The Cytokinesis-Blocked Micronucleus Cytome Assay (CBMNcyt) presents a sensitive and specific method of assessing DNA damage. We have previously reported that this assay is sensitive to genetic damage caused by the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), and that binucleated cells with micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds are strong predictors of lung cancer risk. The current study confirmed our previous findings and sought to identify the specific chromosomes involved in lung carcinogenesis. Spectral karyotyping was conducted on a subset of lung cancer cases [n = 116] and cancer-free controls [n = 126] with the highest CBMNcyt endpoints, on baseline and NNK-treated blood lymphocytes. After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and pack and smoke years, consistent significant associations between chromosome: 9, 19, 22, X, at baseline; chromosome: 3, 4, and 16 after NNK-induction; and chromosome: 1, 13, and 17 at both baseline and NNK-induction; and lung cancer risk (all P ≤ 0.05) were observed. Several of these chromosomes harbor critical genes involved in lung carcinogenesis, such as the FHIT gene, CDKN2A, PADPRP, and TP53.

Conversely, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) causally associated with carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix contributes to tumor development by inactivating p53 and Rb. Nevertheless, a correlation between expression of p14(ARF)/p16(INK4A) and HPV infection in uterine cervix is less clear. To clarify this, we examined 25 cervical cancers and 11 normal uterine cervixes. HPV was detected in 21 of 25 cervical cancers (84%) and their subtype was determined by PCR-RFLP. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays showed overexpression of p14(ARF) mRNA in all 21 HPV-positive cases (100%). p16(INK4A) mRNA was overexpressed in 17 cases of the HPV-positive cases (81%). In four HPV-negative cancers, reduced expression of p14(ARF) mRNA was detected in two cases (50%) and reduced p16(INK4A) mRNA in three cases (75%). Our data indicate that the overexpression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) strongly associates with HPV-positive cervical cancers and that reduced expression of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) correlates with HPV-negative cervical cancers.

Genetic experiments have defined the importance of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 for the maintenance of methylation in mouse cells and its role in neoplasia. In human bladder cancer cells, selective depletion of DNMT1 with antisense inhibitors has been shown to induce demethylation and reactivation of the silenced tumor-suppressor gene CDKN2A. In contrast, targeted disruption of DNMT1 alleles in HCT116 human colon cancer cells produced clones that retained CpG island methylation and associated tumor-suppressor gene silencing, whereas HCT116 clones with inactivation of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B showed much lower levels of DNA methylation, suggesting that the two enzymes are highly cooperative. We used a combination of genetic (antisense and siRNA) and pharmacologic (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) inhibitors of DNA methyl transferases to study the contribution of the DNMT isotypes to cancer-cell methylation. Selective depletion of DNMT1 using either antisense or siRNA resulted in lower cellular maintenance methyltransferase activity, global and gene-specific demethylation and re-expression of tumor-suppressor genes in human cancer cells. Specific depletion of DNMT1 but not DNMT3A or DNMT3B markedly potentiated the ability of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to reactivate silenced tumor-suppressor genes, indicating that inhibition of DNMT1 function is the principal means by which 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivates genes. These results indicate that DNMT1 is necessary and sufficient to maintain global methylation and aberrant CpG island methylation in human cancer cells.",

A total of 70 genes were proven to be related to the mammalian phenotypes of NSCLC, and seven genes (ATAD5, BECN1, CDKN2A, FNTB, E2F1, KRAS and PTEN) were found to have a bearing on more than one mammalian phenotype (MP) each. Four network clusters centered by four genes thyroglobulin (TG), neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1 ), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2 ) and E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) were generated. Genes in the four network modules were enriched in eight KEGG pathways (p value < 0.05), including pathways in cancer, small cell lung cancer, cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway. Genes p53 and E2F1 may play important roles in NSCLC occurrence, and thus can be considered as therapeutic targets for NSCLC.",

In a series of 11 microsatellite stable (MSS) and 9 microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancer cell lines and primary colon carcinomas (25 MSS and 28 MSI) with known ploidy stem line and APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutation status, we analyzed the promoter methylation of the following genes: hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a (CDKN2A alpha-transcript), p14ARF (CDKN2A beta-transcript), APC, and E-cadherin (CDH1). We compared the DNA methylation profiles of the cell lines with those of the primary tumors. Finally, we examined if the epigenetic changes were associated with known genetic markers and/or clinicopathological variables.;The cell lines and primary tumors generally showed similar overall distribution and frequencies of gene methylation. Among the cell lines, 15%, 50%, 75%, 65%, 20% and 15% showed promoter methylation for hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a, p14ARF, APC, and E-cadherin, respectively, whereas 21%, 40%, 32%, 38%, 32%, and 40% of the primary tumors were methylated for the same genes. hMLH1 and p14ARF were significantly more often methylated in MSI than in MSS primary tumors, whereas the remaining four genes showed similar methylation frequencies in the two groups. Methylation of p14ARF, which indirectly inactivates TP53, was seen more frequently in tumors with normal TP53 than in mutated samples, but the difference was not statistically significant. Methylation of p14ARF and p16INK4a was often present in the same primary tumors, but association to diploidy, MSI, right-sided location and female gender was only significant for p14ARF. E-cadherin was methylated in 14/34 tumors with altered APC further stimulating WNT signaling.;The present study shows that colon cancer cell lines are in general relevant in vitro models, comparable with the in vivo situation, as the cell lines display many of the same molecular alterations as do the primary carcinomas. The combined pattern of epigenetic and genetic aberrations in the primary carcinomas reveals associations between them as well as to clinicopathological variables, and may aid in the future molecular assisted classification of clinically distinct stages.",

Here, we report that nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. No evidence of drug-induced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate in activating p53.

Depending on amplicon design, different types of information can be obtained from the HRM analysis. Much of this information cannot be obtained by electrophoretic analysis. In particular, identification of false positives due to incomplete bisulphite conversion or false priming is possible. Heterogeneous methylation can also be distinguished from homogeneous methylation. As proof of principle, we have developed assays for the promoter regions of the CDH1, DAPK1, CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)) and RARB genes. We show that highly accurate quantification is possible in the range from 100% to 0.1% methylated template when 25 ng of bisulphite-modified DNA is used as a template for PCR.

        "Doc_abstract":"Although the first English-language report of melanoma in 1820 contained a description of a melanoma-prone family, it was 1983 before formal genetic analysis suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for both melanoma and the then newly described melanoma precursor, dysplastic nevi (DN). Subsequent genetic studies have assumed this model to be correct, although when viewed in aggregate, the data are inconsistent. The first proposed melanoma gene (CMM1) was mapped to chromosome 1p36. This gene assignment has not been confirmed. A second melanoma gene, designated CMM2, has been mapped to chromosome 9p21. This gene assignment has been confirmed, and the cell cycle regulator CDKN2A has been proposed as the candidate gene. Germline mutations in this gene have been identified in about 20% of melanoma-prone families that have been studied to date. Pancreatic cancer occurs excessively in melanoma families with germline mutations in CDKN2A. Germline mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4 (chromosome 12q14) have been described in three melanoma families. This finding represents a third melanoma gene but one that accounts for only a tiny fraction of all hereditary melanoma. Recently, a familial melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome has been reported. Large germline deletions of 9p21 occur in these families, with the p19 gene implicated in its pathogenesis. At present, clinical predictive genetic testing for mutations in the CDKN2A gene is available commercially, but its use has been limited by uncertainty as to how test results would affect the management of melanoma-prone family members. Currently, management recommendations include monthly skin self-examination, clinical skin examination once or twice yearly, a low threshold for simple excision of changing pigmented lesions, moderation of sun exposure, and appropriate use of sunscreens. A heritable determinant for total nevus number has been suggested by twin studies. Other data suggest the presence of a major gene responsible for \"total nevus density\" in melanoma-prone families. Approximately 55% of the mole phenotype in multiplex melanoma families was explained by this proposed gene. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been proposed for DN, and data exist to suggest that DN may be a pleiotropic manifestation of the 1p36 familial melanoma gene. However, there clearly are melanoma-prone families that do not express the dysplastic nevus trait, and some of the families linked to CDKN2A also present with dysplastic nevi. Several studies have shown a surprisingly high prevalence of DN on the skin of family members of probands with DN. In light of the extensive evidence documenting that persons with DN (both sporadic and familial) have an increased prospective risk of melanoma, these family studies suggest that relatives of persons with DN should be examined for both DN and melanoma. Genetic determinants play a major role in the pathogenesis of normal nevi, DN, and melanoma. Identifying the molecular basis of these genetic events promises to enhance melanoma risk-reduction strategies and, ultimately, reduce melanoma-associated mortality.",

For this analysis, we utilized a panel of 25 human pancreatic cancer cell lines derived from either primary or metastatic tumors. This panel also included a metastatic progression series of cell lines derived from COLO 357 cells. Array CGH permitted the identification of alterations in the copy number of genes that might participate in the aberrant behavior of pancreatic cancer cells.

To complement the array CGH analysis, we also conducted an analysis of mRNA expression patterns in a subset of these cells using cDNA microarrays. By this means, we identified a set of candidate genes, including those regulated by RAS signaling, that may contribute to the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

Activating point mutations in the KRAS oncogene are prevalent in pancreatic cancer and result in the stimulation of several pathways including the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Other genetic alterations, including telomere shortening and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4, which encode p16, p53, and SMAD4, respectively, also contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer. These, and other genetic events, can present at different stages in the development of PDAC at histologically defined precursor lesions known as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, or mucinous cystic neoplasms. Each precursor lesion represents alternate routes to PDAC formation and has a unique presentation and somewhat distinct genetic events controlling its development. Despite the advances in the understanding of the genetics of PDAC, the prognosis for this cancer remains poor, and several important aspects of its pathogenesis must be clarified to improve therapeutics, including the timing and method of metastases, as well as the relationship of the tumor cells with the desmoplastic stroma, which is a characteristic feature of the cancer.

Studies have shown that combination of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors is effective against various cancers, including lung cancer. However, optimizing the synergistic dose regime is very difficult and involves adverse side effects. Therefore, in this study, we have shown that cucurbitacin B (CuB), a single bioactive triterpenoid compound, inhibits both DNMTs and HDACs starting at a very low dose of 60 nmol/L in NSCLC H1299 cells. The CuB-mediated inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs in H1299 cells leads to the reactivation of key tumor suppressor genes (TSG) such as CDKN1A and CDKN2A, as well as downregulation of oncogenes c-MYC and K-RAS and key tumor promoter gene (TPG), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The upregulation of TSGs and downregulation of TPG were consistently correlated with the alterations in their promoter methylation and histone modifications. This altered expression of TPG and TSGs is, at least in part, responsible for the inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of cellular apoptosis in NSCLC. Furthermore, CuB treatment significantly inhibited the tumor incidence and multiplicity in 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of hyperproliferation in the lung tissues.

This model is advantageous in overcoming the heterogeneity associated with the prostate cancer up to a certain extent. We characterized and compared the gene expression profiles in LNCaP-C33 (androgen-dependent) and LNCaP-C81 (androgen-independent) cells using Affymetrix GeneChip array analyses. Multiple genes were identified exhibiting differential expression during androgen-independent progression. Among the important genes upregulated in androgen-independent cells were PCDH7, TPTE, TSPY, EPHA3, HGF, MET, EGF, TEM8, etc., whereas many candidate tumor suppressor genes (HTATIP2, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN1C, TP53, TP73, ICAM1, SOCS1/2, SPRY2, PPP2CA, PPP3CA, etc.) were decreased. Pathway prediction analysis identified important gene networks associated with growth-promoting and apoptotic signaling that were perturbed during androgen-independent progression. Further investigation of one of the genes, PPP2CA, which encodes the catalytic subunit of a serine phosphatase PP2A, a potent tumor suppressor, revealed that its expression was decreased in prostate cancer compared to adjacent normal/benign tissue. Furthermore, the downregulated expression of PPP2CA was significantly correlated with tumor stage and Gleason grade. Future studies on the identified differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways may be helpful in understanding the biology of prostate cancer progression and prove useful in developing novel prognostic biomarkers and therapy for androgen-refractory prostate cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Morphologically, early colorectal tumors are divided into two groups, protruded-type tumors and flat-type tumors. Although some studies have shown genetic alterations in protruded-type tumors, little is known about genetic and epigenetic alterations in flat-type tumors, as well as pT1 (early invasive) colorectal cancers (CRCs). In the current study, we compared the frequencies of genetic and epigenetic alterations of the RAS-RAF and Wnt signaling pathways in flat-type and protruded-type tumors. In addition, we investigated the relationship between those alterations and invasive potential of pT1 CRCs. Methylations of RASSF2, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), EPHB2, CDKN2A and MLH1 were detected in 44.3, 30.3, 81.4, 7.5, 43.6 and 13.4% of the 307 early colorectal tumors, respectively. Mutations of KRAS, BRAF, catalytic subunit alpha of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PIK3CA) and beta-catenin were detected in 25.4, 4.6, 1.6 and 9.4% of those tumors, respectively. Methylations of MGMT, WIF-1 and CDKN2A were detected in significantly higher percentages of protruded-type tumors than in flat-type tumors. Mutation of at least one gene was detected in a significantly higher percentage of flat-type tumors than in protruded-type tumors. RASSF2 methylation was correlated significantly with KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutation. Multiple logistic analysis showed that lymphatic invasion and RASSF2 methylation with KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutation were independent risk factors for venous invasion in pT1 CRCs. In conclusion, since genetic alterations of these pathways have frequently occurred in flat-type tumors, flat-type tumors seem to have a distinct genetic profile different from that of protruded-type tumors. RASSF2 methylation with oncogenic activation is a promising biomarker for predicting invasive potential of pT1 CRCs.",

We also analysed DNA copy number aberrations and the methylation of CpG sequences in several cancer-related genes by utilizing a novel methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method.;Twenty three of 24 conventional melanomas showed at least one of the genetic and epigenetic alterations examined, although one acral melanoma did not show any alteration.

Of the 16 ambiguous spitzoid lesions, most of which were designated atypical Spitz tumour by one of the authors, all but one showed no mutations, no methylations and few copy number aberrations. However, three tumours showed copy number loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A), an alteration observed frequently in melanomas but not found in conventional Spitz naevi. These results show that, although most atypical Spitz tumours do not differ from conventional Spitz naevi showing virtually no genetic and epigenetic aberrations, some cases may have chromosomal aberrations that include copy number loss of the CDKN2A gene.;Genetic and epigenetic analyses may be useful as an additional diagnostic tool to distinguish between melanoma and Spitz naevus, and may help to define subgroups in atypical Spitz tumours.",

Cellular FASN expression is physiologically upregulated in a state of energy excess. Obesity and excess energy balance have been known to be risk factors for colorectal cancer. High degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is a distinct phenotype in colorectal cancer, associated with CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Previous data suggest that obesity or altered energy balance may potentially modify risks for MSI-H cancers and microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers differently. However, the relationship between MSI and FASN overexpression has not been investigated. Using 976 cases of population-based colorectal cancer samples from 2 large prospective cohort studies, we correlated FASN expression (by immunohistochemistry) with MSI, KRAS and BRAF mutations, p53 expression (by immunohistochemistry), and CIMP status [determined by MethyLight for 8 CIMP-specific gene promoters including CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1]. Marked (2+) FASN overexpression was observed in 110 (11%) of the 976 tumors and was significantly more common in MSI-H tumors (21% [28/135]) than MSI-low (5.6% [4/72], P = .004) and MSS tumors (11% [72/678], P = .001). The association between FASN overexpression and MSI-H persisted even after stratification by CIMP status. In contrast, FASN overexpression was not correlated with CIMP after stratification by MSI status. Fatty acid synthase overexpression was not significantly correlated with sex, tumor location, p53, or KRAS/BRAF status. In conclusion, FASN overexpression in colorectal cancer is associated with MSI-H, independent of CIMP status.",

In this study, the methylation pattern of 24 tumor suppressor genes was analyzed in 75 samples of ovarian cancer using the methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay. Of the 24 tumor suppressor genes examined, aberrant methylation was observed in 17. The three most frequently methylated genes were CDKN2B, CDH13 and RASSF1, followed by ESR1 and MLH1. Methylation frequencies ranged from 1.3% for CDKN2A, RARβ, CASP8, VHL and TP73 to 24% for CDKN2B. The corresponding normal DNA from each patient was also investigated. Methylation was detected in tumors, although not in normal tissues, with the exception of two samples, indicating aberrant methylation in tumors. Clear cell carcinoma samples exhibited a higher frequency of CDKN2B promoter hypermethylation compared to those of other histological types (P=0.05). Our data indicate that methylation of the CDKN2B gene is a frequent event in ovarian carcinogenesis and that analysis of only three genes is sufficient to detect the presence of methylation in 35% of ovarian cancer cases.

The MTAP gene product is the principal enzyme involved in purine synthesis via the salvage pathway, such that MTAP-negative cancers are solely dependent on de novo purine synthesis mechanisms. Inhibitors of the de novo pathway can then be used to selectively blockade purine synthesis in cancer cells while causing minimal collateral damage to normal cells. In this study, we determine that 10 of 28 (35%) biliary tract cancers show complete lack of Mtap protein expression. In vitro analysis using a selective inhibitor of the de novo purine synthesis pathway, L-alanosine, shows robust growth inhibition in MTAP-negative biliary cancer cell lines CAK-1 and GBD-1 accompanied by striking depletion of intracellular ATP and failure to rescue this depletion via addition of exogenous methylthioadenosine, the principal substrate of the MTAP gene product; in contrast, no significant effects were observed in MTAP-expressing HuCCT1 and SNU308 cell lines. Colony formation studies confirmed that L-alanosine reduced both number and size of CAK-1 colonies in soft agar assays. Knockdown of Mtap protein by RNA interference in L-alanosine-resistant HuCCT1 cells conferred sensitivity to this agent, confirming that intracellular Mtap protein levels determine response to L-alanosine.

In both cases the cellular response to oxidative stress is determined by the cellular context. ARF, the alternative protein product of the CDKN2A locus has been recently recognized as a novel sensor of oxidative stress, in a β-catenin and Hsp70-mediated manner.

Chronic infections with hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses and alcohol abuse are the major factors leading to HCC. This deadly cancer affects more than 500,000 people worldwide and it is quite resistant to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy. Genetic and epigenetic studies on HCC may help to understand better its mechanisms and provide new tools for early diagnosis and therapy. Recent literature on whole genome analysis of HCC indicated a high number of mutated genes in addition to well-known genes such as TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1 and CDKN2A, but their frequencies are much lower. Apart from CTNNB1 mutations, most of the other mutations appear to result in loss-of-function. Thus, HCC-associated mutations cannot be easily targeted for therapy. Epigenetic aberrations that appear to occur quite frequently may serve as new targets. Global DNA hypomethylation, promoter methylation, aberrant expression of non-coding RNAs and dysregulated expression of other epigenetic regulatory genes such as EZH2 are the best-known epigenetic abnormalities. Future research in this direction may help to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.",

Univariate analysis for association with tumour recurrence was carried out with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Follow-up data were available in 95/105 patients (91.4%). A tumour recurrence was observed in 26 patients (27.3%). We could identify six genes (SOCS-1, STAT-1, BCL-2, DAPK, TIMP-3, E-Cadherin), where methylation was associated with tumour recurrence. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, TIMP-3 showed a significant association with recurrence free survival. Methylation of TIMP-3 predicted prolonged disease free interval. In this study, we report a comprehensive analysis on prognostic relevance of gene methylation in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

We analyzed hypermethylation of six genes by methylation-specific PCR and LINE-1 hypomethylation by Southern blotting in 96 carcinoma tissues. Hypermethylation frequencies were: SFRP1 (55%), APC (45%), RASSF1A (35%), DAPK1 (29%), RARB2 (19%), and CDKN2A (2%). Three groups of cancers could be discerned, with escalating hypermethylation. Hypermethylation increased with tumor stage, particularly at the transition to invasive cancers, and RARB2 hypermethylation was indicative of lymph node involvement. A comparison to a previous study on prostate cancer using the same techniques suggests that hypermethylation in urothelial carcinoma occurs in a random rather than coordinated manner. LINE-1 hypomethylation was present in 90% of specimens, largely independent of hypermethylation. Lack of hypomethylation indicated a significantly better clinical prognosis. Bisulfite sequencing of SFRP1 demonstrated dense or patchy hypermethylation in tumor tissues that likely accounts for discrepant reported frequencies. In urothelial carcinoma cell lines, the same genes as in tissues were frequently hypermethylated. SFRP1 hypermethylation was concordant with lack of expression. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine induced its reexpression in some lines, whereas additional treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor was required in others. Thus, epigenetic SFRP1 inactivation occurs in a graduated manner. In conclusion, markers of genome-wide hypomethylation seem optimally suited for urothelial carcinoma detection, whereas combinations of hypermethylation and hypomethylation assays hold promise for classification.",

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

Relationships between CDKN2A, CDKN2B, ARF, and ANRIL expression and the rs2151280 genotype were tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test.

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma of the skin is the most common neoplasia in humans. Previous studies have shown the existence of allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability) in BCC on several human chromosomes. Chromosome region 9p21-p22 harbors the CDKN2a/p16INK4a, p19ARF, and p15INK4b tumor suppressor genes. To determine the contribution of these genes to the development of basal cell carcinomas we looked for evidence of allelic imbalance in 67 sporadic basal cell carcinoma specimens from Greek patients and screened 28 of them presenting loss of heterozygosity at 9p21-p22 for germline mutations in p16INK4a and p19ARF genes. Chromosome regions 17q21 and 17p13 were also screened for allelic imbalance in all the 67 basal cell carcinoma specimens. Overall, 69% (46 of 67) of the specimens displayed loss of heterozygosity in at least one microsatellite marker, whereas only six of the 67 (9%) exhibited microsatellite instability. For the 9p21-p22 locus the overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity reached 55% (37 of 67) and is the highest reported. The overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity for the 17q21 locus is 34% (22 of 64) and for the 17p13 locus is 11% (seven of 65). Two of the 28 loss of heterozygosity positive cases were heterozygous for a previously described polymorphism, Ala148Thr, in exon 2 of the CDKN2a gene. This is the first demonstration of polymorphism in the CDKN2a gene in human basal cell carcinomas. No sequence variation in exon 1beta of the p19ARF gene was found. Our results provide evidence of a significantly high occurrence of loss of heterozygosity for the 9p21-p22 locus; however, lack of p16INK4a/p19ARF mutation suggests that these genes seem not to be implicated by mutational inactivation in the development of basal cell carcinoma. Other(s), yet unidentified, tumor suppressor gene(s) located in this locus may be related to this specific type of skin cancer.",

EUS revealed two patients with pancreatic cancer (one resectable, one metastatic), five with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), seven with cysts, and six with parenchymal changes. Five had pancreatic surgery (one total pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer, three distal and one central pancreatectomy for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 2 and IPMN). A total of 24 (47%) had genetic testing (19 for BRCA1/2 mutations, 4 for CDKN2A, 1 for MLH1/MSH2) and 7 were positive for BRCA1/2 mutations. Four extrapancreatic neoplasms were found: two ovarian cancers on prophylactic total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, one carcinoid, and one papillary thyroid carcinoma. Overall, 6 (12%) of the 51 patients had neoplastic lesions in the pancreas and 9 (18%) had neoplasms in any location. All were on the initial round of screening.

The majority of techniques to study oncogenic mutations require high quality and quantity DNA or are analytically challenging. Mass-spectrometry based mutation analysis however is a relatively simple and high-throughput method suitable for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour material. Targeted gene panels using this technique have been developed for several types of cancer. These current cancer hotspot panels are not focussed on the genes that are most relevant in gynaecological cancers. In this study, we report the design and validation of a novel, mass-spectrometry based panel specifically for gynaecological malignancies and present the frequencies of detected mutations. Using frequency data from the online Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, we selected 171 somatic hotspot mutations in the 13 most important genes for gynaecological cancers, being BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FOXL2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A and PTEN. A total of 546 tumours (205 cervical, 227 endometrial, 89 ovarian, and 25 vulvar carcinomas) were used to test and validate our panel, and to study the prevalence and spectrum of somatic mutations in these types of cancer. The results were validated by testing duplicate samples and by allele-specific qPCR. The panel presented here using mass-spectrometry shows to be reproducible and high-throughput, and is usefull in FFPE material of low quality and quantity. It provides new possibilities for studying large numbers of gynaecological tumour samples in daily practice, and could be useful in guided therapy selection. ",

Deletion of 9p is one of the most frequent genomic alterations in bladder cancer. In addition, alterations of 9p21 and P16 are frequently seen in the epithelial cells of chronic smokers. This pilot study evaluated whether 9p21 aberrations induced by exposure in vitro to benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the metabolic product of benzo[a]pyrene, a constituent of tobacco smoke, were more common in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 61 bladder cancer patients compared to 64 matched controls. Our hypothesis was that 9p21 sensitivity to BPDE reflects the susceptibility of a specific locus to damage from carcinogens in tobacco smoke. We found that BPDE-induced chromosome band 9p21 aberrations were significantly higher in lymphocytes of bladder cancer cases (24.97 +/- 5.26 per 1,000) than in controls (20.72 +/- 4.51 per 1,000; P < 0.0001). However, no difference was observed for CEP9, a control locus. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking status, 9p BPDE sensitivity had an odds ratio (OR) of 9.01 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.75, 21.67] for bladder cancer. We further observed a gradient of elevated bladder cancer risk associated with increasing chromosomal damage. The adjusted ORs for subjects in the second, third, and highest quartiles of BPDE-induced 9p21 aberrations relative to the first quartile were 0.48 (0.04, 5.69), 5.14 (1.12, 23.59), and 21.51 (4.75, 97.34), respectively, providing increasing dose-response evidence of the locus-specific alterations.

The malignant phenotype results from a step-wise increase of both genetic abnormalities and epigenetic modifications, leading to dysregulation of critical genes controlling cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The methylation of CpG islands within gene promoters is a major epigenetic transcriptional control mechanism that is frequently dysregulated in human cancer. This phenomenon (methylation of CpG islands) plays a critical role in the transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes in cancer and has prompted the development and testing of several demethylating agents aimed at reversing this process. Clinical trials using epigenetically targeted therapies have yielded particularly promising results in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in which tumour suppressor gene silencing by promoter methylation is a frequent event. Several genes and gene pathways disrupted by aberrant CpG island methylation have now been identified in haematological malignancies, the most frequently studied being the cell cycle inhibitors p16 (now termed CDKN2A; mostly methylated in lymphoid malignancy) and p15 (now termed CDKN2B; commonly methylated in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies). This review will discuss the role that aberrant gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation plays in the molecular pathogenesis of haematological malignancies and assess the clinical potential of demethylating agents for the management of patients.",

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether genes in addition to p16 are \"targeted\" for silencing and whether overall gene methylation was more common in radiation-induced adenocarcinoma. A significant increase in the prevalence of methylation of GATA5 was seen in tumors from workers compared to tumors from controls. The prevalence for methylation of PAX5 beta and H-cadherin did not differ in tumors from workers and controls. Evaluating the frequency for methylation of a five-gene panel revealed that 93% of adenocarcinomas from workers compared to 66% of tumors from controls were methylated for at least one gene. Moreover, a twofold increase was seen in the number of tumors methylated for three or more genes for tumors from workers compared to controls.

Loss-of-function approaches targeting individual PRC2 subunits have, however, generated findings that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we prevent assembly of both Ezh1- and Ezh2-containing PRC2 complexes by conditional deletion of Eed, a core subunit, and assess hematopoiesis. We find that deletion of Eed exhausts adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), although fetal liver HSCs are produced in normal numbers. Eed-null neonatal HSCs express HSC signature genes but are defective in maintenance and differentiation. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that neonatal and adult HSCs lacking Eed upregulated gene sets of conflicting pathways. Deletion of Cdkn2a, a PRC2 target gene, in Eed-null mice enhances hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) survival but fails to restore HSC functions. Taken together, our findings define developmental-stage-specific requirements for canonical PRC2 complexes in normal HSC function.",

Although this loss activates the cell-cycle-dependent kinases CDK4/6, which have been considered as drug targets for many years, p16(INK4A)-deficient PDAC cells are inherently resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. This study searched for targeted therapies that might synergize with CDK4/6 inhibition in this setting. We report that the IGF1R/IR inhibitor BMS-754807 cooperated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 to strongly block proliferation of p16(INK4A)-deficient PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo. Sensitivity to this drug combination correlated with reduced activity of the master cell growth regulator mTORC1. Accordingly, replacing the IGF1R/IR inhibitor with the rapalog inhibitor temsirolimus broadened the sensitivity of PDAC cells to CDK4/6 inhibition. Our results establish targeted therapy combinations with robust cytostatic activity in p16(INK4A)-deficient PDAC cells and possible implications for improving treatment of a broad spectrum of human cancers characterized by p16(INK4A) loss.",

Despite considerable efforts, the 5-year survival rate for HNSCC has not changed significantly. To improve this situation, it is necessary to understand the fundamental biological processes leading to the disease and its progression. In addition to known genetic changes in HNSCC, molecular cytogenetic investigations have identified chromosomal regions of gains and losses, but many of the responsible candidate genes have yet to be identified. Furthermore, recent results indicate the importance of epigenetic modifications in HNSCC, such as DNA methylation. Several genes, including the tumor suppressor CDKN2A and other candidates such as DAPK1, MGMT, TIMP3, TCF21, and C/EBPalpha, have been found to harbor hypermethylated regulatory sequences that lead to reduced expression or gene silencing. Hypermethylation in such genes could be used not only as biomarkers for the early detection of HNSCC but also to improve prevention strategies and therapy outcomes.",

Using this model, we showed that a prototype handheld imaging device can identify residual tumor during intraoperative molecular imaging.

Retroviral vectors triggered dose-dependent acceleration of tumor onset contingent on long terminal repeat activity. Insertions at oncogenes and cell-cycle genes were enriched in early-onset tumors, indicating cooperation in tumorigenesis. In contrast, tumorigenesis was unaffected by lentiviral vectors and did not enrich for specific integrants, despite the higher integration load and robust expression of lentiviral vectors in all hematopoietic lineages.

First, we perform a bioinformatic analysis of copy number variation (CNV) and DNA methylation covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumor cells. We separately examined CNV and DNA methylation for 42 primary serous ovarian cancer samples using MOMA-ROMA assays and 379 tumor samples analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have identified 346 genes with significant deletions or amplifications among the tumor samples. Utilizing associated gene expression data we predict 156 genes with altered copy number and correlated changes in expression. Among these genes CCNE1, POP4, UQCRB, PHF20L1 and C19orf2 were identified within both data sets. We were specifically interested in copy number variation as our base genomic property in the prediction of tumor suppressors and oncogenes in the altered ovarian tumor. We therefore identify changes in DNA methylation and expression for all amplified and deleted genes. We statistically define tumor suppressor and oncogenic features for these modalities and perform a correlation analysis with expression. We predicted 611 potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors candidates by integrating these data types. Genes with a strong correlation for methylation dependent expression changes exhibited at varying copy number aberrations include CDCA8, ATAD2, CDKN2A, RAB25, AURKA, BOP1 and EIF2C3. We provide copy number variation and DNA methylation analysis for over 11,500 individual genes covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumors.

Down-regulation of p21 is caused by TP53 mutations in colorectal cancer. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) appears to be a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer with concordant methylation of multiple gene promoters and is associated with a high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and BRAF mutations. However, no study to date has evaluated the relationship between p21 expression and CIMP in colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the inter-relationships between p21, p53, CIMP, MSI and KRAS/BRAF status in colorectal cancer. We utilized 737 relatively unbiased samples of colorectal cancers from two large prospective cohort studies. Using quantitative real-time PCR (MethyLight), we measured DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), CRABP1, MLH1 and NEUROG1]. CIMP-high (>or=4/5 methylated promoters) was diagnosed in 118 (16%) of the 737 tumours. We also assessed expression of p21 and p53 by immunohistochemistry. Among the 737 tumours, 371 (50%) showed p21 loss. Both p21 loss and p53 positivity were inversely associated with CIMP-high, MSI-H and BRAF mutations. The associations of p21 with these molecular features were still present after tumours were stratified by p53 status. In contrast, the associations of p53 positivity with the molecular features were no longer present after tumours were stratified by p21 status. When CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high tumours were stratified by MSI or KRAS/BRAF status, CIMP-high and MSI-H (but not BRAF mutations) were still inversely associated with p21 loss. In conclusion, down-regulation of p21 is inversely correlated with CIMP-high and MSI-H in colorectal cancer, independent of TP53 and BRAF status.",

Recurrent sites of transposon insertion are commonly identified using ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR). Here, we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to directly identify transcriptional events mediated by T2/Onc. Surprisingly, the majority (∼80%) of LM-PCR identified junction fragments do not lead to observable changes in RNA transcripts. However, in CIS regions, direct transcriptional effects of transposon insertions are observed. We developed an automated method to systematically identify T2/Onc-genome RNA fusion sequences in RNA-seq data. RNA fusion-based CISs were identified corresponding to both DNA-based CISs (Cdkn2a, Mycl1, Nf2, Pten, Sema6d, and Rere) and additional regions strongly associated with cancer that were not observed by LM-PCR (Myc, Akt1, Pth, Csf1r, Fgfr2, Wisp1, Map3k5, and Map4k3). In addition to calculating recurrent CISs, we also present complementary methods to identify potential driver events via determination of strongly supported fusions and fusions with large transcript level changes in the absence of multitumor recurrence. These methods independently identify CIS regions and also point to cancer-associated genes like Braf. We anticipate RNA-seq analyses of tumors from forward genetic screens will become an efficient tool to identify causal events. ",

In this report, we show that this model recapitulates the immunohistochemical profile and the rapid progression of the human disease. We show that Pax3:Fkhr expression increases during late preneoplasia but tumor cells undergoing metastasis are under apparent selection for Pax3:Fkhr expression. At a whole-genome level, a cross-species gene set enrichment analysis and metagene projection study showed that our mouse model is most similar to human ARMS when compared with other pediatric cancers. We have defined an expression profile conserved between mouse and human ARMS, as well as a Pax3:Fkhr signature, including the target gene, SKP2.

These changes include: genetic alterations in oncogenes and cancer suppressor genes; changes in the cell cycle and pathways leading to apoptosis; and also changes in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The most common alterations involve the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, the HER2 gene, and the K-ras gene. In particular, the loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes has been documented in this tumor, especially in CDKN2a, p53, DPC4 and BRCA2 genes. However, other molecular events involved in pancreatic adenocarcinoma pathogenesis contribute to its development and maintenance, specifically epigenetic events. In fact, key tumor suppressors that are well established to play a role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may be altered through hypermethylation, and oncogenes can be upregulated secondary to permissive histone modifications. Indeed, factors involved in tumor invasiveness can be aberrantly expressed through dysregulated microRNAs. This review summarizes current knowledge of pancreatic carcinogenesis from its initiation within a normal cell until the time that it has disseminated to distant organs. In this scenario, highlighting these molecular alterations could provide new clinical tools for early diagnosis and new effective therapies for this malignancy. ",

The best-characterized role for ARF is in stabilizing p53 in response to cellular stress. However, ARF has tumor suppressive functions outside this pathway that have not been fully defined. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the ARF tumor suppressor contain abnormal numbers of chromosomes. However, no role for ARF in cell division has previously been proposed. Here we demonstrate a novel, p53-independent role for ARF in the mitotic checkpoint. Consistent with this, loss of ARF results in aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo. ARF(-/-) MEFs exhibit mitotic defects including misaligned and lagging chromosomes, multipolar spindles, and increased tetraploidy. ARF(-/-) cells exhibit overexpression of Mad2, BubR1, and Aurora B, but only overexpression of Aurora B phenocopies mitotic defects observed in ARF(-/-) MEFs. Restoring Aurora B to near-normal levels rescues mitotic phenotypes in cells lacking ARF. Our results define an unexpected role for ARF in chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint function. They further establish maintenance of chromosomal stability as one of the additional tumor-suppressive functions of ARF and offer a molecular explanation for the common up-regulation of Aurora B in human cancers.

Furthermore, recent studies in cancer have suggested the importance of identifying transcriptionally altered loci as biomarkers for improved prognosis and therapy. While many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying novel transcriptional events with RNA-seq, nearly all rely on contrasting known classes of samples, such as tumor and normal. Few tools exist for the unsupervised discovery of such events without class labels. In this paper, we present SigFuge for identifying genomic loci exhibiting differential transcription patterns across many RNA-seq samples. SigFuge combines clustering with hypothesis testing to identify genes exhibiting alternative splicing, or differences in isoform expression. We apply SigFuge to RNA-seq cohorts of 177 lung and 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and identify several cases of differential isoform usage including CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene known to be inactivated in a majority of lung squamous cell tumors. By not restricting attention to known sample stratifications, SigFuge offers a novel approach to unsupervised screening of genetic loci across RNA-seq cohorts.

A dose-matrix screening approach found this combination to be highly active and synergistic in a panel of genetically diverse human MM cell lines. Synergy and activity was observed in mouse PCT and human BL and MCL cell lines tested in vitro, as well as in freshly isolated primary MM patient samples tested ex vivo. This combination had minimal effects on healthy donor cells and retained activity when tested in a co-culture system simulating the protective interaction of cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment. Combining sirolimus with entinostat enhanced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At the molecular level, entinostat increased the expression of cell cycle negative regulators including CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16), while the combination decreased critical growth and survival effectors including Cyclin D, BCL-XL, BIRC5, and activated MAPK.",

Here we have investigated the pathogenesis of serrated CRCs by expressing (V600E)Braf in the proliferative cells of the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We show that the oncogene drives an initial burst of Mek-dependent proliferation, leading to the formation of hyperplastic crypts. This is associated with β-catenin nuclear localization by a mechanism involving Mapk/Erk kinase (Mek)-dependent, Akt-independent phosphorylation of Gsk3β. However, hyperplastic crypts remain dormant for prolonged periods due to the induction of crypt senescence accompanied by upregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and p16(Ink4a). We show that tumour progression is associated with down-regulation of p16(Ink4a) through enhanced CpG methylation of exon 1 and knockout of Cdkn2a confirms this gene is a barrier to tumour progression. Our studies identify (V600E)BRAF as an early genetic driver mutation in serrated CRCs and indicate that, unlike APC-mutated cancers, this subtype arises by the bypassing of a (V600E)Braf driven oncogene-induced senescence programme.",

We examined the relationship between IGFBP3 methylation, p53 expression, CIMP and MSI in 902 population-based colorectal cancers. Utilizing real-time PCR (MethyLight), we quantified promoter methylation in IGFBP3 and eight other CIMP-high-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1). IGFBP3 methylation was far more frequent in non-MSI-high CIMP-high tumors (85% = 35/41) than in MSI-high CIMP-high (49% = 44/90, P < .0001), MSI-high non-CIMP-high (17% = 6/36, P < .0001), and non-MSI-high non-CIMP-high tumors (22% = 152/680, P < .0001).

In conclusion, IGFBP3 methylation is inversely associated with MSI in CIMP-high colorectal cancers, and this relationship is limited to p53-negative tumors.

In the current study, we have tested the efficacy of Andrographolide (AG), a bioactive diterpenoid isolated from Andrographis paniculata, against PCa. This natural agent selectively affects PCa cell viability in a dose and time-dependent manner, without affecting primary prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, AG showed differential effect on cell cycle phases in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 cells compared to retinoblastoma protein (RB(-/-)) and CDKN2A lacking DU-145 cells. G2/M transition was blocked in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 after AG treatment whereas DU-145 cells failed to transit G1/S phase. This difference was primarily due to differential activation of cell cycle regulators in these cell lines. Levels of cyclin A2 after AG treatment increased in all PCa cells line. Cyclin B1 levels increased in LNCaP and PC3, decreased in C4-2b and showed no difference in DU-145 cells after AG treatment. AG decreased cyclin E2 levels only in PC3 and DU-145 cells.

Novel therapeutics and stratification approaches are needed to improve the outlook for both NMIBC and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We investigated the expression and effects of B Lymphoma Mo-MLV Insertion Region 1 (BMI1) in UC. BMI1 was found to be overexpressed in most UC cell lines and primary tumors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In contrast to some previous reports, no association with tumor stage or grade was observed in two independent tumor panels. Furthermore, upregulation of BMI1 was detected in premalignant bladder lesions, suggesting a role early in tumorigenesis. BMI1 is not located within a common region of genomic amplification in UC. The CDKN2A locus (which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor gene) is a transcriptional target of BMI1 in some cellular contexts. In UC cell lines and primary tissues, no correlation between BMI1 and p16 expression was observed. Retroviral-mediated overexpression of BMI1 immortalized normal human urothelial cells (NHUC) in vitro and was associated with induction of telomerase activity, bypass of senescence, and repression of differentiation. The effects of BMI1 on gene expression were identified by expression microarray analysis of NHUC-BMI1. Metacore analysis of the gene expression profile implicated downstream effects of BMI1 on α4/β1 integrin-mediated adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, and CREB1-mediated transcription. ",

An inaccurate diagnosis may lead the clinician to a wrong diagnostic and therapeutic pathway because MPMs occurring in familial or sporadic settings are often involved in individual cancer susceptibility. We investigated the clinical, demographic, histological, and survival differences between MPMs and single melanoma occurring in the head and neck region. A retrospective analysis of medical and histologic records from 217 melanomas of the head and neck region was carried out. Malignant neoplasms affecting MPMs patients were also reported. Mutational analysis of specific genes was carried out when clinical data and family history were suggestive for a familial/hereditary setting. Two hundred and five out of 217 (94.5%) patients were affected by single primary melanoma and 12 (5.5%) by MPMs of the head and neck region. Individuals affected by MPMs were distinguished by a significantly higher mutation frequency and a higher prevalence of malignant neoplasms such as renal cancer. Genetic testing showed germline mutations affecting MITF E318K, CDKN2A genes. Our data highlight the importance of strict cancer surveillance in individuals with MPMs and the role of appropriate genetic counseling and testing in selected patients. Finally, personalized clinical and instrumental screening and follow-up strategies should also be based on mutational status. A heightened level of suspicion is required in the clinical management of mutation carriers. ",

Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates molecular alterations to EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in previously untreated tumors. Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. These results suggest that AP-2 transcription factors are activated as feedback from EGFR network inhibition and may mediate EGFR inhibitor resistance.",

Here we present an analysis tool, VarScan 2, for the detection of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in exome data from tumor-normal pairs. Unlike most current approaches, our algorithm reads data from both samples simultaneously; a heuristic and statistical algorithm detects sequence variants and classifies them by somatic status (germline, somatic, or LOH); while a comparison of normalized read depth delineates relative copy number changes. We apply these methods to the analysis of exome sequence data from 151 high-grade ovarian tumors characterized as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We validated some 7790 somatic coding mutations, achieving 93% sensitivity and 85% precision for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection. Exome-based CNA analysis identified 29 large-scale alterations and 619 focal events per tumor on average. As in our previous analysis of these data, we observed frequent amplification of oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1, MYC) and deletion of tumor suppressors (NF1, PTEN, and CDKN2A). We searched for additional recurrent focal CNAs using the correlation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS) algorithm, which identified 424 significant events affecting 582 genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate the robust performance of VarScan 2 for somatic mutation and CNA detection and shed new light on the landscape of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer.",

DNA sequence analysis revealed no evidence for an inherited mutation of BAP1. Sequence analysis of other potentially relevant genes, including TP53, CDKN2A, and BARD1, also revealed no mutation. DNA microarray analysis of tissue from two mesotheliomas revealed multiple genomic imbalances, including consistent losses of overlapping segments in 2q, 6q, 9p, 14q, 15q, and 22q, but no losses of chromosome 3 harboring the BAP1 locus. However, the results of immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated loss of nuclear BAP1 staining in three of six mesotheliomas tested, suggesting that somatic alterations of BAP1 occurred in a subset of tumors from this family. Since mesothelioma could be confirmed in only a single generation, domestic exposure to asbestos may be the predominant cause of mesothelioma in this family. Given the existence of unspecified malignant pleural tumors and lung cancers in a prior generation, we discuss the possibility that some other tumor susceptibility or modifier gene(s) may contribute to the high incidence of mesothelioma in this family. Because the incidence of mesothelioma in this family is higher than that expected even in workers heavily exposed to asbestos, we conclude that both asbestos exposure and genetic factors have played a role in the high rate of mesothelioma and potentially other pleural or lung cancers seen in this family. ",

As part of an ongoing project to determine how in utero exposure to chemical carcinogens affects the molecular pathogenesis of murine lung tumors, the p53 and p16Cdkn2a genes were analyzed by using paraffin-embedded lung tissues from mice treated transplacentally with 3-methylcholanthrene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, as well as their flanking introns, demonstrated an absence of mutations at this gene locus. However, a genetic polymorphism was identified at nt 708 in intron 4 of the DBA/2 strain of mice 5 bp downstream of a 3' branching-point splice signal. Analysis of exons 1 and 2 of the Cdkn2a gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses revealed mutations in exon 2 in 7% of the tumors examined. Tumor 23-1 exhibited a CAC-->TAC transition at nt 301 (His74-->Tyr74), and tumor 36-1 exhibited a GGG-->GAG transition at nucleotide 350 (Gly90-->Glu90). Northern blot analysis of 14 of the larger tumors showed a marked decrease in the levels of Rb RNA expression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a spectrum of pRb expression, with the smaller adenomas showing moderate numbers of nuclei with heterogeneous staining for pRb in contrast with a highly reduced or near-complete absence of expression in the nuclei of larger tumors with features of adenocarcinomas. The low incidence of mutations at tumor suppressor loci suggested that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes was a late event in murine lung tumor pathogenesis. The identification of both mutations at the Cdkn2a gene locus and reduced levels of Rb expression combined with previous studies demonstrating a high incidence of mutated Kras2 alleles in these tumors implies that alterations of the Rb regulatory axis, in combination with mutation of Kras2, may be the preferred pathway for the pathogenesis of pulmonary tumors in transplacentally exposed mice.",

A single examiner conducted full-body nevus counts and blood samples were collected from cases for analysis of the CDKN2A melanoma predisposition gene. A total of 201 (80%) of the 250 adolescents with melanoma diagnosed between 1987 and 1994 and registered with the Queensland Cancer Registry and 205 (79%) of 258 age-, gender- and location-matched controls who were contacted agreed to participate. The strongest risk factor associated with melanoma in adolescents in a multivariate model was the presence of more than 100 nevi 2 mm or more in diameter (odds ratio [OR] = 46.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.4-190.8). Other risk factors were red hair (OR = 5.4, 95%CI = 1.0-28.4); blue eyes (OR = 4.5, 95%CI = 1.5-13.6); inability to tan after prolonged sun exposure (OR = 4.7, 95%CI = 0.9-24.6); heavy facial freckling (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 0.9-12.3); and family history of melanoma (OR = 4.0, 95%CI = 0.8-18.9). Only 2 of 147 cases tested had germline variants or mutations in CDKN2A. There was no association with sunscreen use overall, however, never/rare use of sunscreen at home under the age of 5 years was associated with increased risk (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 0.7-7.1). There was no difference between cases and controls in cumulative sun exposure in this high-exposure environment. Factors indicating genetic susceptibility to melanoma, in particular, the propensity to develop nevi and freckles, red hair, blue eyes, inability to tan and a family history of the disease are the primary determinants of melanoma among adolescents in this high solar radiation environment.

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14(ARF) and p16. We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REGγ. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REGγ or by pharmacologic blockade of its nuclear export. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of 2 key tumor suppressors mediated by a REGγ-dependent mechanism. The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell-cycle function.;The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell cycle function.

A link between JCVT and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) has been suggested. However, no large-scale study has examined the relations of JCVT with molecular alterations, clinical outcome, or prognosis in colon cancer. We detected JCVT expression (by immunohistochemistry) in 271 (35%) of 766 colorectal cancers. We quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) and eight other loci (CHFR, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, p14, WRN) by MethyLight. We examined loss of heterozygosity in 2p, 5q, 17q, and 18q. JCVT was significantly associated with p53 expression (P < .0001), p21 loss (P < .0001), CIN (>/=2 chromosomal segments with LOH; P < .0001), nuclear beta-catenin (P = .006), LINE-1 hypomethylation (P = .002), and inversely with CIMP-high (P = .0005) and microsatellite instability (MSI) (P < .0001), but not with PIK3CA mutation.

However, JCVT was no longer significantly associated with CIMP, MSI, beta-catenin, or cyclooxygenase-2 expression in multivariate analysis. JCVT was unrelated with patient survival.

The methylation statuses of RASSF1, RARB, CDKN2A (p16INK4a, p14ARF), APC, and RUNX3 genes and long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) were validated in a large cohort (n = 140) of clinically well-annotated ESCC specimens and esophageal normal mucosa (n = 28) using a quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.;Hypermethylation of RARB, p16INK4a, RASSF1, APC, RUNX3, and p14ARF were observed in 55%, 24%, 20%, 19%, 14%, and 8% of specimens, respectively. Hypermethylation of APC was significantly associated with tumor depth (p = 0.02) and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (p = 0.03).

In Brazil, the p.R337H TP53 founder mutation causes the variant form of LFS, Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. The occurrence of cancer and age of disease onset are known to vary, even in patients carrying the same mutation, and several mechanisms such as genetic and epigenetic alterations may be involved in this variability. However, the extent of involvement of such events has not been clarified. It is well established that p53 regulates several pathways, including the thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) pathway, which regulates the DNA methylation of several genes. This study aimed to identify the DNA methylation pattern of genes potentially related to the TDG pathway (CDKN2A, FOXA1, HOXD8, OCT4, SOX2, and SOX17) in 30 patients with germline TP53 mutations, 10 patients with wild-type TP53, and 10 healthy individuals. We also evaluated TDG expression in patients with adrenocortical tumors (ADR) with and without the p.R337H TP53 mutation. Gene methylation patterns of peripheral blood DNA samples assessed by pyrosequencing revealed no significant differences between the three groups. However, increased TDG expression was observed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in p.R337H carriers with ADR. Considering the rarity of this phenotype and the relevance of these findings, further studies using a larger sample set are necessary to confirm our results. ",

Although analogous studies of rare nervous system tumors are needed, there are major barriers to performing such studies. Cross-species comparative oncogenomics, identifying driver mutations in mouse cancer models and validating them in human tumors, is a promising alternative. Although still in its infancy, this approach is being applied to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), rare Schwann cell-derived malignancies that occur sporadically, after radiotherapy, and in neurofibromatosis type 1. Studies of human neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors suggest that NF1 tumor suppressor loss in Schwann cells triggers cell-autonomous and intercellular changes, resulting in development of benign neurofibromas; subsequent neurofibroma-MPNST progression is caused by aberrant growth factor signaling and mutations affecting the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb and p19(ARF)-Mdm2-p53 cell cycle pathways. Mice with Nf1, Trp53, and/or Cdkn2a mutations that overexpress the Schwann cell mitogen neuregulin-1 or overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor validate observations in human tumors and, to various degrees, model human tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of MPNSTs arising in neuregulin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing mice and forward genetic screens with Sleeping Beauty transposons implicate additional signaling cascades in MPNST pathogenesis. These studies confirm the utility of mouse models for MPNST driver gene discovery and provide new insights into the complexity of MPNST pathogenesis. ",

Comprehensive molecular characterization of hemangiosarcoma may identify novel therapeutic targets and advanced clinical management strategies, but there are no published reports of tumor-associated genome instability and disrupted gene dosage in this cancer. We performed genome-wide microarray-based somatic DNA copy number profiling of 75 primary intra-abdominal hemangiosarcomas from five popular dog breeds that are highly predisposed to this disease. The cohort exhibited limited global genomic instability, compared to other canine sarcomas studied to date, and DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) were predominantly of low amplitude. Recurrent imbalances of several key cancer-associated genes were evident; however, the global penetrance of any single CNA was low and no distinct hallmark aberrations were evident. Copy number gains of dog chromosomes 13, 24, and 31, and loss of chromosome 16, were the most recurrent CNAs involving large chromosome regions, but their relative distribution within and between cases suggests they most likely represent passenger aberrations. CNAs involving CDKN2A, VEGFA, and the SKI oncogene were identified as potential driver aberrations of hemangiosarcoma development, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic modulation. CNA profiles were broadly conserved between the five breeds, although subregional variation was evident, including a near twofold lower incidence of VEGFA gain in Golden Retrievers versus other breeds (22 versus 40 %). These observations support prior transcriptional studies suggesting that the clinical heterogeneity of this cancer may reflect the existence of multiple, molecularly distinct subtypes of canine hemangiosarcoma.",

Folate has been suggested to play a role in the homeostasis of DNA methylation and has also been implicated in cancer chemotherapy. We investigated a possible role for folate in DNA methylation by measuring folate concentrations in tumors and adjacent normal tissues from 72 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. These were compared to DNA methylation levels and to clinicopathological features. Folate concentrations were determined as the sum of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. The MethyLight assay was used to quantitate methylation in promoter regions of P16(CDKN2A), APC, CDH13, RARB, RASSF1, RUNX3, and MYOD1. Methylation of LINE-1 repeats was used as a surrogate for global methylation. Folate levels in tumors correlated positively with LINE-1, CDH13, and RUNX3 methylation. Folate concentrations and methylation of LINE-1, RASSF1, and RUNX3 were significantly higher in adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Two sets of array-based data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus consistently showed that expression of FOLR1, a folate transport enzyme, and GGH, an enzyme that prevents folate retention, were higher and lower, respectively, in adenocarcinomas compared to SCC. This was independently validated by quantitative RT-PCR in 26 adenocarcinomas and 13 SCC. Our results suggest that folate metabolism plays a role in aberrant DNA methylation in NSCLC. The histological subtype differences in folate concentration and DNA methylation observed here were associated with distinct expression patterns for folate metabolizing enzymes. These findings may have clinical applications for histology-directed chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and anti-folates in NSCLC.",

We sought to decipher this heterogeneity by integrating matched genetic alterations and candidate cells of origin to generate accurate disease models. First, we identified subgroups of human ependymoma, a form of neural tumour that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Subgroup-specific alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma. To select cellular compartments most likely to give rise to subgroups of ependymoma, we matched the transcriptomes of human tumours to those of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), isolated from different regions of the CNS at different developmental stages, with an intact or deleted Ink4a/Arf locus (that encodes Cdkn2a and b). The transcriptome of human supratentorial ependymomas with amplified EPHB2 and deleted INK4A/ARF matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf(-/-) NSCs. Notably, activation of Ephb2 signalling in these, but not other, NSCs generated the first mouse model of ependymoma, which is highly penetrant and accurately models the histology and transcriptome of one subgroup of human supratentorial tumour. Further, comparative analysis of matched mouse and human tumours revealed selective deregulation in the expression and copy number of genes that control synaptogenesis, pinpointing disruption of this pathway as a critical event in the production of this ependymoma subgroup. Our data demonstrate the power of cross-species genomics to meticulously match subgroup-specific driver mutations with cellular compartments to model and interrogate cancer subgroups.",

LSDBs of cancer-related genes often serve as a critical resource to researchers, diagnostic laboratories, clinicians, and others in the cancer genetics community. LSDBs are poised to play an important role in disseminating clinical classification of variants. The IARC Working Group on Unclassified Genetic Variants has proposed a new system of five classes of variants in cancer susceptibility genes. However, standards are lacking for reporting and analyzing the multiple data types that assist in classifying variants. By adhering to standards of transparency and consistency in the curation and annotation of data, LSDBs can be critical for organizing our understanding of how genetic variation relates to disease. In this article we discuss how LSDBs can accomplish these goals, using existing databases for BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH2, MLH1, TP53, and CDKN2A to illustrate the progress and remaining challenges in this field. We recommend that: 1) LSDBs should only report a conclusion related to pathogenicity if a consensus has been reached by an expert panel. 2) The system used to classify variants should be standardized. The Working Group encourages use of the five class system described in this issue by Plon and colleagues. 3) Evidence that supports a conclusion should be reported in the database, including sources and criteria used for assignment. 4) Variants should only be classified as pathogenic if more than one type of evidence has been considered. 5) All instances of all variants should be recorded.",

Approximately 70% of global oesophageal cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases (>90%). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting in a 10% five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes, of which six are well known tumour-associated genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, NFE2L2), and two have not previously been described in ESCC (ADAM29 and FAM135B). Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene, and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes (MLL2 (also called KMT2D), ASH1L, MLL3 (KMT2C), SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300) are frequently altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms, and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic strategies for ESCC. ",

Inhibition of SIRT1 reactivates silenced genes, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach of targeted reversal of aberrantly silenced genes. In addition, SIRT1 may be involved in the well-known link between obesity, cellular energy balance and cancer. However, a comprehensive study of SIRT1 using human cancer tissue with clinical outcome data is currently lacking, and its prognostic significance is uncertain. Using the database of 485 colorectal cancers in two independent prospective cohort studies, we detected SIRT1 overexpression in 180 (37%) tumors by immunohistochemistry. We examined its relationship to the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), related molecular events, clinical features including body mass index, and patient survival. We quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) and eight other CpG islands (CHFR, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, p14, and WRN) by MethyLight. SIRT1 overexpression was associated with CIMP-high (> or =6 of 8 methylated CIMP-specific promoters, P=0.002) and microsatellite instability (MSI)-high phenotype (P<0.0001). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, SIRT1 overexpression was significantly associated with the CIMP-high MSI-high phenotype (multivariate odds ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-7.59; P=0.008). In addition, mucinous component (P=0.01), high tumor grade (P=0.02), and fatty acid synthase overexpression (P=0.04) were significantly associated with SIRT positivity in multivariate analysis.

The WRN helicase plays an important role in the maintenance of telomere function. WRN promoter methylation and gene silencing are common in colorectal cancer with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), which is associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and mucinous tumors. However, no study has examined the relationship between mucinous differentiation, WRN methylation, CIMP and MSI in colorectal cancer. Utilizing 903 population-based colorectal cancers and real-time PCR (MethyLight), we quantified DNA methylation in WRN and eight other promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1) known to be specific for CIMP. Supporting WRN as a good CIMP marker, WRN methylation was correlated well with CIMP-high diagnosis (> or =6/8 methylated promoters), demonstrating 89% sensitivity and 81% specificity. WRN methylation was associated with the presence of any mucinous component and > or =50% mucinous component (P<0.0001). Because both MSI and CIMP were associated with mucinous tumors and WRN methylation, we stratified tumors into 9 MSI/CIMP subtypes, to examine whether the relationship between WRN methylation and mucin still persisted. In each MSI/CIMP subtype, tumors with mucinous component were persistently more common in WRN-methylated tumors than WRN-unmethylated tumors (P=0.004). No relations of WRN methylation with other variables (age, sex, tumor location, poor differentiation, signet ring cells, lymphocytic reactions, KRAS, BRAF, p53, p21 or 18q loss of heterozygosity) persisted after tumors were stratified by CIMP status. In conclusion, WRN methylation is associated with mucinous differentiation independent of CIMP and MSI status. Our data suggest a possible role of WRN methylation in mucinous differentiation, and may provide explanation to the enigmatic association between mucin and MSI/CIMP.",

Only four of 31 probes (13%) investigated showed no difference in the numbers of positive samples using the different cut-offs.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization studies revealed deletions in the CDKN2A locus that include ARF and P16INK4A, both of which encode tumor suppressor proteins, in both human and mouse retinoblastoma. Through mouse genetic analyses, we found that Arf was the critical tumor suppressor gene in the deleted region. In mice, inactivation of one allele of Arf cooperated with Rb and p107 loss to rapidly accelerate retinoblastoma, with frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Arf locus. Arf has been reported to exhibit p53-independent tumor suppressor roles in other systems; however, our results showed no additive effect of p53 and Arf coinactivation in promoting retinoblastoma.

Our aim was to determine which gene is the major target in bladder cancer. We used quantitative real-time PCR (RTQ-PCR) to determine copy number of p15, of p14(ARF) exon 1beta, and p16 exon 2 in 22 tumor cell lines and 83 bladder tumors, some of which had been assessed previously by duplex PCR. Titration experiments showed that homozygous deletion could be detected in the presence of up to 30% normal DNA. Results for cell lines were compatible with previous cytogenetic analyses. Ten cell lines and 32 tumors (38.5%) had homozygous deletion of at least one target. Thirteen tumors (15.7%) had deletion of all three targets. Two tumors had deletion of p14(ARF) exon 1beta alone and four of p16 exon 2 alone. RTQ-PCR detected more homozygous deletions than duplex PCR. Finally we used a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification kit to provide independent confirmation of results. We conclude that with appropriate controls RTQ-PCR is a sensitive and robust method to detect copy number changes in tumors even in the presence of contaminating normal cell DNA.",

APEX consists of a sequencing reaction primed by an oligonucleotide anchored with its 5' end to a glass slide and terminating one nucleotide before the polymorphic site. The extension with one fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide complementary to the template reveals the polymorphism. Ninety-three SNPs in 42 genes were selected among those resequenced in the context of the SNP500 project, using a set of 102 reference DNA samples from the Coriell Biorepository. Selected SNPs belong to the following genes: ADH1B, ALDH2, APEX, CDKN2A, COMT, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, DRD2, DRD4, EPHX1, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC4, ERCC5, GRPR, GSTA4, GSTM3, GSTP1, GSTT2, LIG3, MDM2, MGMT, MPO, NAT1, NAT2, NQO1, OGG1, PCNA, POLB, SLC6A3, SOD2, TP53, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, and XRCC9.

We also observed widespread ncRNA correlation to concurrent TP53 and chromosome 3p loss, a compelling predictor of poor prognosis in HNSCCs. Three selected ncRNAs were additionally associated with tumor stage, HPV status, and other clinical characteristics, and modulation of their expression in vitro reveals differential regulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptotic response.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mitochondria are more than just the powerhouse of cells; they dictate if a cell dies or survives. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fusion and fission in response to environmental conditions. We showed previously that mitochondria of cells in a low oxygen environment (hypoxia) hyperfuse to form enlarged or highly interconnected networks with enhanced metabolic efficacy and resistance to apoptosis. Modifications to the appearance and metabolic capacity of mitochondria have been reported in cancer. However, the precise mechanisms regulating mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism in cancer are unknown. Since hypoxia plays a role in the generation of these abnormal mitochondria, we questioned if it modulates mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial outer-membrane voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is at center stage in regulating metabolism and apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that VDAC1 was post-translationally C-terminal cleaved not only in various hypoxic cancer cells but also in tumor tissues of patients with lung adenocarcinomas. Cells with enlarged mitochondria and cleaved VDAC1 were also more resistant to chemotherapy-stimulated cell death than normoxic cancer cells.;Transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) knocked out for Vdac1 highlighted alterations in not only cancer and inflammatory pathways but also in the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway in normoxia. HIF-1α was stable in normoxia due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decreased respiration and glycolysis and maintained basal apoptosis. However, in hypoxia, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in combination with maintenance of respiration and increased glycolysis counterbalanced the deleterious effects of enhanced ROS, thereby allowing Vdac1 (-/-) MEF to proliferate better than wild-type MEF in hypoxia. Allografts of RAS-transformed Vdac1 (-/-) MEF exhibited stabilization of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, blood vessel destabilization, and a strong inflammatory response. Moreover, expression of Cdkn2a, a HIF-1-target and tumor suppressor gene, was markedly decreased. Consequently, RAS-transformed Vdac1 (-/-) MEF tumors grew faster than wild-type MEF tumors.;Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells may be regulated by VDAC1 through vascular destabilization and inflammation. These findings provide new perspectives into the understanding of VDAC1 in the function of mitochondria not only in cancer but also in inflammatory diseases.",

Our investigation evaluates associations between active and passive smoking and TP53, KRAS2, and BRAF V600E mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI), and CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) in rectal tumors. We examine how genetic variants of GSTM1 and NAT2 alter these associations in a population-based, case-control study of 750 incident rectal cancer cases and 1,201 controls. Detailed tobacco exposure data were collected in an extensive questionnaire. DNA from blood was examined for GSTM1 and NAT2 variants. Tumor DNA was assessed to determine TP53 (exons 5-8), KRAS2 (codons 12-13) and BRAF mutations, MSI (BAT26 and TGFbetaRII analysis), and CIMP (methylation of CpG islands in CDKN2A, MLH1, MINT1, MINT2 and MINT31). Cigarette smoking (>20 pack-years, relative to nonsmokers) was associated with increased risk of TP53 mutations (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.02-2.0), BRAF mutations (OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.3-14.2) and MSI (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 1.1-29.8) in rectal tumors. Long-term environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure of >10 hr/wk was associated with increased risk of KRAS2 mutation (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.04-2.2). All smoking indicators were suggestive of increased risk in CIMP+ rectal cancer. GSTM1 and NAT2 were generally not associated with rectal tumor alterations; however, we observed an interaction of ETS and NAT2 in TP53-mutated tumors (p < 0.01). Our investigation shows active smoking is associated with increased risk of TP53, BRAF and MSI+ in rectal tumors and is suggestive of increased risk of CIMP+ tumors. ETS may increase risk of KRAS2 mutations; association with TP53 mutations and ETS may be influenced by NAT2.",

Development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, particularly for the most common subtype, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), has been hampered by controversies over the origin of the disease and a lack of spontaneous HGSC models to resolve this controversy. Over long-term culture in our laboratory, an ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cell line spontaneously transformed OSE (STOSE). The objective of this study was to determine if the STOSE cell line is a good model of HGSC. STOSE cells grow faster than early passage parental M0505 cells with a doubling time of 13 and 48 h, respectively. STOSE cells form colonies in soft agar, an activity for which M0505 cells have negligible capacity. Microarray analysis identified 1755 down-regulated genes and 1203 up-regulated genes in STOSE compared to M0505 cells, many associated with aberrant Wnt/β-catenin and Nf-κB signaling. Upregulation of Ccnd1 and loss of Cdkn2a in STOSE tumors is consistent with changes identified in human ovarian cancers by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Intraperitoneal injection of STOSE cells into severe combined immunodeficient and syngeneic FVB/N mice produced cytokeratin+, WT1+, inhibin-, and PAX8+ tumors, a histotype resembling human HGSC. Based on evidence that a SCA1+ stem cell-like population exists in M0505 cells, we examined a subpopulation of SCA1+ cells that is present in STOSE cells. Compared to SCA1- cells, SCA1+ STOSE cells have increased colony-forming capacity and form palpable tumors 8 days faster after intrabursal injection into FVB/N mice. This study has identified the STOSE cells as the first spontaneous murine model of HGSC and provides evidence for the OSE as a possible origin of HGSC. Furthermore, this model provides a novel opportunity to study how normal stem-like OSE cells may transform into tumor-initiating cells. ",

All reported trends were statistically significant, for instance, correlation of gene expression values for MKI67, CCNB1 and BIRC5. A model was proposed that employed mRNA concentrations for genes MKI67, CDKN2A, PGR and BAX. Prompt distinction between the norm and the cancer, provided by initial calculation, suggested that positive values of the function could indicate the higher individual risks. Indeed, all patients assigned to high risk by calculation were HPV infected and showed elevated viral E6, E7 mRNA concentration known to be associated with CC onset.;The research was concentrated on dynamical gene expression profiling upon pathological changes ultimately leading to CC.

However, other genetic abnormalities remain to be identified and molecular cytogenetics may be useful to detect chromosomal loci involved in recurrent rearrangements. We have used spectral karyotyping to characterize cytogenetic aberrations in a panel of 20 human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and confirmed their identities by dual and triple color fluorescence in situ hybridization. The most common partial or whole-arm gains involved 5p, 7q, 12p, 1q, 7p, 5q, 9p, 9q and 11p. The most common partial or whole-arm losses affected 9p, 11q, 18q, 3p, 2q and 1p, as well as the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes. Spectral karyotyping allowed us to identify a number of recurrent structural aberrations, all of them unbalanced: most frequently i(5)(p10), del(11)(q23), i(12)(p10), i(1)(q10), del(7)(q22) and del(10)(p11). Spectral karyotyping mapped the complex aberrations occurring in pancreatic cancer cell lines and identified non-random patterns of chromosomal rearrangement. This comprehensive characterization should be useful to direct future investigation. The observation that loss at 11q and gains at 5p with i(5)(p10) and 12p with i(12)(p10) are more frequent changes than previously reported would justify more intensive investigation of these chromosomal regions.",

In lung cancer, the RB1-CCND1-CDKN2A pathway, involved in the G1-S transition, is damaged in nearly all tumors. In the present study, we localized a novel amplicon in lung tumors to a fragment of less than 0.5 Mb at 12q13.3-q14.1 by using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on cDNA microarrays. This approach enabled us to identify 10-15 genes with the most consistent amplifications. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of 13 genes in this region showed that four of them (CDK4, CYP27B1, METTL1, and TSFM) were also highly up-regulated. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of 141 tumor samples on a tissue microarray showed that CDK4 was expressed at a high level in 23% of lung tumors. Six (21.4%) of the tumors with high CDK4 expression (n = 28) were shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to contain the 12q13.3-q14.1 amplification. For CDK4, a positive correlation was found between gene copy number (FISH and CGH array), mRNA expression (RT-PCR), and level of protein expression (IHC). CDK4 expression did not correlate with CDKN2A methylation status. Amplification of CDK4 has been described in other tumor types, but its role in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. Although CDK4 amplification seems to be a relatively rare event (4.3%) in lung tumors, it indicates the significance of the RB1-CCND1 pathway in lung tumorigenesis.",

We used cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and structural equation modeling (SEM), a novel strategy, to decipher the correlation structure of CpG island hypermethylation. Using a database of 861 colon and rectal cancers, DNA methylation at 16 CpG islands [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16/ink4a), CHFR, CRABP1, HIC1, IGF2, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT-1, MINT-31, MLH1, NEUROG1, p14 (CDKN2A/arf), RUNX3, SOCS1, and WRN] was quantified by real-time PCR.

Tumors with mutant KRAS/BRAF (N = 6) were excluded. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, all but six markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, RUNX3, MGMT, MINT-1, and SOCS1) were differentially clustered with CIMP-high and CIMP-low according to KRAS and BRAF status. In SEM, the correlation structures between CIMP, locus-specific CpG island methylation, and MSI differed according to KRAS and BRAF status, which was consistent with PCA results.

Univariable and multivariable competing risk modelling was performed to identify whether DNMT expression was associated with local disease recurrence or disease morbidity.;Over-expression of DNMT3A in the invasive component of the tumour was seen in 44% of tumours and was associated with an increased risk of local vulvar recurrence (LVR) (HR=4.51, p=0.012).

In a subset analysis, over-expression of DNMT3A was found to be significantly more common in VSCCs that stained negative for CDKN2A.;These observations are consistent with the possibility that epigenetic changes contribute to vulvar neoplasia and DNMT3A over-expression may be useful in predicting local disease recurrence.",

Methylation status was considered as a dichotomous variable and genes showing methylation ≥20% were defined as \"positive\".;Methylation frequencies were higher in non recurring than recurring tumors. A statistically significant difference was observed for HIC1 (P = 0.03), GSTP1 (P = 0.02) and RASSF1 (P = 0.03). The combination of the three genes showed 78% sensitivity and 66% specificity in identifying recurrent patients, with an overall accuracy of 72%.;Our preliminary data suggest a potential role of HIC1, GSTP1 and RASSF1 in predicting local recurrence in NMIBC. Such information could help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of recurrence who require close monitoring during follow up.",

The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%) were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway (n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A, CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1, MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively). In conclusion, genomic alterations are common in advanced HCC. Refractory patients with alterations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway demonstrated early signals of clinical activity when treated with therapies targeting mTOR. ",

Despite numerous studies reporting the results of ancillary marker investigations in PTs, the current histological grading systems remain unreliable at predicting clinical outcome even when supplemented by these markers. As a consequence, there has been much interest in the prospect of using molecular/genetic techniques to develop a more robust \"grading\" system. This review focuses on recent cytogenetic and molecular studies investigating the pathogenesis of PTs and those correlating molecular findings with clinicopathological features of the tumours. Recent data highlight that intratumoural genetic heterogeneity is common in PTs and may account for the reported lack of correlation between histological grading and clinical behaviour. The entire spectrum of molecular aberrations in PTs are yet to be fully defined, however recent array-based studies using comparative genomic hybridisation have reported that copy number changes increase with the progression from benign PT to malignancy. Tumour recurrence and progression is likely to reflect the presence of under-recognised subclones. p(16INK4a) (CDKN2A) inactivation also appears to be important in PT pathogenesis. Further additional studies will be required to identify and validate new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in order to improve the diagnosis, classification, prediction of outcome and management of patients with this rare neoplasm. Data generated from modern sequencing technologies are likely to provide new insights into the disease and assist in this endeavour.",

Genome-wide hypomethylation may also play an important role in genomic instability. However, the relation between global DNA methylation level and methylation in individual CpG islands remains uncertain. Utilizing 869 population-based colorectal cancers, we measured long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation level by Pyrosequencing, which correlates with global DNA methylation level. We quantified DNA methylation in 8 CIMP-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1) by real-time PCR (MethyLight technology). LINE-1 methylation levels in tumors were approximately normally distributed (mean, 61.4%; median, 62.3%; standard deviation, 9.6%). Among the 869 tumors, 128 (15%) were classified as CIMP-high (>or=6/8 methylated promoters). The mean LINE-1 methylation level was higher in CIMP-high tumors (65.1%, p < 0.0001) than non-CIMP-high tumors (60.7%), and higher in MSI-high tumors (64.7%, p < 0.0001) than non-MSI-high tumors (60.7%). When tumors were stratified by MSI/CIMP status, compared to non-MSI-high non-CIMP-high tumors (mean LINE-1 methylation level, 60.4%), the mean LINE-1 methylation level was higher in MSI-high CIMP-high (64.8%, p < 0.0001), MSI-high non-CIMP-high (64.6%, p = 0.03) and non-MSI-high CIMP-high tumors (66.1%, p = 0.0003). In addition, 18q loss of heterozygosity in non-MSI-high tumors was correlated with LINE-1 hypomethylation (p = 0.004). In conclusion, both CIMP-high and MSI-high are inversely associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation, suggesting that CIMP/MSI and genomic hypomethylation may represent different pathways to colorectal cancer.

The DNA repair genes are the best candidates for caretaker genes as exemplified by the human hereditary xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) syndrome. Cultured XP cells are hypermutable after UVB irradiation. This increased mutation frequency is also found in gatekeeper genes, which govern signalling pathways implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival of human epidermal keratinocytes. We describe and discuss the role of mutated gatekeeper genes in five specific signalling pathways which have been implicated in skin carcinogenesis. The pathways we focus on in this review are: (i) P16(INK4A)-CDK4/6-RB; (ii) P14(ARF)-HDM2-P53; (iii) Sonic hedgehog (SHH)/GLI; (iv) WNT/beta-catenin; and (v) Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/SMAD. 70-80% of XP skin cancers exhibit one or several mutations in the P53, PTCH-1, SMO or CDKN2A genes, the type and frequency of mutated genes being different between squamous cell (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). In XP cancers, the typically UVB-induced CC to TT tandem transitions represent approximately 60% of total mutations compared to 10-15% in skin tumours from DNA repair-proficient patients. Acquired activation of the pathways described herein can alter proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, allowing a damaged cell to replicate and give rise to mutated daughter cells, then eventually to the development of the carcinogenic process following clonal selection.",

RUNX3, GATA6, and p16INK4A were methylated to a lesser extent, whereas ATM and RARβ were found to be methylated in a marginal number of patients. The ERCC1, hMLH1, NDRG2, and PTEN genes were unmethylated in all cases. Although tumors of the same grade according to WHO criteria had different genes methylated, the number of methylated genes for each individual patient was low. RUNX3 methylation significantly correlated with meningioma WHO grade, therefore, can be considered as a potential indicator of tumor aggressiveness. The sequence of NDRG2 chosen for PSQ analysis was found methylated in the majority of meningiomas; however, the methylation level was only slightly elevated as compared to non-cancerous brain.;Overall, the results of this study confirm that DNA methylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of meningiomas.

Recently, these two epigenetic processes have been dynamically linked. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 appears to reside in a complex with histone deacetylase activity. MeCP2 can mediate formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin on methylated promoter templates in vitro, and this process can be reversed by trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase. Little is known, however, about the relative roles of methylation and histone deacetylase activity in the stable inhibition of transcription on densely methylated endogenous promoters, such as those for silenced alleles of imprinted genes, genes on the female inactive X chromosome and tumour-suppressor genes inactivated in cancer cells. We show here that the hypermethylated genes MLH1, TIMP3 (TIMP3), CDKN2B (INK4B, p15) and CDKN2A (INK4, p16) cannot be transcriptionally reactivated with TSA alone in tumour cells in which we have shown that TSA alone can upregulate the expression of non-methylated genes. Following minimal demethylation and slight gene reactivation in the presence of low dose 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC), however, TSA treatment results in robust re-expression of each gene. TSA does not contribute to demethylation of the genes, and none of the treatments alter the chromatin structure associated with the hypermethylated promoters. Thus, although DNA methylation and histone deacetylation appear to act as synergistic layers for the silencing of genes in cancer, dense CpG island methylation is dominant for the stable maintenance of a silent state at these loci.",

In particular detection of homozygous deletions (HDs) is easier using these pure populations of cancer cells. Identification of HDs could potentially lead to the subsequent identification of new tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) involved in esophageal adenocarcinogenesis. Genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to identify HDs in 10 verified EAC cell lines and nine EAC xenografts. In total, 61 HDs (range 1-6 per sample) were detected and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Besides HDs observed in common fragile genomic regions (n = 26), and gene deserts (n = 8), 27 HDs were located in gene-containing regions. HDs were noted for known TSGs, including CDKN2A, SMAD4 and CDH3/CDH1. Twenty-two new chromosomal regions were detected harboring potentially new TSGs involved in EAC carcinogenesis. Two of these regions of homozygous loss, encompassing the ITGAV and RUNX1 gene, were detected in multiple samples indicating a potential role in the carcinogenesis of EAC. To exclude culturing artifacts, these last two deletions were confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the primary tumors of which the involved cell lines and xenografts were derived.

In this study, we combined statistical analyses and computational modeling to explain patterns of genetic alterations seen in 178 patients with bladder tumors (either muscle-invasive or non-muscle-invasive). A statistical analysis on frequently altered genes identified pair associations, including co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity. Focusing on genetic alterations of protein-coding genes involved in growth factor receptor signaling, cell cycle, and apoptosis entry, we complemented this analysis with a literature search to focus on nine pairs of genetic alterations of our dataset, with subsequent verification in three other datasets available publicly. To understand the reasons and contexts of these patterns of associations while accounting for the dynamics of associated signaling pathways, we built a logical model. This model was validated first on published mutant mice data, then used to study patterns and to draw conclusions on counter-intuitive observations, allowing one to formulate predictions about conditions where combining genetic alterations benefits tumorigenesis. For example, while CDKN2A homozygous deletions occur in a context of FGFR3-activating mutations, our model suggests that additional PIK3CA mutation or p21CIP deletion would greatly favor invasiveness. Furthermore, the model sheds light on the temporal orders of gene alterations, for example, showing how mutual exclusivity of FGFR3 and TP53 mutations is interpretable if FGFR3 is mutated first. Overall, our work shows how to predict combinations of the major gene alterations leading to invasiveness through two main progression pathways in bladder cancer.",

Promoter hypermethylation is widely recognized as a mechanism in the progression of HNSCC, but the extent to which this mechanism is consistent between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors is unknown. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HPV-induced and carcinogen-induced cancers, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in HPV(+) and HPV(-) SCC cell lines. We used two platforms: the Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadArray and tiling arrays, and confirmed illustrative examples with pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. These analyses indicate that HPV(+) cell lines have higher DNA methylation in genic and LINE-1 regions than HPV(-) cell lines. Differentially methylated loci between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines significantly correlated with HPV-typed HNSCC primary tumor DNA methylation levels. Novel findings include higher promoter methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes in HPV(+) cells compared to HPV(-) cells and increased expression of DNMT3A in HPV(+) cells. Additionally, CDKN2A and KRT8 were identified as interaction hubs among genes with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(-) cells. Conversely, RUNX2, IRS-1 and CCNA1 were major hubs with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(+) cells.

Pathogenesis involves upregulation of D-type cyclins and activation of oncogenes, but little is known about the role of tumor suppressor genes. Gene hypermethylation is an alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Various approaches have been used to elucidate the role of gene hypermethylation in MM, including a candidate gene approach, microarray approach for genes upregulated by hypomethylating agents, and a cancer pathway approach, which enables a comprehensive picture of the involvement of multiple tumor suppressor genes in MM. Based on the cancer pathway approach, the following data on the involvement of cell cycle control, intrinsic tumor suppressor, and cell signaling were derived. First, among the INK4 and CIP/KIP families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, only CDKN2B and CDKN2A are frequently hypermethylated. Second, methylation of SHP1 and soluble Wnt inhibitors is associated with constitutive activation of JAK/STAT and Wnt signaling. Importantly, downregulation of the signaling pathways can be restored by demethylation and re-expression of SHP1 and soluble Wnt inhibitors, which is potentially important therapeutically. Third, of the tumor suppressor genes involved in the DAPK/P14/HDM2/P53/Apaf-1 pathway, only DAPK is frequently methylated, which appeared to be an adverse prognostic factor to survival. Lastly, apart from being implicated in the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance to MM, aberrant gene promoter methylation might also account for late disease progression in MM. Future studies are needed to delineate the biologic consequence of gene hypermethylation, the prognostic effect of gene methylation, and the possibility of hypomethylation therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant mesotheliomas are highly aggressive tumors usually caused by exposure to asbestos. Germline-inactivating mutations of BAP1 predispose to mesothelioma and certain other cancers. However, why mesothelioma is the predominate malignancy in some BAP1 families and not others, and whether exposure to asbestos is required for development of mesothelioma in BAP1 mutation carriers are not known. To address these questions experimentally, we generated a Bap1(+/-) knockout mouse model to assess its susceptibility to mesothelioma upon chronic exposure to asbestos. Bap1(+/-) mice exhibited a significantly higher incidence of asbestos-induced mesothelioma than wild-type (WT) littermates (73% vs. 32%, respectively). Furthermore, mesotheliomas arose at an accelerated rate in Bap1(+/-) mice than in WT animals (median survival, 43 weeks vs. 55 weeks after initial exposure, respectively) and showed increased invasiveness and proliferation. No spontaneous mesotheliomas were seen in unexposed Bap1(+/-) mice followed for up to 87 weeks of age. Mesothelioma cells from Bap1(+/-) mice showed biallelic inactivation of Bap1, consistent with its proposed role as a recessive cancer susceptibility gene. Unlike in WT mice, mesotheliomas from Bap1(+/-) mice did not require homozygous loss of Cdkn2a. However, normal mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cells from Bap1(+/-) mice showed downregulation of Rb through a p16(Ink4a)-independent mechanism, suggesting that predisposition of Bap1(+/-) mice to mesothelioma may be facilitated, in part, by cooperation between Bap1 and Rb. Drawing parallels to human disease, these unbiased genetic findings indicate that BAP1 mutation carriers are predisposed to the tumorigenic effects of asbestos and suggest that high penetrance of mesothelioma requires such environmental exposure.",

DNA methylation alterations have been linked to various carcinomas in different populations. Aberrant CpG island methylation of genes has been recognized in HCC, information is limited for hepatitis virus-related hepatocarcinogenesis. HCC risk has not previously been associated with gene-specific DNA methylation in India. Promoter region methylation of a panel of six tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDH1, GSTP1, SOCS1, and APC) and three oncogenes (MYC, HRAS, and KRAS) was determined by methylation-specific PCR among 23 HCC samples and 20 control hepatitis samples. CDKN2B methylation frequency in HCC was double that for hepatitis, and methylation allele density of APC, GSTP1, and CDKN2B increased 2.2-, 2.3-, and 7.6-fold, respectively. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes starts during viral infection and progresses toward HCC with the chronicity of the disease. Findings of altered methylation status support involvement of these tumor suppressor genes in HCC. MYC showed decreased methylation in HCC, relative to hepatitis. These observations on DNA methylation suggest the involvement of CDKN2B, SOCS1, CDH1, GSTP1, and MYC in pathogenesis of HCC in India and implicate altered DNA methylation in the molecular pathogenesis.",

In order to elucidate biological relevance of the aberrations and their mutual relations, we performed whole-genome sequencing, RNA-Seq, bisulfite sequencing and ChIP-Seq of 26 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. The collected multi-omics data allowed us to associate an average of 536 coding mutations and 13,573 mutations in promoter or enhancer regions with aberrant transcriptional regulations. We detected the 385 splice site mutations and 552 chromosomal rearrangements, representative cases of which were validated to cause aberrant transcripts. Averages of 61, 217, 3687 and 3112 mutations are located in the regulatory regions which showed differential DNA methylation, H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks, respectively. We detected distinct patterns of aberrations in transcriptional regulations depending on genes. We found that the irregular histone marks were characteristic to EGFR and CDKN1A, while a large genomic deletion and hyper-DNA methylation were most frequent for CDKN2A. We also used the multi-omics data to classify the cell lines regarding their hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Our datasets should provide a valuable foundation for biological interpretations of interlaced genomic and epigenomic aberrations. ",

Given that elevated expression levels of PRMT6 have been reported in various cancer types, we explore here its role in cell proliferation and senescence. We find that knockdown of PRMT6 results in proliferation defects of transformed as well as non-transformed cells, causes G1-phase arrest and induces senescence. This phenotype is accompanied by transcriptional upregulation of important cell cycle regulators, most prominently the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor gene p21 (p21(CIP1/WAF1), CDKN1A) and p16 (p16(INK4A), CDKN2A). Chromatin immuno-precipitation analysis reveals that the p21 gene is a direct target of PRMT6 and the corresponding histone mark H3 R2me2a. Using a cell model of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), in which p21 is an essential activator of the senescent phenotype, we show that PRMT6 expression declines upon induction of senescence and conversely p21 gene expression increases. Moreover, overexpression of PRMT6 leads to reduced levels of OIS. These findings indicate that the transcriptional repressor activity of PRMT6 facilitates cell proliferation and blocks senescence by regulation of tumor suppressor genes and that this might contribute to the oncogenic capacity of PRMT6.",

Whereas the cellular heterogeneity of NF1-associated tumors has been well studied, the molecular heterogeneity of MPNSTs is still poorly understood. Mutational heterogeneity within these malignant tumors greatly complicates the study of the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis. We have explored this molecular heterogeneity by performing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the NF1, TP53, RB1, PTEN, and CDKN2A genes on sections of 10 MPNSTs derived from 10 unrelated NF1 patients. LOH data for the TP53 gene was found to correlate with the results of p53 immunohistochemical analysis in the same tumor sections. Further, approximately 70% of MPNSTs were found to display intra-tumoral molecular heterogeneity as evidenced by differences in the level of LOH between different sections of the same tumor samples. This study constitutes the first systematic analysis of molecular heterogeneity within MPNSTs derived from NF1 patients. Appreciation of the existence of molecular heterogeneity in NF1-associated tumors is important not only for optimizing somatic mutation detection, but also for understanding the mechanisms of NF1 tumorigenesis, a prerequisite for the development of specifically targeted cancer therapeutics.",

Mutant IDH1 accelerated cell-cycle transition through repression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b, and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. By computational screening, we identified an inhibitor of mutant IDH1, which inhibited mutant IDH1 cells and lowered 2HG levels in vitro, and efficiently blocked colony formation of AML cells from IDH1-mutated patients but not of normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells.

Recently, it has become increasingly clear that genetic lesions driving tumorigenesis frequently occur at the submicroscopic level and, consequently, escape standard cytogenetic observations. Therefore, we profiled the genomes of 40 childhood ALLs at high resolution. We detected multiple de novo genetic lesions, including gross aneuploidies and segmental gains and losses, some of which were subtle and affected single genes. Many of these lesions involved recurrent (partially) overlapping deletions and duplications, containing various established leukemia-associated genes, such as ETV6, RUNX1 and MLL. Importantly, the most frequently affected genes were those controlling G1/S cell cycle progression (e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN1B and RB1), followed by genes associated with B-cell development. The latter group includes microdeletions of the B-lineage transcription factors PAX5, EBF, E2-2 and IKZF1 (Ikaros), as well as genes with other established roles in B-cell development, that is RAG1 and RAG2, FYN, PBEF1 or CBP/PAG.

Currently, little is known about the effect of age and caloric restriction (CR) on adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). This is important for three reasons: firstly, age and CR cause extensive remodeling of WAT; it is currently unknown how this remodeling affects the resident stem cell population. Secondly, stem cell senescence has been theorized as one of the causes of aging and could reduce the utility of a stem cell as a reagent. Thirdly, the mechanism by which CR extends lifespan is currently not known, one theory postulates that CR maintains the resident stem cell population in youthful \"fit\" state. For the purpose of this study, we define ASC as lineage negative (lin(-))/CD34(+(low))/CD31(-). We show that aging increases the abundance of ASC and the expression of Cdkn2a 9.8-fold and Isl1 60.6-fold. This would suggest that aging causes an accumulation of non-replicative ASC. CR reduced the percentage of ASC in the lin(-) SVF while also reducing colony forming ability.

Three ATCs harbored the common BRAF mutation V600E.

However, the mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR activates the expression of genes is not completely understood. Here, we report that the pRb pocket proteins pRb, p107, and p130 were degraded in various cancer cell lines in response to 5-aza-CdR treatment, and this effect was dependent on the proteasome pathway. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) played a critical role in this 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation of pRb. Furthermore, PP2A phosphatase-induced MDM2 dephosphorylation at S260 was found to be essential for MDM2 binding to pRb in the presence of 5-aza-CdR. pRb degradation resulted in the significant reexpression of several genes, including methylated CDKN2A, RASFF1A, and unmethylated CDKN2D. Finally, knockdown of pRb pocket proteins by either RNAi or 5-aza-CdR treatment induced a significant decrease in the recruitment of SUV39H1 and an increase in the enrichment of KDM3B and KDM4A to histones around the promoter of RASFF1A and thus reduced H3K9 di- and trimethylation, by which RASFF1A expression is activated. Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR induces the expression of both methylated and unmethylated genes by degrading pRb pocket proteins.",

To better understand the importance of RB1 activity in HPV-negative SCCHN, we investigated the prognostic value of inhibitory CDK4/6 phosphorylation of RB1 on threonine 356 (T356) in archival HPV-negative tumor specimens from patients who underwent surgical resection and adjuvant radiation. We benchmarked pT356RB1 to total RB1, Ki67, pT202/Y204ERK1/2, and TP53, as quantified by automatic quantitative analysis (AQUA), and correlated protein expression with tumor stage and grade. High expression of pT356RB1 but not total RB1 predicted reduced overall survival (OS; P = 0.0295), indicating the potential relevance of post-translational phosphorylation. Paired analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data for regulators of this RB1 phosphorylation identified loss or truncating mutation of negative regulator CDKN2A (p16) and elevated expression of the CDK4/6 activator CCND1 (cyclin D) as also predicting poor survival. Given that CDK4/6 inhibitors have been most effective in the context of functional RB1 and low expression or deletion of p16 in other tumor types, these data suggest such agents may merit evaluation in HPV-negative SCCHN, specifically in cases associated with high pT356RB1.

Seventy-six percent of cases showed genomic aberrations. The most common imbalances were gains of 7q33.3q35 followed by 17q21.1, 8q24.21, 9q34qter, and 10p14 and losses of 9p21.3 followed by 9q31.2, 17p13.1, 13q14.11, 6q21.3, 10p11.22, 16q23.2, and 16q24.3. Three specific chromosomal regions, 9p21.3, 8q24.21, and 10q26qter, were defined as prognostic markers showing a significant correlation with overall survival (OS) (P=0.042, 0.017, and 0.022, respectively). Moreover, we have established two MFt genomic subgroups distinguishing a stable group (0-5 DNA aberrations) and an unstable group (>5 DNA aberrations), showing that the genomic unstable group had a shorter OS (P=0.05). We therefore conclude that specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as gains of 8q24.21 (MYC) and losses of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP) and 10q26qter (MGMT and EBF3) may have an important role in prognosis.

Epigenetic studies of this model have thus far been limited to the DNA methylation analysis of a few genes. In this study, we analyzed a panel of 20 genes using a quantitative, high-throughput methylation assay, METHYLIGHT: We used this broader approach to gain insight into concordant methylation behavior between genes and to generate epigenomic fingerprints for the different histological stages of EAC. Our study included a total of 104 tissue specimens from 51 patients with different stages of Barrett's esophagus and/or associated adenocarcinoma. We screened 84 of these samples with the full panel of 20 genes and found distinct classes of methylation patterns in the different types of tissue. The most informative genes were those with an intermediate frequency of significant hypermethylation [ranging from 15% (CDKN2A) to 60% (MGMT) of the samples]. This group could be further subdivided into three classes, according to the absence (CDKN2A, ESR1, and MYOD1) or presence (CALCA, MGMT, and TIMP3) of methylation in normal esophageal mucosa and stomach, or the infrequent methylation of normal esophageal mucosa accompanied by methylation in all normal stomach samples (APC). The other genes were less informative, because the frequency of hypermethylation was below 5% (ARF, CDH1, CDKN2B, GSTP1, MLH1, PTGS2, and THBS1), completely absent (CTNNB1, RB1, TGFBR2, and TYMS1), or ubiquitous (HIC1 and MTHFR), regardless of tissue type. Each class undergoes unique epigenetic changes at different steps of disease progression of EAC, suggesting a step-wise loss of multiple protective barriers against CpG island hypermethylation. The aberrant hypermethylation occurs at many different loci in the same tissues, suggestive of an overall deregulation of methylation control in EAC tumorigenesis. However, we did not find evidence for a distinct group of tumors with a CpG island methylator phenotype. Finally, we found that normal and metaplastic tissues from patients with evidence of associated dysplasia or cancer had a significantly higher incidence of hypermethylation than similar tissues from patients with no further progression of their disease. The fact that the samples from these two groups of patients were histologically indistinguishable, yet molecularly distinct, suggests that the occurrence of such hypermethylation may provide a clinical tool to identify patients with premalignant Barrett's who are at risk for further progression.",

To determine the early molecular alterations induced by (S)-NNN in the oral and esophageal mucosa, we administered the carcinogen to rats in the drinking water for 10 wk and global gene expression alterations were analyzed by RNA sequencing. At a false discovery rate P-value < 0.05 and fold-change ≥2, we found alterations in the level of 39 genes in the oral cavity and 69 genes in the esophagus. Validation of RNA sequencing results by qRT-PCR assays revealed a high cross-platform concordance. The most significant impact of exposure to (S)-NNN was alteration of genes involved in immune regulation (Aire, Ctla4, and CD80), inflammation (Ephx2 and Inpp5d) and cancer (Cdkn2a, Dhh, Fetub B, Inpp5d, Ly6E, Nr1d1, and Wnt6). Consistent with the findings in rat tissues, most of the genes were deregulated, albeit to different degrees, in immortalized oral keratinocytes treated with (S)-NNN and in non-treated premalignant oral cells and malignant oral and head and neck squamous cells. Furthermore, interrogation of TCGA data sets showed that genes deregulated by (S)-NNN in rat tissues (Fetub, Ly6e, Nr1d1, Cacna1c, Cd80, and Dgkg) are also altered in esophageal and head and neck tumors. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into early molecular changes induced by (S)-NNN and, therefore, could contribute to the development of biomarkers for the early detection and prevention of (S)-NNN-associated oral and esophageal cancers. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Mutations and copy-number aberrations were determined and results validated with a secondary method.;The overall mutational burden in HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC was similar with an average of 15.2 versus 14.4 somatic exonic mutations in the targeted cancer-associated genes. HPV-negative tumors showed a mutational spectrum concordant with published lung squamous cell carcinoma analyses with enrichment for mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, MLL2, CUL3, NSD1, PIK3CA, and NOTCH genes. HPV-positive tumors showed unique mutations in DDX3X, FGFR2/3 and aberrations in PIK3CA, KRAS, MLL2/3, and NOTCH1 were enriched in HPV-positive tumors. Currently targetable genomic alterations were identified in FGFR1, DDR2, EGFR, FGFR2/3, EPHA2, and PIK3CA. EGFR, CCND1, and FGFR1 amplifications occurred in HPV-negative tumors, whereas 17.6% of HPV-positive tumors harbored mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (FGFR2/3), including six recurrent FGFR3 S249C mutations. HPV-positive tumors showed a 5.8% incidence of KRAS mutations, and DNA-repair gene aberrations, including 7.8% BRCA1/2 mutations, were identified.;The mutational makeup of HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC differs significantly, including targetable genes.

As a consequence, testing for DNA methylation biomarkers in plasma or other body fluids shows great promise for detection of malignancies at early stages and/or for monitoring response to treatment. However, DNA from normal leukocytes may contribute to the DNA in plasma and will affect biomarker specificity if there is any methylation in the leukocytes. DNA from 48 samples of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated for the presence of methylation of a panel of DNA methylation biomarkers that have been implicated in cancer. SMART-MSP, a methylation specific PCR (MSP) methodology based on real time PCR amplification, high-resolution melting and strategic primer design, enabled quantitative detection of low levels of methylated DNA. Methylation was observed in all tested mononuclear cell DNA samples for the CDH1 and HIC1 promoters and in majority of DNA samples for the TWIST1 and DAPK1 promoters. APC and RARB promoter methylation, at a lower average level, was also detected in a substantial proportion of DNA samples. We found no BRCA1, CDKN2A, GSTP1 and RASSF1A promoter methylation in this sample set. Several individuals had higher levels of methylation at several loci suggestive of a methylator phenotype. In conclusion, methylation of many potential DNA methylation biomarkers can be detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and is likely to affect their specificity for detecting low level disease.

Functional classification of these mutated genes suggested that alterations in pathways participating in chromatin remodeling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and oxidative stress play critical roles in HCC tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, because there are few druggable genes used in HCC therapy, the identification of new therapeutic targets through integrated genomic approaches remains an important task. Because a large amount of HCC genomic data genotyped by high density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is deposited in the public domain, copy number alteration (CNA) analyses of these arrays is a cost-effective way to reveal target genes through profiling of recurrent and overlapping amplicons, homozygous deletions and potentially unbalanced chromosomal translocations accumulated during HCC progression. Moreover, integration of CNAs with other high-throughput genomic data, such as aberrantly coding transcriptomes and non-coding gene expression in human HCC tissues and rodent HCC models, provides lines of evidence that can be used to facilitate the identification of novel HCC target genes with the potential of improving the survival of HCC patients.

These methyltransferases are ideal therapeutic targets due to their frequent hyperactive mutations and overexpression found in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we characterized a set of small molecules that allow pharmacologic manipulation of EZH2 and EZH1, which include UNC1999, a selective inhibitor of both enzymes, and UNC2400, an inactive analog compound useful for assessment of off-target effect. UNC1999 suppresses global H3K27 trimethylation/dimethylation (H3K27me3/2) and inhibits growth of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia cells. UNC1999-induced transcriptome alterations overlap those following knockdown of embryonic ectoderm development, a common cofactor of EZH2 and EZH1, demonstrating UNC1999's on-target inhibition. Mechanistically, UNC1999 preferentially affects distal regulatory elements such as enhancers, leading to derepression of polycomb targets including Cdkn2a. Gene derepression correlates with a decrease in H3K27me3 and concurrent gain in H3K27 acetylation. UNC2400 does not induce such effects. Oral administration of UNC1999 prolongs survival of a well-defined murine leukemia model bearing MLL-AF9. Collectively, our study provides the detailed profiling for a set of chemicals to manipulate EZH2 and EZH1 and establishes specific enzymatic inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-EZH2 and PRC2-EZH1 by small-molecule compounds as a novel therapeutics for MLL-rearranged leukemia.

Heparanase, an enzyme expressed by multiple cell types, including tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, has been implicated in angiogenesis and metastasis, and its expression correlates with decreased overall survival in PDAC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PG545, an angiogenesis and heparanase inhibitor, in experimental PDAC. PG545 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Heparanase inhibition also reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts but had only modest effects on endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, PG545 significantly prolonged animal survival in intraperitoneal and genetic models (mPDAC: LSL-Kras(G12D); Cdkn2a(lox/lox); p48(Cre)) of PDAC. PG545 also inhibited primary tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic and genetic endpoint studies. Analysis of tumor tissue revealed that PG545 significantly decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced microvessel density, disrupted vascular function, and elevated intratumoral hypoxia. Elevated hypoxia is a known driver of collagen deposition and tumor progression; however, tumors from PG545-treated animals displayed reduced collagen deposition and a greater degree of differentiation compared with control or gemcitabine-treated tumors. These results highlight the potent antitumor activity of PG545 and support the further exploration of heparanase inhibitors as a potential clinical strategy for the treatment of PDAC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The observation that the age-specific incidence curve of many carcinomas is approximately linear on a double logarithmic plot has led to much speculation regarding the number and nature of the critical events involved in carcinogenesis. By a consideration of colorectal and pancreatic cancers in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry we show that the log-log model provides a poor description of the data, and that a much better description is provided by a multistage model that predicts two basic phases in the age-specific incidence curves, a first exponential phase until the age of approximately 60 followed by a linear phase after that age. These two phases in the incidence curve reflect two phases in the process of carcinogenesis. Paradoxically, the early-exponential phase reflects events between the formation (initiation) of premalignant clones in a tissue and the clinical detection of a malignant tumor, whereas the linear phase reflects events leading to initiated cells that give rise to premalignant lesions because of abrogated growth/differentiation control. This model is consistent with Knudson's idea that renewal tissue, such as the colon, is converted into growing tissue before malignant transformation. The linear phase of the age-specific incidence curve represents this conversion, which is the result of recessive inactivation of a gatekeeper gene, such as the APC gene in the colon and the CDKN2A gene in the pancreas.",

Despite the progress in glioblastoma cell culturing, the cells isolated from the majority of specimens cannot be propagated infinitely in vitro. The aim of this study was to identify the processes responsible for the stabilization failure. Therefore, we analyzed 56 primary GB cultures, 7 of which were stabilized. Our results indicate that senescence is primarily responsible for the glioblastoma cell line stabilization failure, while mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis play a minor role. Moreover, a new technical approach allowed for a more profound analysis of the senescent cells in primary cultures, including the distinction between tumor and normal cells. In addition, we observed that glioblastoma cells in primary cultures have a varied potential to undergo spontaneous in vitro senescence, which is often higher than that of the normal cells infiltrating the tumor. Thus, this is the first report of GB cells in primary cell cultures (including both monolayer and spheroid conditions) rapidly and spontaneously becoming senescent. Intriguingly, our data also suggest that nearly half of GB cell lines have a combination of TP53 mutation and CDKN2A homozygous deletion, which are considered as mutually exclusive in glioblastoma. Moreover, recognition of the mechanisms of senescence and mitotic catastrophe in glioblastoma cells may be a step towards a potential new therapeutic approach. ",

Based on these findings and the previous implication of multiple melanoma tumor suppressor(s) in 11q, including the MEN1 region, we have investigated the involvement of the MEN1 gene in melanoma tumorigenesis. Mutation analysis was performed on a panel of 39 sporadic metastatic melanomas, 13 melanoma cell lines and 20 melanoma families without CDKN2A or CDK4 germline mutations. In addition, 19 sporadic metastatic tumors were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 11q13. LOH was detected in 6 tumors (32%), and in 4 of the tumors the pattern of LOH suggested that the deletion included the MEN1 gene locus. A novel somatic nonsense mutation in exon 7 (Q349X) was identified in 1 sporadic tumor which also showed loss of the wild-type allele.

In this study, we observed that methylation analysis of exon 1 alpha gave false positive results in three samples of normal rat mammary epithelia and in two of six primary mammary carcinomas. Therefore, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' region of the rat p16 gene. To confirm that methylation status of the 5' region is correlated with p16 expression, the methylation status was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR in three samples of normal mammary glands, six samples of mammary carcinomas and four cell lines. The 5' region was demethylated in all of the three normal and six carcinoma samples that fully expressed p16. On the other hand, the 5' region was highly methylated in the 3Y1 cell line, which lacked p16 expression, but without deletion. These results showed that the methylation status of the 5' region was more closely correlated with p16 expression than that of the exon 1 alpha and analysis of the methylation status is useful in examining p16 silencing in various rat tumors.",

NGS was performed using a clinically validated multiplexed gene sequencing panel interrogating the full coding sequence of 194 cancer-related genes. A custom bioinformatics pipeline was developed to detect all classes of mutations directly from the NGS data, including single-nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, copy number variation, and complex structural variations. Twenty-five soft tissue sarcomas were analyzed; 18 of these patients had metastatic disease and 7 primary locally advanced tumors. Targetable mutations for which clinical trials are available were identified in 60% of the cases. MAP2K4, AURKA, AURKB, and c-MYC amplification were recurrent events in leiomyosarcomas. Frequent non-targetable variants included copy losses of the TP53 (24%), PTEN (16%), and CDKN2A (20%). Additional frameshift mutations, deletion mutations, and single-nucleotide variants involving numerous genes, including RB1, NOTCH1, PIK3CA, PDGFRB, EPHA5, KDM6A, NF1, and FLT4 genes, were also identified.

Strategies were devised to generate antibody responses against hCG to investigate whether reversal of the molecular processes driving tumorigenesis would follow. hCG-immunized transgenic mice did not exhibit increases in body weight or serum prolactin levels, and gross ovarian and pituitary morphology remained normal. While non-immunized transgenic animals demonstrated heightened levels of transcripts associated with pituitary tumorigenesis (HMG2A, E2F1, CCND1, PRL, GH, GAL, PTTG1, BMP4) and decreased levels of CDK inhibitors CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN2c (p18), immunization led to a reversal to levels found in non-transgenic animals. Serum derived from transgenic (but not non-transgenic) mice led to enhanced transcription as well as expression of VEGF, IL-8, KC (murine IL-8) and MMP-9 in tumor cells, effects not seen when sera derived from hCG-immunized transgenic mice was employed. As the definitive indication of the restoration of the reproductive axis, immunization led to the resumption of estrous cyclicity as well as fertility in transgenic mice. These results indicate that hCG may influence cancer pathogenesis and progression via several distinct mechanisms. Using a stringent in vivo system in which βhCG acts both a \"self\" antigen and a tumor-promoting moiety (putatively akin to the situation in humans), the data builds a case for anti-gonadotropin vaccination strategies in the treatment of gonadotropin-dependent or secreting malignancies that frequently acquire resistance to conventional therapy.",

On the genomic level a highly variable degree of alterations in nearly all chromosomal regions and between individual tumors is observable. This hampers the identification of common drivers in OS biology. To identify the common molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of OS, we follow the hypothesis that all the copy number-associated differences between the patients are intercepted on the level of the functional modules. The implementation is based on a network approach utilizing copy number associated genes in OS, paired expression data and protein interaction data. The resulting functional modules of tightly connected genes were interpreted regarding their biological functions in OS and their potential prognostic significance. We identified an osteosarcoma network assembling well-known and lesser-known candidates. The derived network shows a significant connectivity and modularity suggesting that the genes affected by the heterogeneous genetic alterations share the same biological context. The network modules participate in several critical aspects of cancer biology like DNA damage response, cell growth, and cell motility which is in line with the hypothesis of specifically deregulated but functional modules in cancer. Further, we could deduce genes with possible prognostic significance in OS for further investigation (e.g. EZR, CDKN2A, MAP3K5). Several of those module genes were located on chromosome 6q. The given systems biological approach provides evidence that heterogeneity on the genomic and expression level is ordered by the biological system on the level of the functional modules. Different genomic aberrations are pointing to the same cellular network vicinity to form vital, but already neoplastically altered, functional modules maintaining OS. This observation, exemplarily now shown for OS, has been under discussion already for a longer time, but often in a hypothetical manner, and can here be exemplified for OS. ",

There has been no new treatment for advanced and recurrent disease in decades, with most women succumbing to the disease. Despite two distinct etiologies of VSCC, human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated and HPV-independent disease, there is no difference in therapeutic options.;A literature review was carried out by searching EMBASE and Medline databases between January 1990 and March 2016 by pairing the keywords of vulvar carcinoma, vulva cancer, vulvar and vulva with molecular markers involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Molecular targets of prognostic significance were identified and targeted agents of therapeutic relevance to both HPV-independent and HPV-associated VSCC were then reviewed.;Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of VSCC provide insight into the future management of VSCC with molecular targeted therapies. Aberrant cell cycle activity is common in both HPV-associated and HPV-independent VSCC and is characterized by overexpression of p53, Rb and cyclin D1, supporting targeting of these protein products and their downstream pathways. Extracellular regulators of cellular activity, such as EGFR, as well as inhibitors of angiogenesis are being clinically evaluated in VSCC. HPV-independent VSCC is characterized by actionable mutations, including PI3K, CDKN2A and PTEN. In HPV-associated disease, therapeutic vaccines targeting the E6 and E7 HPV oncogenes and immune-based therapies are under investigation.;There has been a paucity of clinical trials in recent years in this neglected women's cancer. Directed therapy against cell cycle regulatory molecules and extracellular proteins and the inhibition of angiogenesis are of broad therapeutic relevance in VSCC. Therapeutic strategies that target actionable mutations should be explored. In HPV-associated VSCC, novel treatments that exploit the virology of HPV and/or enhance the host immune response merit further study.",

Contrastingly, the closely related gene CDKN2B had no disease-related mutations in these families. A majority of Swedish families with hereditary melanoma predisposition thus lack germline mutations in these cell cycle G1 checkpoint-regulating genes. Additional genes with the potential to contribute to increased melanoma risk may code for related components of the cell cycle-regulating machinery. The gene for cyclin-dependent kinase 4, CDK4, has been found in mutated form in the germline from individuals belonging to 2 melanoma kindreds in the United States. The CDKN2C gene coding for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18 is localized on 1p32, a region frequently involved in chromosomal changes in melanomas and other tumors. The TP53 suppressor gene, involved in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genetic stability, is found mutated in the germline of patients with hereditary Li-Fraumeni syndrome, leading to early onset of several human cancers, including melanoma. The present investigation reports the results of screening the 100 Swedish melanoma families for germline mutations in the CDK4, CDKN2C and TP53 genes. No disease-related mutations were detected in the coding regions. A direct contribution of these genes to the hereditary risk for melanoma in members of Swedish melanoma kindreds therefore appears unlikely.",

The gene-specific and widespread methylation status among the carcinomas was related to patient gender and age, and microsatellite instability status. Possible CIMP tumors were identified by comparing the methylation profile with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF-, KRAS-, and TP53 mutation status.;The mean number of methylated genes per sample was 0.4 in normal colon mucosa from tumor-free individuals, 1.2 in mucosa from cancerous bowels, 2.2 in adenomas, and 3.9 in carcinomas. Widespread methylation was found in both adenomas and carcinomas. The promoters of ADAMTS1, MAL, and MGMT were frequently methylated in benign samples as well as in malignant tumors, independent of microsatellite instability. In contrast, normal mucosa samples taken from bowels without tumor were rarely methylated for the same genes. Hypermethylated CRABP1, MLH1, NR3C1, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1 were shown to be identifiers of carcinomas with microsatellite instability.

While the involvement of Ink4a in lung tumor development has been widely described, the tumor suppressor gene has not been studied in radon-induced lung tumors. In this study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the Cdkn2a locus, common to the Ink4a and Arf genes, was performed on 33 radon-induced rat lung tumors and showed a DNA loss in 50% of cases. The analysis of p16(Ink4a) protein expression by immunohistochemistry revealed that 50% of the tumors were negative for this protein. Looking for the origin of this lack of expression, we observed a low frequency of homozygous deletion (6%), a lack of mutation, an absence of correlation between promoter methylation and Ink4a mRNA expression and no correlation between LOH and protein expression. However, a tendency for an inverse correlation between p16(Ink4a) and pRb protein expression was observed. The expressions of p19Arf, Mmd2 and Mdm4 were not deregulated and only 14% of the tumors were mutated for Tp53. These results indicated that Ink4a/Cdk4/Rb1 pathway deregulation, more than Arf/Mdm2/Tp53 pathway, has a major role in the development of these tumors through p16(Ink4a) deregulation. However, all known mechanisms of inactivation of the pathway do not play a recurrent role in these tumors and the actual origin of the lack of p16(Ink4a) protein expression remains to be established.",

Current models trade off tractability for realism. Computational models are perhaps the most tractable and can be used both to interpret data and to develop intuitions and hypotheses for neoplastic progression. Tissue culture models include squamous cell lines, Barrett's oesophagus cell lines and OAC cell lines, although it was recognized recently that BIC-1, SEG-1 and TE-7 are not true OAC cell lines. Some of the unrealistic aspects of the micro-environment in two-dimensional tissue culture may be overcome with the development of three-dimensional organotypic cultures of Barrett's oesophagus. The most realistic, but least tractable, model is a canine surgical model that generates reflux and leads to an intestinal metaplasia. Alternatively, rat surgical models have gained popularity and should be tested for the common genetic features of Barrett's oesophagus neoplastic progression in humans including loss of CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and TP53 (tumour protein 53), generation of aneuploidy and realistic levels of genetic diversity. This last feature will be important for studying the effects of cancer-prevention interventions.

Thus, quantitation of the influence of inherited variants on gene function can potentially be used to predict the disease relevance of these variants. While many disease genes have been extensively characterized at the functional level, few assays based on functional properties of the encoded proteins have been established for the purpose of predicting the contribution of rare inherited variants to disease. Much of the difficulty in establishing predictive functional assays stems from the technical complexity of the assays. However, perhaps the most challenging aspect of functional assay development for clinical testing purposes is the absolute requirement for validation of the sensitivity and specificity of the assays and the determination of positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) of the assays relative to a \"gold standard\" measure of disease predisposition. In this commentary, we provide examples of some of the functional assays under development for several cancer predisposition genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, and mismatch repair [MMR] genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) and present a detailed review of the issues associated with functional assay development. We conclude that validation is paramount for all assays that will be used for clinical interpretation of inherited variants of any gene, but note that in certain circumstances information derived from incompletely validated assays may be valuable for classification of variants for clinical purposes when used to supplement data derived from other sources.",

For these purposes, we characterized a collection of 27 cell lines established from F344 rats, after 136 to 415 days of induction with crocidolite asbestos administered intraperitoneally. Four mesotheliomas were distinguished from 23 preneoplastic mesothelial cell lines (PN) according to their propensity to generate tumors after orthotopic transplantation into syngeneic rats, their growth pattern, and the expression profile of three genes. PN cell lines were further discriminated into groups / subgroups according to morphology in culture and the expression profiles of 14 additional genes. This approach was completed by analysis of positive and negative immunohistochemical MM markers in the four tumors, of karyotype alterations in the most aggressive MM cell line in comparison with a PN epithelioid cell line, and of human normal mesothelial and mesothelioma cells and a tissue array. Our results showed that both the rat and human MM cell lines shared in common a dramatic decrease in the relative expression of Cdkn2a and of epigenetic regulators, in comparison with PN and normal human mesothelial cells, respectively. In particular, we identified the involvement of the relative expression of the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases and Dnmt3a in relation to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level in malignant transformation and the acquisition of metastatic potential.

Diagnosis is problematic, and additional biomarkers are needed to better stratify patients. To investigate their molecular signature, we performed low-coverage copy number (CN) sequencing on 57 OVC and exome and RNA sequencing on a subset of these and compared the data to the same OSCC parameters. CN results showed that OVC lacked any of the classical OSCC patterns such as gain of 3q and loss of 3p and demonstrated considerably fewer genomic rearrangements compared to the OSCC cohort. OVC and OSCC samples could be clearly differentiated. Exome sequencing showed that OVC samples lacked mutations in genes commonly associated with OSCC (TP53, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, CDKN2A and FAT1). RNA sequencing identified genes that were differentially expressed between the groups. In silico functional analysis showed that the mutated and differentially expressed genes in OVC samples were involved in cell adhesion and keratinocyte proliferation, while those in the OSCC cohort were enriched for cell death and apoptosis pathways. This is the largest and most detailed genomic and transcriptomic analysis yet performed on this tumour type, which, as an example of non-metastatic cancer, may shed light on the nature of metastases. These three independent investigations consistently show substantial differences between the cohorts. Taken together, they lead to the conclusion that OVC is not a subtype of OSCC, but should be classified as a distinct entity. ",

Primary glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer that typically appears suddenly in older adults. With aggressive treatment, the median survival time is only 15 months. Their acute onset and widespread genomic instability indicates that chromothripsis may play a key role in their initiation and progression.

The data derived from this study was further expanded on using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and susceptibility studies with colony formation assays.;We show that primary GBMs are associated with higher chromothripsis scores and establish a link between chromothripsis and gene amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), as well as modulators of the TP53 and RB1 pathways.;Utilizing a newly introduced bioinformatic tool, we provide evidence that chromothripsis is associated with the formation of amplicons containing several oncogenes involved in key pathways that are likely essential for post-chromothriptic cell survival.",

The CDKN2A locus, which houses the INK4a and ARF tumor suppressor genes, is frequently altered in NSCLC. However, the specific role of ARF in pulmonary tumorigenesis remains unclear. KRAS and other oncogenes induce the expression of ARF, thus stabilizing p53 activity and arresting cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in Kras-driven NSCLC, we compared the susceptibility of NIH/Ola strain wild-type and Arf-knockout mice to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Lung tumor size, malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in Arf(-/-) compared with Arf(+/+) animals at 25 weeks after induction. Pulmonary tumors from Arf-knockout mice exhibited increased cell proliferation and DNA damage compared with wild-type mice. A subgroup of tumors in Arf(-/-) animals presented as dedifferentiated and metastatic, with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, a neoplasm previously undocumented in mouse models. Our finding of a role for ARF in NSCLC is consistent with the observation that benign adenomas from Arf(+/+) mice robustly expressed ARF, while ARF expression was markedly reduced in malignant adenocarcinomas. ARF expression also frequently colocalized with the expression of p21(CIP1), a transcriptional target of p53, arguing that ARF induces the p53 checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in lung tumorigenesis that mounts a strong barrier against tumor growth and malignant progression. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of both benign and malignant tumors. The lifetime risk for developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in NF1 patients is approximately 10% with poor survival rates. To date, the molecular basis of MPNST development remains unclear. Here, we report the first genome-wide and high-resolution analysis of DNA copy number alterations in MPNST using the 32K bacterial artificial chromosome microarray on a series of 24 MPNSTs and three neurofibroma samples. In the benign neurofibromas, apart from loss of one copy of the NF1 gene and copy number polymorphisms, no other changes were found. The profiles of malignant samples, however, revealed specific loss of chromosomal regions including 1p35-33, 1p21, 9p21.3, 10q25, 11q22-23, 17q11, and 20p12.2 as well as gain of 1q25, 3p26, 3q13, 5p12, 5q11.2-q14, 5q21-23, 5q31-33, 6p23-p21, 6p12, 6q15, 6q23-q24, 7p22, 7p14-p13, 7q21, 7q36, 8q22-q24, 14q22, and 17q21-q25. Copy number gains were more frequent than deletions in the MPNST samples (62% vs. 38%). The genes resident within common regions of gain were NEDL1 (7p14), AP3B1 (5q14.1), and CUL1 (7q36.1) and these were identified in >63% MPNSTs. The most frequently deleted locus encompassed CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP genes on 9p21.3 (33% cases). These genes have previously been implicated in other cancer conditions and therefore, should be considered for their therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic relevance in NF1 tumorigenesis.",

Consistent heterogeneity in chromosome number was found, and most cell lines showed a near-triploid chromosome complement. Several cell lines showed deletions of the TP53 (alias p53), CDKN2A (alias p16), and VHL genes. Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) analysis revealed chromosome 3 translocated to several other partners chromosomes, as well as breakage events commonly affecting chromosomes 1, 5, 8, 10, and 17. The most common abnormality detected with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was deletions of chromosome 3p, with loss of the RASSF1, FHIT, and p44S10 loci frequently involved. CGH gain of 5q showed overrepresentation of the EGR1 and CSF1R genes. Recurrent alterations to chromosome 7 included rearrangement of 7q11 and gains of the EGFR, TIF1, and RFC2 genes. Several lines exhibited rearrangement of 12q11 approximately q14 and overrepresentation of CDK4 and SAS loci. M-FISH revealed several other recurrent translocations, and CGH findings included loss of 9p, 14q, and 18q and gain of 8q, 12, and 20. Further genomic microarray changes included loss of MTAP, IGH@, HTR1B, and SMAD4 (previously MADH4) and gains of MYC and TOP1. An excellent correlation was observed between the genomic array and FISH data, demonstrating that this technique is effective and accurate.

Molecular analysis showed CDKN2A deletions but wild-type PIK3CA. BC61 contained a G372C FGFR3 mutation. TP53 was not mutated in either cell line and BC61 expressed normal full-length protein. In contrast, BC44 exclusively expressed cytoplasmic and nuclear p53Δ40 and 133 isoforms from the alternative promoter P2 as revealed by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and PCR. The only discernible difference in TP53 in BC44 was homozygosity for the deletion allele of the rs17878362 polymorphism in the P2 promoter. Expression of p53 isoforms was also detected in a few other urothelial carcinoma cell lines and tumor cultures and in 4 out of 28 carcinoma tissues.;In urothelial cancers, TP53 is typically inactivated by mutations in one allele and loss of the wildtype allele and more frequently in invasive compared to papillary carcinomas. We show that some urothelial carcinomas may predominantly or exclusively express isoforms which are not detected by commonly used antibodies to epitopes located in the p53 TA amino-terminal region. Expression of these isoforms may constitute a further mode of p53 inactivation in urothelial carcinoma.

Smoking and drinking alcohol are environmental risk factors for ESCC, whereas single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2, which increase harmful intermediates produced by drinking alcohol, are genetic risk factors. We conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of ESCCs from patients in Japan to determine the mutational landscape of this cancer.;We performed whole-exome sequence analysis of tumor and nontumor esophageal tissues collected from 144 patients with ESCC who underwent surgery at 5 hospitals in Japan. We also performed single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based copy number profile and germline genotype analyses of polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2. Polymorphisms in CYP2A6, which increase harmful effects of smoking, were analyzed. Functions of TET2 mutants were evaluated in KYSE410 and HEK293FT cells.;A high proportion of mutations in the 144 tumor samples were C to T substitution in CpG dinucleotides (called the CpG signature) and C to G/T substitutions with a flanking 5' thymine (called the APOBEC signature). Based on mutational signatures, patients were assigned to 3 groups, which associated with environmental (drinking and smoking) and genetic (polymorphisms in ALDH2 and CYP2A6) factors. Many tumors contained mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle (TP53, CCND1, CDKN2A, FBXW7); epigenetic processes (MLL2, EP300, CREBBP, TET2); and the NOTCH (NOTCH1, NOTCH3), WNT (FAT1, YAP1, AJUBA) and receptor-tyrosine kinase-phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2). Mutations in EP300 and TET2 correlated with shorter survival times, and mutations in ZNF750 associated with an increased number of mutations of the APOBEC signature. Expression of mutant forms of TET2 did not increase cellular levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in HEK293FT cells, whereas knockdown of TET2 increased the invasive activity of KYSE410 ESCC cells. Computational analyses associated the mutations in NFE2L2 we identified with transcriptional activation of its target genes.;We associated environmental and genetic factors with base substitution patterns of somatic mutations and provide a registry of genes and pathways that are disrupted in ESCCs.

Abnormalities of 9p21 have been reported in 10-30% of childhood ALL using conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The incidence of 9p21 using more sensitive techniques, such as methylation specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA), remains uncertain, and thus also the prognostic significance.;We investigated the incidence and prognostic importance of 9p21 abnormalities in pediatric ALL patients using MS-MLPA and compared these results to FISH.;In total, MS-MLPA or FISH detected aberrations (both dosage and methylation abnormalities) at 9p21 in a remarkable 32/48 (67%) patients in contrast to a much lower rate of only 8% of patients identified to have deletions by standard G banding cytogenetics. MS-MLPA identified five deletions not found by FISH. Aberrant methylation at CDKN2B was found in 19 (46%) patients. 9p21 abnormalities were associated with National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk criteria (P = 0.04) and were present in all five patients with T-cell disease. Four pre-B-cell ALL patients relapsed, three of whom had prior 9p21 abnormalities.;MS-MLPA had a higher detection rate for 9p21 abnormalities than previously reported for other techniques.

The bulk of this variation is stochastic and functionally neutral, with only a small minority representing \"drivers\" that contribute to the genesis and maintenance of tumors. Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors, reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate. Here, a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns. Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-RB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor β (RARB) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14(ARF) (P < 0.0001), suggesting a functional link between RARβ signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14(ARF). Mechanistically, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased the expression of p14(ARF) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14(ARF) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARβ. Furthermore, the ability of ATRA to induce senescence is reduced in p14(ARF)-depleted melanocytes, and we provide proof-of-concept that ATRA can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARβ-p14(ARF) signaling axis, independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status.;These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARβ and p14(ARF) with potential implications for melanoma treatment.",

We sequenced 24 candidate healthy aging genes in DNA samples from 47 healthy individuals aged eighty-five years or older (the 'oldest-old'), to characterize genetic variation that is present in this exceptional group. These healthy seniors were never diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, or Alzheimer disease. We re-sequenced all exons, intron-exon boundaries and selected conserved non-coding sequences of candidate genes involved in aging-related processes, including dietary restriction (PPARG, PPARGC1A, SIRT1, SIRT3, UCP2, UCP3), metabolism (IGF1R, APOB, SCD), autophagy (BECN1, FRAP1), stem cell activation (NOTCH1, DLL1), tumor suppression (TP53, CDKN2A, ING1), DNA methylation (TRDMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) Progeria syndromes (LMNA, ZMPSTE24, KL) and stress response (CRYAB, HSPB2).

HSCs maintain themselves for the lifetime of the organism because of their ability to self-renew. However, multipotent progenitors lack the ability to self-renew, therefore their mitotic capacity and expansion potential are limited and they are destined to eventually stop proliferating after a finite number of cell divisions. The molecular mechanisms that limit the proliferation capacity of multipotent progenitors and other more mature progenitors are not fully understood. Here we show that bone marrow cells from mice deficient in three genes genetically downstream of Bmi1--p16Ink4a, p19Arf and Trp53 (triple mutant mice; p16Ink4a and p19Arf are alternative reading frames of the same gene (also called Cdkn2a) that encode different proteins)--have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the blood long term. This increase is associated with the acquisition of long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype c-kit+Sca-1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors in wild-type mice. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor response to growth factors resembles that of wild-type multipotent progenitors but not wild-type HSCs. These results demonstrate that p16Ink4a/p19Arf and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. These pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.",

The recent multidimensional analysis of the GBM genome has provided a more complete view of the landscape of such alterations and their linked pathways. This effort has demonstrated that certain pathways are universally altered, but that the specific genetic events altered within each pathway can vary for each particular patient's tumor. With this atlas of genetic and epigenetic events, it now becomes feasible to assess how the patterns of mutations in a pathway influence response to drugs that are targeting such pathways. This issue is particularly important for GBM because, in contrast to other tumor types, molecularly targeted therapies have failed to alter overall survival substantially. Here, we combined functional genetic screens and comprehensive genomic analyses to identify CDK6 as a GBM oncogene that is required for proliferation and viability in a subset of GBM cell lines and tumors. Using an available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, we sought to determine if the specific pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated the response to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. We showed that codeletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2C serves as a strong predictor of sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Thus, genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify a subset of GBMs likely to respond to CDK4/6 inhibition. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genomic, functional and pharmacologic data can be exploited to inform the development of targeted therapy directed against specific cancer pathways.",

In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%).

The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs.

After sample clean-up, peptide and protein profiles were obtained on an ultrahigh-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry platform. A discriminant score for each sample was calculated with a previously designed prediction rule, and the median discriminant scores of cases and controls were compared. Individuals with precursor lesions of PC (n = 4) and individuals with a recent diagnosis of melanoma (n = 4) were also separately considered.;Cases had a higher median discriminant score than controls (0.26 vs 0.016; P = .001).

Previous studies have shown evidence for association between risk of ALL and variation within IKZF1, ARID5B, CEBPE, CDKN2A, GATA3, and BM1-PIP4K2A genes. However, variants identified only account for <10% of the genetic risk of ALL.;We applied pathway-based analyses to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biologic pathways were overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among SNPs.;Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may involve distinct biologic mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and focal adhesion (PFDR < 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell malignancies. Several candidate genes for ALL, such as COL6A6 and COL5A1, were identified through targeted maximum likelihood estimation.;This is the first study to show distinct biologic pathways are overrepresented in different ALL subtypes using pathway-based approaches, and identified potential gene candidates using causal inference methods.;The findings demonstrate that newly developed bioinformatics tools and causal inference methods can provide insights to furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of leukemia.

Studies have identified several molecular abnormalities with clinical or biological relevance to AOD (e.g. t(1;19)(q10;p10), IDH1, IDH2, CIC and FUBP1 mutations).To better characterize the clinical and biological behavior of this tumor type, the creation of a national multicentric network, named \"Prise en charge des OLigodendrogliomes Anaplasiques (POLA),\" has been supported by the Institut National du Cancer (InCA). Newly diagnosed and centrally validated AOD patients and their related biological material (tumor and blood samples) were prospectively included in the POLA clinical database and tissue bank, respectively.At the molecular level, we have conducted a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, which included 83 patients. Despite a careful central pathological review, AOD have been found to exhibit heterogeneous genomic features. A total of 82% of the tumors exhibited a 1p/19q-co-deletion, while 18% harbor a distinct chromosome pattern. Novel focal abnormalities, including homozygously deleted, amplified and disrupted regions, have been identified. Recurring copy neutral losses of heterozygosity (CNLOH) inducing the modulation of gene expression have also been discovered. CNLOH in the CDKN2A locus was associated with protein silencing in 1/3 of the cases. In addition, FUBP1 homozygous deletion was detected in one case suggesting a putative tumor suppressor role of FUBP1 in AOD.Our study showed that the genomic and pathological analyses of AOD are synergistic in detecting relevant clinical and biological subgroups of AOD.",

The best-known form of human cell senescence is attributed to telomere shortening and a DNA-damage response through p53 and p21. There is also a more rapid form of senescence, dependent on the p16-retinoblastoma pathway. p16 (CDKN2A) is a known melanoma susceptibility gene. Here, we use retrovirally mediated gene transfer to confirm that the normal form of senescence in cultured human melanocytes involves p16, since disruption of the p16/retinoblastoma pathway is required as well as telomerase activation for immortalisation. Expression (immunostaining) patterns of senescence mediators and markers in melanocytic lesions provide strong evidence that cell senescence occurs in benign melanocytic naevi (moles) in vivo and does not involve p53 or p21 upregulation, although p16 is widely expressed. In comparison, dysplastic naevi and early (radial growth-phase, RGP) melanomas show less p16 and some p53 and p21 immunostaining. All RGP melanomas expressed p21, suggesting areas of p53-mediated senescence, while most areas of advanced (vertical growth-phase) melanomas lacked both p16 and p21, implying escape from both forms of senescence (immortalisation). Moreover, nuclear p16 but not p21 expression can be induced in human melanocytes by oncogenic BRAF, as found in around 80% of naevi. We conclude that cell senescence can form a barrier to melanoma development. This also provides a potential explanation of why p16 is a melanoma suppressor gene.",

        "Doc_abstract":"For major genes known to influence the risk of cancer, an important task is to determine the risks conferred by individual variants, so that one can appropriately counsel carriers of these mutations. This is a challenging task, since new mutations are continually being identified, and there is typically relatively little empirical evidence available about each individual mutation. Hierarchical modeling offers a natural strategy to leverage the collective evidence from these rare variants with sparse data. This can be accomplished when there are available higher-level covariates that characterize the variants in terms of attributes that could distinguish their association with disease. In this article, we explore the use of hierarchical modeling for this purpose using data from a large population-based study of the risks of melanoma conferred by variants in the CDKN2A gene. We employ both a pseudo-likelihood approach and a Bayesian approach using Gibbs sampling. The results indicate that relative risk estimates tend to be primarily influenced by the individual case-control frequencies when several cases and/or controls are observed with the variant under study, but that relative risk estimates for variants with very sparse data are more influenced by the higher-level covariate values, as one would expect. The analysis offers encouragement that we can draw strength from the aggregating power of hierarchical models to provide guidance to medical geneticists when they offer counseling to patients with rare or even hitherto unobserved variants. However, further research is needed to validate the application of asymptotic methods to such sparse data.",

We report the isolation and characterization of a population of tumor-initiating cells derived from an atypical meningioma. We identify a tumor-initiating population from an atypical meningioma, termed meningioma-initiating cells (MICs). These MICs self-renew, differentiate, and can recapitulate the histological characteristics of the parental tumor when transplanted at 1000 cells into the flank regions of athymic nude mice. Immunohistochemistry reveals stem-like protein expression patterns similar to neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) while genomic profiling verified the isolation of cancer cells (with defined meningioma chromosomal aberrations) from the bulk tumor. Microarray and pathway analysis identifies biochemical processes and gene networks related to aberrant cell cycle progression, particularly the loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (p16(INK4A)), p14(ARF), and CDKN2B (p15(INK4B)). Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of CD44 and activated leukocyte adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166); these may prove to be markers able to identify this cell type.

The paraffin blocks from 103 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were obtained, and cellular targets were selected for tissue microdissection genotyping. Tumor suppressor gene loss was based on loss of heterozygosity situated within or adjacent to specific genes of interest (APC, CDKN2A, DCC, MET, MYC1, OGG1, p34, p53, PTEN). Microdissected tissue was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with flanking oligonucleotides bearing fluorescent labels designed for GeneScan fragment analysis; PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis. Normal microdissected tissue samples for each case were evaluated for informative status with respect to individual alleles for 18 microsatellites at 10 genomic loci-1p, 3p, 5q, 7q, 8q, 9p, 10q, 17p, 17q, 18q. The measure of allelic loss of heterozygosity combined with tumor number, tumor size, vascular invasion, lobar distribution, and patient gender provide a highly discriminatory model for predicting cancer recurrence after liver transplantation. Using our previously developed artificial neural network model in combination with the genotyping results, unambiguous predictions were made for 91 of the103 patients (88.3%). Of these, 1 was lost to follow-up, and 9 died recurrence-free less than 3 years posttransplantation.

Molecular markers that differentiate IM and MC are of interest to clinical practitioners because the clinical diagnoses of IM and MC often lead to different therapies.;We analyzed 30 multiple tumors from 15 patients for somatic mutations of cancer-related genes, chromosomal aberrations, and promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes using techniques such as high-resolution melting, array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and quantitative methylation-specific PCR.;Somatic mutations were found in TP53 and CTNNB1 but not in CDKN2A or KRAS.

WT mice were more susceptible than Nrf2(-/+) mice to tumor induction in the colon. Tumors from WT mice had higher HDAC levels globally and locally on genes such as cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a/p16) that were dysregulated during tumor development. The average tumor burden was reduced by SFN from 62.7 to 26.0 mm(3) in WT mice and from 14.6 to 11.7 mm(3) in Nrf2(-/+) mice. The decreased antitumor activity of SFN in Nrf2(-/+) mice coincided with attenuated Cdkn2a promoter interactions involving HDAC3. HDAC3 knockdown in human colon cancer cells recapitulated the effects of SFN on p16 induction. Human subjects given a broccoli sprout extract supplement (200 μmol SFN equivalents), or reporting more than five cruciferous vegetable servings per week, had increased p16 expression that was inversely associated with HDAC3 in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in biopsies obtained during screening colonoscopy.;Nrf2 expression varies widely in both normal human colon and human colon cancers and likely contributes to the overall rate of tumor growth in the large intestine. It remains to be determined whether this influences global HDAC protein expression levels, as well as local HDAC interactions on genes dysregulated during human colon tumor development.

ACF are the earliest identifiable preneoplastic lesion found within the human colon and are detected using high-definition endoscopy with contrast dye spray. The current analysis focused on the epithelium of ACF with somatic mutations to either KRAS, BRAF, or APC, and expression patterns compared with normal mucosa from each patient. By comparing gene expression patterns among groups, an increase in a number of proinflammatory NF-κB target genes was identified that was specific to ACF epithelium, including TIMP1, RELA, and RELB Distinct transcriptional changes associated with each somatic mutation were observed and a subset of ACF display BRAF(V600E)-mediated senescence-associated transcriptome characterized by increased expression of CDKN2A Finally, LCM-captured ACF-associated stroma was found to be transcriptionally distinct from normal-appearing stroma, with an upregulation of genes related to immune cell infiltration and fibroblast activation. Immunofluorescence confirmed increased CD3(+) T cells within the stromal microenvironment of ACF and an abundance of activated fibroblasts.

There are limited treatment strategies for LUSC in part due to our inadequate understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the disease. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and comprehensive immune profiling of a unique set of clinically annotated early-stage LUSCs to increase our understanding of the pathobiology of this malignancy.;Matched pairs of surgically resected stage I-III LUSCs and normal lung tissues (n=108) were analyzed by WES. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis-based profiling of ten immune markers was done on a subset of LUSCs (n=91). Associations among mutations, immune markers and clinicopathological variables were statistically examined using ANOVA and Fisher's exact test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for statistical analysis of clinical outcome.;This early-stage LUSC cohort displayed an average of 209 exonic mutations per tumor. Fourteen genes exhibited significant enrichment for somatic mutation: TP53, MLL2, PIK3CA, NFE2L2, CDH8, KEAP1, PTEN, ADCY8, PTPRT, CALCR, GRM8, FBXW7, RB1 and CDKN2A Among mutated genes associated with poor recurrence-free survival, MLL2 mutations predicted poor prognosis in both TP53 mutant and wild type LUSCs. We also found that in treated patients, FBXW7 and KEAP1 mutations were associated with poor response to adjuvant therapy, particularly in TP53-mutant tumors. Analysis of mutations with immune markers revealed that ADCY8 and PIK3CA mutations were associated with markedly decreased tumoral PD-L1 expression, LUSCs with PIK3CA mutations exhibited elevated CD45ro levels and CDKN2A-mutant tumors displayed an up-regulated immune response.;Our findings pinpoint mutated genes that may impact clinical outcome as well as personalized strategies for targeted immunotherapies in early-stage LUSC.",

Using data from a hospital-based case-control study conducted by the National Cancer Institute between 1994 and 1998, we evaluated risk of glioma (n = 388), meningioma (n = 162), and acoustic neuroma (n = 73) with respect to 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 10 genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle control: CASP8, CCND1, CCNH, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CHEK1, CHEK2, MDM2, PTEN, and TP53. We observed significantly decreased risk of meningioma with the CASP8 Ex14-271A>T variant [odds ratio (OR)(AT), 0.8; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.5-1.2; OR(AA), 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P(trend) = 0.03] and increased risk of meningioma with the CASP8 Ex13+51G>C variant (OR(GC), 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1; OR(CC), 3.6; 95% CI, 1.0-13.1; P(trend) = 0.04). The CT haplotype of the two CASP8 polymorphisms was associated with significantly increased risk of meningioma (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6), but was not associated with risk of glioma or acoustic neuroma. The CCND1 Ex4-1G>A variant was associated with increased risk for glioma, and the Ex8+49T>C variant of CCNH was associated with increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma. The MDM2 Ex12+162A>G variant was associated with significantly reduced risk of glioma. Our results suggest that common variants in the CASP8, CCND1, CCNH, and MDM2 genes may influence brain tumor risk.

Better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of mesothelial carcinogenesis is required to develop new therapeutic strategies. MPM, like all cancer cells, needs to maintain telomere length to prevent senescence. Previous studies suggested that the telomere lengthening mechanism in MPM is based mainly on telomerase activity. For this reason, we focused on the key catalytic enzyme, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), by analyzing its gene expression in MPM and by studying the mechanism underlying its upregulation. We used our large collection of MPM composed of 61 MPM in culture and 71 frozen MPM tumor samples. Evaluation of TERT mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR showed overexpression in MPM in culture compared with normal mesothelial cells, and in MPM tumor samples compared with normal pleura. We identified a 'hot spot' of mutations in the TERT gene core promoter in both MPM in culture and in MPM tumor samples with an overall frequency of 15%. Furthermore, data clearly identified mutation in the TERT promoter as a mechanism of TERT mRNA upregulation in MPM. In contrast, gene copy number amplification was not associated with TERT overexpression. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological, etiological and genetic characteristics of MPM with mutations in the TERT promoter. TERT promoter mutations were more frequent in MPM with sarcomatoid histologic subtype (P<0.01), and they were frequently associated with CDKN2A gene inactivation (P=0.03). In conclusion, a subgroup of MPM presents TERT promoter mutations, which lead to TERT mRNA upregulation. This is the first recurrent gain-of-function oncogenic mutations identified in MPM. ",

In an effort to molecularly profile these subtypes of ampullary carcinomas, we conducted a two-phase study. In the discovery phase, we identified 18 pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinomas and 14 intestinal-type ampullary carcinomas using stringent pathologic criteria and performed next-generation sequencing targeting 279 cancer-associated genes on these tumors. Although the results showed overlapping of genomic alterations between the two subtypes, trends including more frequent KRAS alterations in pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma (61 vs 29%) and more frequent mutations in APC in intestinal-type ampullary carcinoma (43 vs 17%) were observed. Of the entire cohort of 32 tumors, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53 (n=17); the most frequently amplified gene was ERBB2 (n=5); and the most frequently deleted gene was CDKN2A (n=6). In the second phase of the study, we aimed at validating our observation on ERBB2 and assessed ERBB2 amplification and protein overexpression in a series of 100 ampullary carcinomas. We found that (1) gene amplification and immunohistochemical overexpression of ERBB2 occurred in 13% of all ampullary carcinomas, therefore providing a potential target for anti-HER2 therapy in these tumors; (2) amplification and immunohistochemical expression correlated in all cases, thus indicating that immunohistochemistry could be used to screen tumors; and (3) none of the 14 ERBB2-amplified tumors harbored any downstream driver mutations in KRAS/NRAS, whereas 56% of the cases negative for ERBB2 amplification did, an observation clinically pertinent as downstream mutations may cause primary resistance to inhibition of EGFR family members.

To identify liver-specific miRNAs for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), global expression profiling of miRNAs in liver tissue of HBV-HCC and HBV-control with no or mild fibrosis was evaluated. A total of 40 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in HCC. Among ten highly altered miRNAs, six miRNAs were successfully validated in tissues, whereas only two miRNAs, miR-126 and miR-142-3p showed increased expression in plasma of HBV-HCC compared to HBV-non-HCC patients. Subsequently, ROC curve analysis revealed that neither miR-126 nor miR-142-3p performed better than AFP in discriminating HCC from non-HCC while combination of each with AFP showed significantly higher efficiency rather than AFP alone (AUC: 0.922, 0.908 vs. 0.88; sensitivity: 0.84, 0.86 vs. 0.82 and specificity: 0.92, 0.94 vs. 0.86 respectively). Interestingly, triple combination of markers (miR-126 + miR-142-3p + AFP) showed no additive effect on efficiency (AUC: 0.925) over the dual combination. Again, the expression of only miR-126 was noticed significantly higher in HBV-HCC patients with low-AFP [<250 ng/ml] compared to either non-HCC or liver cirrhosis (AUC: 0.77, 0.64, respectively). Furthermore, no alteration in expression of mir-126 in HCV-HCC or non-viral-HCC revealed that miR-126 + AFP might be specific to HBV-HCC. To understand the physiological role of these two miRNAs in hepato-carcinogenesis, target genes related to cancer pathways (APAF1, APC2, CDKN2A, IRS1, CRKL, LIFR, EGR2) were verified. Thus, combination of circulating miR-126 + AFP is a promising noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for HBV-HCC and may be useful in the management of HCC patients.",

The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) with extensive promoter methylation appears to be a distinct epigenetic subtype of colorectal carcinoma. Most previous studies on CpG island methylation in colorectal carcinoma used methylation-specific PCR, which may detect low levels of DNA methylation with little or no biological significance. In contrast, quantitative DNA methylation assays have been shown to provide useful information beyond that which can be achieved with methylation-specific PCR. Synchronous neoplasias provide a unique model for investigators to examine molecular alterations in multistep tumorigenesis within one individual. However, no study to date has quantified DNA methylation of CIMP-specific promoters in synchronous colorectal neoplasias. Utilizing real-time PCR (MethyLight), we quantified DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters [CACNA1G (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T type alpha-1G subunit), CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), CRABP1 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein-1), MLH1 and NEUROG1 (neurogenin 1)] and MGMT in six synchronous carcinoma pairs (12 carcinomas) and eight synchronous carcinoma and adenoma pairs (16 tumors). We found that while some synchronous tumor pairs showed discordant promoter methylation patterns, other tumor pairs showed similar, but not exactly identical, patterns of promoter methylation. All but two pairs showed concordant patterns of CIMP status (CIMP positive vs CIMP negative) (P = 0.05 in cancer pairs). BRAF mutations were present in only CIMP-positive tumors. A high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was observed in both CIMP-positive and CIMP-negative tumors. KRAS mutations were not concordant in any synchronous neoplasia pair. In conclusion, epigenetic alterations at CIMP-specific promoter CpG islands in synchronous colorectal neoplasias likely have both random and nonrandom components.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate hypermethylation of the p16 promoter in pterygia and the relationship between this hypermethylation and the expression of p16 and DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) proteins.;We studied the methylation status of p16 and the expression of p16 and DNMT3b proteins by performing methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively, in specimens of 129 pterygia and 16 normal conjunctiva. The results were statistically analyzed.;Hypermethylation of the p16 gene promoter was detected in 21 (16.3%) of 129 pterygial specimens. Among them, 46 (35.7%) were positive for p16 protein expression, and 83 (64.3%) were negative. Staining for p16 was limited to the nuclei of the epithelial layer.

They represent the second malignant primary bone tumor of adults after osteosarcoma, but in contrast to osteosarcoma they are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical excision remaining the only therapeutic option. Few cell lines and animal models are available, and the mechanisms behind their chemoresistance remain largely unknown. Our goal was to establish new cell lines and animal cancer models from human chondrosarcoma biopsies to study their chemoresistance. Between 2007 and 2012, 10 chondrosarcoma biopsies were collected and used for cell culture and transplantation into nude mice. Only one transplanted biopsy and one injected cell line has engrafted successfully leading to conventional central high-grade chondrosarcoma similar to the original biopsies. In culture, two new stable cell lines were obtained, one from a dedifferentiated and one from a grade III conventional central chondrosarcoma biopsy. Their genetic characterization revealed triploid karyotypes, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53, deletion in CDKN2A and/or MDM2 amplification. These cell lines expressed mesenchymal membrane markers (CD44, 73, 90, 105) and were able to produce a hyaline cartilaginous matrix when cultured in chondrogenic three-dimensional (3D) pellets. Using a high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR approach, we observed that cell lines cultured in monolayer had lost expression of several genes implicated in cartilage development (COL2A1, COMP, ACAN) but restored their expression in 3D cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells in monolayer were sensitive to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents but became resistant to low doses of mafosfamide or doxorubicin when cultured in 3D pellets, in parallel with an altered nucleic accumulation of the drug. Our results indicate that the cartilaginous matrix produced by chondrosarcoma cells may impair diffusion of several drugs and thus contribute to chemoresistance. Therefore, 3D chondrogenic cell pellets constitute a more relevant model to study chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and may be a valuable alternative to animal experimentations. ",

However, atypical verruciform proliferations are also associated with these malignancies and their pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study compared 11 atypical verruciform lesions, including atypical verruciform hyperplasia, vulvar acanthosis with altered differentiation, and verruciform lichen simplex chronicus, with 14 human papillomavirus-negative keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Extracted tissue DNA was subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing of the exonic regions of 300 genes. Eight (73%) and six (55%) of eleven atypical verruciform lesions contained mutations in PIK3CA and ARID2, respectively. No TP53 mutations were identified. Eleven (79%) and five (36%) of fourteen keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas tested contained TP53 and CDKN2A mutations, respectively. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas displayed the majority of copy number variations with some variations (7p gain and 8p loss) shared by some cases in both groups. One patient developed atypical verruciform lesions with PIK3CA mutations followed by a keratinizing carcinoma with mutations in both PIK3CA and TP53. This study, for the first time segregates atypical verruciform lesions by virtue of a unique genotype (PIK3CA mutant/TP53 wild type) illustrating an example of progression to a TP53-mutated keratinizing carcinoma. The findings indicate that although PIK3CA mutations are found in <10% of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, they may be specific for a particular pathway involving atypical verruciform lesions, which could function as either a direct precursor or a risk factor for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Given the presence of a molecular signature, we propose the term 'differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesion' for this group. Whether they function as direct precursors to a less common form of squamous cell carcinoma will require further study, but carcinomas associated with these lesions might warrant testing for PIK3CA mutations to address this question.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 11 November 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.187.",

Several techniques are available to detect gene methylation, and the method chosen may have an effect on the results. A cross-sectional study was conducted in which the methylation status of DAPK, CDKN2A (p16) and RASSF1A genes in sputum and bronchial washing (BW) from subjects at risk for LC was analyzed. The methylation results of both samples were compared, considering BW as the reference. Results obtained by methylation-sensitive PCR (MSP) were validated by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM). The methylation results obtained in sputum and BW samples did not show statistically significant differences for any of the three genes analyzed in 65 subjects (McNemar test>0.05). Concordant results between sputum and BW were found in 40 patients for DAPK (61%), in 52 patients for p16 (80%) and in 63 patients for RASSF1 (97%). More methylated samples were found in BW, however, and sputum sensitivities and specificities for the identification of methylation status were 44 and 72% for DAPK gene, 21 and 94% for p16 and 100 and 98% for RASSF1A, respectively. When MSP results were validated by MS-HRM, DAPK and p16 gene samples methylated by MSP appeared to be unmethylated by MS-HRM. One sample showing methylation of RASSF1A gene also showed methylation when tested following MS-HRM procedure. Sputum and BW samples may be considered equally valid for the identification of methylated genes in bronchial secretions. The low sensitivity of sputum for the assessment of the methylation status of DAPK and p16 genes, however, suggests that the analysis of two or more sputum samples, or of a BW obtained semi-invasively, would be needed to attain higher reliability, together with the use of confirmatory techniques for positive results.",

DNA was extracted and comprehensive genomic profiling was performed in a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments.;Bayesian algorithms and local alignment algorithms were used to detect substitutions and insertions/deletions, respectively. A comparison to normal control samples was used to detect copy number alterations. Clinically relevant GAs (CRGAs) were defined as those linked to approved or investigational targeted therapies.;The median age in the cohort was 53 yr (range 26-73), and 14 primary tumors and three metastatic sites assessed. A total of 36 GAs were detected in this series of patients, with an average of 2.1 GAs per case. The most common GAs were in NF2 (5/17, 29%), SETD2 (4/17, 24%), SMARCB1 (3/17, 18%), and CDKN2A (2/17, 12%). Of nine cases assessed for FH GAs, two patients had FH homozygous loss. A limitation is that targeted interrogation of genes known to be implicated in other cancers was performed, so mutations outside of these cannot be excluded.;Recurrent CRGAs were detected in this series of CDC cases and suggest a possible benefit from targeted therapy. In particular, mTOR inhibitors may be of interest in patients with NF2 alterations. Alterations in FH and SMARCB1 also occurred in a mutually exclusive manner to NF2 alterations.;This report provides important genomic insights into collecting duct carcinoma, a rare type of renal cell carcinoma with a very aggressive course.

The molecular genetic profile of these two pathogenetic types, based on the genes reportedly mutated in these cancers, remains to be defined. Although microsatellite inability is reported in approximately 25% of endometrial carcinomas, its relation with the 2 pathogenetic types is not investigated.;To elucidate their underlying genetic changes, we analyzed 53 sporadic endometrial tumors, including 19 with and 34 without hyperplasia, for microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA ploidy (by flow cytometry), and for mutations in different genes.;Microsatellite instability was present in 21%, DNA nondiploidy in 15%, and mutations in the PTEN, KRAS, CTNNB1/beta-catenin, TP53, and CDKN2A genes were detected in 32, 11, 13, 17, and 0% of the tumors, respectively. Microsatellite instability and mutations in these genes were present in tumors both with and without complex atypical hyperplasia. All cases with complex atypical hyperplasia were early stage (I-II) endometrioid tumors and associated with long progression free disease (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, most tumors with hyperplasia had low World Health Organization or International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade, had less myometrial invasion, and showed expression of estrogen receptors. All MSI tumors were diploid and had a significantly higher rate of PTEN mutations, but similar rates of KRAS, beta-catenin, and TP53 mutations compared with microsatellite stable tumors. TP53 mutations more often were found in nondiploid tumors but never in tumors with PTEN, KRAS, or beta-catenin mutations, and all PTEN mutations occurred in diploid tumors.;Thus, PTEN, KRAS, beta-catenin, and TP53 mutations occurred in tumors both with and without hyperplasia, but PTEN and TP53 mutations were more common in tumors without hyperplasia. However, none of these genes seems to clearly distinguish tumors with and without hyperplasia, suggesting that other factors may be involved. Conversely, alterations in the PTEN and TP53 genes seem to define distinct subgroups of endometrial carcinoma, the former associated with diploidy and MSI, the latter with macroscopic chromosomal instability.",

        "Doc_abstract":"With the emerging evidence that the five major ovarian carcinoma subtypes (high-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, mucinous, and low-grade serous) are distinct disease entities, management of ovarian carcinoma will become subtype specific in the future. In an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy, we set out to determine if an immunohistochemical panel of molecular markers could reproduce consensus subtype assignment. Immunohistochemical expression of 22 biomarkers were examined on tissue microarrays constructed from 322 archival ovarian carcinoma samples from the British Columbia Cancer Agency archives, for the period between 1984 and 2000, and an independent set of 242 cases of ovarian carcinoma from the Gynaecologic Tissue Bank at Vancouver General Hospital from 2001 to 2008. Nominal logistic regression was used to produce a subtype prediction model for each of these sets of cases. These models were then cross-validated against the other cohort, and then both models were further validated in an independent cohort of 81 ovarian carcinoma samples from five different centers. Starting with data for 22 markers, full model fit, backwards, nominal logistic regression identified the same nine markers (CDKN2A, DKK1, HNF1B, MDM2, PGR, TFF3, TP53, VIM, WT1) as being most predictive of ovarian carcinoma subtype in both the archival and tumor bank cohorts. These models were able to predict subtype in the respective cohort in which they were developed with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity (κ statistics of 0.88±0.02 and 0.86±0.04, respectively). When the models were cross-validated (ie using the model developed in one case series to predict subtype in the other series), the prediction equation's performances were reduced (κ statistics of 0.70±0.04 and 0.61±0.04, respectively) due to differences in frequency of expression of some biomarkers in the two case series. Both models were then validated on the independent series of 81 cases, with very good to excellent ability to predict subtype (κ=0.85±0.06 and 0.78±0.07, respectively). A nine-marker immunohistochemical maker panel can be used to objectively support classification into one of the five major subtypes of ovarian carcinoma.",

In sporadic CRC, aberrant gene promoter methylation has been shown to play a key role in carcinogenesis, although little is known about its involvement in multiplicity. To assess the effect of methylation in tumor multiplicity in sporadic CRC, hypermethylation of key tumor suppressor genes was evaluated in patients with both multiple and solitary tumors, as a proof-of-concept of an underlying epigenetic defect.;We examined a total of 47 synchronous/metachronous primary CRC from 41 patients, and 41 gender, age (5-year intervals) and tumor location-paired patients with solitary tumors. Exclusion criteria were polyposis syndromes, Lynch syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. DNA methylation at the promoter region of the MGMT, CDKN2A, SFRP1, TMEFF2, HS3ST2 (3OST2), RASSF1A and GATA4 genes was evaluated by quantitative methylation specific PCR in both tumor and corresponding normal appearing colorectal mucosa samples. Overall, patients with multiple lesions exhibited a higher degree of methylation in tumor samples than those with solitary tumors regarding all evaluated genes. After adjusting for age and gender, binomial logistic regression analysis identified methylation of MGMT2 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.97; p = 0.008) and RASSF1A (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.13; p = 0.047) as variables independently associated with tumor multiplicity, being the risk related to methylation of any of these two genes 4.57 (95% CI, 1.53 to 13.61; p = 0.006). Moreover, in six patients in whom both tumors were available, we found a correlation in the methylation levels of MGMT2 (r = 0.64, p = 0.17), SFRP1 (r = 0.83, 0.06), HPP1 (r = 0.64, p = 0.17), 3OST2 (r = 0.83, p = 0.06) and GATA4 (r = 0.6, p = 0.24). Methylation in normal appearing colorectal mucosa from patients with multiple and solitary CRC showed no relevant difference in any evaluated gene.;These results provide a proof-of-concept that gene promoter methylation is associated with tumor multiplicity.

        "Doc_abstract":"There are numerous risk factors for the development of malignant melanoma. It has been documented that genetic predisposition exists but exogenous factors are also very important. In familial melanomas it has been well established that mutation in the CDKN2A gene which is located at chromosome 9 leads to a marked risk for malignant melanoma. This tumor-suppressor gene is important for the regulation of the cell cycle and mutation in this gene is associated also with an increased rate of pancreas cancer. The penetrance of this mutation is influenced by UV-energy. In addition it has been shown that a second cluster for the familial atypical nevus syndrome is located at chromosome 1p36. Patients with the rare disease xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the DNA-repair mechanism inherited in an autosomal recessive trait and therefore develop within the first 20 years of life numerous malignant skin tumours including malignant melanomas. But also in non-syndromic patients a decrease of DNA-repair ability may occur. It has been shown recently that reduced DNA-repair ability is an independent risk factor for malignant melanoma and may contribute to susceptibility to sunlight-induced melanoma among the general population. Other constitutional risk factors for the development of malignant melanoma are fair skin, red hair and blue eyes. The most important exogenous risk factor is UV-exposition. Extensive and repetitive sunburns before the age of 15 years are especially predisposing to malignant melanoma. The most important preventive measures are continuous sun-protection including avoidance of sun in noon time on tropical and subtropical places, wearing a hut and sunglasses and application of sun-screens with high sun-protection factor. Furthermore a regular check for changing moles is indicated in persons with multiple atypical nevi or a familial melanoma syndrome. Nowadays molecular genetic screenings are available within research projects for members of melanoma-prone families. The controversy of such possibilities is discussed.",
