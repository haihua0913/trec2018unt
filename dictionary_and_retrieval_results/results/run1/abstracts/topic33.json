        "Doc_abstract":"Cancers of the esophagus and stomach present a major health burden worldwide. In the past 30 years we have witnessed some interesting shifts in terms of epidemiology of esophago gastric cancers. Regardless of a world region, the majority of patients diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancers die from progression or recurrence of their disease. While there are many active cytotoxic agents for esophageal and stomach cancers, their impact on the disease course has been modest at best. Median survival for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer is still less than a year. Therefore, novel strategies, based on our understanding of biology and genetics, are desperately needed. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has been implicated in pathophysiology of many epithelial malignancies, including esophageal and stomach cancers. EGFR inhibitors, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been explored in patients with esophageal and gastric cancers. It appears that tumors of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) may be more sensitive to EGFR blockade than distal gastric adenocarcinomas. Investigations looking into potential molecular predictors of sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors for patients with esophageal and GEJ cancers are ongoing. While we are still searching for those predictors, it is clear that they will be different from ones identified in lung and colorectal cancers. Further development of EGFR inhibitors for esophageal and GEJ cancers should be driven by better understanding of EGFR pathway disregulation that drives cancer progression in a sensitive patient population.",

In the current study we explored the role of EGFR and its potential use as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer. First we analyzed 66 gastric cancer samples of Asian and Caucasian patients for the presence of EGFR mutations. No activating EGFR mutations were found and gefitinib alone was only weakly effective in gastric cancer cell lines. However, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of gefitinib indicating synergistic action. Whole genome expression profiling indicated significant regulation of 120 genes in the case of co-administration of gefitinib and ASA (32 induced, 88 repressed) in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Further analyses indicated that several important signalling pathways were effectively inhibited by simultaneous exposure to gefitinib and ASA. Our findings indicate that although gastric cancer does not seem to harbour mutations which render the cancer cells constitutively susceptible to gefitinib, the co-administration of ASA can strengthen RTK inhibitor activity in adenocarcinoma cells by EGFR activation. This is the first report of effective modulation of EGFR-inhibition activity in cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Since the prognosis of unresectable advanced gastric cancer remains poor, novel therapeutic strategies are needed. Somatic MEK1 gene mutations have been reported as oncogenic activating mutations in gastric cancer, and MEK inhibitors can be effective against such gastric cancers. In the present study, however, activated EGFR and HER2 signals after treatment with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) were found in a MEK1-mutated gastric cancer cell line (OCUM-1 cell line) using a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array. The phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 reactivated ERK1/2, which had been inhibited by trametinib, and EGF stimulation led to resistance to trametinib in this cell line. Lapatinib, an EGFR and an HER2 inhibitor, reversed the activation of ERK1/2 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 and cancelled the resistance. The combination of trametinib and lapatinib synergistically inhibited the cell growth of the OCUM-1 cell line and strongly induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activated EGFR and HER2 signals. These results suggest that the EGFR and HER2 signals play a salvage role and are related to resistance to MEK inhibitors in MEK1‑mutated gastric cancer. Moreover, combination therapy with trametinib and lapatinib can exhibit a synergistic effect and may contribute to overcoming the resistance to MEK inhibitors. ",

Here, we reported significant decrease in microRNA (miRNA)-34a and significant increase in phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) in the resected gastric carcinoma from the patients, compared with adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, strong correlation was detected among these three factors. To examine whether a causal link exists, we used two human gastric carcinoma lines, SNU-5 and HGC27, to study the molecular basis of miRNA-34a, EGFR signaling, and MMP7 activation. We found that EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells activated MMP7 and consequently cancer invasiveness. Both an inhibitor for EGFR and an inhibitor for Akt significantly inhibited the EGF-induced activation of MMP7, suggesting a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade dependent pathway. Moreover, miRNA-34a levels were not affected by EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation. However, overexpression of miRNA-34a antagonized EGF-induced MMP7 activation without affecting EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that miRNA-34 inhibits EGFR signaling via downstream PI3K signaling cascades to regulate MMP7 expression in gastric carcinoma. Thus, miRNA-34a, EGFR, and MMP7 appear to be promising therapeutic targets for preventing the metastasis of gastric carcinoma.",

In 66 curatively treated patients, EGFR expression correlated with disease recurrence and poorer survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In a multivariate model for predicting recurrence and survival, advanced tumor extension (T(3) or T(4)), nodal metastases, and EGFR expression were the only independent covariates. In particular, EGFR expression was shown to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis among gastric cancer patients having the same stage according to the current TNM staging system.;These findings suggest that EGFR expression may be useful in identifying high-risk gastric cancer patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.

        "Doc_abstract":"Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa is strongly associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. However, the mechanisms by which H. pylori causes cancer are currently unknown. Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR) may be important in the development of gastric cancer. This interaction accelerates cell proliferation and migration, and triggers epithelial cell signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of H. pylori on EGFR- and AP-1-mediated signal transduction pathways in the AGS gastric epithelial cell line and gastric tissue from humans.;Cells were treated with H. pylori and cell death was examined at a variety of time points using cell viability and trypan blue exclusion dye assay. To investigate the effects on EGFR regulation, AGS cells were transfected with a full-length and truncated EGFR luciferase (luc) reporter. Tissue microarray containing 44 samples of gastric biopsies from H. pylori-positive patients was analyzed for protein expression level of EGFR by immunohistochemistry.;EGFR promoter activity was increased (twofold) 3 h after treatment with H. pylori commenced. Using a series of EGFR promoter deletion mutants, we identified a region that was crucial for transactivation of the EGFR by H. pylori. To determine whether AP-1 binding was altered, we transfected AGS cells with an AP-1 luciferase construct and then treated them with H. pylori for up to 6 h. We found that AP-1 activity was induced by H. pylori in gastric cells, while electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that binding of AP-1 to the EGFR promoter site was increased following H. pylori treatment. Binding of c-Jun and c-Fos to the EGFR promoter region -1,062/-900 was induced eight- and six fold, respectively, using ChIP assay. Active EGFR staining was markedly increased in gastric mucosa from infected persons, compared to uninfected controls.;We conclude that exposure of gastric cells to H. pylori induces increased production of EGFR through various signal transduction pathways, including those mediated by the EGFR and AP-1. Distinct effects on EGFR activation may specify the subset of AP-1 target genes that are selected, including those involved in proliferation and apoptosis. This is consistent with EGFR activation that was found in the gastric mucosa of humans infected with H. pylori. Hence, the balance between apoptosis and proliferation in these cells may be altered in response to injury caused by H. pylori infection, leading to an increased risk of cancer.",

No association between immunoreactivity of all growth factor receptors and the histopathological structure of gastric cancer was observed. EGFR and c-erbB-3 proteins were detected more frequently in patients with III/IV than in I/II of TNM stages, while c-erbB-2 overexpression was higher in I/II vs. III/IV stages. In chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia and or coexisting carcinoma lesions, a higher frequency of the expression of studied proteins was observed in comparison with chronic gastritis without those alternations; however, these differences were statistically insignificant. The percentage of positive cases with coexpression of two proteins was comparable in gastric cancer and chronic gastritis (33% and 35%) but the simultaneous expression of all three receptors was evident only in gastric cancer (19%). Our results indicate that at least one or two members of EGFR related receptors could appear in the early stages of gastric tumorigenesis.

Tumor specimens from patients with stage III gastric cancer with high or low ND (n = 4 for both) were compared at the mRNA level using Affymetrix microarray (harboring 54,675 genes). The expression data were prioritized, and genes that correlated with ND were selected. Ultimately, the EGFR was validated as such a candidate molecule in patients with primary advanced gastric cancer who underwent standard treatment (n = 167). Expression data of the microarray were prioritized based on gene expression ratio and frequency of gene expression. The first priority genes to be selected were genes that are known to be amplified in cancer, which included NKX2.1, CHST9, CTNND2, SLC25A27, FGFR2, EGFR, and PTGER1. Of these genes, the EGFR gene was of particular interest. EGFR expression in primary gastric cancer was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Student's t-test elucidated a significant difference in EGFR expression between IHC 2+/3+ and IHC 1+ according to ND (P = 0.0035). The Chi-square test also indicated a significant difference between high and low levels of EGFR immunohistochemical staining (IHC2+/3+ and IHC1+, respectively) and ND status (P = 0.0023). According to the least squares method, as ND increased, the risk that EGFR staining levels changed from IHC 1+ to IHC 2+ also increased.

Knowledge of molecular pathways determining the behavior of individual gastric tumors seems to be crucial for therapeutic decisions, and evaluation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression might be critical for prognosis, assessment, and identification of patients that could be treated with tailored therapies.;VEGF and EGFR determination was performed in 88 gastric cancer samples as well as 25 normal gastric mucosa specimens from non-cancer patients using a commercially available immunohistochemistry kit. In all samples, the correlation of VEGF and EGFR expression was investigated with each other, and with other prognostic indicators in all samples, and, finally, with survival rates in 69 patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.;Forty-eight per cent (42 cases) of gastric cancers expressed VEGF, and 44% (39 cases) stained for EGFR. In curatively treated patients, VEGF and EGFR expression was demonstrated to correlate with worse survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Molecular profiling was shown to more accurately estimate the risk of cancer-related death than TNM stage, and, of most interest, to allow sorting out high-risk patients within the same stage.;These findings provide evidence that contemporary evaluation of VEGF and EGFR expression may be crucial to select gastric cancer patients with poor prognosis who may benefit of tailored treatments.",

The present study showed that Cbl-b knockdown caused higher proliferation concomitant with the decrease of apoptosis induced by 5-FU treatment in gastric cancer cell. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that Cbl-b knockdown caused significant increase of phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK and Akt, decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase of expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax.

However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have also proven ineffective against most tumors with EGFR wild-type (WT) alleles. Although some genetic changes, including the KRAS mutation, have been shown to confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, novel strategies for the treatment of cancer patients with tumors harboring EGFR WT alleles have yet to be thoroughly delineated. The principal objective of this study was to improve our current understanding of drug interactions between EGFR and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors in an effort to gain insight into a novel therapeutic strategy against EGFR WT tumors. Using a panel of human EGFR WT gastric cancer cell lines, we showed that gastric cancer cells harboring the KRAS mutation were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition as compared with those cells harboring KRAS and PI3K mutations and KRAS WT alleles. However, all cell lines were found to be resistant to EGFR inhibition. The results from Western blots and phosphoprotein arrays showed that, in MEK inhibitor resistant cell lines, AKT was activated through the EGFR/HER3/PI3K pathway following AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) treatment. Blockade of this feedback mechanism through the targeting of MEK and EGFR resulted in detectable synergistic effects in some cell lines in vitro and in vivo.

Forty cases of GC and the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) were collected, and the expression of EGFR was assessed using immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples. Furthermore, EGFR signaling was blocked by constructed recombinant small hairpin RNA lentiviral vector (Lv-shRAGE) used to transfect into human GC SGC-7901 cells. The expression of AKT, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting assays. Cell proliferative activities and invasive capability were, respectively, determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and Transwell assays. Cell apoptosis and cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. EGFR was found highly expressed in cancer tissues compared with the ANCT and correlated with lymph node metastases. Knockdown of EGFR reduced cell proliferation and invasion of GC with decreased expression of AKT, PCNA and MMP-9 and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest. Upregulation of EGFR expression is associated with lymph node metastases of GC, and blockade of EGFR signaling suppresses growth and invasion of GC cells through AKT pathway, suggesting that EGFR may represent a potential therapeutic target for this aggressive malignancy.

Tumor-associated macrophages are generally considered allies in the process of tumor progression in several types of cancer, although their role on gastric and colorectal carcinomas is still poorly understood. In this report, we studied the influence of primary human macrophages on gastric and colorectal cancer cells, considering invasion, motility/migration, proteolysis and activated intracellular signaling pathways. We demonstrated that macrophages stimulate cancer cell invasion, motility and migration, and that these effects depend on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and on the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (at the residue Y(1086)), PLC-γ (phospholipase C-gamma) and Gab1 (GRB2-associated binding protein-1), as evidenced by siRNA (small interference RNA) experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-immunodepletion impaired macrophage-mediated cancer cell invasion and motility, suggesting that EGF is the pro-invasive and pro-motile factor produced by macrophages. Macrophages also induced gastric and colorectal cancer cell phosphorylation of Akt, c-Src and ERK1/2, and led to an increase of RhoA and Cdc42 activity. Interestingly, whereas macrophage-mediated cancer cell c-Src and ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred downstream EGFR activation, Akt phosphorylation seems to be a parallel event, taking place in an EGFR-independent manner. The involvement of EGF, EGFR-downstream signaling partners and MMPs in macrophage-mediated invasion provides novel insights into the molecular crosstalk established between cancer cells and macrophages, opening new perspectives for the design of new and more efficient therapeutic strategies to counteract cancer cell invasion.

This article examines the relationship between EGFR expression and cancer prognosis based on literature compiled on PubMed between 1985 and September 2000. More than 200 studies were identified that analysed relapse-free-interval or survival data directly in relation to EGFR levels in over 20000 patients. Analysis of the data showed that 10 cancer types both express elevated levels of EGFR relative to normal tissues and have been studied in sufficient depth to allow sound judgements to be made concerning the association between EGFR and patient outlook. The EGFR was found to act as a strong prognostic indicator in head and neck, ovarian, cervical, bladder and oesophageal cancers. In these cancers, increased EGFR expression was associated with reduced recurrence-free or overall survival rates in 70% (52/74) of studies. In gastric, breast, endometrial and colorectal cancers, the EGFR provided more modest prognostic information, correlating to poor survival rates in 52% (13/25) of studies, while in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR expression only rarely (3/10 studies) related to patient outlook. However, it is likely that the true prognostic significance of the EGFR has been underestimated as the published studies only assessed total cellular EGFR levels, rather than the activated form of the receptor, and were not standardised with regard to patient populations or assay methods. Finally, it is important to stress that failure to detect a prognostic significance for EGFR in any one cancer type does not necessarily preclude patients from benefiting from anti-EGFR therapies.",

The present study aimed to determine the contribution of membrane-bound precursors of TGF-alpha in enhancing EGFR activation in the gastric and colonic mucosa during aging. The extent of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, a measure of EGFR activation, was substantially higher (300--350%) in the gastric and colonic mucosa of 23- (aged) vs. 4-mo-old (young) Fischer 344 rats. This was accompanied by an increase (200--1,000%) in the relative concentration of 18- to 20-kDa membrane-bound precursor forms of TGF-alpha. The amount of TGF-alpha bound to EGFR was also higher (150-250%) in the gastric and colonic mucosa of aged vs. young rats. In vitro studies revealed that exposure of HCT 116 cells (a colon cancer cell line) to TGF-alpha from gastric and colonic mucosal membranes of aged rats caused a 200--250% higher activation of EGFR and extracellular signal-related kinases (p42/44) compared with young rats.

Association studies between EGFR alterations and the clinical pathological features of the tumours were performed.;Within the 77 primary gastric carcinomas we found two EGFR somatic mutations and several EGFR polymorphisms in exon 20. Six different intronic sequence variants of EGFR were also found. Four gastric carcinomas showed balanced polysomy or EGFR gene amplification. We verified that gastric carcinoma with alterations of EGFR (somatic mutations or copy number variation) showed a significant increase of tumour size (p = 0.0094) in comparison to wild-type EGFR carcinomas.;We demonstrate that EGFR structural alterations are rare in gastric carcinoma, but whenever present, it leads to tumour growth. We considered that searching for EGFR alterations in gastric cancer is likely to be clinically important in order to identify patients susceptible to respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

The protein expressions of HER2, EGFR, MET and FGFR2 were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and the gene amplifications of HER2, EGFR and MET were examined using dual-color in situ hybridization.;The frequency of overexpression was 11.8% for HER2, 23.5% for EGFR, 24.9 % for MET and 31.1% for FGFR2. Whereas strong staining for each of the RTKs was heterogeneous, tumors with homogeneously strong staining areas often exhibited gene amplification. Strong EGFR expression was significantly associated with a poor outcome, but no prognostic correlations were observed in other RTKs. The overexpression of single and multiple RTKs was observed in 40.4 and 22.7% of the cases, respectively.

The present investigation examines the age-related changes in gastric mucosal tyrosine kinase activity and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) and its structural and functional analog p185c-erbB-2, the protein product of c-erbB-2/c-neu protooncogene. We observed a significantly higher intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2 in the gastric mucosa of 24-mo-old (aged) rats than in that of their 4- or 12-mo-old counterparts. This was associated with increased levels of EGFR protein and steady-state mRNA levels of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2. In addition, we also observed threefold higher steady-state mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha; one of the primary ligands of EGFR) in the gastric mucosa of aged rats than in that of 4-mo-old (young) animals. This was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the relative concentration of the 18-kDa precursor form of TGF-alpha in gastric mucosal membranes but not in the cytosol. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that aging is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2 in the gastric mucosa. Moreover, the observation that aging results in increased accumulation of TGF-alpha in gastric mucosal membranes raises the possibility that the membrane-bound TGF-alpha could partly be responsible for the constitutively active EGFR-induced signaling pathway in the gastric mucosa of aged rats and, in turn, for stimulation of mucosal proliferative activity.",

Here, we report that overexpression of the EGFR ligand betacellulin (BTC) results in a severe, age-dependent hyperplasia of foveolar epithelium. The stomach weight of affected mice reached up to 3g representing more than 10% of total body weight. The preexisting corpus mucosa was severely depleted, and both parietal and chief cells were replaced by proliferating foveolar epithelium. The lesions were more severe in male as compared to female transgenic mice, and partially regressed in the former after castration-mediated androgen removal. The gastric hyperplasia fully disappeared when BTC-tg mice were crossed into the Egfr(Wa5) background expressing a dominant-negative EGFR, indicating that the phenotype is EGFR-dependent.

Interestingly, we found that EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis is existed differently between gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cell lines.

In addition, we found that Rab25 was differentially expressed in between gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cells. Rab25 knockdown caused the changed EGFR endocytosis and reverted the gefitinib response in gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer with wtEGFR in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel insight that EGFR endocytosis is a rational therapeutic target in lung cancer with wtEGFR, in which the combined efficacy with gefitinib is expected.

Cells were treated with various concentrations of SFE and cell viability, morphology, intracellular ROS, migration and different signaling protein expressions were investigated. The results indicate that SFE decreases AGS cell viability and induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Intracellular ROS generation, dose- and time-dependent Bax/Bcl2 alteration and signaling proteins like cytochrome c, Casp-3, Casp-8 and PARP-1 higher expression demonstrated the SFE-induced apoptotic pathway in AGS cells. Again, SFE induced apoptosis also accompanied by the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) like JNK and P-38. Moreover, dose-dependent EGFR, p-ERK1/2 down-regulation and cell migration inhibition at non-toxic concentration confirms SFE activity in AGS cell migration inhibition.

YB-1 knockdown induced drug resistance to lapatinib, a dual EGFR and HER2 kinase inhibitor, and also to erlotinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Moreover, phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) was not markedly affected by lapatinib or erlotinib when YB-1 was silenced. Nuclear YB-1 expression was significantly (P = 0.026) associated with HER2 expression, but not with EGFR or HER3, in patients with gastric cancer (n = 111).

Unlike lung cancers with EGFR kinase domain (KD) mutations, GBMs respond poorly to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Using RNAi, we show that GBM cells carrying EGFR EC mutations display EGFR addiction. In contrast to KD mutants found in lung cancer, glioma-specific EGFR EC mutants are poorly inhibited by EGFR inhibitors that target the active kinase conformation (e.g., erlotinib). Inhibitors that bind to the inactive EGFR conformation, however, potently inhibit EGFR EC mutants and induce cell death in EGFR-mutant GBM cells. Our results provide first evidence for single kinase addiction in GBM and suggest that the disappointing clinical activity of first-generation EGFR inhibitors in GBM versus lung cancer may be attributed to the different conformational requirements of mutant EGFR in these 2 cancer types.;Approximately 40% of human glioblastomas harbor oncogenic EGFR alterations, but attempts to therapeutically target EGFR with first-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors have failed. Here, we demonstrate selective sensitivity of glioma-specific EGFR mutants to ATP-site competitive EGFR kinase inhibitors that target the inactive conformation of the catalytic domain.",

EGFR expression was determined by FACS and quantitative PCR in GC cells. Experimental 5-fluorouracil (5FU) was used instead of S-1 for in vitro experiments. The efficacy of 5FU or cetuximab monotherapy or combination 5FU/cetuximab therapy was examined in vitro and in vivo. Clinical specimens were examined for EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR expression score was defined as strong membrane and cytoplasmic staining in at least 50-75% of cells. The combination of 5FU and cetuximab synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in GC cells with EGFR overexpression. Cetuximab also induced down-regulation of phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT, leading to diminished signaling. The antitumor effect of the combination of S-1 and cetuximab in vivo was also greater than that of either drug alone.

Although most EGFR-mutant lung cancers are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and shrink in response to treatment, acquired resistance to TKI therapy is common. We demonstrate here that two EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, HCC827 and HCC4006, contain a subpopulation of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and survive independent of activated EGFR. These EGFR-independent cancer cells, herein termed gefitinib-resistant (GR) cells, demonstrate higher levels of basal autophagy than their parental cells and thrive under hypoxic, reduced-serum conditions in vitro; this somewhat simulates the hypoxic environment common to cancerous tissues. We show that depletion of the essential autophagy gene, ATG5, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, markedly reduces GR cell viability under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, we show a significant elevation in caspase activity in GR cells following knockdown of ATG5. These results suggest that GR cells can evade apoptosis and survive in hostile, hypoxic environments with constant autophagic flux. We also show the presence of autophagosomes in some cancer cells from patient samples, even in untreated EGFR-mutant lung cancer tissue samples. Together, our results indicate that autophagy inhibitors alone or in combination with EGFR TKIs may be an effective approach for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancers, where basal autophagy of some cancer cells is upregulated.

We found that breast tumor kinase (Brk)/protein-tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase highly expressed in most human breast tumors, interacted with EGFR and sustained ligand-induced EGFR signaling. We demonstrate that Brk inhibits ligand-induced EGFR degradation through uncoupling activated EGFR from casitas B-lineage lymphoma-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. In addition, upon activation by EGFR, Brk directly phosphorylated Y845 in the EGFR kinase domain, thereby further potentiating EGFR kinase activity. Experimental elevation of Brk conferred resistance of breast cancer cells to cetuximab (an EGFR-blocking antibody)-induced inhibition of cell signaling and proliferation, whereas knockdown of Brk sensitized the cells to cetuximab by inducing apoptosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation plays a critical role in cancer development. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis, including prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and plays a key role in both inflammation and cancer. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of COX-2 and PGE(2) receptor signaling results in the suppression of tumor development in a variety of animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying COX-2/PGE(2)-associated inflammation in carcinogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. In order to study the role of PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses in tumorigenesis, it is important to use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human cancer development from molecular mechanisms with construction of tumor microenvironment. We have developed a gastritis model (K19-C2mE mice) in which an inflammatory microenvironment is constructed in the stomach via induction of the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway. We also developed a gastric cancer mouse model (Gan mice) in which the mice develop inflammation-associated gastric tumors via activation of both the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway and Wnt signaling. Expression analyses using these in vivo models have revealed novel mechanisms of the inflammatory responses underlying gastric cancer development. PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling through the induction of EGFR ligands and ADAMs that release EGFR ligands from the cell membrane. In Gan mice, a combination treatment with EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors significantly suppresses gastric tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGE(2)-associated inflammation downregulates tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-7, in gastric cancer cells, which suppresses epithelial differentiation. These results indicate that PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses promote in vivo gastric tumorigenesis via several different molecular mechanisms.",

Herein, we demonstrated that M. hyorhinis p37 protein expression in gastric cancer tissues predicts poor survival and associates with metastasis. M. hyorhinis infects mammalian cells and promotes gastric cancer cell invasiveness via its membrane protein p37. Synthesized peptide corresponding to the N-terminus of p37 prevents M. hyorhinis infection. Host Annexin A2 (ANXA2) interacts with the N-terminus of p37. In addition, EGFR forms a complex with p37 and ANXA2, and is required for M. hyorhinis-induced phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of ANXA2. M. hyorhinis infection is inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ANXA2 or EGFR, but is enhanced by expression of ectopic ANXA2 or EGFR. Downstream of ANXA2 and EGFR, the NF-κB pathway is activated and mediates M. hyorhinis-driven cell migration.

Here, we report that gallic acid induces apoptosis in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, but not in EGFR-WT NSCLC cells. Treatment with gallic acid resulted in a significant reduction in proliferation and induction of apoptosis, only in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Interestingly, treatment with gallic acid led to a robust decrease in EGFR levels, which is critical for NSCLC survival. Treatment with gallic acid had no significant effect on transcription, but induced EGFR turnover. Indeed, treatment with a proteasome inhibitor dramatically reversed gallic acid-induced EGFR downregulation. Moreover, treatment with gallic acid induced EGFR turnover leading to apoptosis in EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)-resistant cell lines, which are dependent on EGFR signaling for survival. Thus, these studies suggest that gallic acid can induce apoptosis in EGFR-dependent lung cancers that are dependent on EGFR for growth and survival via acceleration of EGFR turnover. ",

The mechanism of this resistance is unknown; however, we have recently shown that Met kinase activity compensates for loss of EGFR kinase activity in cell culture models. Met has been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast tumors and therefore may cooperate with EGFR for tumor growth. Here we have found that EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation is in part regulated by Met expression. In addition, we found that Met constitutive phosphorylation occurred independent of the Met ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Ligand-independent Met phosphorylation is mediated by Met amplification, mutation, or overexpression and by Met interaction with other cell surface molecules. In SUM229 breast cancer cells, we found that Met was not amplified or mutated, however it was overexpressed. Met overexpression did not directly correlate with ligand-independent Met phosphorylation as the SUM229 cell line was the only Met expressing breast cancer line with constitutive Met phosphorylation. Interestingly, Met expression did correlate with EGFR expression and we identified an EGFR/Met complex via co-immunoprecipitation. However, we only observed Met constitutive phosphorylation when c-Src also was part of this complex. Ligand-independent phosphorylation of Met was decreased by down regulating EGFR expression or by inhibiting c-Src kinase activity. Lastly, inhibiting EGFR and Met kinase activities resulted in a synergistic decrease in cell proliferation, supporting the idea that EGFR and Met functionally, as well as physically interact in breast cancer cells to regulate response to EGFR inhibitors.",

Several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR have shown clinical efficacy in lung and colon cancers, but no benefit has been noted in breast cancer. Thirteen EGFR expressing breast cancer cell lines were analyzed for response to EGFR TKIs. Seven were found to be EGFR TKI resistant; while shRNA knockdown of EGFR determined that four of these cell lines retained the requirement of EGFR protein expression for growth. Interestingly, EGFR localized to plasma membrane lipid rafts in all four of these EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines, as determined by biochemical raft isolation and immunofluorescence. When lipid rafts were depleted of cholesterol using lovastatin, all four cell lines were sensitized to EGFR TKIs. In fact, the effects of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors and gefitinib were synergistic. While gefitinib effectively abrogated phosphorylation of Akt- and mitogen-activated protein kinase in an EGFR TKI-sensitive cell line, phosphorylation of Akt persisted in two EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines, however, this phosphorylation was abrogated by lovastatin treatment. Thus, we have shown that lipid raft localization of EGFR correlates with resistance to EGFR TKI-induced growth inhibition and pharmacological depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts decreases this resistance in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have presented evidence to suggest that when EGFR localizes to lipid rafts, these rafts provide a platform to facilitate activation of Akt signaling in the absence of EGFR kinase activity.",

We found that the expression level of Rab11-FIP2 was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues and high expression of Rab11-FIP2 was closely correlated with nodal metastasis in gastric cancer patients. Rab11-FIP2 overexpression promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a manner associated with gastric cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We also found that hypoxia could enhance the expression of Rab11-FIP2 through HIF-1α. Inactivation of Rab11-FIP2 dramatically decreased hypoxia-induced migration of gastric cancer cells. Suppression of the internalization of EGFR, at least in part, plays an important role in EMT induced by overexpression of Rab11-FIP2 in gastric cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that Rab11-FIP2 could regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

Serum EGF levels in gastric cancer cases were significantly lower than those in controls (p=0.012). There were no correlations between the serum EGF levels according to EGF A61G genotype and allelic distributions in patients with gastric cancer.;Our findings suggested that EGF A61G gene variations and EGF serum levels might be associated with the risk of gastric cancer.",

Coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) plays a critical role in tumor response to targeted therapeutics. We examined concomitant overexpression of EGFR and MET in patients with HER2(+) and HER2(-) gastric cancers (GCs). Tissue microarray samples obtained from 1,589 GC patients who received R0 gastrectomy with extensive node dissection and adjuvant chemoradiationtherapy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. HER2(+) was observed in 169 patients (11%). Out of 169 HER2(+) patients, 15 (9%) were EGFR(+) and MET(+) , 29 (17%) were EGFR(+) , 37 (22%) were MET(+) and the remaining 88 patients (52%) were HER2(+) only, without concomitant EGFR or MET overexpression. Greater number of overexpressed RTKs correlated with younger age (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p = 0.027), intestinal histology (p < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (p = 0.002). The mean overall survival was 113 months for HER2(-) /EGFR(-) /MET(-) and 63 months for HER2(+) /EGFR(+) /MET(+) subgroups. Patients with HER2(+) /EGFR(+) /MET(+) GCs had a substantial risk of death with a hazard ratio of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.54-5.90), compared with HER2(-) /EGFR(-) /MET(-) GC patients. Using patient-derived tumor cell models isolated from pericardial effusion of HER2(+) and MET(+) GC cases, we demonstrated that the combination of HER2-inhibitor (lapatinib) and MET-inhibitor offered a more profound inhibition in the ERK/AKT pathway and cell proliferation than lapatinib alone. Co-overexpression of RTKs was demonstrated in small subsets of GC associated with aggressive behavior and in these cases, combination therapy may be considered as potential treatment options. ",

In this study, we showed a novel signal transduction pathway using two human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN28 and MKN74. Both gastric cancer cells expressed leptin and its receptors (Ob-R) at the protein level. We found that leptin, even at as low as 0.1 ng/mL, induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Time-course experiments revealed that phosphorylation was maximal after 5 minutes of stimulation and declined thereafter. We also revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR induced by leptin was significantly attenuated by two inhibitors, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478, and a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001. This indicates that the pathway of EGFR transactivation induced by leptin is dependent on proteolytically released EGFR ligands. Leptin induced JAK2 activation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation in these gastric cancer cells, both of which occurred after the peak of EGFR transactivation. Pretreatment of gastric cancer cells with AG1478 significantly reduced the degree of phosphorylation of both JAK2 and ERK1/2. These findings indicate the involvement of EGFR transactivation in the activation of JAK2 and ERK1/2. Our results reveal that EGFR transactivation is involved in the leptin signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, which extends the physiologic action of leptin beyond its central effects in the hypothalamus to regulate body weight.",

Several molecular pathways underlying mechanisms of this disease have been partly elucidated, among which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is one of the well-known signaling cascades that plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of the EGFR signaling is frequently found in lung cancer. The strategies to effectively inhibit EGFR signaling pathway have been mounted for developing anticancer therapeutic agents. However, most anti-EGFR-targeted agents fail to repress cancer progression because of developing drug-resistance. Therefore, studies of the mechanisms underpinning the resistance toward anti-EGFR agents may provide important findings for lung cancer treatment using anti-EGFR therapies. Recently, increasing numbers of miRNAs are correlated with the drug resistance of lung cancer cells to anti-EGFR agents, indicating that miRNAs may serve as novel targets and/or promising predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy. In this paper, we summarize the emerging role of miRNAs as regulators to modulate the EGFR signaling and the resistance of lung cancer cells to anti-EGFR therapy. We also highlight the evidence supporting the use of miRNAs as biomarkers for response to anti-EGFR agents and as novel therapeutic targets to circumvent the resistance of lung cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors.

The loss of palmitoylation increases sustained EGFR signal activation and sensitizes cells to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. Our work shows that the reversible modification of EGFR with palmitate \"pins\" the unstructured C-terminal tail to the plasma membrane, impeding EGFR activation. We identify by mass spectrometry palmitoylated cysteine residues within the C-terminal tail where mutation of the cysteine residues to alanine is sufficient to activate EGFR signaling promoting cell migration and transformation.

Fifty-three patient specimens of cervical cancer were analysed for HPV infection, for EGFR mutations in exons 18 through 21, and for expression of EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin by immunostaining. Results showed that 79.24% of the cases (42/53) are HPV positive and the HPV types more closely associated with risk are HPV 16 and 18.

Although this EGFR transactivation reportedly requires a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) that sheds the ectodomain of EGFR ligands, the detailed mechanisms are still unknown. This study evaluated the mechanism of interleukin (IL)-8- and IL-1beta-dependent shedding of the EGFR ligand in KATO III cells.;We established transfectants stably expressing alkaline phosphatase-tagged heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), transforming growth factor alpha, or amphiregulin precursors, and depleted ADAM proteins, using short interfering RNA against ADAM10, 12, or 17. We assessed shedding of EGFR ligands by measuring AP activities in the conditioned media after IL-1beta or IL-8 stimulation. EGFR activation was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibody. KB-R7785 and anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody were used to inhibit activities of ADAMs and IL-8 action, respectively.;IL-8 dose dependently released the EGFR ligands and transiently phosphorylated EGFR, with a peak at 15 minutes. KB-R7785 completely blocked IL-8-induced shedding and EGFR transactivation. Depletion of ADAM10 also dramatically reduced IL-8-induced shedding and EGFR transactivation, but depletion of ADAM12 and 17 did not. IL-1beta dose dependently enhanced shedding of HB-EGF, which was not blocked by KB-R7785 in the early phase. In the late phase, however, the EGFR transactivation was blocked by KB-R7785 and abrogated by anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody.;IL-8 induces shedding of EGFR ligands because of an ADAM10-dependent pathway in gastric cancer cells, whereas IL-1beta acts principally by an ADAM-independent pathway. IL-1beta-dependent prolonged EGFR transactivation involves multiple pathways, including an IL-8-dependent pathway.",

We tested this hypothesis using genetically engineered mouse models and find that loss of Dok2 in the mouse accelerates lung tumorigenesis initiated by oncogenic EGFR, but not that initiated by mutated Kras. Moreover, we find that DOK2 participates in a negative feedback loop that opposes mutated EGFR; EGFR mutation leads to recruitment of DOK2 to EGFR and DOK2-mediated inhibition of downstream activation of RAS.

However, it is clear that mutations and/or genetic variations in EGFR alone cannot explain all of the variability in the responses of patients with NSCLC to EGFR-targeted therapies. For instance, in addition to EGFR genotype, genetic variations in other members of the signaling pathway downstream of EGFR or variations in parallel receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways are now recognized to have a significant impact on the efficacy of certain EGFR-targeted therapies. In this review, we highlight the mutations and genetic variations in such genes downstream of EGFR and in parallel RTK pathways. Specifically, the directional effects of these pharmacogenetic factors are discussed with a focus on two commonly prescribed EGFR inhibitors: cetuximab and erlotinib. The results of this comprehensive review can be used to optimize the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR inhibitors.

All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30- to 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and up to 100-fold less potent against wild-type EGFR, than quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors in vitro.

Knockdown of 172 individual endocytosis and actin-regulatory genes with small interfering RNAs led to the identification of 14 genes of which the contribution to EGFR endocytosis in breast cancer is until now poorly defined, including DNAJC6, GDI2, FGD6, HAX1, NECAP2 and AnxA2. We show that depletion of the actin and endocytosis regulatory protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) in a panel of four triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines affected EGFR endocytosis. Depletion of AnxA2 in the aggressive and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line resulted in the inhibition of EGFR transport beyond the early endosomes. This inhibition coincided with enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell migration and downstream signaling via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt. Moreover, AnxA2 knockdown increased lung metastasis formation in mice. The effect of AnxA2 knockdown on EGFR endocytosis in MDA-MB-231 was related to dephosphorylation/activation of the actin-severing protein cofilin, as re-expression of an inactive S3E-cofilin mutant, but not an active S3A-cofilin mutant, re-established EGFR endocytosis to control levels. Together, our data provide evidence for AnxA2 as a mediator of EGFR endocytosis and signaling in breast cancer via regulation of cofilin activation. ",

Patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer with this mutation show dramatic clinical responses to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, whose effectiveness has been established recently in large clinical trials. Most of the mechanisms responsible for resistance to treatment, which most responders experience eventually, have been elucidated, and methods to overcome resistance have been developed. In addition to the clinical benefit, understanding EGFR mutations sheds new light on the molecular and pathological aspects of this adenocarcinoma subset, which include frequent development in nonsmokers or females, and particular clusters within the molecular classification in lung cancer. In contrast to the involvement of EGFR mutations in the early stage of lung adenocarcinoma development, EGFR amplification is superimposed on the progression to invasive cancer. In this review, I summarize the clinicopathological characteristics of EGFR mutations in lung cancer. I also provide an overview of the current understanding of the lung adenocarcinoma subset harboring EGFR mutations with special reference to the molecular classification of lung cancer and the novel concept of the \"terminal respiratory unit.\"",

We report herein the effects and mechanisms of action of the antibody cetuximab in lung cancer cells that naturally express receptor mutations and in ErbB-null 32D hematopoietic cells transfected with mutant EGFR. Treatment with cetuximab down-regulated EGFR levels and inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. This was associated with inhibition of ligand-independent EGFR signaling. These effects were seen in 32D cells arguing the growth inhibitory action was not because of the blockade of autocrine ligand action. Both antibody-induced EGFR down-regulation and inhibition of growth required receptor dimerization as monovalent Fab fragments only eliminated receptor levels or reduced cell proliferation in the presence of antihuman IgG. Finally, cetuximab inhibited growth of H1975 lung cancer cells and xenografts, which expressed L858R/T790M EGFR and were resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

We recently reported that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces resistance to EGFR-TKIs by activating the Met/PI3K pathway. HGF is also known to induce angiogenesis in cooperation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is an important therapeutic target in lung cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of HGF and VEGF may be therapeutically useful for controlling HGF-induced EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer. We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. HGF stimulated VEGF production by activation of the Met/Gab1 signaling pathway in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines, and E7050 showed an inhibitory effect. In a xenograft model, tumors produced by HGF-transfected Ma-1 (Ma-1/HGF) cells were more angiogenic than vector control tumors and showed resistance to gefitinib. E7050 alone inhibited angiogenesis and retarded growth of Ma-1/HGF tumors. E7050 combined with gefitinib induced marked regression of tumor growth. Moreover, dual inhibition of HGF and VEGF by neutralizing antibodies combined with gefitinib also markedly regressed tumor growth.

While anti-EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated clinical success in specific cancers, most patients demonstrate either intrinsic or acquired resistance within one year of treatment. Many mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors have been identified, one of these being attributed to alternatively localized EGFR from the cell membrane into the cell's nucleus. Inside the nucleus, EGFR functions as a co-transcription factor for several genes involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and as a tyrosine kinase to activate and stabilize proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA dependent protein kinase. Nuclear localized EGFR is highly associated with disease progression, worse overall survival in numerous cancers, and enhanced resistance to radiation, chemotherapy, and the anti-EGFR therapies gefitinib and cetuximab. In this review the current knowledge of how nuclear EGFR enhances resistance to cancer therapeutics is discussed, in addition to highlighting ways to target nuclear EGFR as an anti-cancer strategy in the future.

A combination of cell viability assay, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that PS-101 induced EGFR-dependent inhibition selectivity. Further studies showed that PS-101 caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, changed cell size, induced apoptosis and led to cell death by increasing the proportion of sub-G1 cells. Molecular mechanism studies suggested that blocking the EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway is essential for PS-101-induced apoptosis. The contribution of blocking the EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway was verified through examines abundance of likely candidate proteins and RNA interference. The root cause for increase in BAD and decrease in Bcl-2 which altogether initiated caspase-dependent apoptosis were predominantly due to down-regulation the expression of EGFR after PS-101 treatment. PS-101 strongly down-regulated the EGFR expression to trigger proapototic protein BAD increase and antiproapototic protein Bcl-2 decrease, which altogether actived effector caspase-3/9 to initiate cell apoptisis. Taken together, these results suggest that PS-101 may be a potential candidate for cancer therapy against human lung cancer. ",

The phenotypic diversity of cancer cells caused by genetic or epigenetic alterations (intratumor heterogeneity) confers treatment failure and may foster tumor evolution through Darwinian selection. Recently, we found DDX3X as the protein that was preferentially expressed in murine melanoma with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes by proteome analysis. In this study, we transfected PC9, human lung cancer cells harboring EGFR exon19 deletion, with cDNA encoding DDX3X and found that DDX3X, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, induced CSC-like phenotypes and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) accompanied with loss of sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. DDX3X expression was associated with upregulation of Sox2 and increase of cancer cells exhibiting CSC-like phenotypes, such as anchorage-independent proliferation, strong expression of CD44, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The EMT with switching from E-cadherin to N-cadherin was also facilitated by DDX3X. Either ligand-independent or ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in lung cancer cells that strongly expressed DDX3X. Lack of EGFR signal addiction resulted in resistance to EGFR-TKI. Moreover, we found a small nonadherent subpopulation that strongly expressed DDX3X accompanied by the same stem cell-like properties and the EMT in parental PC9 cells. The unique subpopulation lacked EGFR signaling and was highly resistant to EGFR-TKI. In conclusion, our data indicate that DDX3X may play a critical role for inducing phenotypic diversity, and that treatment targeting DDX3X may overcome primary resistance to EGFR-TKI resulting from intratumor heterogeneity.

The introduction of new antitarget drugs has introduced a new perspective in cancer treatment in general and gastric cancer in particular. Nevertheless, few studies have been developed with this generation of drugs. The monoclonal antibody antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cetuximab and the antiangiogenic bevacizumab have been used in phase I and II studies with good results, which need to be confirmed in new phase III studies. The carcinogenesis of this tumor provides information regarding two transcription and signaling pathways of great interest and with therapeutic potential. Infection by Helicobacter pylori is recognized as the cause of gastric cancer development, and there are two elements that play an important role in this process: the CagA gene, whose protein is introduced in the cell by H. pylori initiates the process; and the hedgehog signaling pathway, which regulates the gastric mucosa and is very frequently activated in gastric cancer. Taking action on these agents may be a new and effective method of treating gastric cancer, and therefore must be researched.",

PM scores of EGFR ctDNA with activating mutations decreased rapidly in response to EGFR-TKI. Of the 14 patients with positive pretreatment PM scores, complete disappearance of major EGFR ctDNA was observed in 14.3%, 42.9%, and 57.1% on days 2 - 4, 8, and 15, respectively. These responses of EGFR ctDNA were most prominent among the measures used to evaluate responses, and correlated with early radiologic responses evaluated by chest X-rays.;EGFR ctDNA in serial plasma samples was amplified and 105 copies were sequenced with a next-generation sequencer. Plasma mutation (PM) score was defined as the number of reads containing deletions/substitutions in 105EGFR cell free DNA (cfDNA).

The activation of EGFR by phosphorylation is balanced by receptor kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities. However, the mechanisms of negative EGFR regulation by tyrosine phosphatases remain largely unexplored. Our previous results indicate that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is down-regulated in a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a poor prognosis. Here we identified PTPRO as a phosphatase that negatively regulates SRC by directly dephosphorylating Y416 phosphorylation site. SRC activation triggered by PTPRO down-regulation induces phosphorylation of both EGFR at Y845 and the c-CBL ubiquitin ligase at Y731. Increased EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 promotes its receptor activity, whereas enhanced phosphorylation of c-CBL triggers its degradation promoting EGFR stability. Importantly, hyperactivation of SRC/EGFR signaling triggered by loss of PTPRO leads to high resistance of colon cancer to EGFR inhibitors. Our results not only highlight the PTPRO contribution in negative regulation of SRC/EGFR signaling but also suggest that tumors with low PTPRO expression may be therapeutically targetable by anti-SRC therapies.

However, evidence of resistance to these drugs has been described and extensive studies have been performed to investigate whether resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy is primary or secondary. Cellular levels of EGFR do not always correlate with response to the EGFR inhibitors. Indeed, in spite of the over expression and efficient inhibition of EGFR, resistance to EGFR inhibitors may occur.

        "Doc_abstract":"The abnormal activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is strongly associated with a variety of human cancers but the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. By using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we find that EGFR proteins form nanoclusters in the cell membrane of both normal lung epithelial cells and lung cancer cells, but the number and size of clusters significantly increase in lung cancer cells. The formation of EGFR clusters is mediated by the ionic interaction between the anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane and the juxtamembrane (JM) region of EGFR. Disruption of EGFR clustering by PIP2 depletion or JM region mutation impairs EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Furthermore, JM region mutation in constitutively active EGFR mutant attenuates its capability of cell transformation. Collectively, our findings highlight the key roles of anionic phospholipids in EGFR signaling and function, and reveal a novel mechanism to explain the aberrant activation of EGFR in cancers. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. The frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has ranged from 5-30%, depending on the population studied. Lung cancer patients with tumor EGFR activating mutations have a more favorable prognosis than those without. With regard to second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) following platinum-based chemotherapy, its tumor response rate was less than first-line TKIs in patients with EGFR mutations. The change of EGFR mutation status during disease course may partially explain the difference in the predictive value of EGFR mutation between first- and second-line TKIs treatment. First-line chemotherapy may have influence on status of EGFR mutations, and thus, EGFR mutation status collected from the initial specimens for diagnosis might be inadequate for predicting efficacy of EGFR-TKI treatment after first-line chemotherapy. Intratumoral heterogeneity in the initial single tumor biopsy specimen could also lead to misinterpretation of the tumor EGFR mutation status and difficulty in making precise treatment decision. Many investigators used plasma EGFR mutation obtained from peripheral blood samples to represent the post-chemotherapy EGFR mutation status. However, many studies revealed that plasma EGFR mutation could not completely represent EGFR mutation status in the tumor tissue. There could be many reasons for the change of EGFR mutation status after chemotherapy. Influence of chemotherapy on EGFR mutation status may be one of the explanations for this phenomenon. Intratumoral heterogeneity also plays an important role in diversity of tumor EGFR mutation status. Further studies will be necessary to explain the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced EGFR mutation change. ",

Several anti-EGFR therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed, which has enabled clinicians to identify and treat specific patient cohorts.;This review covers the basic mechanism of EGFR activation and the role of EGFR signaling in cancer progression. Furthermore, current developments made toward targeting the EGFR signaling pathway for the treatment of epithelial cancers and a summary of the various anti-EGFR therapeutic agents that are currently in use are also presented in this review.;EGFR signaling is a part of a complex network that has been the target of effective cancer therapies.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the intrinsic invasive properties of NSCLC cells with differing EGFR status and examine possible therapeutic targets that can abrogate invasive growth.;Collagen-based assays and 3D cell cultures were used to assess morphological features, actin cytoskeleton dynamics and the invasive capacity of NSCLC cell lines with differing EGFR status.

Knockdown of wild-type and mutant EGFR leads to depletion of active and total MYPT1 levels. Combined pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of ROCK/EGFR suppresses the hallmarks of cancer cells and abrogates the invasive phenotype in EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells.;These observations suggest that combined targeting of the ROCK and EGFR/HER pathways may be a potential therapeutic approach in limiting invasive growth in NSCLC.",

Current anti-EGFR therapies, such as cetuximab (Erbitux), gefitinib (Iressa), or trastuzumab (Herceptin), target EGFR or HER-2 but not both. Because solid tumors express different EGFRs, identification of inhibitor(s), targeting multiple EGFR family members may provide a therapeutic benefit to a broader patient population. We have identified a natural inhibitor of EGFRs called EGFR-related protein (ERRP), a 53 to 55 kDa protein that is present in most, if not all, normal human epithelial cells. The growth of colon (HCT-116, Caco2, and HT-29) and breast (MDA-MB-468 and SKBR-3) cancer cells expressing varying levels of EGFR, HER-2, and/or HER-4 was inhibited by recombinant ERRP in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, ERRP caused no inhibition of growth of normal mouse fibroblast cell lines (NIH-3T3, NIH-3T3/P67), and the growth of nontransformed rat small intestinal IEC-6 cells expressing relatively low levels of EGFRs was inhibited only at high doses of ERRP. Transforming growth factor-alpha or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-induced activation of EGFR and HER-2 was inhibited by ERRP in colon and breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR or HER-2. In contrast, cetuximab inhibited the growth- and ligand-induced activation of EGFR in cell lines expressing high levels of EGFR, whereas trastuzumab was effective only in HER-2-overexpressing cells. ERRP and trastuzumab, but not cetuximab, attenuated heregulin-alpha-induced activation of colon and breast cancer cells that expressed high levels of HER-2. Furthermore, ERRP, but not cetuximab or trastuzumab, significantly induced apoptosis of colon and breast cancer cells. None of these agents induced apoptosis of either NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast or normal rat small intestinal IEC cells. Our results suggest that ERRP is an effective pan-erbB inhibitor and, thus, may be a potential therapeutic agent for a wide variety of epithelial cancers expressing different levels and subclasses of EGFRs.",

Similarly, the C225/425 antibody combination more effectively inhibited AKT and MAPK phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells. Surface plasmon resonance, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that mAbs C225 and 425 simultaneously bind to distinct antigenic epitopes on domain III of the soluble wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, neither mAb competed with the other for binding to cells expressing either wild-type EGFR or a mutant EGFR (EGFRvIII) associated with neoplasia. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that residues S460/G461 in EGFR domain III are essential components of the 425 epitope and clearly distinguish it from the EGF/ TGFalpha binding site and the C225 interaction interface.

Here, we analyzed the relationship between PAR1 activation, proliferation, invasion, and the signaling pathways downstream of PAR1 activation in gastric cancer.;We established a PAR1 stably transfected MKN45 human gastric cancer cell line (MKN45/PAR1) and performed cell proliferation and invasion assays employing this cell line and MKN28 cell line exposed to PAR1 agonists (alpha-thrombin and TFLLR-NH2). We also quantified NF-kappaB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the level of Tenascin-C (TN-C) expression in conditioned medium by ELISA of MKN45/PAR1 following administration of alpha-thrombin. A high molecular weight concentrate was derived from the resultant conditioned medium and subsequent cultures of MKN45/PAR1 and MKN28 were exposed to the resultant concentrate either in the presence or absence of TN-C-neutralizing antibody. Lysates of these subsequent cells were probed to quantify levels of phospholyrated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).;PAR1 in both PAR1/MKN45 and MKN28 was activated by PAR1 agonists, resulting in cell proliferation and matrigel invasion. We have shown that activation of NF-kappaB and EGFR phosphorylation initially were triggered by the activation of PAR1 with alpha-thrombin. Quantitative PCR and Western blot assay revealed up-regulation of mRNA and protein expression of NF-kappaB target genes, especially TN-C, a potential EGFR activator. The suppressed level of phosphorylated EGFR, observed in cells exposed to concentrate of conditioned medium in the presence of TN-C-neutralizing antibody, identifies TN-C as a putative autocrine stimulatory factor of EGFR possibly involved in the sustained PAR1 activation responses observed.;Our data indicate that in gastric carcinoma cells, PAR1 activation can trigger an array of responses that would promote tumor cell growth and invasion. Over expression of NF-kappaB, EGFR, and TN-C, are among the effects of PAR1 activation and TN-C induces EGFR activation in an autocrine manner.

EGFR mutations can be detected in tumour tissue, cytology specimens and blood from lung cancer patients. Thus far, EGFR mutation analysis has not been systematically demonstrated for sputum samples. The aim of the present study was to determine whether EGFR mutation analysis is attainable on sputum samples, employing different assays in a multicenter study.;Sputum DNA from 10 lung cancer patients with confirmed EGFR mutation in their tumour tissue, 10 lung cancer patients without evidence of an EGFR mutation, and 10 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was used for mutation analysis by Cycleave PCR, COLD-PCR, PangaeaBiotech SL Technology (PST), and High Resolution Melting, respectively. Targeted resequencing (TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel) and droplet digital PCR were additionally performed on the 10 samples with EGFR mutation.;Dependent on the assay, EGFR mutations could be detected in 30-50% of the sputum samples of patients with EGFR mutations. The different techniques revealed consistent results, with slightly higher sensitivity for PST. Neither the lung cancer patients without EGFR mutation nor the COPD controls tested positive for EGFR mutations in their sputum samples, indicating high clinical specificity of all assays.;EGFR mutations can be detected in sputum samples from patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, which may replace biopsy procedure for some patients.",

In the present study, we tested the consequences of STAT3 inhibition in EGFR inhibitor-resistant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and bladder cancer models to determine whether STAT3 blockade can enhance responses to EGFR targeting.;pSTAT3 expression was assessed in human HNSCC tumors that recurred following cetuximab treatment. Cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant cell lines were treated with a STAT3 decoy to determine EC(50) concentrations and the effects on STAT3 target gene expression by Western blotting. In vivo assays included evaluation of antitumor efficacy of STAT3 decoy in cetuximab-sensitive and -resistant models followed by immunoblotting for STAT3 target protein expression.;Targeting STAT3 with a STAT3 decoy reduced cellular viability and the expression of STAT3 target genes in EGFR inhibitor resistance models. The addition of a STAT3 inhibitor to EGFR blocking strategies significantly enhanced antitumor effects in vivo. Biopsies from HNSCC tumors that recurred following cetuximab treatment showed increased STAT3 activation compared with pretreatment biopsies.;These results suggest that STAT3 activation contributes to EGFR inhibitor resistance both in HNSCC and bladder cancer where concomitant targeting of STAT3 may represent an effective treatment strategy.",

Paralleling effects on cell survival, AICAR leads to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HER2 and EGFR in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells, with activation of AMPK and suppression of HER2/ EGFR activity preceding commitment to cell death. Transfection of constitutively active AMPKα also leads to decreased HER2 and EGFR phosphorylation, reduced downstream signaling associated with these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and reduced breast cancer cell growth, confirming effects of AMPK activity on HER2/ EGFR. Ensuing co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an interaction of HER2 with AMPK and an in vitro phosphorylation assay found that HER2 and EGFR contain sequences that are potential substrates for AMPK.

We hypothesized that patients with lung cancers found to harbor the EGFR T790M resistance mutation before treatment, an uncommon occurrence, would be likely to carry underlying germline T790M mutations.;Eleven unrelated patients with lung cancer, harboring an EGFR T790M mutation, were identified from a 7-year institutional experience with tumor genotyping.

One patient's cancer exhibited a distinctive indolent growth, which has also been described in preclinical studies of T790M-mutant cancers. A second patient underwent resection of six separate primary lung adenocarcinomas, each carrying different sensitizing EGFR mutations and T790M.;Genotyping of lung cancers, now commonly performed to predict benefit from treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can also be used as a screening tool to identify patients at risk of carrying germline EGFR mutations.

However, the relationship between Aurora-A and EGFR in tumour development was not clear. In previous reports, we found that EGFR translocates to nucleus to activate Aurora-A expression after EGF treatment in EGFR-overexpressed cells. However, we also observed that not all the EGFR-overexpressed cells have the nuclear EGFR pathway to mediate the Aurora-A expression. In this study, we demonstrated that EGF signalling increased the Aurora-A protein expression in EGFR-overexpressed colorectal cancer cell lines via increasing the translational efficiency. In addition, the overexpression of EGFR was also associated with higher expression of Aurora-A in clinical colorectal samples. Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways mediated the effect of EGF-induced translational up-regulation. Besides, only the splicing variants containing exon 2 of Aurora-A mRNA showed increased interaction with the translational complex to synthesize Aurora-A protein under EGF stimulus. Besides, the exon 2 containing splicing variants were the major Aurora-A splicing forms expressed in human colorectal cancers. Taken together, our results propose a novel regulatory mechanism for the abnormal expression of Aurora-A in EGFR-overexpressed cancers, and highlight the importance of alternative 5'-UTR splicing variants in regulating Aurora-A expression. Furthermore, the specific expression of exon 2 containing splicing variants in cancer tissues may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy in the future.",

Despite many studies having suggested that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potent predictor of malignancy in cancers, systematic research of EGFR in multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cells is lacking. In order to clarify the role of EGFR in MDR breast cancer cells, MCF7/Adr expressing relatively higher EGFR, and its parental cell line MCF7 expressing relatively lower EGFR, were chosen for this study. Knockdown of EGFR by siRNA in MCF7/Adr cells showed that EGFR siRNA inhibits cell migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro; converse effects were observed in MCF7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.0-EGFR plasmid. Moreover, we found that EGFR upregulated migration and invasion via EMMPRIN, MMP2 and MMP9 in addition to promoting cell cycle passage via elevation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in MDR breast cancer cells. Interestingly, MCF7/Adr cells not expressing EGFR showed significant decrease of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and ABCG2 expression levels, and became more sensitive to treatment of adriamycin (ADR) and paclitaxel (Taxol); the above results indicated that MDR of cancer cells is related to S-phase arrest.

A series of EGFR inhibitors from both the monoclonal antibody (mAb) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class have shown clear clinical activity in the treatment of several common human cancers. Three EGFR inhibitors have recently gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cancer therapy in the United States including the mAb cetuximab (Erbitux) and the small-molecule TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva). The rapidly expanding preclinical and clinical data contributing to these FDA approvals validate a central role of the EGFR as an important molecular target in epithelial malignancies. Indeed, one of the more striking clinical results in this field has been recently achieved by combining an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) with radiation in the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer patients. Nevertheless, the overall clinical gains realized to date with the EGFR inhibitors are modest for the global cancer population.

Recently it was found that EGFR in cancer cells has a kinase-independent pro-survival function, preventing cells from undergoing autophagy. In the present study we investigated whether the anti-autophagic function of EGFR may contribute to resistance of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells to chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis.;We first characterized the autophagic phenotype induced by knocking down EGFR in hormone refractory prostate cancer cells (PC-3MM2 and DU-145), then we tested whether loss of EGFR-induced autophagy could sensitize cancer cells to adriamycin.;Using continuous live cell imaging techniques, we observed that knocking down EGFR lead to typical autophagic morphological/molecular changes, cell shrinkage without detachment, aggregation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein and absence of activation of apoptotic caspases 3/7. Loss of EGFR also increased the activity of calpain, which is pro-apoptotic. Knocking down EGFR, but not inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity, significantly sensitized cells to adriamycin-induced apoptosis. Adriamycin-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by increased extracellular glucose level, suggesting intracellular glucose deficiency is a key mediator of the sensitization. The loss of EGFR induced autophagy and sensitization to adriamycin were also reproduced by using another hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line, Du145.;Taken together, these data suggest that decreasing the expression level of EGFR protein, rather than inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity, may enhance the efficiency of EGFR targeted therapy for prostate cancer.",

Next, we analyzed expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and compared these results with EGFR (HER-1/ErbB1) and HER2/neu (ErbB2) expression levels, as EGFR conducts signals through Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway; gefitinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF addition in cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression.

Upon binding its ligands, dynamic conformational changes occur in both extracellular and intracellular domains of the receptor tyrosine kinases, resulting in the transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal regulatory domain. These provide docking sites for downstream molecules and lead to the evasion of apoptosis, to proliferation, to invasion and to metastases, all of which are important for the cancer phenotype. Mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene was found in a subset of lung cancers in 2002. Lung cancers with an EGFR mutation are highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Here, we review the discovery of EGFR, the EGFR signal transduction pathway and mutations of the EGFR gene in lung cancers and glioblastomas. The biological significance of such mutations and their relationship with other activated genes in lung cancers are also discussed.",

We investigated the effect of CK2 inhibition in lung cancer cells with T790M-mediated resistance to the EGFR-TK inhibitor. Resistant sublines of PC-9 to gefitinib (PC-9/GR) and erlotinib (PC-9/ER) were established by previous study, and T790M secondary mutation was found in both resistant sublines. A decrease of EGFR by siRNA treatment effectively controlled the growth of resistant cells, thus suggesting that they still have EGFR-dependency. CX-4945, a potent and selective CK2 inhibitor, induced autophagy in PC-9/GR and PC-9/ER, and which was supported by the induction of autophagic vacuoles and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) expression, and the increase of punctate fluorescent signals in resistant cells pre-transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged LC3. However, the withdrawal of CX-4945 led to the recovery of cancer cells with autophagy. We found that the induction of autophagy by CX-4945 in both resistant cells was CK2 dependent by using small interfering RNA against CK2. The treatment with CX-4945 alone induced a minimal growth inhibition in resistant cells. However, combined treatment of CX-4945 and EGFR-TKI effectively inhibited cancer-cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. CX-4945 increased the translocation of EGFR from the cell surface into the autophagosome, subsequently leading to the decrease of EGFR while inhibition of autophagy by 3MA or Atg7-targeted siRNA pretreatment reduced the decrease of EGFR by CX-4945. Accordingly, apoptosis by a combination of CX-4945 and EGFR-TKI was suppressed by 3MA or Atg7-targeted siRNA pretreatment, thus suggesting that autophagosome-mediated EGFR down-regulation would have an important role regarding apoptotic cell death by EGFR-TKI. Combined treatment of the CK2 inhibitor and EGFR-TKI may be a promising strategy for overcoming T790M-mediated resistance. ",

To investigate the relation between the expression of EGFR and PCNA LI, we divided the patients into the following three groups according to the immunohistochemical findings: group A, EGFR (+); group B, EGFR (-), and EGF(+) or TGF alpha(+); group C, EGFR(-), EGF(-) and TGF alpha(-).

We have shown that these mutant forms of EGFR induce oncogenic transformation in different cellular systems. Cells whose growth depends on EGFR with mutations in exons 19 and 21 are sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, whereas cells expressing insertion mutations in exon 20 or the T790M point mutant, found in tumor biopsies from patients that relapsed after an initial response to EGFR-TKIs, are resistant. Furthermore, by applying a novel, massively parallel sequencing technology, we have shown that clinically relevant oncogene mutations can be detected in clinical specimens with very low tumor content, thereby enabling optimal patient selection for mutation-directed therapy.

Gatekeeper T790M mutation in EGFR is the most prevalent genetic alteration underlying acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, and EGFR mutant lung cancer cells are reported to be addictive to EGFR/Akt signaling even after acquired T790M mutation. Here, we focused on Akt kinase-interacting protein1 (Aki1), a scaffold protein of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase)/Akt that determines receptor signal selectivity for non-mutated EGFR, and assessed its role in EGFR mutant lung cancer with or without gatekeeper T790M mutation. Cell line-based assays showed that Aki1 constitutively associates with mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells with (H1975) or without (PC-9 and HCC827) T790M gatekeeper mutation. Silencing of Aki1 induced apoptosis of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with Aki1 siRNA dramatically inhibited growth of H1975 cells in a xenograft model. Moreover, silencing of Aki1 further potentiated growth inhibitory effect of new generation EGFR-TKIs against H1975 cells in vitro. Aki1 was frequently expressed in tumor cells of EGFR mutant lung cancer patients (53/56 cases), including those with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment (7/7 cases).

Although recent advances in targeted therapy against driver oncogenes have significantly improved patient outcome, cure of this disease is still exceptional. Although tobacco is a known cause of lung cancer, not all smokers develop lung cancer, and conversely many patients, especially Asian female patients with lung cancer, are lifetime never-smokers. Therefore, efforts to understand the basis for different susceptibilities to lung cancer among individuals with different genetic, biologic, ethnic, and social backgrounds are important to help develop effective preventive measures. Lung cancer in never-smokers has many different characteristics to lung cancer in smokers, such as adenocarcinoma predominance and high frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation yet low number of genetic changes. Epidemiologic studies suggest that East Asians are more susceptible to smoking-unrelated lung cancer but less susceptible to smoking-related lung cancer compared with Caucasians. Mutations in the EGFR gene are more common in Asian females and never-smokers. Our case-control study suggests that EGFR mutation occurs independent of smoking, and that the apparent low frequency of EGFR mutations in smokers may be the result of dilution by smoking-related lung cancer. The frequencies of three EGFR gene polymorphisms associated with increased protein expression are significantly different between East Asians and Caucasians, favoring lower protein expression in East Asians. Although these may be associated with preferred expression of the EGFR mutant allele, it is difficult to explain the frequent EGFR mutation in Asian patients. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed several loci related to lung cancer susceptibility. In the future, GWAS may identify loci that are specifically related to EGFR-targeted carcinogenesis, leading to identification of carcinogens that induce EGFR mutations and effective prevention measures.

While K-RAS mutant tumors are more likely present in male patients, B-RAF mutant tumors develop more frequently in females and are independent of the microsatellite status. Colorectal cancers are characterized by EGFR expression; the gene is not mutated, rarely amplified and increased copy number is due to chromosomal polysomy. This phenotype/genotype of colorectal cancer lent support to the introduction of anti-EGFR antibody therapies. For a while positive EGFR expression status of the tumor was the basis of patient selection for these targeted therapies in colorectal cancer. Monotherapies with the two available anti-EGFR antibodies of chemoresistant colorectal cancers resulted in appr. 10% objective response rate, which was independent of the level of EGFR expression. In case of panitumumab it was discovered that the efficacy of this targeted therapy depends on the K-RAS mutant status of the tumors. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that cetuximab combined with chemotherapy is effective also exclusively in K-RAS wild-type tumors.

In human mammary carcinomas the EGFR is involved in regulating cell growth, survival, migration and metastasis and its activation correlates with the lack of response in hormone therapy. Here, we demonstrate in oestrogen receptor-positive and -negative human breast cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells a cross-communication between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the EGFR. We present evidence that specific inhibition of ADAM15 or TACE blocks GPCR-induced and proHB-EGF-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, downstream mitogenic signalling and cell migration. Notably, activation of the PI3K downstream mediator PKB/Akt by GPCR ligands involves the activity of sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and is independent of EGFR signal transactivation. We conclude that GPCR-induced chemotaxis of breast cancer cells is mediated by EGFR-dependent and -independent signalling pathways, with both parallel pathways having to act in concert to achieve a complete migratory response.",

It is increasingly clear that cancer cells are able to evolve and rewire canonical signalling pathways to their advantage, thus evading cell death and promoting cell invasion. The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been shown to modulate acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in both breast and lung cancers. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly infiltrative and invasive form of brain tumour with little response to therapy. Both Axl and EGFR have been identified as major players in gliomagenesis and invasiveness. However, the mechanisms underlying a potential signalling crosstalk between EGFR and Axl RTKs are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate this novel and unconventional interaction among RTKs of different families in human GBM cells. With the use of western blotting, in vitro kinase activity, co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we show that EGF stimulates activation of Axl kinase and that there is a hetero-interaction between the two RTKs. Through small interfering RNA knockdown and quantitative PCR screening, we identified distinct gene expression patterns in GBM cells that were specifically regulated by signalling from EGFR-EGFR, Axl-Axl and EGFR-Axl RTK parings. These included genes that promote invasion, which were activated only via the EGFR-Axl axis (MMP9), while EGFR-EGFR distinctly regulated the cell cycle and Axl-Axl regulated invasion. Our findings provide critical insights into the role of EGFR-Axl hetero-dimerisation in cancer cells and reveal regulation of cell invasion via Axl as a novel function of EGFR signalling.",

Accordingly, PARP inhibition prevents nuclear retention of PKM2 and therefore suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth. In addition, we found that PAR level correlates with nuclear localization of PKM2 in EGFR mutant brain and lung cancers, suggesting that PAR-dependent nuclear localization of PKM2 likely contributes to tumor progression in EGFR mutant glioblastoma and lung cancers.

EGFR was found to be overexpressed in 60-86% of gastric or gastroesophageal tumors and in 50-70% of esophageal cancers. Cetuximab was shown to be a radiosensitizing agent in the treatment of ENT neoplasia. These results led to several phase II encouraging therapeutic trials evaluating the combination of cetuximab with radiochemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancers. Numerous encouraging phase II trials evaluating cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction cancer were reported. These promising results are still to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trials. Several studies reported HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer (7-34%), which appeared to be associated with poorer prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular HER2 domain. The international phase III trial known as ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Angiogenesis is an essential step in the initial phase of tumorigenesis, and it is normally absent from healthy tissues except for particular physiological situations, such as wound healing. VEGF-A plays a role in endothelial growth and angiogenesis. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody, is currently being studied for gastric cancer.

In this study we sought to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in tumors that do not harbor TK sensitizing mutations in order to identify markers capable of guiding the decision to incorporate these drugs into chemotherapeutic regimens. Here we show that EGFR activity was markedly decreased during the evolution of resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib, with a concomitant increase of mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6), a negative regulator of EGFR through the upregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway.

The mutated EGFR proteins (EGFRs) are hyper-phosphorylated and refractory to receptor down-regulation. To address the discrepancy between hyper-phosphorylation and lack of down-regulation of mutant EGFRs, we have examined the expression of EGFR negative regulators in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. We found that NSCLC cell lines expressing mutant EGFRs often had low expression of various negative regulators for EGFR. Among them, tumor suppressor CD82 was up-regulated by wild type (WT) EGFR but down-regulated by mutant EGFRs. Reconstitution of CD82 exerted stronger suppressive effects on mutant EGFRs than on WT EGFR. Active exportation of CD82 through the exosome was one of the mechanisms involved in achieving the overall CD82 down-regulation in mutant EGFR-expressing lung cancer cell lines. Over-expression of mutant EGFR protein frequently occurred in the lung cancer tissues of mutant EGFR-transgenic mice and also associated with CD82 down-regulation. Immunoblot analyses on the tumor tissues from 23 lung adenocarcinoma patients (12 with WT EGFR, and 11 with mutant EGFRs) also identified significantly stronger down-regulation of CD82 in tumors with mutant EGFRs than WT. Our data indicate that CD82 down-regulation could be a critical step involved in the EGFR over-expression and the stronger tumorigenic activity triggered by EGFR mutations. Up-regulation of the CD82 level may become a promising new treatment strategy for lung adenocarcinoma. ",

YAP has emerged as critical oncogene in conferring drug resistance against targeted therapy. In this study, we evaluated the role of YAP in primary and acquired EGFR-TKI resistance using gefitinib-resistant A549 and PC9 cells and their parental cell lines. Our study revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance is associated with enhanced YAP activity. Notably, YAP activation was independent of the Hippo pathway. We confirmed that AXL is a downstream target of YAP that confers EGFR-TKI resistance. And our results showed that YAP can induce ERK activation in lung adenocarcinoma. The combination of YAP inhibition with EGFR-TKI overcomes primary and acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. We also found increased YAP expression in human lung cancer after acquiring EGFR-TKI resistance.

To overcome this issue, we have designed a novel targeting anticancer 'hybrid-peptide' EGFR-lytic peptide, in which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) binding peptide is conjugated with a newly designed lytic-type peptide containing cationic-rich amino acids that disintegrates the cell membrane to kill cancer cells. In this report, cytotoxic activity of EGFR-lytic peptide was investigated in various human cancer and normal cell lines. It was found that the resulting conformational change in the novel lytic peptide enabled it to bind selectively to the membrane of cancer cells, and due to its acquired synergistic action, hybrid peptide demonstrated selective destruction of cancer cells as swiftly as 10 min after exposure. Treatment with EGFR-lytic peptide exerted a sufficient in vitro cytotoxic activity against TKI-resistant cancer cells with K-ras mutations. Moreover, in vivo analyses revealed that this peptide displayed significant antitumour activity in mouse xenograft models of both human K-ras mutation negative and positive cancers. Thus, hybrid peptide can be a unique and powerful tool for a new cancer-targeted therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Due to the existence of parallel pathways for receptor endocytosis and their complexities, a quantitative understanding of receptor endocytosis in normal and pathological settings requires computational analysis. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis to determine the relative contributions of three parallel pathways: clathrin-dependent internalization mediated by mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), an endogenous EGFR kinase inhibitor that links EGFR to endocytic proteins; clathrin-dependent internalization mediated by the ubiquitin ligase CBL, which can be sequestered by the regulatory protein Sprouty2; or alternative pathways that may be non-clathrin mediated. We applied the model to interpret our previous measurements of EGFR endocytosis in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, our results suggest that MIG6 is responsible for at least as much wild-type EGFR internalization as CBL, indicating that a significant fraction of internalizing EGFR may be incapable of driving signaling. Model results also suggest that MIG6's endocytic function is reduced for the kinase-activated and internalization-impaired EGFR mutants found in some lung cancers. Analysis of Sprouty2 knockdown data indicates that Sprouty2 regulates EGFR endocytosis primarily by controlling EGFR expression, rather than by sequestering CBL, and supports the notion that CBL-mediated internalization is impaired for EGFR mutants. We further demonstrate that differences in internalization between wild-type and mutant EGFR cannot explain differences in EGF-mediated EGFR degradation without concomitant changes in EGFR recycling, which we previously quantified. This work provides new quantitative insights into EGFR trafficking in lung cancer and provides a framework for studying parallel endocytosis pathways for other receptors. ",

In addition, EGFR inhibitors have shown significant promise for patients who failed cisplatin-based therapy. In this study, we investigated whether treatment with an EGFR inhibitor improves cisplatin sensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The effects of a combination of AG1478, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with cisplatin were evaluated in cultured OSCC cell lines and cisplatin-resistant sublines. Higher expression of EGFR and p-EGFR was found in the two cisplatin-resistant cell lines compared with the corresponding parental cell lines. In addition, augmented inhibition of OSCC cell growth by the combination of AG1478 with cisplatin was found in both cell lines.

Recent investigations have demonstrated that GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) are able to utilize the EGFR as a downstream signalling partner in the generation of mitogenic signals. This cross-talk mechanism combines the broad diversity of GPCRs with the signalling capacities of the EGFR and has emerged as a general concept in a multitude of cell types. The molecular mechanisms of EGFR signal transactivation involve processing of transmembrane growth factor precursors by metalloproteases which have been recently identified as members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of zinc-dependent proteases. Subsequently, the EGFR transmits signals to prominent downstream pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and modulation of ion channels. Analysis of GPCR-induced EGFR activation in more than 60 human carcinoma cell lines derived from different tissues has demonstrated the broad relevance of this signalling mechanism in cancer. Moreover, EGFR signal transactivation was linked to diverse biological processes in human cancer cells, such as cell proliferation, migration and anti-apoptosis. Together with investigations revealing the importance of this GPCR-EGFR cross-talk mechanism in cardiac hypertrophy, Helicobacter pylori -induced pathophysiological processes and cystic fibrosis, these findings support an important role for GPCR ligand-dependent EGFR signal transactivation in diverse pathophysiological disorders.",

Gene amplification of EGFR was examined by two in situ hybridization techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in serial sections to IHC. Only 1 of 14 EGFR-positive breast cancers showed gene amplification at low levels by CISH. Overall, the ER(-)/HER2(-) breast cancer showed the highest Ki-67 LI, the most frequent expression of EGFR, p53 and vimentin, as well as the lowest expression of cyclinD1. It is unlikely that gene amplification contributes to EGFR expression. ER(-)/HER2(-) breast cancers have potential in the development of novel therapeutics, including targeted medicines.",

Few studies have comprehensively examined the association between germline genetic variants in the EGFR pathway and risk of esophageal and gastric cancers. Based on a genome-wide association study in a Han Chinese population, we examined 3443 SNPs in 127 genes in the EGFR pathway for 1942 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), 1758 gastric cancers (GCs), and 2111 controls. SNP-level analyses were conducted using logistic regression models. We applied the resampling-based adaptive rank truncated product approach to determine the gene- and pathway-level associations. The EGFR pathway was significantly associated with GC risk (P = 2.16×10(-3)). Gene-level analyses found 10 genes to be associated with GC, including FYN, MAPK8, MAP2K4, GNAI3, MAP2K1, TLN1, PRLR, PLCG2, RPS6KB2, and PIK3R3 (P<0.05). For ESCC, we did not observe a significant pathway-level association (P = 0.72), but gene-level analyses suggested associations between GNAI3, CHRNE, PAK4, WASL, and ITCH, and ESCC (P<0.05). Our data suggest an association between specific genes in the EGFR signaling pathway and risk of GC and ESCC.

Here we show for the first time the high efficiency of systemic application of polyIC/melittin-polyethyleneimine-polyethyleneglycol-EGF (polyIC/MPPE) in combination with human immune cells.;Cancer-targeted activation of immune cells was examined in vitro and in vivo following transfection with polyIC/MPPE.

The immune cells and the cytokines they produce are localized to the tumor site of the treated animal and contribute decisively to the demise of the tumor cells. The immune system homes to the tumors, due to the chemokines produced by the internalized polyIC.;The EGFR-homing vector loaded with polyIC can be used to treat and possibly cure patients with disseminated EGFR-overexpressing tumors.

It is well documented that dysregulation of these two pathways often leads to tumorigenesis with poor prognosis. However, the possible crosstalk between the two pathways in cancer development is largely unknown. Although some reports show that EGFR might antagonize Wnt signaling during development in Drosophila, an increasing body of evidence indicates that Wnt and EGFR signaling crosstalk and transactivate one another in development and cancer. This review summarizes recent studies on the crosstalk between Wnt and EGFR signaling in cancers and points out several possible convergence points. Wnt ligands can activate EGFR signaling through their 7-transmembrane domain receptor Frizzled while EGFR can activate β-catenin via receptor tyrosine kinase-PI3K/Akt pathway; EGFR has been shown to form a complex with β-catenin and increase the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. NKD2, a Wnt antagonist by interacting with Dishevelled, also escorts TGFα-containing exocytic vesicles to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells. Down-regulation of NKD2 causes Wnt activation and TGFα misdelivery, suggesting its functions in cell homeostasis and prevention of tumorigenesis.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of molecular therapy targeting HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer liver metastasis. We developed three new HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines (GLM-1, GLM-2, GLM-4) without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations derived from such liver metastasis, two of which had HER2 gene amplifications. All these GLM series of cell lines were highly sensitive to gefitinib in vitro, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (Iressa) rather than anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), whereas most of the HER2 low-expressing counterparts were not. In these HER2-overexpressing GLM series, protein kinase B (Akt), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), was constitutively phosphorylated, and gefitinib efficiently inhibited this Akt phosphorylation, induced strong apoptosis in vitro and exhibited antitumour activity in tumour xenografts in nude mice. This gefitinib-mediated antitumour effect in xenograft was significantly potentiated by trastuzumab treatment. On the other hand, gefitinib-resistant cells (GLM-1R) exhibited increased EGFR expression, followed by constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These results suggest that the antitumour effect of gefitinib is due to the effective inhibition of HER2-driven constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and that the acquired resistance to gefitinib is due to the constitutive activation of Ras/MAPK pathway in compensation for PI3K/Akt pathway. Gastric cancer liver metastasis with HER2 overexpression would be a potential molecular target for gefitinib and trastuzumab.",

EGFR mutations were present in 20 patients (17.4%). The EGFR mutations were found only in adenocarcinomas (20 of 55 adenocarcinomas, 36.4%). The ERBB2 mutation was found in 1 adenocarcinoma of the 115 NSCLCs (0.9% overall; 1.8% of the 55 adenocarcinomas). KRAS mutations were found in 6 (5.2%) of the 115 NSCLCs (2 of 60 squamous cell carcinomas, or 3.3%, and 4 of 55 adenocarcinomas, or 7.3%). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.02) and in never-smokers (P = 0.004). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were not associated with pathologic stage in never-smokers, but were more frequent in pathologic stage II-IV than in stage I in ever-smokers (P = 0.01). Of the 55 adenocarcinomas, 25 (45.5%) had mutations of one or another of the three genes; EGFR mutations were never found in adenocarcinomas together with ERBB2 or KRAS mutations. These findings suggest that the EGFR mutation is frequent in Korean lung cancer patients, and that the ERBB2 mutation is rare. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EGFR mutations in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma among smokers.",

However, the therapeutic efficiency of the existing anti-ErbB agents is limited. Thus, identifying new molecules that inactivate the ErbB receptors through novel strategies is an important goal on cancer research. In this study we have developed a shorter form of human EGF (EGFt) with a truncated C-terminal as a novel EGFR inhibitor. EGFt was designed based on the superimposition of the three-dimensional structures of EGF and the Potato Carboxypeptidase Inhibitor (PCI), an EGFR blocker previously described by our group. The peptide was produced in E. coli with a high yield of the correctly folded peptide. EGFt showed specificity and high affinity for EGFR but induced poor EGFR homodimerization and phosphorylation. Interestingly, EGFt promoted EGFR internalization and translocation to the cell nucleus although it did not stimulate the cell growth. In addition, EGFt competed with EGFR native ligands, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. These data indicate that EGFt may be a potential EGFR blocker for cancer therapy. In addition, the lack of EGFR-mediated growth-stimulatory activity makes EGFt an excellent delivery agent to target toxins to tumours over-expressing EGFR. ",

High expression of receptor type tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has repeatedly represented poor prognosis for cancers. However it has not been demonstrated whether RTKs have prognostic relevance for stage II/III gastric cancer with standard treatment. Tumor tissues were obtained from 167 stage II/III advanced gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery and received postoperative S-1 chemotherapy from 2000 to 2010. Expression of the RTKs including EGFR, HER2, HER3, IGF-1R, and EphA2 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Analysis using a multivariate proportional hazard model identified the most significant RTKs that represented independent prognostic relevance. When tumor HER3 expression was classified into IHC 1+/2+ (n = 98) and IHC 0 (n = 69), the cumulative 5-year Relapse Free Survival (5y-RFS) was 56.5 and 82.9%, respectively (P = 0.0034). Significant prognostic relevance was similarly confirmed for IGF-1R (P = 0.014), and EGFR (P = 0.030), but not for EphA2 or HER2 expression. Intriguingly, HER3 expression was closely correlated with IGF-1R (P < 0.0001, R = 0.41), and EphA2 (P < 0.0001, R = 0.34) expression. Multivariate proportional hazard model analysis identified HER3 (IHC 1+/2+) (HR; 1.53, 95% CI, 1.11-2.16, P = 0.0078) as the sole RTK that was a poor prognostic factor independent of stage. Of the 53 patients who recurred, 40 patients (75.5%) were HER3-positive. Thus, of the RTKs studied, HER3 was the only RTK identified as an independent prognostic indicator of stage II/III advanced gastric cancer with standard treatment. ",

Several drugs are being developed to overcome EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. Here, we report that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) stabilized mutant EGFR protein by direct interaction and sustained cell survival signaling in lung cancer cells. PKM2 silencing resulted in markedly reduced mutant EGFR expression in TKI-sensitive or -resistant human lung cancer cells, and in inhibition of tumor growth in their xenografts, concomitant with downregulation of EGFR-related signaling. Mechanistically, PKM2 directly interacted with mutant EGFR and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), and thus stabilized EGFR by maintaining its binding with HSP90 and co-chaperones. Stabilization of EGFR relied on dimeric PKM2, and the protein half-life of mutant EGFR decreased when PKM2 was forced into its tetramer form. Clinical levels of PKM2 positively correlated with mutant EGFR expression and with patient outcome. These results reveal a previously undescribed non-glycolysis function of PKM2 in the cytoplasm, which contribute to EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis and provide a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance to EGFR TKIs.

Even though both anti-EGFR immunonanoparticles had a high binding affinity to the EGFR-positive cancer cells, the anti-EGFR immunolipoplex formulation exhibited approximately 100-fold higher transfection to the target cells than anti-EGFR immunoliposomes. The lipoplex formulation also showed a higher transfection to SK-OV-3 tumor xenografts in mice. Thus, IL12 and/or salmosin genes were loaded in the anti-EGFR immunolipoplexes and intravenously administered to mice carrying SK-OV-3 tumors. Co-transfection of IL12 and salmosin genes using anti-EGFR immunolipoplexes significantly reduced tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis.

EGF induces the mitochondrial translocation of EGFR; further, it leads to mitochondrial fission and redistribution in the lamellipodia, upregulates cellular ATP production, and enhances motility in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, EGFR can regulate mitochondrial dynamics by interacting with Mfn1 and disturbing Mfn1 polymerization. Overexpression of Mfn1 reverses the phenotypes resulting from EGFR mitochondrial translocation. We show that the mitochondrial EGFR expressions are higher in paired samples of the metastatic lymph node as compared with primary lung tumor and are inversely correlated with the overall survival in NSCLC patients.

The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and chemotherapy represents the only possible therapeutic approach. However, chemotherapy seems to have reached an efficacy plateau in this setting. Gastric cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease because it emerges from multiple interactions of genetic, environmental and host factors. A better understanding of its molecular characteristics may lead to an improvement of outcomes. The recent molecular classification by The Cancer Genome Atlas project divides gastric cancer into four subtypes that could be taken into consideration in future clinical trials with targeted agents. So far trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody addressing the HER2 receptor, is the only targeted agent approved in the first-line setting, but only in patients overexpressing HER2. Negative data have been obtained in first-line therapy when antiangiogenics, anti-EGFR or anti-MET monoclonal antibodies have been studied in randomised controlled trials. Ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody binding to VEGFR2, is the only antiangiogenic agent currently recommended in patients progressing after first-line treatment. In this review, we discuss whether personalised therapy may have a role in gastric cancer. ",

SHP-1 has been demonstrated to downregulate tyrosine kinase activity including EGFR via its phosphatase function, but its effect on HER-2 activity is still unknown. Here, we examined the hypothesis that SHP-1 enhances the anticancer efficacy of trastuzumab in EGFR/HER-2 positive breast cancer cells through combining dual inhibition of EGFR and HER-2.;Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer SKBr-3 cells were generated by long-term in vitro culture of SKBr-3cells in the presence of trastuzumab. The SHP-1 was ectopically expressed by stable transfection. The activity and expression of EGFR, HER-2, and downstream signaling pathways were tested by Western blot. Cell viability was examined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The binding between SHP-1 and EGFR/HER-2 was evaluated by immunoprecipitation assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The effects of SHP-1 on tumorigenicity and trastuzumab sensitivity were confirmed via in vivo xenograft model.;Trastuzumab-resistant SKBr-3 cells showed aberrant co-expression of EGFR and HER-2. Introduction of wild-type SHP-1 inhibited cell proliferation, clone formation, and promoted the apoptosis induced by trastuzumab. Meanwhile, SHP-1 overexpression reduced phosphorylation levels of EGFR and HER-2 both in parental and trastuzumab-resistant SKBr-3 cells. In vivo study showed an increased antitumor effect of trastuzumab in SHP-1 overexpressed xenografts. At last, we discovered that SHP-1 can make complexes with both EGFR and HER-2, and both phospho-EGFR and phosphor-HER-2 levels in wild-type SHP-1 immunoprecipitates were less than those in phosphatase-inactive SHP-1 (C453S) immunoprecipitates, indicating that EGFR and HER-2 are potential substrates of SHP-1.;Taken together, we have demonstrated that the SHP-1 is a negative regulatory factor of the tyrosine kinase activity of HER-2 and EGFR through inhibiting phosphorylation. Dual targeting of EGFR and HER-2, by combining trastuzumab with SHP-1 overexpression, may improve response in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cells that also express high levels of EGFR.",

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) are often overexpressed in colorectal cancer and are associated with inferior outcomes. More recently, further improvements in survival have occurred due to the use of novel targeted therapies such EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inibitors (EGFR-TKIs), EGFR monoclonal antibodies (EGFR-mAb), and VEGF antibodies. Despite the initial clinical efficacy of these inhibitors in such cancer, resistance invariably develops, typically within 1 to 2 years. Over the past several years, multiple molecular mechanisms of resistance have been identified, and some common themes have emerged. One is the development of resistance mutations in the drug target and another it is activation of alternative signaling of key downstream pathways despite sustained inhibition of the original drug target. In this mini-review, we summarize the concepts underlying EGFR- and VEGF-mediated resistance, the specific examples known to date, and the challenges of applying this knowledge to develop improved therapeutic strategies to prevent or overcome resistance.

Lapatinib, a dual HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promising in vitro results in treating HER2(+) cancer cells. However, several studies have shown that activation of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases can mediate resistance to HER-targeted therapy. Here, we investigated whether activated MET can confer resistance to lapatinib inhibition of gastric cancer cells. A panel of gastric cancer cell lines was treated with lapatinib, and we observed that cell proliferation was reduced by 70% and that the degree of HER2 amplification corresponds to sensitivity to lapatinib. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, MET, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited by lapatinib and presumably led to cell-cycle arrest as observed with flow cytometry. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activation of MET receptors rescued cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition by restimulating the downstream pathways and restoring normal cell-cycle progression. This rescue effect could be abrogated by inhibiting MET with PHA-665752 (a highly specific MET inhibitor) or downregulating MET expression with short interfering RNA. No synergy in growth inhibition was observed when cells were treated with a combination of lapatinib and PHA-665752. Repeat studies using insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor 3 could not uniformly rescue the lapatinib-treated gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, HGF/MET-mediated resistance to lapatinib is a novel mechanism of resistance to HER2-targeted agents in gastric cancer cells. Development of inhibitors targeting multiple receptors or common downstream signaling proteins merits further investigation.",

We investigated the crosstalk between EGFR and TrkB, both of which have been known to be important in cell survival and migration in response to EGF and BDNF. Our results showed that both EGF and BDNF induced cell migration and cell proliferation in cultured human ovarian cancer cells (Caov3 cell line). EGF and BDNF transactivated TrkB and EGFR respectively, and activated downstream cell survival components such as Akt. EGFR and TrkB kinase inhibitors inhibited EGF- and BDNF-induced TrkB and EGFR activation and Akt phosphorylation, and cell proliferation and migration. Using EGFR knockout cells, we further demonstrated that EGFR is required for EGF-induced cell migration. Collectively, our data indicate that EGFR and TrkB crosstalk each other in response to EGF and BDNF, leading to cell survival pathway activation in ovarian cancer cells.

A secondary point mutation that substitutes methionine for threonine at amino acid position 790 (T790M) is a molecular mechanism that produces a drug-resistant variant of the targeted kinase. The T790M mutation is present in about half of the lung cancer patients with acquired resistance, and reported to act by increasing the affinity of the receptor to adenosine triphosphate, relative to its affinity to TKIs. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the T790M mutation confers growth advantage to cancer cells, and it was shown that mice expressing tetracycline-inducible EGFR transgenes harboring the T790M mutation develop lung tumors. Thus, T790M mutation seems to play a double role in the survival of lung cancer cells. Several second-generation EGFR-TKIs are currently being developed to overcome the acquired resistance caused by the T790M mutation. MET (met proto-oncogene) amplification or activation of IGF1R are reported as alternative mechanisms for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.

Recently, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been identified as a critical regulator of oncogenic protein stability, including EGFR, HER-2, and HIF-1alpha. We hypothesized that inhibition of Hsp90 impairs EGF- and hypoxia-mediated angiogenic signaling in gastric cancer cells and consequently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. In vitro, the geldanamycin derivate 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) led to marked reduction in constitutive and inducible activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha protein. In addition, EGFR and HER-2 were down-regulated after Hsp90 inhibition. With respect to regulation of angiogenic molecules, 17-AAG significantly reduced EGF-mediated VEGF secretion. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were both abrogated by 17-AAG, which resulted in significant impairment of cancer cell motility. Interestingly, cytotoxic effects of 17-AAG in vitro were higher on cancer cells and gastric fibroblasts than on pericytes. In vivo, the water-soluble compound 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG; 25 mg/kg, thrice per week) significantly reduced s.c. xenografted tumor growth. By immunohistochemistry, 17-DMAG significantly reduced vessel area and numbers of proliferating tumor cells in sections. Furthermore, similar significant growth-inhibitory effects of 17-DMAG were achieved when administered as low-dose therapy (5 mg/kg, thrice per week). In conclusion, blocking Hsp90 disrupts multiple proangiogenic signaling pathways in gastric cancer cells and inhibits xenografted tumor growth in vivo. Hence, gastric cancer harbors attractive molecular targets for therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors, which could lead to improved efficacy of antineoplastic therapy regimens.",

Mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI) is a small cytosolic protein suggested to play a role in the differentiation of epithelial cells. Here, we have investigated the effect of MDGI expression on the EGFR signaling and cetuximab responsiveness of cancer cells.;MDGI mRNA expression was investigated in clinical breast and lung cancer samples and in nontransformed and malignant cell lines. The effect of ectopic expression of MDGI on EGFR, ErbB2, and integrin function and traffic was investigated in breast and lung cancer cell lines using multiple methods. The effect of anti-EGFR agents on these cells were tested by cell proliferation measurements and by assessing tumor growth of breast cancer cells in cetuximab treated and control athymic nude mice.;Here, we show that although MDGI is absent in cultured cell lines because of epigenetic silencing, MDGI mRNA is expressed in 40% of clinical breast carcinomas and 85% of lung cancers. Ectopic expression of MDGI rendered breast and lung cancer cells resistant to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in vitro and in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. When expressed in cancer cells, MDGI induces intracellular accumulation of EGFR, but not ErbB2, and the internalized receptor is phosphorylated and not degraded.;MDGI-driven inherent desensitization of cancer cells is a novel molecular mechanism for resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and MDGI may be a biomarker for responsiveness to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.",

Over the last decade, multiple EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been developed to target mutated EGFR. However, there is little information regarding mutation specific potency of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR mutations. The purpose of this study is to establish an in vitro model to determine the \"therapeutic window\" of EGFR-TKIs against various types of EGFR mutations, including EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The potency of 1st (erlotinib), 2nd (afatinib) and 3rd (osimertinib and rociletinib) generation EGFR-TKIs was compared in vitro for human lung cancer cell lines and Ba/F3 cells, which exogenously express mutated or wild type EGFR. An in vitro model of mutation specificity was created by calculating the ratio of IC50 values between mutated and wild type EGFR. The in vitro model identified a wide therapeutic window of afatinib for exon 19 deletions and L858R and of osimertinib and rociletinib for T790M positive mutations. The results obtained with our models matched well with previously reported preclinical and clinical data. Interestingly, for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, most of which are known to be resistant to 1st and 2nd generation EGFR-TKIS, osimertinib was potent and presented a wide therapeutic window. To our knowledge, this is the first report that has identified the therapeutic window of osimertinib for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In conclusion, this model will provide a preclinical rationale for proper selection of EGFR-TKIs against clinically-relevant EGFR mutations. ",

These EGFR-dependent tumors eventually become TKI resistant, and the common secondary T790M mutation accounts for half the tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib. However, the key proapoptotic proteins involved in TKI-induced cell death and other secondary mutations involved in resistance remain unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the mechanism of EGFR TKI-induced apoptosis and secondary resistant mutations that affect this process.;To study TKI-induced cell death and mechanisms of resistance, we used lung cancer cell lines (with or without EGFR mutations), Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with EGFR mutation constructs, and tumor samples from a gefitinib-resistant patient. Here we show that up-regulation of the BH3-only polypeptide BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11) correlated with gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. The T790M mutation blocked gefitinib-induced up-regulation of BIM and apoptosis. This blockade was overcome by the irreversible TKI CL-387,785. Knockdown of BIM by small interfering RNA was able to attenuate apoptosis induced by EGFR TKIs. Furthermore, from a gefitinib-resistant patient carrying the activating L858R mutation, we identified a novel secondary resistant mutation, L747S in cis to the activating mutation, which attenuated the up-regulation of BIM and reduced apoptosis.;Our results provide evidence that BIM is involved in TKI-induced apoptosis in sensitive EGFR-mutant cells and that both attenuation of the up-regulation of BIM and resistance to gefitinib-induced apoptosis are seen in models that contain the common EGFR T790M and the novel L747S secondary resistance mutations. These findings also suggest that induction of BIM may have a role in the treatment of TKI-resistant tumors.",

Twenty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EGF, TGFA, and EGFR were investigated. Two SNPs, rs11466285 in TGFA and rs884225 in EGFR, were significantly associated with the distribution of ZHENG (P < 0.05). The rs11466285 TT genotype increased the risk of damp heat with toxin (DHT) and deficiency of both Qi and yin (DQY) compared with obstruction of blood stasis (OBS). The rs884225 AA genotype could increase the risk of DQY and deficiency of both Qi and blood (DQB) compared with yin deficiency due to stomach heat (YDSH). Parallel comparison among the SNPs and syndrome types revealed that DQB was distinct from YDSH, disharmony between the liver and stomach, stagnation of phlegm muddiness (SPM), OBS, and other syndromes at several SNP loci (P < 0.05). The rs11466285 TT and rs884225 AA genotypes exhibit increased risk of DQB compared with OBS and SPM (P < 0.05), respectively.

Transfection of miR-137 mimic suppressed EGFR protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. EGFR small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the role of miR-137 inhibitor on cyclin E, MMP2, p-ERK, and p-AKT.

Here we show that ectopic miR-203 expression displayed reduced bone metastasis and induced sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment in a xenograft model. Our results demonstrate that the induction of bone metastasis and TKI resistance require miR-203 down regulation, activation of the EGFR pathway via altered expression of EGFR ligands (EREG and TGFA) and anti-apoptotic proteins (API5, BIRC2, and TRIAP1). Importantly, a sufficient reconstitution of invasiveness and resistance to TKIs treatment was observed in cells transfected with anti-miR-203. In prostate cancer patients, our data showed that miR-203 levels were inversely correlated with the expression of two EGFR ligands, EREG and TGFA, and an EGFR dependent gene signature. Our results support the existence of a miR-203, EGFR, TKIs resistance regulatory network in prostate cancer progression. We propose that the loss of miR-203 is a molecular link in the progression of prostate cancer metastasis and TKIs resistance characterized by high EGFR ligands output and anti-apoptotic proteins activation.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents the main target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy, as its overexpression or constitutive activation contributes to malignancy and correlates with poor prognosis. Our previous work demonstrated that in epithelial cells β1 integrin is required for propagating EGFR signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. In this study, we silenced β1 integrin in human NSCLC A549 cells. The β1 integrin-silenced cells show a defective activation of the EGFR signaling cascade, leading to decreased in vitro proliferation, enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and Gefitinib, impaired migration and invasive behavior. Inhibitory effects on tumor growth and on the EGFR pathway were also observed in in vivo experiments. Moreover, β1 integrin silencing increases the amount of EGFR on the cell surface, suggesting that β1 integrin is required for efficient constitutive EGFR turnover at the cell membrane. Although the rate of EGF internalization and recycling is not affected in silenced cells, EGFR signaling is recovered only by expression of the Rab-coupling protein RCP, indicating that β1 integrin sustains the endocytic machinery required for EGFR signaling. Overall, these results show that β1 integrin is an essential regulator of EGFR signaling and tumorigenic properties of lung cancer cells, and that its silencing might represent an adjuvant approach to anti-EGFR therapy.",

Tumors with EGFR mutations showed good response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We aimed to identify the discriminating capacity of immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring to detect L858R and E746-A750 deletion mutation in lung adenocarcinoma patients and predict EGFR TKIs response. Patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled. EGFR mutation status was genotyped by PCR and direct sequencing. Mutation-specific antibodies for L858R and E746-A750 deletion were used for IHC staining. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the capacity of IHC, including intensity and/or quickscore (Q score), in differentiating L858R and E746-A750 deletion. We enrolled 143 patients during September 2000 to May 2009. Logistic-regression-model-based scoring containing both L858R Q score and total EGFR expression Q score was able to obtain a maximal area under the curve (AUC: 0.891) to differentiate the patients with L858R. Predictive model based on IHC Q score of E746-A750 deletion and IHC intensity of total EGFR expression reached an AUC of 0.969. The predictive model of L858R had a significantly higher AUC than L858R intensity only (p = 0.036). Of the six patients harboring complex EGFR mutations with classical mutation patterns, five had positive IHC staining. For EGFR TKI treated cancer recurrence patients, those with positive mutation-specific antibody IHC staining had better EGFR TKI response (p = 0.008) and longer progression-free survival (p = 0.012) than those without. In conclusion, total EGFR expression should be included in the IHC interpretation of L858R. After adjusting for total EGFR expression, the scoring method decreased the false positive rate and increased diagnostic power. According to the scoring method, the IHC method is useful to predict the clinical outcome and refine personalized therapy.",

We previously showed that EGFR mutations were associated with a copy number gain at a locus encompassing the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible implication of TWIST1 reactivation on the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in EGFR mutated lung cancer. We studied a series of consecutive lung adenocarcinoma from Caucasian non-smokers for which surgical frozen samples were available (n = 33) and showed that TWIST1 expression was linked to EGFR mutations (P<0.001), to low CDH1 expression (P<0.05) and low disease free survival (P = 0.044). To validate that TWIST1 is a driver of EMT in EGFR mutated lung cancer, we used five human lung cancer cell lines and demonstrated that EMT and the associated cell mobility were dependent upon TWIST1 expression in cells with EGFR mutation. Moreover a decrease of EGFR pathway stimulation through EGF retrieval or an inhibition of TWIST1 expression by small RNA technology reversed the phenomenon. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings support that TWIST1 collaborates with the EGF pathway in promoting EMT in EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma and that large series of EGFR mutated lung cancer patients are needed to further define the prognostic role of TWIST1 reactivation in this subgroup.",

Recent data on a polymorphic CA repeat located at the 5'-regulatory sequence in intron 1 of the egfr gene [egfr CA simple sequence repeat (SSR) I] point to a possible inheritance of cancer risk associated with the egfr gene. Furthermore, we have detected frequent allelic imbalances restricted to the egfr CA SSR I in breast cancer tissue and nontumorous breast tissue adjacent to invasive and in situ breast cancer representing amplifications. Therefore, we conducted a population-based case-control study to assess the relationship between the egfr polymorphism and breast cancer risk. Cases with a first primary breast cancer by age 50 years and age-matched population controls provided information on known and suspected risk factors. The allelic length of the egfr CA SSR was determined in 616 cases and 1072 population-sampled controls. Genotypes were categorized for analysis by allele length. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare genotype distributions, accounting for other risk factors, and to investigate gene-environment interactions. We found a modifying effect, albeit no main effect, of the allelic length of the egfr polymorphism on breast cancer risk. The presence of two long alleles (>/==\" BORDER=\"0\">19 CA) was associated with a significantly elevated odds ratio (OR) of 10.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.85-58.70] among women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (P = 0.015 for interaction). The risk increase associated with high red meat consumption (OR, 10.68; 95% CI, 1.57-72.58) and the protective effect of high vegetable intake (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.004-1.07) was also most pronounced among carriers of two long alleles (>/==\" BORDER=\"0\">19 CA).

We have conducted a comparative analysis of functional footprints (that is, effect on signaling and transcriptional landscapes in cells) associated with oncogenic and tumor suppressor mutations in EGFR pathway genes in human cancers. We have found that mutations in the EGFR pathway differentially have an impact on signaling and metabolic pathways in cancer cells in a mutation- and tissue-selective manner. For example, although signaling and metabolic profiles of breast tumors with PIK3CA or AKT1 mutations are, as expected, highly similar, they display markedly different, sometimes even opposite, profiles to those with ERBB2 or EGFR amplifications. On the other hand, although low-grade gliomas and glioblastomas, both brain cancers, driven by EGFR amplifications are highly functionally similar, their functional footprints are significantly different from lung and breast tumors driven by EGFR or ERBB2. Overall, these observations argue that, contrary to expectations, the mechanisms of tumorigenicity associated with mutations in different genes along the same pathway, or in the same gene across different tissues, may be highly different. We present evidence that oncogenic functional footprints in cancer cell lines have significantly diverged from those in tumor tissues, which potentially explains the discrepancy of our findings with the current knowledge. Nevertheless, our analyses reveal a common inflammatory response signature in EGFR-driven human cancers of different tissue origins. Our results may have implications in the design of therapeutic strategies in cancers driven by these oncogenes. ",

Its clinical activity is currently limited by both intrinsic (natural) and acquired drug resistance. A better understanding of the underlying resistance mechanisms is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Exposure of tumor cells to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38 is accompanied by EGFR activation, either by stimulation of EGFR autophosphorylation or by Src-mediated phosphorylation. Accordingly, combinations of irinotecan and EGFR inhibitors have been associated with supra-additive activity. We now show that acquired resistance to SN-38 is accompanied by increased expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and Src proteins in two colorectal cancer cell models as well as by Src activation. One SN-38 resistant model (HT-29) showed increased sensitivity to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and afatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, while the other SN-38 resistant model (HCT-116) showed increased resistance to erlotinib but unchanged or increased sensitivity to afatinib. Unexpectedly, both models showed increased or unaltered resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Therefore, tyrosine kinase upregulation is not necessarily accompanied by increased sensitivity to targeted agents. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that prolonged exposure to topoisomerase I inhibitors is accompanied by upregulation of different signal transduction pathways which can alter tumor sensitivity to molecular targeted agents. These results suggest that chemotherapy exposure may lead to creation of novel targets which could be exploited therapeutically.",

However, the biological contribution of GPR30 in ovarian cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationships between GPR30 expression and the clinicopathological findings, and to determine how the signaling cascade influences the prognosis of ovarian cancer.;The expression levels of GPR30, EGFR, ERα, and ERβ were analyzed using an immunohistochemical analysis, and their correlations with the clinicopathological features were examined in 10 patients with borderline malignant tumors and 152 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. We also examined whether GPR30 signaling activates the EGFR-Akt pathway in an ovarian cancer cell line (Caov-3) by a Western blotting analysis.;The GPR30 expression in ovarian carcinomas was significantly higher than that in borderline malignancies (p=0.0016), and was not associated with the expression of the EGFR, ERα, or ERβ. The expression of GPR30 in clear cell carcinomas was significantly lower than that in other subtypes of cancer (P <; 0.001). The expression of both GPR30 and EGFR was significantly associated with a poor prognosis in terms of the progression-free survival rate.

A diagnosis of PAC, history of non-smoking and presence of mutations in the EGFR are predictive factors for responsiveness of lung cancer to EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Unfortunately, less than 50% of PAC cases demonstrate this mutation-based responsiveness. Our immunohistochemical analysis of NNK-induced PAC in hamsters demonstrates the simultaneous over-expression of a beta2-adrenergic receptor pathway, including PKA, cAMP, CREB and phosphorylated CREB and of an EGFR pathway, including over-expression of EGFR-specific phosphorylated tyrosine kinase, Raf-1 and ERK1/2 and their phosphorylated forms. These findings implicate, for the first time, PKA/CREB-mediated signaling in the development and regulation of any type of lung cancer. In light of reports that NNK acts as a beta-adrenergic agonist and that beta-blockers inhibit the growth of PAC of Clara cell lineage in the NNK hamster model and in human cancer cell lines from smokers, our current data suggest transactivation of the EGFR pathway via beta-adrenergic signaling as a novel regulatory mechanism in a subpopulation of PACs in smokers.

However, the clinical benefit of molecularly targeted therapy on NSCLC appears to be different between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs). We report here that the resistance of lung SqCC harboring EGFR mutations to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) was due to the activation of BMP-BMPR-Smad1/5-p70S6K. The combined treatment of these tumor cells with EGFR-TKI, together with inhibitors specific to BMPR or downstream mTOR, effectively reversed the resistance to EGFR-TKI. Moreover, blocking the whole PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 also showed efficacy in treating this subtype of lung SqCC.

Why, differently to other tumors, have EGFR inhibitors been so ineffective in human prostate cancer? This is the question that we have set in this report.;For this purpose, the effectiveness of erlotinib, a selective EGFR inhibitor, in a wide range of prostate cancer cells (wild type or engineered to overexpress peculiar proteins including androgen receptor and PTEN).;We demonstrated that the effectiveness of erlotinib was inversely correlated to the EGFR/Her2 ratio rather than EGFR/p-EGFR or Her2/p-Her2 levels. Chronic treatment with bicalutamide induced overexpression of Her2 and reduction of EGFR/Her2ratio and this was associated with increased Akt and Erk activity. In these conditions of treatment a reduced efficacy of erlotinib was observed. At the same time, an increased efficacy versus erlotinib was documented in cancer cells chronically exposed to DHT. In these culture conditions low levels of Her2 and increased EGFR/Her2 ratio were evidenced.;Taken together, our results seem to suggest that a low EGFR/Her2 ratio and PTEN absence are the main factors responsible of erlotinib inefficacy.

BRAF and PTEN are commonly mutated genes in various cancer types, including NSCLC, with PTEN mutations exerting an effect on the therapeutic response of EGFR/AKT/PI3K pathway inhibitors. TTF-1 is expressed in approximately 80% of lung adenocarcinomas and its positivity correlates with higher prevalence of EGFR mutation in this cancer type. To determine molecular markers for lung cancer in Brazilian patients, the rate of the predominant EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and PTEN mutations, as well as TTF-1 expression, was assessed in 88 Brazilian NSCLC patients. EGFR exon 19 deletions (del746-750) were detected in 3/88 (3·4%) patients. Activating KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 61 were noted in five (5·7%) and two (2·3%) patients, respectively.

However, most of these patients will eventually develop resistance, 50% of which are due to a secondary mutation at T790M in the EGFR. In this paper, we describe the development of an allele-specific DNAzyme, DzT, that can specifically silence EGFR T790M mutant messenger RNA while leaving wild-type EGFR intact. Allele-specific silencing of EGFR T790M expression and downstream signaling by DzT triggered apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer cells harboring this mutant. Adding a cholesterol-triethylene glycol group on the 3'-end of DzT (cDzT) improved drug efficacy, increasing inhibitory effect on cell viability from 46 to 79% in T790M/L858R-harboring H1975(TM/LR) non-small-cell lung cancer cells, without loss of allele specificity. Combined treatment with cDzT and BIBW-2992, a second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, synergistically inhibited EGFR downstream signaling and suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors derived from H1975(TM/LR) cells. Collectively, these results indicate that the allele-specific DNAzyme, DzT, may provide an alternative treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer that is capable of overcoming EGFR T790M mutant-based tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2014) 3, e150; doi:10.1038/mtna.2014.3; published online 4 March 2014.

Eighteen cases (22%) exhibited both high- and low-affinity binding sites. A wide interpatient variability was observed for the site number, with physiologically-relevant high-affinity sites ranging from 7 to 310 fmol/mg protein in tumors and from 6 to 313 fmol/mg protein in normal mucosa. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between tumor and normal mucosa for the high-affinity Kd values and for the number of high-affinity sites, suggesting a common regulation for both tumor and normal tissue.;These observations (i) could explain recently-reported clinically-active EGFR targeting in colorectal tumors apparently negative for EGFR, and (ii) may offer a plausible explanation for the link observed between toxicity in normal tissue (cutaneous rash) and clinical outcome of patients treated with anti-EGFR drugs.

The presence or absence of three common EGFR mutations were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR with mutation-specific sensor and anchor probes.;In exon 21, EGFR mutations (CTG --> CGG; L858R) were found from 8 of 102 patients from Nagoya and 1 of 16 from Kinki.

Here we report a distinct resistance mechanism whereby PTEN inactivation specifically raises EGFR activity by impairing the ligand-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of the activated receptor through destabilization of newly formed ubiquitin ligase Cbl complexes. PTEN-associated resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is phenocopied by expression of dominant negative Cbl and can be overcome by more complete EGFR kinase inhibition. PTEN inactivation does not confer resistance to inhibitors of the MET or PDGFRA kinase. Our study identifies a critical role for PTEN in EGFR signal termination and suggests that more potent EGFR inhibition should overcome resistance caused by PI3K pathway activation.",

Although EGFR is expressed in approximately 85% of patients with mCRC, the clinical efficacy of treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies is limited to a subset of patients. A series of potential biomarkers that could be useful in predicting response to EGFR inhibitors has been investigated. In patients with mCRC, activating mutations within KRAS can predict resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Activating mutations in KRAS, which could result in EGFR-independent intracellular signal transduction activation, are found in approximately 35-40% of patients with mCRC. These mutations are almost exclusively detected in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2. KRAS mutations have been significantly associated with lack of response to cetuximab or panitumumab therapy in patients with mCRC, which suggests that EGFR-independent, constitutive activation of the RAS signaling pathway could impair response to anti-EGFR drugs.

Over the years, an increasing number of studies have reported on the crosstalk between EGFR and other receptors that can contribute to accelerated cancer development or even acquisition of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. Combined targeting of EGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a rational strategy to potentiate anti-cancer treatment and possibly retard resistance development. In the present study, we have pursued this by encapsulating the kinase inhibitor AG538 in anti-EGFR nanobody-liposomes. The thus developed dual-active nanobody-liposomes associated with EGFR-(over)expressing cells in an EGFR-specific manner and blocked both EGFR and IGF-1R activation, due to the presence of the EGFR-blocking nanobody EGa1 and the anti-IGF-1R kinase inhibitor AG538 respectively. AG538-loaded nanobody-liposomes induced a strong inhibition of tumor cell proliferation even upon short-term exposure followed by a drug-free wash-out period. Therefore, AG538-loaded nanobody-liposomes are a promising anti-cancer formulation due to efficient intracellular delivery of AG538 in combination with antagonistic and downregulating properties of the EGa1 nanobody-liposomes.",

Thus: the ability to modulate the functional activity of these receptors is an attractive target for diagnostic intervention. In this study we examined the effect of a well characterised tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RG13022) on the cellular proliferation and EGF activated tyrosine kinase signalling pathway of two primary gastric cell lines: MKN45 and N87. RG13022 has a dose dependent, antiproliferative effect on both gastric cell lines when grown either in serum-free conditions or in the presence of FCS. Western blotting revealed RG13022 caused an inhibition of EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFr in A431 cells and both EGFr and c-erbB-2 in MKN45 cells. No clear modulation of EGFr or c-erbB-2 phosphorylation was observed in N87 cells. In both A431 cells and N87 cells (which overexpress EGFr and c-erbB-2 respectively) exposed to EGF, MAP2 kinase immunoblot analysis resulted in the detection of a second protein band with reduced migration in SDS-PAGE. In N87 cells, this protein appeared to co-mi,orate with a strongly tyrosine phosphorylated protein, which suggests that it is a hyper-phosphorylated form of MAP2 kinase. However, treatment with RG13022, whilst inhibiting phosphorylation of this protein, did not prevent a shift in gel mobility (suggestive of activation) of MAP2 kinase in response to EGF. These findings demonstrate that the tyrphostin RG13022 inhibits cell proliferation of two primary gastric cancer cell lines. Investigation of intracellular signalling pathways suggests that alterations in intracellular signalling are responsible for the actions of RG 13022 in these cells. The biochemical analysis revealed that in N87 and A431, cells which overexpress c-erbB-2 and EGFr respectively, the tyrphostin affects the MAP2 kinase immunoreactivity and migration on SDS gels but fails to affect this protein in the MKN45 cell line. This data questions the usefulness of MAP2 kinase gel shift assays as markers of activation but supports the further development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential inhibitors of gastric tumour proliferation.",

We previously reported that a subpopulation of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas depends on enhanced autophagy, instead of EGFR, for survival, and in this study we explore another mechanism that contributes to TKI resistance. We demonstrate here that an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, H1975 (L858R+T790M), has a subset of cells that exhibits an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and can thrive in the presence of third-generation EGFR TKIs. These cells depend on not only autophagy but also on the isomerase Pin1 for survival in vitro, unlike their parental cells. The Pin1 protein was expressed in an EGFR-mutant lung cancer tissue that has undergone partial EMT and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, but not its primary tumor.

In the present study, compared with TRAIL or cetuximab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) alone, treatment with the TRAIL/cetuximab combination significantly promoted death receptor 4 (DR4) clustering as well as the translocation of both DR4 and Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) into lipid rafts. This in turn resulted in caspase-8 cleavage and the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in these lipid rafts. Cholesterol-depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin partially prevented DR4 clustering and DISC formation, and thus partially reversed apoptosis induced by the TRAIL/cetuximab dual treatment.

We initially analyzed expression and phosphorylation of ERBB family receptors and their major downstream proteins, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3, in a series of lung cancer cell lines with or without EGFR mutation. The expression levels of EGFR as well as of ERBB2 and ERBB3 proteins in cells with EGFR mutation tended to be higher than those in cells with wild type EGFR. There was no difference in stability between mutant and wild type EGFR proteins. EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 to various extents, but the level of induction was not associated with the existence of EGFR mutation. These results implied that the activation of AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 signaling transmitted by EGFR would be critical for the growth and survival of lung cancer cells, but specific features of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells was not discriminated by these approaches. We therefore performed transfection studies using PC-13 cells with no detectable endogenous EGFR expression. Exogenous expression of wild type and mutant EGFR (delE746-A750) in the cells revealed that only in the mutant EGFR transfected cells, EGFR itself as well as AKT and STAT3 were highly phosphorylated after 24h of serum deprivation. The survival time of mutant EGFR transfected cells was prolonged under serum-free culture conditions, but not under standard culture conditions with 10% serum. These results suggest that cells with a mutant EGFR survive through the activation of the AKT and/or STAT3 pathways, even in low EGF microenvironments.

Allelic imbalance of the EGFR -216G/T polymorphism was also tested in the heterozygous patients and in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines to further verify its function.

The -216T allele is favored to be amplified in both tumor DNA of lung cancer patients and cancer cell lines.

Here, we examined whether modulating EMT maintains the responsiveness of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs to EGFR TKI therapy. Using human NSCLC cell lines harboring mutated EGFR and a transgenic mouse model of lung cancer driven by mutant EGFR (EGFR-Del19-T790M), we demonstrate that EGFR inhibition induces TGFβ secretion followed by SMAD pathway activation, an event that promotes EMT. Chronic exposure of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells to TGFβ was sufficient to induce EMT and resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. Furthermore, NSCLC HCC4006 cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib were characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype and displayed a higher prevalence of the EGFR T790M mutated allele. Notably, combined inhibition of EGFR and the TGFβ receptor in HCC4006 cells prevented EMT but was not sufficient to prevent acquired gefitinib resistance because of an increased emergence of the EGFR T790M allele compared with cells treated with gefitinib alone. Conversely, another independent NSCLC cell line, PC9, reproducibly developed EGFR T790M mutations as the primary mechanism underlying EGFR TKI resistance, even though the prevalence of the mutant allele was lower than that in HCC4006 cells. Thus, our findings underscore heterogeneity within NSCLC cells lines harboring EGFR kinase domain mutations that give rise to divergent resistance mechanisms in response to treatment and anticipate the complexity of EMT suppression as a therapeutic strategy.",

EGFR inhibitors, drugs targeting the intracellular kinase activity and antibodies targeting the extracellular ligand binding, are used to treat breast, lung, colon and other cancers. Nominally affecting the same target, inhibitors have different effects, suggesting that use of inhibitor combinations may provide beneficial in cancer treatment. To explore the specific and the common transcriptional effects of EGFR inhibitors, we present metaanalysis of 20 individual studies comprising 346 microarrays. We identified specific gene subsets regulated by kinase inhibitors, those regulated using antibodies and by suppressing EGFR expression using miR-7. Unreported before, the inhibitors prominently induce lysosome components. All inhibitors rely on related sets of transcription factors and protein kinases, both for transcriptional induction and suppression. However, we find that Gefitinib suppresses apoptosis inhibitors, while inducing cell-cycle inhibitors; conversely, Erlotinib suppresses cell-cycle and cell migration genes, while inducing proapoptotic genes. EGFR-targeting antibodies specifically suppress cell motility, developmental and differentiation processes, while inducing the contractile apparatus. miR-7, distinctively, suppresses cell-cycle genes, while inducing transcription machinery. These metaanalysis results suggest that different inhibitors have overlapping but quite distinct effects in target cells. Judicial use of EGFR-targeting combinations, i.e., simultaneous use of antibodies and multiple kinase inhibitors, may provide more effective cancer treatments with fewer side-effects and avoid development of resistance. We expect, moreover, that specific drug combination treatments can be fine-tuned to achieve specific, personalized results. ",

Thus, this protein may improve penetration of conjugated drugs into the deep zone of gastric cancer multicellular 3D spheroids.

Single‑targeting agent anti‑EGFR‑DTPA‑Gd, which served as the control, was also prepared. The results of the present study showed that anti‑EGFR‑iRGD‑DTPA‑Gd exhibited no significant cyto-toxicity to human gastric carcinoma cells (BGC‑823) under the experimental conditions used. Compared with a conventional contrast agent (Magnevist), anti‑EGFR‑iRGD‑DTPA‑Gd showed higher T1 relaxivity (10.157/mM/sec at 3T) and better tumor‑targeting ability. In addition, the signal intensity and the area under curve for the enhanced signal time in tumor, in vivo, were stronger than Gd‑DTPA alone or the anti‑EGFR‑Gd control.

In this study, it was investigated whether EGFR inhibitors, including erlotinib or gefitinib, could regulate expression of NKG2D ligands in various lung cancer cells including A549, NCI-H23, and SW-900. The EGFR inhibitors predominantly increased transcription and surface expression of ULBP1, and subsequently increased susceptibility of the cancer cells to NK-92 cells. When the selective inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappa B, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and PKC were treated to discriminate downstream signaling of EGFR pathway, expression of ULBP1 in the cancer cells was induced by inhibition of PKC. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate restored the EGFR inhibitor-induced ULBP1 transcription. Binding activity to ULBP1 promoter region of AP-2α, which suggested as suppressor of expression of ULBP1, was decreased by treatment with EGFR inhibitors, and restored by pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in A549 and SW-900. Rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, also decreased the binding activity of AP-2α in dose-dependent manner. This study suggests that EGFR inhibitors enhanced the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis of lung cancer cells by induction of ULBP1 by inhibition of PKC pathway and therapeutic efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer may be mediated in part by increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",

A total of 1,990 compounds from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity set with nonredundant structures have been tested to inhibit cancer cell lines with unknown mechanism. Cancer inhibition through EGFR-TK is one of the mechanisms of these compounds. In this work, we performed receptor-based virtual screening against the NCI diversity database. Using two different docking algorithms, AutoDock and Gold, combined with subsequent post-docking analyses, we found eight candidate compounds with high scoring functions that all bind to the ATP-competitive site of the kinase. None of these compounds belongs to the main group of the currently known EGFR-TK inhibitors. Binding mode analyses revealed that the way these compounds complexed with EGFR-TK differs from quinazoline inhibitor binding and the interaction mainly involves hydrophobic interactions. Also, the common kinase-inhibitor (NH---N and CO---HC) hydrogen bonds between the hinge region and the hit compounds are rarely observed.

PC-9 lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring 15-bp deletions (Del E746_A750) in EGFR exon 19 were treated with increasing concentrations of the Met-TKI PHA665752 and 1 μmol/L gefitinib for 1 year; three resistant clones were established via Met amplification. The three dual-resistance cell lines (PC-9DR2, PC-9DR4, and PC-9DR6, designated as DR2, DR4, and DR6, respectively) exhibited different mechanisms for evading both EGFR and Met inhibition. None of the clones harbored a secondary mutation of EGFR T790M or a Met mutation. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF1 receptor activation in DR2 and DR4 cells acted as a bypass signaling pathway. Met expression was attenuated to a greater extent in DR2 than in PC-9 cells, but was maintained in DR4 cells by overexpression of IGF-binding protein 3. In DR6 cells, Met was further amplified by association with HSP90, which protected Met from degradation and induced SET and MYND domain-containing 3 (SMYD3)-mediated Met transcription.

In the last decade, two EGFR target agents have significantly contributed to the understanding of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib and erlotinib are first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors(EGFR-TKIs)that play a key role in activating EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Although these reversible, small, molecular target agents provide a significant response and survival benefit, all responders eventually acquire resistance. Although various mechanisms of resistance have been identified, nearly 3 0% of patients who acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs have an unknown mechanism of resistance. Approximately half the patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who develop acquired resistance to these molecular target agents have a secondary mutation T790M in the threonine gatekeeper residue that coexists with a primary EGFR activating mutation. The strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs is a major clinical concept. Afatinib is a second-generation EGFR-targeting agent and an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. It may improve survival further and help in potentially overcoming resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In patients harboring activating EGFR mutations, certain treatments could be suggested for subsequent therapy after failure of first-generation EGFR-TKIs.

By mass spectrometry genotyping, the plasma samples contained mutant DNA corresponding to 5/14 EGFR Exon 19 deletions and 3/4 EGFR L858R mutations previously diagnosed in the matched tumors. Two samples were positive in plasma DNA but negative in primary tumor tissue. Results were similar for samples studied by ME-PCR. For patients treated with erlotinib, overall survival was correlated with the presence of EGFR mutation in plasma and/or tumor tissue (p=0.002), with the two patients positive only in plasma DNA showing responses and favorable outcomes.;The detection of EGFR mutations in plasma DNA samples by mass spectrometry genotyping and ME-PCR is feasible. A positive EGFR result in plasma DNA has a high predictive value for tumor EGFR status and for favorable clinical course on EGFR-targeted therapy and could therefore be useful in guiding clinical decisions in patients with insufficient or unavailable tumor specimens.",

The development of novel diagnostic molecular marker(s) to detect circulating gastric cancer cells is an issue of great clinical importance. We obtained peripheral blood samples from 10 patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparotomy and 4 healthy volunteers. Microarray analysis consisting of 30,000 genes or ESTs was carried out using eight gastric cancer tissues and normal gastric mucosae. We selected 53 genes up-regulated in gastric cancer compared to normal gastric mucosae from our microarray data set, and, among these, identified five candidate marker genes (TSPAN8, EPCAM, MMP12, MMP7 and REG3A) which were not expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 healthy volunteers. We further carried out semi-quantitative nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for HRH1, EGFR, CK20 and CEA in addition to the five newly identified genes using PBMCs of patients with gastric cancer, and found that expression of one or more genes out of the nine was detected in 80% of the patients with gastric cancer. Moreover, the numbers of genes expressed in PBMCs were ≤2 and ≥2 in all vascular invasion-negative cases and in 5 of 6 positive cases, respectively, showing significant differences between the two groups (P=0.041). Nested RT-PCR analysis for the set of nine marker genes using PBMCs may provide the potential for detection of circulating gastric cancer cells prior to metastasis formation in other organs.",

However, inhibition of EGFR signaling in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer has been disappointing. It remains to be addressed whether ovarian cancer patients could benefit from targeting EGFR signaling. Here we investigated the mechanisms underlying the resistance to EGFR inhibition in ovarian cancer and developed a strategy to overcome it.;We found that treatment of human ovarian cancer cells with an EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib, resulted in increased STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibiting STAT3 activation with a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, an upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates STAT3, synergistically increased the anti-tumor activity of gefitinib in vitro. Similar results were obtained when STAT3 or JAK1 expression was knocked down. In contrast, inhibiting other signaling pathways, such as AKT/mTOR, MEK or SRC, was relatively less effective. The combined treatment resulted in simultaneous attenuation of multiple survival pathways and increased inhibition of ERK pathway. In addition, the dual inhibition showed a stronger suppression of xenograft tumor growth than either single inhibition.;Our findings demonstrate that feedback activation of STAT3 pathway might contribute to the resistance to EGFR inhibition. Combined blockade of both pathways appears to be more effective against human ovarian cancer than inhibition of each pathway alone both in vitro and in vivo.

Nevertheless, while trastuzumab is highly effective in many Her-2/neu overexpressing tumors, some do not respond. The reason for the differential effect is unknown, but it has been hypothesized that the complex interactions between Her-2/neu and other members of the EGFR family are involved in trastuzumab resistance. We have analyzed the protein expression of Her-2/neu, EGFR, and their activated forms, ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu, ptyr-845 EGFR and ptyr-1173 EGFR, in 57 Her-2/neu overexpressing breast tumors and investigated potential correlations between the receptors. By performing immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, we found that ptyr-845 EGFR was significantly co-expressed with Her-2/neu and ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu (p=0.043 and p=0.040, respectively), while ptyr-1173 EGFR was only correlated to Her-2/neu expression (p=0.042). Interestingly, EGFR and its activated forms were all significantly inversely correlated with PgR expression (p=0.011, p=0.033 and p=0.032, respectively), and ptyr-845 EGFR was also inversely correlated with ER expression (p=0.008). While we have previously shown that serum levels of the extracellular component of Her-2/neu are associated with tumoral ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu expression, we did not find a similar relationship between serum EGFR and intratumoral total/activated EGFR. We did, however, observe significantly higher levels of serum EGFR in women with 3+ overexpression of HER-2/neu (p=0.047). Taken together, we have demonstrated the activation pattern of EGFR and Her-2/neu in Her-2/neu overexpressing breast cancer.

It has been previously shown that EGFR signaling induces the production of PTHrP in several primary and transformed epithelial cell types. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between EGFR and PTHrP gene expression in human breast cancer cells. Of a panel of 7 breast epithelial and cancer cell lines, the osteolytic, EGFR- positive lines (MDA-MB-231 and NS2T2A1) exhibited higher levels of PTHrP transcript expression. Amphiregulin mRNA levels in all lines were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of TGFalpha or HB-EGF. In the EGFR bearing lines, the receptor was phosphorylated at tyrosine 992 under basal conditions, and the addition of 100 nM amphiregulin did not lead to the phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues typically phosphorylated by the prototypical ligand EGF. Treatment of the EGFR positive lines with the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 and amphiregulin-neutralizing antibodies reduced PTHrP mRNA levels by 50-70%. Stable EGFR expression in the MCF7 line failed to increase basal PTHrP mRNA levels; however, treatment of this cell line with exogenous EGF or amphiregulin increased PTHrP transcription 3-fold. Transient transfection analysis suggests that the MAPK pathway and ETS transcription factors mediate EGFR coupling to PTHrP gene expression. Taken together, it appears that autocrine stimulation of EGFR signaling by amphiregulin is coupled to PTHrP gene expression via EGFR Tyr992 and MAPK, and that this pathway may contribute to PTHrP expression by breast tumor cells.",

An important source of resistance to these agents arises from functional redundancy among EGFR, HER2, and HER3.

Compounds that disrupt extracellular disulfide bonds could inactivate EGFR, HER2, and HER3 in unison. Here we describe the identification of compounds that kill breast cancer cells that overexpress EGFR or HER2. Cell death parallels downregulation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3. These compounds disrupt disulfide bonds and are termed Disulfide Bond Disrupting Agents (DDAs). DDA RBF3 exhibits anticancer efficacy in vivo at 40 mg/kg without evidence of toxicity. DDAs may complement existing EGFR-, HER2-, and HER3-targeted agents that function through alternate mechanisms of action, and combination regimens with these existing drugs may overcome therapeutic resistance.

Enzymatic EGFR inhibitors are effective for lung adenocarcinomas with somatic kinase domain EGFR mutations while, paradoxically, anti-EGFR antibodies are more effective in colon and head and neck cancers where EGFR mutations occur less frequently. In colorectal cancer, anti-EGFR antibodies are routinely used as second-line therapy of KRAS wild-type tumors. However, detailed mechanisms and genomic predictors for pharmacological response to these antibodies in colon cancer remain unclear.;We describe a case of colorectal adenocarcinoma, which was found to harbor a kinase domain mutation, G724S, in EGFR through whole genome sequencing. We show that G724S mutant EGFR is oncogenic and that it differs from classic lung cancer derived EGFR mutants in that it is cetuximab responsive in vitro, yet relatively insensitive to small molecule kinase inhibitors. Through biochemical and cellular pharmacologic studies, we have determined that cells harboring the colon cancer-derived G719S and G724S mutants are responsive to cetuximab therapy in vitro and found that the requirement for asymmetric dimerization of these mutant EGFR to promote cellular transformation may explain their greater inhibition by cetuximab than small-molecule kinase inhibitors.;The colon-cancer derived G719S and G724S mutants are oncogenic and sensitive in vitro to cetuximab. These data suggest that patients with these mutations may benefit from the use of anti-EGFR antibodies as part of the first-line therapy.",

Cancer patients harboring activating EGFR mutations benefit from first-line TKI therapy. Yet 10% of patients present a primary TKI resistance, while 50% of the others develop a secondary resistance within 9-12 months after starting TKI. The RECIST's definition of progression appears flawed when applied to EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. Most often, tumor volume shrinking widely exceeds 30% during TKI response and kinetics of growth is low during relapse. At present, secondary resistance mechanisms associated with progression are better known: clonal selection of EGFR resistance mutation (T790M mutation in exon 20), amplification of transmembrane receptors for other growth factors (c-met, HER family, IGF1R, or AXL), downstream molecular alterations in EGFR signaling pathway (PI3K or PTEN), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition or transdifferentiation to small-cell cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain cancer that is driven by aberrant signaling of growth factor receptors, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling is tightly regulated by receptor endocytosis and lysosome-mediated degradation, although the molecular mechanisms governing such regulation, particularly in the context of cancer, remain poorly delineated. Here, high-resolution genomic profiles of GBM identified a highly recurrent focal 1p36 deletion encompassing the putative tumor suppressor gene, Mig-6. We show that Mig-6 quells the malignant potential of GBM cells and dampens EGFR signaling by driving EGFR into late endosomes and lysosome-mediated degradation upon ligand stimulation. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by the binding of Mig-6 to a SNARE protein STX8, a protein known to be required for late endosome trafficking. Thus, Mig-6 functions to ensure recruitment of internalized receptor to late endosomes and subsequently the lysosomal degradation compartment through its ability to specifically link EGFR and STX8 during ligand-stimulated EGFR trafficking. In GBM, the highly frequent loss of Mig-6 would therefore serve to sustain aberrant EGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling. Together, these data uncover a unique tumor suppression mechanism involving the regulation of receptor trafficking.",

However the correlations between C23 and EGFR were rarely reported. Here, this study explored the effects of C23 in activation of EGFR signaling pathway. In our study, immunohistochemistry was used to identify the expression of C23 or EGFR in CC tissues. The level of the phosphorylated EGFR was observed by western blot, and cell invasion capacity was detected by Transwell assay. In this study, we found that C23 and EGFR were highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues, while C23 on the cell surface mainly expressed in CC tissues with lymph node metastasis, and was correlated to EGFR statistically. In vitro, western blot showed that either anti-C23 or anti-EGFR antibodies can inhibit the phosphorlation of EGFR with significant differences (p < 0.01). Besides, based on Transwell assay, the number of membrane-invading cells was reduced significantly in anti-C23 group, and no significant difference was found compared with anti-EGFR treatment (p > 0.05). In conclusion, C23 on the cell surface may be a kind of indispensable component in activation of EGFR signaling, by which C23 can participate in the growth and invasion of tumors.

DNA methylation levels of cancerous tissues were significantly higher compared to the corresponding pericarcinomatous tissues (P < 0.05) at stages I, II, and IIIA. The methylation levels at loci 3, 6, 9 among the detected CpG islands were higher in the cancer tissues at each stage (P < 0.05).

We previously showed that B4GALNT3 overexpression enhances colon cancer cell malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of B4GALNT3 in cancer stemness remains unclear. We found that B4GALNT3 expression was positively correlated with advanced stages and poor survival in colorectal cancer patients. Knockdown of B4GALNT3 using small interfering (si) RNAs in colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, HCT15, and HT29 cells) decreased sphere formation and the expression of stem cell markers, OCT4 and NANOG. The expression of B4GALNT3 was upregulated in colonospheres. Interestingly, we found that B4GALNT3 primarily modified N-glycans of EGFR with LacdiNAc by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) pull down assays. B4GALNT3 knockdown suppressed EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signaling molecules. Furthermore, EGF-induced degradation of EGFR was facilitated. In addition, EGF-induced migration and invasion were significantly suppressed by B4GALNT3 knockdown.

Mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status is a known predictor of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and immunohistochemistry may be a less costly way of predicting presence of mutation. In this study, mutation analysis of EGFR in 218 cases of NSCLC was performed. One hundred thirty tissue samples were examined via immunohistochemistry of p-EGFR (Y1045 and Y1068) and correlated with mutation status. Mutations were seen in 29% of patients, and were correlated with female sex, nonsmoking history, and adenocarcinoma histology.

Indeed, we found that dasatinib causes inhibition of breast cancer cells overexpressing EGFR, HER-2 and HER-3 (MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-231) in a dose and time-dependent manner. Dasatinib also stimulated apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells, which could be attributed to activation of both caspase-9 and -8 and arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1 cycle. Furthermore, dasatinib markedly inhibited colony formation, cell invasion, migration and angiogenesis, accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of EGFR and c-Src and their downstream effector molecules Akt and Erks.

In this study, we quantified the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and E-cadherin (E-cad) in the same cells simultaneously by using secondary antibody-conjugated QDs with two different emission wavelengths (QD605 and QD565) and compared the cellular distribution of EGFR and E-cad between EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-insensitive and -sensitive lung and head and neck cancer cell lines. Relocalization of EGFR and E-cad upon treatment with the EGFR-TKI erlotinib in the presence of EGF was visualized and analyzed quantitatively. Our results showed that QD-immunocytochemistry (ICC)-based technology can not only quantify basal levels of multiple biomarkers but also track the localization of the biomarkers upon biostimulation. With this new technology we found that in EGFR-TKI-insensitive cells, EGFR and E-cad were located mainly in the cytoplasm; while in sensitive cells, they were found mainly on the cell membrane. After induction with EGF, both EGFR and E-cad internalized to the cytoplasm, but the internalization capability in sensitive cells was greater than that in insensitive cells. Quantification also showed that inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR and E-cad internalization by erlotinib in the sensitive cells was stronger than that in the insensitive cells. These studies demonstrate substantial differences between EGFR-TKI-insensitive and -sensitive cancer cells in EGFR and E-cad expression and localization both at the basal level and in response to EGF and erlotinib. QD-based analysis facilitates the understanding of the features of EGFR-TKI-insensitive versus -sensitive cancer cells and may be used in the prediction of patient response to EGFR-targeted therapy.",

MUC1 knockout cells were more sensitive to the EGFR inhibitor, lapatinib. Finally, MUC1 and EGFR co-expression was associated with increased cellular proliferation in human endometrial tumors.

These drugs induce dramatic responses in individuals with lung adenocarcinomas characterized by mutations in exons encoding the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, but disease progression invariably occurs. A major reason for such acquired resistance is the outgrowth of tumor cells with additional TKI-resistant EGFR mutations. Here we used relevant transgenic mouse lung tumor models to evaluate strategies to overcome the most common EGFR TKI resistance mutation, T790M. We treated mice bearing tumors harboring EGFR mutations with a variety of anticancer agents, including a new irreversible EGFR TKI that is under development (BIBW-2992) and the EGFR-specific antibody cetuximab. Surprisingly, we found that only the combination of both agents together induced dramatic shrinkage of erlotinib-resistant tumors harboring the T790M mutation, because together they efficiently depleted both phosphorylated and total EGFR. We suggest that these studies have immediate therapeutic implications for lung cancer patients, as dual targeting with cetuximab and a second-generation EGFR TKI may be an effective strategy to overcome T790M-mediated drug resistance.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most prevalent subtype of this recalcitrant cancer, is usually diagnosed at advanced stages, and available systemic therapies are mostly palliative. The probing of the NSCLC kinome has identified numerous nonoverlapping driver genomic events, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. This review provides a synopsis of preclinical and clinical data on EGFR mutated NSCLC and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Classic somatic EGFR kinase domain mutations (such as L858R and exon 19 deletions) make tumors addicted to their signaling cascades and generate a therapeutic window for the use of ATP-mimetic EGFR TKIs. The latter inhibit these kinases and their downstream effectors, and induce apoptosis in preclinical models. The aforementioned EGFR mutations are stout predictors of response and augmentation of progression-free survival when gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are used for patients with advanced NSCLC. The benefits associated with these EGFR TKIs are limited by the mechanisms of tumor resistance, such as the gatekeeper EGFR-T790M mutation, and bypass activation of signaling cascades. Ongoing preclinical efforts for treating resistance have started to translate into patient care (including clinical trials of the covalent EGFR-T790M TKIs AZD9291 and CO-1686) and hold promise to further boost the median survival of patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC.",

Nonetheless, improving therapeutic efficacy and patient survival is important, particularly in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.

Treatment with 1E11 alone induced apoptosis in HER2-positive cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced by combination treatment with trastuzumab. Combination treatment with 1E11 and trastuzumab reduced the levels of total HER2 protein and those of aberrant HER2 signaling molecules including phosphorylated HER3 and EGFR.

Here we report support for a rationale to target IKBKE, an IκB kinase family member that activates the AKT and NF-κB pathways, as one strategy to address NSCLC resistant to EGFR inhibitors. While wild-type and mutant EGFR directly interacted with IKBKE, only mutant EGFR phosphorylated IKBKE on residues Y153 and Y179. The unphosphorylatable mutant IKBKE-Y153F/Y179-F that lost kinase activity failed to activate AKT and inhibited EGFR signaling. In clinical specimens of NSCLC with activating mutations of EGFR, we observed elevated levels of phospho-Y153 IKBKE. IKBKE ablation with shRNA or small-molecule inhibitor amlexanox selectively inhibited the viability of NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations in vitro In parallel, we found that these treatments activated the MAPK pathway due to attenuation of an IKBKE feedback mechanism. In vivo studies revealed that combining amlexanox with MEK inhibitor AZD6244 significantly inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of NSCLC cells harboring activating EGFR mutations, including EGFR(T790M) Overall, our findings define IKBKE as a direct effector target of EGFR and provide a therapeutic rationale to target IKBKE as a strategy to eradicate EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.

Thus, testing for the 7 most common mutations of KRAS codons 12 and 13 is now recommended as a clinical practice. However, pooled analysis of randomized controlled studies in Western countries in patients treated with cetuximab has suggested that patients with tumors showing the KRAS p. G13D mutation[a glycine(G)to aspartate(D)transition mutation] have longer overall survival and progression-free survival when compared to patients with other KRAS mutations. Furthermore, even among patients whose tumors are wild-type for KRAS codons 12 and 13, response rates are only 13~17% for anti-EGFR antibody monotherapy. These facts suggest that additional activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MAPK or PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways may also confer resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapies. Indeed, recent retrospective studies have shown that mutations in KRAS codon 61 and 146, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA may also predict resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies in colorectal cancer patients. On the other hand, the continuous use of anti-EGFR therapies for KRAS wild-type patients may lead to secondary resistance. Acquired EGFR or KRAS mutations have occasionally been detected among specimens from these patients.

In a panel of patient-derived xenografts in mice, the intensity of EGFR:GRB2 PLA correlated with the reduction in tumor size in response to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab. In tumor biopsies from three cohorts of lung cancer patients, positive EGFR:GRB2 PLA was observed in patients with and without EGFR mutations, and the intensity of EGFR:GRB2 PLA was predictive of overall survival in an EGFR inhibitor-treated cohort. Thus, we established the feasibility of using PLA to measure EGFR signaling-associated protein complexes in patient-based materials, suggesting the potential for similar assays for a broader array of receptor tyrosine kinases and other key signaling molecules.

In this project, we have studied the microRNA expression of lung adenocarcinomas and corresponding normal lung tissue and correlated the expression with clinical data and EGFR- and KRAS-mutational status.

We identified microRNAs associated with time to progression. We have identified several aberrantly expressed microRNAs that discriminate lung adenocarcinomas from normal lung tissue, and hence may be potential biomarkers for early detection.

Breast cancer cells and osteoblasts express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and produce ErbB family ligands, suggesting participation of these growth factors in autocrine and paracrine signaling within the bone microenvironment. EGFR ligand expression was profiled in the bone metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-231), and agonist-induced signaling was examined in both breast cancer and osteoblast-like cells. Both paracrine and autocrine EGFR signaling were inhibited with a neutralizing amphiregulin antibody, PAR34, whereas shRNA to the EGFR was used to specifically block autocrine signaling in MDA-231 cells. The impact of these was evaluated with proliferation, migration and gene expression assays. Breast cancer metastasis to bone was modeled in female athymic nude mice with intratibial inoculation of MDA-231 cells, and cancer cell-bone marrow co-cultures. EGFR knockdown, but not PAR34 treatment, decreased osteoclasts formed in vitro (p<0.01), reduced osteolytic lesion tumor volume (p<0.01), increased survivorship in vivo (p<0.001), and resulted in decreased MDA-231 growth in the fat pad (p<0.01).

Unfortunately, a subset of patients with EGFR mutations are refractory to EGFR-TKIs. Resistance to EGFR inhibitors reportedly involves SRC activation and induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we have demonstrated that overexpression of CRIPTO1, an EGF-CFC protein family member, renders EGFR-TKI-sensitive and EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells resistant to erlotinib in culture and in murine xenograft models. Furthermore, tumors from NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations that were intrinsically resistant to EGFR-TKIs expressed higher levels of CRIPTO1 compared with tumors from patients that were sensitive to EGFR-TKIs. Primary NSCLC cells derived from a patient with EGFR-mutated NSCLC that was intrinsically erlotinib resistant were CRIPTO1 positive, but gained erlotinib sensitivity upon loss of CRIPTO1 expression during culture. CRIPTO1 activated SRC and ZEB1 to promote EMT via microRNA-205 (miR-205) downregulation. While miR-205 depletion induced erlotinib resistance, miR-205 overexpression inhibited CRIPTO1-dependent ZEB1 and SRC activation, restoring erlotinib sensitivity. CRIPTO1-induced erlotinib resistance was directly mediated through SRC but not ZEB1; therefore, cotargeting EGFR and SRC synergistically attenuated growth of erlotinib-resistant, CRIPTO1-positive, EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this combination may overcome intrinsic EGFR-inhibitor resistance in patients with CRIPTO1-positive, EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

One erlotinib-resistant cell line from PC9 and two erlotinib-resistant cell lines and two gefitinib-resistant cell lines from 11-18 were independently established. Almost complete loss of mutant delE746-A750 EGFR gene was observed in the erlotinib-resistant cells isolated from PC9, and partial loss of the mutant L858R EGFR gene copy was specifically observed in the erlotinib- and gefitinib-resistant cells from 11-18. However, constitutive activation of EGFR downstream signaling, PI3K/Akt, was observed even after loss of the mutated EGFR gene in all resistant cell lines even in the presence of the drug. In the erlotinib-resistant cells from PC9, constitutive PI3K/Akt activation was effectively inhibited by lapatinib (a dual TKI of EGFR and HER2) or BIBW2992 (pan-TKI of EGFR family proteins). Furthermore, erlotinib with either HER2 or HER3 knockdown by their cognate siRNAs also inhibited PI3K/Akt activation. Transfection of activating mutant EGFR complementary DNA restored drug sensitivity in the erlotinib-resistant cell line.

To examine the role of p53, we first knocked down p53 in sensitive parental cells and found a reduction in sensitivity to both EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Conversely, restoration of functional p53 in EGFR inhibitor-resistant cells was sufficient to resensitize them to EGFR inhibitors or radiation in vitro and in vivo. Further studies indicate that p53 may enhance sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and radiation via induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair.

Although up to one-third of patient tumors resistant to reversible EGFR TKIs harbor concurrent T790M mutation and MET amplification, potential therapies for these tumors have not been modeled in vivo. In this study, we developed a preclinical platform to evaluate potential therapies by generating transgenic mouse lung cancer models expressing EGFR-mutant Del19-T790M or L858R-T790M, each with concurrent MET overexpression.

        "Doc_abstract":"Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is a major characteristic of many human malignancies including breast cancer. Since the discovery of EGF in 1960's and its receptor in 1980's, our understanding of the EGF/EGFR pathway has been significantly advanced and consequently, EGFR is considered as a major oncogenic factor and an attractive therapeutic target. The well-established traditional function of EGFR is known to transmit extra-cellular mitogenic signals, such as EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), through activating a number of downstream signaling cascades. These include signaling modules that involve phospholipase C-gamma, Ras, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). In cancer cells, the common outcomes following the activation of the EGFR-mediated downstream pathways are altered gene activities, leading to un-controlled tumor proliferation and apoptosis. Interestingly, emerging evidences suggest the existence of a direct mode of the EGFR pathway that is distinct from the traditional transduction pathway. This new mode of EGFR signaling involves cellular transport of EGFR from the cell-surface to the cell nucleus, association of nuclear EGFR complex with gene promoters, and transcriptional regulation of the target genes. Although the nature and pathological consequences of the nuclear EGFR pathway remain elusive, accumulating evidences suggest its association with increased tumor cell proliferation and poor survival rate in breast cancer patients. While several anti-EGFR agents are being tested in breast cancer patients clinically and others under pre-clinical development, a better understanding of the traditional and the nuclear EGFR pathways will facilitate the identification of patients that are likely to respond to these agents as well as future development of more effective anti-EGFR therapeutic interventions.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Several molecular pathways underlying mechanisms of this disease have been partly elucidated, among which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is one of the well-known signaling cascades that plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. The strategies to effectively inhibit EGFR signaling pathway have been used in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) targeted therapy. Patients with EGFR mutations benefit from EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) treatment. However, most of TKIs-treated patients eventually suffer drug resistant after 10-month treatments. MiRNAs (microRNAs) is a non coding RNA and protein involved in regulating gene expression in the transcription level. More and more studies have found that miRNAs are correlated with EGFR-TKIs secondary resistance. MiRNAs may serve as novel targets to circumvent the resistance and promising predictive biomarkers for EGFR-TKIs. In this paper, we reviewed briefly advanced research on miRNAs and EGFR-TKIs secondary resistance in NSCLC.;肺癌是癌症致死率最高的疾病，关于这个疾病的发生机制已得到部分阐明，其中表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）信号通路研究最为深入，在肺癌的发生中起着至关重要的作用。而有效地抑制EGFR信号通路的药物已用于非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）的靶向治疗中，伴有EGFR基因突变的患者使用EGFR酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR-TKIs）治疗后获得不错的临床收益，但大部分患者在使用该药治疗10个月后出现耐药现象。MiRNAs（microRNAs）是一种非编码蛋白的RNA，参与转录后水平基因的表达调控。越来越多的研究发现miRNAs与EGFR-TKIs继发性耐药有关，miRNAs可作为逆转EGFR-TKIs耐药及评估EGFR-TKIs有效性的生物指标。本文就NSCLC中miRNAs与EGFR-TKIs继发性耐药机制之间的相关性研究进展做简要的综述。.",

Genetic variations in 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of gene have been reported to affect gene expression by interfering with microRNAs (miRNAs), which are thought to function as either tumour suppressors or oncogenes by binding to their target mRNA. In this study, we investigated the association between the EGFR 3'UTR 774T>C polymorphism and bladder cancer risk. We used the TaqMan technology to genotype this genetic variant in a hospital-based case-control study of 908 bladder cancer patients and 1239 controls in a Chinese population. We found that the 774CC genotype was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of bladder cancer [adjusted odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.58], compared with the 774TT/TC genotype, and this increased risk was more pronounced among subgroups of age > 65 years, non-smokers and patients' tumour invasive stage. Furthermore, luciferase assays in T24 cell showed that EGFR 3'UTR 774 T to C substitution could increase the expression of EGFR, which was consistent with the association study finding. Additionally, we also provide evidence that 774T>C polymorphism increasing EGFR expression was not regulated by hsa-miR-214 binding.

However, it is not realistic to analyze for all these mechanisms at the time of resistance in clinical practice and establish adequate treatment targeting these numerous resistance mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that we should move our research focus from the exploration of \"established\" diverse resistance mechanisms to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to remain alive at the early phase of the treatment. Here in this review, we summarize up-to-date molecular mechanisms that maintain residual tumor cells against EGFR TKI monotherapy in lung cancers with EGFR mutations. We classified these mechanisms into three categories. The first is a preexisting minor subpopulation with a resistance mechanism such as a pretreatment T790M mutation that can be detected by highly sensitivity methods. The second is the reversible drug-tolerant state that is often observed in cell line models and accounts for the lack of complete response and continued survival of cells exposed to EGFR TKIs in patients. And the last is the role of the microenvironment, including survival signaling from fibroblasts or dying cancer cells and the role of poor vascularization. Primary double-strike cancer therapy, or even initial multiple-strike therapy, to cancer cells that cotarget EGFR and survival mechanism(s) simultaneously would be a promising strategy to improve the outcomes of patients with EGFR mutations.",

In this study, we report the identification of a naturally occurring and widely expressed EGFR isoform termed EGFRvA, which substitutes a Ser/Thr-rich peptide for part of the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of the receptor. Intriguingly, EGFRvA expression relates more closely to histopathologic grade and poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Ectopic expression of EGFRvA in cancer cells conferred a higher invasive capacity than EGFR in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EGFRvA stimulated expression of STAT3, which upregulated heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF). Reciprocally, HB-EGF stimulated phosphorylation of EGFRvA at Y845 along with STAT3, generating a positive feedback loop that may reinforce invasive function. The significance of EGFRvA expression was reinforced by findings that it is attenuated by miR-542-5p, a microRNA that is a known tumor suppressor.

The molecular events which induce laryngeal carcinogenesis are not yet known. Protoncogenes seem to be the target of the risk factors (cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, ionizing radiations and, not least HPV-DNA) that are commonly considered related to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. New information on the role of alterations of oncogenes and/or their proteic products in laryngeal cancer will be useful in identifying new diagnostic and clinical therapeutical applications. The Authors investigated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) expression in 103 primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and 42 normal laryngeal tissue specimens in order to assess its clinical significance in primary laryngeal cancer. Significantly higher EGFR levels were found in cancer specimens compared with normal mucosa (p < 0.001). EGFR expression did not correlate with age, tumor localization, T classification, cervicallymphonode involvement or surgery, whereas in G3 tumors it was significantly higher than in G1-G2 (p < 0.05). Follow-up data were available for 74 cases: EGFR levels resulted significantly higher in patients who had a recurrence of the disease than those in recurrence-free patients (p < 0.05). The 24-month disease-free survival (DFS) was 58% for EGFR+ patients and 82% for EGFR-subjects. Multivariate analysis permitted identification of EGFR status and tumor localization as significant independent prognostic factors. Data reported here suggest that EGFR expression probably plays a role not only by regulating the growth of laryngeal cancer, but also by identifying a sub-set of laryngeal cancer patients at a higher degree of relapse risk and with an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, in this study p21-ras expression in 43 primary laryngeal cancers and in 7 normal laryngeal mucosa specimens was evaluated. Scattered p21 levels, expressed as optical density (O.D), were found in normal mucosa (median = 1.94) and in primary laryngeal tumours (median = 1.74). Higher p21 levels were found in neoplastic tissue than in normal laryngeal tissue (median = 2.54 vs median = 1.94; p = 0.023). The correlation between p21 ras protein and EGFR levels was also investigated. EGFR+ cases do not show any difference in p21 expression with respect to EGFR- cases (median = 1.52 O.D. vs median = 1.84). Our findings suggest that overexpression of p21 is associated with malignant phenotype in laryngeal cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of using curette lavage fluid for molecular testing to detect EGFR, KRAS and P53 mutations in lung cancer patients. Samples were obtained from 77 lung cancer patients by bronchoscopy at the time of diagnosis, collected by scraping the site of the primary tumor lesion with a curette. DNA was extracted from cells in the curette lavage fluid, and PCRs were performed to amplify mutation hot spot regions in the EGFR, KRAS and P53 genes. The PCR products were direct-sequenced to detect mutations of each gene. The reference sequence of each gene was obtained from GenBank. Overall, 27% (21 of 77) were found with EGFR mutations, 1% (1 of 77) with KRAS mutations, and 36% (28 of 77) with P53 mutations. KRAS mutations were not detected in patients harboring mutations in either EGFR or P53. P53 mutations were identified in 38% (8 of 21) of the patients with EGFR mutations, all of who had advanced lung cancer. Of these patients, a 62-year-old female current smoker was given EGFR-TKI as third-line therapy, with no improvement in clinical symptoms or results of radiographic examination. Multivariate analysis indicated that P53 mutation rates in advanced-stage lung cancer were significantly higher than those in early-stage lung cancer (P=.017). In contrast, EGFR mutation rates were not significantly associated with staging. L747S in EGFR, described as a mutation associated with secondary resistance to EGFR-TKI, was detected in three patients who had never received EGFR-TKI, including one SCLC patient. It is possible to analyze EGFR, KRAS and P53 mutations using curette lavage fluid collected from lung cancer patients. This is useful when sufficient amounts of tumor samples cannot be obtained. Data from the current study suggest that EGFR mutations in concert with P53 mutations accelerate cancer development and lead to evolution of therapeutic resistance.",

Therapies that target EGFR can promote the dimerization of EGFR with other ErbB receptors, which is associated with the development of drug resistance. Understanding how interactions among ErbB receptors alter EGFR biology could provide avenues for improving cancer therapy. We found that EGFR interacted directly with the CYT1 and CYT2 variants of ErbB4 and the membrane-anchored intracellular domain (mICD). The CYT2 variant, but not the CYT1 variant, protected EGFR from ligand-induced degradation by competing with EGFR for binding to a complex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and the adaptor Grb2. Cultured breast cancer cells overexpressing both EGFR and ErbB4 CYT2 mICD exhibited increased migration. With molecular modeling, we identified residues involved in stabilizing the EGFR dimer. Mutation of these residues in the dimer interface destabilized the complex in cells and abrogated growth factor-stimulated cell migration. An exon array analysis of 155 breast tumors revealed that the relative mRNA abundance of the ErbB4 CYT2 variant was increased in ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients, suggesting that our findings could be clinically relevant. We propose a mechanism whereby competition for binding to c-Cbl in an ErbB signaling heterodimer promotes migration in response to a growth factor gradient.",

Moreover, a small percentage of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs do not respond to an EGFR-TKI, thus displaying primary resistance. At the present time, several mechanisms of either primary and acquired resistance have been elucidated, and new drugs are currently under preclinical and clinical development in order to overcome resistance to treatment. Nevertheless, there still remains much to be thoroughly investigated, as so far research has mainly focused on the role of proteincoding genes involved in resistance to EGFR-TKIs. On the other hand, in line with the data underscoring the relevance of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and modulation of response to systemic therapies, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been supposed to play an important role in resistance to EGFR-TKIs.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Promising new therapies have recently emerged from the development of molecular targeted drugs; particularly promising are those blocking the signal transduction machinery of cancer cells. One of the most widely studied cell signaling pathways is that of EGFR, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation, increased cell angiogenesis, and greater cell invasiveness. Activating mutations in the EGFR gene (deletions in exon 19 and mutation L858R in exon 21), first described in 2004, have been detected in approximately 10% of all non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Western countries and are the most important predictors of a response to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Studies of the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, in comparison with platinum-based regimens, as first-line treatments in chemotherapy-naïve patients have shown that the EGFR-TKIs produce gains in progression-free survival and overall response rates, although only in patients whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Clinical trials have also shown EGFR-TKIs to be effective as second- and third-line therapies in advanced NSCLC. Here, we review the main aspects of EGFR pathway activation in NSCLC, underscore the importance of correctly identifying activating mutations in the EGFR gene, and discuss the main outcomes of EGFR-TKI treatment in NSCLC.

Fork-head box O (FOXO) transcription factors, Akt downstream effectors, are important regulators of cell growth. Here, we hypothesized that FOXO1 might be crucial in quercetin-induced growth inhibition in EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer. Quercetin treatment suppressed cell growth by inducing G2 arrest and apoptosis in EGFR-overexpressing HSC-3 and TW206 oral cancer cells. Quercetin inhibited EGFR/Akt activation with a concomitant induction of FOXO1 activation. FOXO1 knockdown attenuated quercetin-induced p21 and FasL expression and subsequent G2 arrest and apoptosis, respectively. Likewise, quercetin suppressed tumor growth in HSC-3 xenograft mice.

Here, we show that oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces silencing of multiple unrelated tumor suppressors in lung adenocarcinomas and glioblastomas by inhibiting the DNA demethylase TET oncogene family member 1 (TET1) via the C/EBPα transcription factor. After oncogenic EGFR inhibition, TET1 binds to tumor suppressor promoters and induces their re-expression through active DNA demethylation. Ectopic expression of TET1 potently inhibits lung and glioblastoma tumor growth, and TET1 knockdown confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer cells. Lung cancer samples exhibited reduced TET1 expression or TET1 cytoplasmic localization in the majority of cases. Collectively, these results identify a conserved pathway of oncogenic EGFR-induced DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressors that may have therapeutic benefits for oncogenic EGFR-mediated lung cancers and glioblastomas.

Since the successful targeting of amplified ERBB2 with a humanized monoclonal antibody, the amplified genes of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, FGFR2, and MET, as well as those of other cell regulator genes, are being considered as candidate targets of molecular therapy. The aim of the present study was to determine the amplification status of 26 genes, which are frequently amplified in solid cancers, in advanced gastric cancers. A total of 93 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded advanced gastric cancer tissues were examined by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification, and 32 cases with 'gain' or 'amplified' status of 16 genes were further examined for the respective gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and for the respective protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of gene amplifications in advanced gastric cancers were as follows: ERBB2 (13 cases, 14%), FGFR2 (7 cases, 8%), MYC (7 cases, 8%), TOP2A (7 cases, 8%), MET (4 cases, 4%), MDM2 (4 cases, 4%), CCND1 (3 cases, 3%), FGF10 (2 cases, 3%), and EGFR (1 case, 1%). Amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinases genes occurred in a mutually exclusive manner except for one tumor in which ERBB2 and FGFR2 were both amplified but in different cancer cells. Co-amplification of ERBB2 and MYC, and EGFR and CCND1, in single nuclei but on different amplicons, was confirmed in one case each. Attempts at correlating the FISH status with the immunohistochemical staining pattern showed variable results from complete concordance to no correlation. In conclusion, combination of multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and FISH analysis is a feasible approach for obtaining the semi-comprehensive genetic information that is necessary for personalized molecular targeted therapy.

Here we found that EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor cells.

Targeting EPHA2 in erlotinib-resistant cells decreased S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of cell death agonist BAD, resulting in reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 by the small-molecule inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 decreased both survival and proliferation of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. ALW-II-41-27 was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291.

Macroautophagy, a process of intracellular proteolysis, has been shown to be activated in response to EGFR targeted therapy. However, the specific role of the induction of autophagy remains controversial. Here we show that autophagy is induced in a dose-dependent manner by in vitro treatment of multiple cancer cell lines with EGFR-TKI. Additionally, we find that in cells highly resistant to EGFR-TKI, autophagy is not robustly activated and that co-treatment of these cells with rapamycin, a known inducer of autophagy, can partially restore sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. Finally, we demonstrate that, in resistant cell lines, EGFR-TKI sensitivity can be further inhibited by siRNA-mediated depletion of the critical autophagy protein ATG7.

The response rate to EGFR-TKI tended to be higher in patients with EGFR mutations in the MLN, as all patients with EGFR mutations in the MLN showed disease control to treatment with EGFR-TKI.

EGFR is an upstream activator of several pathways involved in tumor progression, and STATs activate selected genes involved in oncogenesis. There are several different mechanisms by which STAT proteins can mediate intracellular EGFR signaling, including direct activation of STATs by EGFR binding and indirect activation of STATs through Src-mediated EGFR signaling. EGFR likely activates STAT in a manner distinctive from other mechanisms of STAT activation; STAT5 can be phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner at unique sites, conferring novel functions. Cumulative evidence suggests that targeting EGFR signaling pathways at several levels may demonstrate synergistic therapeutic effects compared with targeting the upstream receptor alone. Thus, methods to inhibit EGFR in conjunction with oncogenic STATs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for cancers characterized by upregulation of EGFR signaling.",

We demonstrate that monensin effectively inhibits cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle progression, and induces apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells. Monensin suppresses multiple cancer-related pathways including Elk1/SRF, AP1, NFκB and STAT, and reduces EGFR expression in ovarian cancer cells. Monensin acts synergistically with EGFR inhibitors and oxaliplatin to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells.

The function and mechanisms of Srx in cancer development are not well understood. Here, Srx is preferentially expressed in human colorectal cancer cells but not in normal colon epithelial cells. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that knockdown of Srx in poorly differentiated colorectal cancer cells not only leads to the inhibition of colony formation and cell invasion in vitro, but also reduces tumor xenograft growth and represses metastasis to distal organs in a mouse orthotopic implantation model. Notably, exactly opposite effects were observed in gain-of-function experiments when Srx was ectopically expressed in well-differentiated colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, expression of Srx enhances the activation of MAPK signaling through increasing the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation levels of EGFR. This function of Srx is mediated through its inhibition of EGFR acetylation at K1037, a novel posttranslational modification of EGFR in human colorectal cancer cells identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS-MS) proteomic analysis. Furthermore, abolishment of K1037 acetylation in human colorectal cancer cells by site-specific mutagenesis leads to sustained activation of EGFR-MAPK signaling. Combined, these data reveal that Srx promotes colorectal cancer cell invasion and metastasis through a novel mechanism of enhancing EGFR signaling.;Sulfiredoxin is a critical oncogenic protein that can be used as a molecular target to develop therapeutics for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.",

We demonstrated recently that the expression of EGFR in breast cancer strongly correlates with the length of a CA simple sequence repeat within the first 2000 bases in intron 1 of the egfr gene [CA simple sequence repeat (CA-SSR) I; H. Buerger et al., Cancer Res., 60: 854-857, 2000]. Using a standardized semiautomated method of microsatellite analysis for loss of heterozygosity detection, we identified an allelic imbalance (AI) at the egfr locus in 55 of 163 primary breast cancer cases. Fine mapping of the chromosomal region at 7p12-15 around the egfr gene using 10 CA-SSR markers showed that mutations of egfr in breast cancer are frequently restricted to the first intron of egfr. Thereby, the simple sequence repeat CA-SSR I in intron 1 was affected in 84% of the patients with AI. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of 23 breast cancer tissues with AI excluded the presence of in-frame deletions between exon 2 and exon 7. For additional characterization of the underlying phenomenon leading to the detection of an AI in microsatellite analysis, a quantitative 5'-nuclease assay for the first CA-SSR I in intron 1 was established. In breast cancer cases with AI the presence of amplifications of this sequence was shown. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a statistically significant worse prognosis for patients with AI in the cancer tissue at the egfr locus compared with patients without AI. Interestingly, 75% of the patients bearing AI of CA-SSR I in the tumor also showed AI at normal, nontumorous breast tissue. Our data strongly support the assumption that distinct amplifications in intronic sequences of the egfr gene, which enhance the basic transcription activity of the gene, represent one of the first steps in breast carcinogenesis. Furthermore, they point to the presence of prognosis-associated markers for breast cancer already in morphological normal breast tissue.",

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is known to stabilize mutant EGFR and ErbB2, but its role in cancers with wild-type (WT) WT-EGFR is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that fully mature, membrane-bound WT-EGFR interacts with HSP90 independent of ErbB2. Further, the HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin (GA) and AT13387 cause a decrease in WT-EGFR in cultured head and neck cancer cells. This decrease results from a significantly reduced half-life of WT-EGFR. WT-EGFR was also lost in head and neck xenograft specimens after treatment with AT13387 under conditions that inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice. Our findings demonstrate that WT-EGFR is a client protein of HSP90 and that their interaction is critical for maintaining both the stability of the receptor as well as the growth of EGFR-dependent cancers.

Constitutive or non-canonical EGFR signalling activates the transcription factor IRF3 leading to expression of IFI27, IFIT1 and TRAIL. Ligand-mediated activation of EGFR switches off IRF3-dependent transcription, activates canonical extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signals, and confers sensitivity to chemotherapy and virus-induced cell death. Mechanistically, the distinct downstream signals result from a switch of EGFR-associated proteins. EGFR constitutively complexes with IRF3 and TBK1 leading to TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation. Addition of epidermal growth factor dissociates TBK1, IRF3 and EGFR leading to a loss of IRF3 activity, Shc-EGFR association and ERK activation.

Further we provide evidence that resveratrol inhibits EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent activation of a Ras/Rho/ROCK signaling.

EGFR mutations were analyzed by DNA sequencing in 24 cases with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks. All 77 cases were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies specific for the EGFR E746-A750 deletion in exon 19 (DEL), L858R point mutation in exon 21 (L858R), and total EGFR. EGFR amplifications were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;A positive reaction of DEL-specific, L858R-specific, and total EGFR antibodies was detected in seven (9.1%), 5 (6.5%) and 35 (45.5%) of 77 SIAs by IHC, respectively. Positive reaction of the three antibodies was not significantly correlated with patient's age, gender, differentiation, and stage. EGFR gene amplification was assayed in 77 SIAs in micro-tissue array. Of 24 SIA samples that had DNA sequencing, two (8.3%) harbored exon 19 deletion and one (4.2%) harbored L858R point mutation.

As recently shown, these mechanisms may imply oncogenic activation of MET or its stimulation by the ligand hepatocyte growth factor. However, it is still largely obscure if sensitivity or resistance to EGFR inhibitors operates in cancer stem cells. Convincing evidence indicates that this elusive cell subpopulation is present at the roots of colorectal cancer. Conceivably, cancer stem cells accumulate the genetic lesions driving tumor onset and progression, as well as the genetic determinants of sensitivity or resistance to conventional and targeted therapies. Recent studies enlighten the expression of functional EGFR and MET in colorectal cancer stem cells and the outcome of their inhibition.

Dynamin2 expression in cancer tissues from HCC patients was assessed by immunohistochemistry and its prognostic significance for the patients was conducted using univariate and multivariate analysis. Its role in tumor invasion and metastasis was evaluated in vitro by gene silence using siRNA-mediated approach and the small molecule inhibitor of Dynasore. EGFR expression in HCC cell lines and EGFR downstream signaling ERK1/2 was evaluated by Western-blot and immunofluorescence analyses after Dynamin2 inhibition. Our data indicated that low expression of dynamin2 was well correlated with invasion characteristics and shorter overall survival. HCC cell migration, colony formation and invasion were significantly increased after the inhibition of dynamin2 in HCC cells. Internalization of EGFR was markedly reduced when dynamin2 was knock down or inhibition. In addition, we observed that dynamin2 regulated EGF mediated EGFR downstream Ras/ERK1/2 signaling and p-ERK1/2 accumulation in nucleus. The results demonstrate a possible mechanism of dynamin involved EGFR endocytosis and modulation of metastasis in HCC.

Its expression is positively correlated with the poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Galectin-3 can promote cancer progression through its effects on cell proliferation, cell survival or cancer metastasis. However, the role of galectin-3 in the regulation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is still unclear. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that galectin-3 might regulate lung CSCs via the EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. In our study, galectin-3 facilitated EGFR activation and enhanced the sphere formation activity of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, galectin-3 promoted Sox2 expression in an EGFR activation-dependent manner; importantly, forced expression of Sox2 blunted the effect of galectin-3 knockdown on lung cancer sphere formation ability. These results suggest that galectin-3 promotes EGFR activation leading to the upregulation of Sox2 expression and lung CSCs properties. Moreover, we showed that the carbohydrate-binding activity of galectin-3 was important for the regulation of EGFR activation, Sox2 expression and sphere formation. We have recently reported that c-Myc is a transcriptional activator of Sox2. We further found that galectin-3 enhanced c-Myc protein stability leading to increased c-Myc binding to the Sox2 gene promoter. We also examined the effect of the stemness factors, Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 on the expression of galectin-3. We found that Oct4 enhanced galectin-3 expression. Our results together suggest that galectin-3 enhances lung cancer stemness through the EGFR/c-Myc/Sox2 axis; Oct4, in turn, promotes galectin-3 expression, forming a positive regulatory loop in lung CSCs.

Aim of this study was to pinpoint mechanistic parameters occurring during egfr copy number gains leading to a stable EGFR overexpression and high sensitivity to extracellular signalling. A deeper understanding of those marker events might improve early diagnosis of cancer in suspect lesions, early detection of cancer progression and the prediction of egfr targeted therapies.;The basal-like/stemness type breast cancer cell line subpopulation MDA-MB-468 CD44high/CD24-/low, carrying high egfr amplifications, was chosen as a model system in this study. Subclones of the heterogeneous cell line expressing low and high EGF receptor densities were isolated by cell sorting. Genomic profiling was carried out for these by means of SNP array profiling, qPCR and FISH. Cell cycle analysis was performed using the BrdU quenching technique.;Low and high EGFR expressing MDA-MB-468 CD44+/CD24-/low subpopulations separated by cell sorting showed intermediate and high copy numbers of egfr, respectively. However, during cell culture an increase solely for egfr gene copy numbers in the intermediate subpopulation occurred. This shift was based on the formation of new cells which regained egfr gene copies. By two parametric cell cycle analysis clonal effects mediated through growth advantage of cells bearing higher egfr gene copy numbers could most likely be excluded for being the driving force. Subsequently, the detection of a fragile site distal to the egfr gene, sustaining uncapped telomere-less chromosomal ends, the ladder-like structure of the intrachromosomal egfr amplification and a broader range of egfr copy numbers support the assumption that dynamic chromosomal rearrangements, like breakage-fusion-bridge-cycles other than proliferation drive the gain of egfr copies.;Progressive genome modulation in the CD44+/CD24-/low subpopulation of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 leads to different coexisting subclones. In isolated low-copy cells asymmetric chromosomal segregation leads to new cells with regained solely egfr gene copies. Furthermore, egfr regain resulted in enhanced signal transduction of the MAP-kinase and PI3-kinase pathway. We show here for the first time a dynamic copy number regain in basal-like/stemness cell type breast cancer subpopulations which might explain genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, this process might also be involved in adaptive growth factor receptor intracellular signaling which support survival and migration during cancer development and progression.",

We examined the potency of EGFR inhibition achieved by combining anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody and tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which target extracellular and intracellular domains of the receptor, respectively. We specifically studied the combination of cetuximab (Erbitux, C225; ImClone Systems, New York, NY) with either gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839; AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, UK) or erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI-774; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) across a variety of human cancer cells. The combination of cetuximab plus gefitinib or erlotinib enhanced growth inhibition over that observed with either agent alone. As measured by immunostaining, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation with the combination of cetuximab plus gefitinib or erlotinib was augmented over that obtained with single-agent therapy in head and neck (H&N) cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation inhibition of downstream effector molecules [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT] also was enhanced in tumor cells treated with the combination of cetuximab plus gefitinib or erlotinib. Flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that treatment of H&N tumor cells with cetuximab in combination with either gefitinib or erlotinib amplified the induction of apoptosis. Following establishment of cetuximab-resistant cell lines, we observed that gefitinib or erlotinib retained the capacity to inhibit growth of lung and H&N tumor cells that were highly resistant to cetuximab. Treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib, but not cetuximab, also could further inhibit the activation of downstream effectors of EGFR signaling in cetuximab-resistant cells, including MAPK and AKT. These data suggest that tyrosine kinase inhibitors may further modulate intracellular signaling that is not fully blocked by extracellular anti-EGFR antibody treatment. Finally, animal studies confirmed that single EGFR inhibitor treatment resulted in partial and transient tumor regression in human lung cancer xenografts. In contrast, more profound tumor regression and regrowth delay were observed in mice treated with the combination of cetuximab and gefitinib or erlotinib. Immunohistochemical staining, which demonstrated significant reduction of the proliferative marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen in mice treated with dual EGFR inhibitors, further supported this in vivo observation. Together, these data suggest that combined treatment with distinct EGFR inhibitory agents can augment the potency of EGFR signaling inhibition. This approach suggests potential new strategies to maximize effective target inhibition, which may improve the therapeutic ratio for anti-EGFR-targeted therapies in developing clinical trials.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple mutations in the EGFR gene are a major cause for the failure of Erlotinib and Gefitinib in the treatment of patients harboring non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who initially responded to this therapy. The development of these tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is going back to the early 90s, where cancer was widely considered and fully treated as a disease of an organ. Fundamental gain of knowledge in cell biology in general and cancer genetics in particular led us to where we currently stand: cancer is a disease that originates in the genome. Fast and affordable gene sequencing paved the way and opened our eyes for the genetic instability of many cancers, particularly EGFR driven NSCLC. This might allow highly rational and personal therapies by aiming at a very particular wild type and mutant kinase pattern. However, the paradigm \"one disease - one target - one drug\" is currently challenged. Both activating and deactivating EGFR mutations are known to render the development of novel targeted drugs difficult. Among all lung adenocarcinomas, only 20% are driven by EGFR and only a subpopulation has an activating mutation (e.g. L858R), making them sensitive to first generation EGFR inhibitors. Unfortunately, most of them acquire second deactivating mutations (e.g. T790M) during treatment, leading to a complete loss of response. Are specific inhibitors of the double EGFR mutant L858R/T790M the magic bullet? Much scientific evidence but also high expectations justify this approach. Structural biology of EGFR mutants constitutes the basis for highly rational approaches. Second generation pan EGFR inhibitors inhibiting wild type (WT) and mutant EGFR like Afatinib suffer from dose-limiting adverse effects. Inhibition of WT EGFR is considered to be the culprit. Third generation EGFR inhibitors follow two strategies. Mutant selectivity and improved target residential time. These inhibitors display high mutant selectivity and irreversible binding patterns while sparing WT EGFR activity, hence enhancing tumor selectivity while minimizing adverse effects. Third generation EGFR inhibitors are still undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. The most advanced are Rociletinib and AZD9291 which displayed encouraging preliminary clinical phase II data regarding response and adverse effects. In the current review we show both a medicinal chemists' approach toward the design of third generation EGFR inhibitors as well as a detailed overview of the development of EGFR inhibitors over the last decade. High interdisciplinary approaches, such as structural biology and time-resolved tumor genetics pave the way toward the development of drugs that target EGFR mutants. This might lead to highly effective targeted and personalized therapies with enhanced response rates for a minor cohort of patients which have to undergo continuous gene sequencing, hence enabling therapies with tailor-made TKIs.

Mutation analysis of the EGFR gene is therefore indispensable for predicting gefitinib response. We investigated a CA-repeat polymorphism in the EGFR gene related to EGFR mutations. Because an increasing number of CA-repeats at intron 1 of the EGFR gene has been reported to reduce transcription activity, we examined the relationship between EGFR mutations and this CA-repeat polymorphism. EGFR mutations at exon 19 were closely associated with shorter CA-repeat length in the shorter allele, but this was not the case for EGFR mutations at exons 18 or 21. Increased intrinsic EGFR mRNA expression in non-cancerous lung tissues from lung adenocarcinoma patients was also significantly associated with shorter CA-repeat length. A higher frequency of EGFR mutations at exon 19 was associated with shorter CA-repeat length only in patients with high levels of EGFR mRNA expression. To determine the phenotypes of cells possessing shorter CA-repeats, an in vitro study using human bronchial epithelial cells with different CA-repeat lengths was performed; more rapid cell growth and activated EGF/EGFR signaling were found more often in the cells having both shorter CA-repeats and increased EGFR mRNA expression. These results suggest that CA-repeat length in the EGFR gene may be a genetic factor related to cancer in the case of EGFR mutations at exon 19. The mechanism likely involves enhanced intrinsic expression of EGFR mRNA and activated EGF/EGFR signaling that accompany shorter CA-repeats.",

We have previously shown that an AR/EGFR autocrine loop is required for SUM149 human breast cancer cell proliferation, motility and invasion. We also demonstrated that AR can induce these altered phenotypes when expressed in the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, or by exposure of these cells to AR in the medium. In the present studies, we demonstrate that SUM149 cells and immortalized human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells that over express AR (MCF10A AR) or are cultured in the presence of exogenous AR, express higher levels of EGFR protein than MCF10A cells cultured in EGF. Pulse-chase analysis showed that EGFR protein remained stable in the presence of AR, yet was degraded in the presence of EGF. Consistent with this observation, tyrosine 1045 on the EGFR, the c-cbl binding site, exhibited less phosphorylation following stimulation with AR than following stimulation with EGF. Ubiquitination of the receptor was also dramatically less following stimulation with AR than following stimulation with EGF. Flow cytometry analysis showed that EGFR remained on the cell surface following stimulation with AR but was rapidly internalized following stimulation with EGF. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy confirmed the flow cytometry results. EGFR in MCF10A cells cultured in the presence of EGF exhibited a predominantly intracellular, punctate localization. In stark contrast, SUM149 cells and MCF10A cells growing in the presence of AR expressed EGFR predominantly on the membrane and at cell-cell junctions. We propose that AR alters EGFR internalization and degradation in a way that favors accumulation of EGFR at the cell surface and ultimately leads to changes in EGFR signaling.",

We observed decreased CTLs and increased markers of T-cell exhaustion in mouse models of EGFR-driven lung cancer. PD-1 antibody blockade improved the survival of mice with EGFR-driven adenocarcinomas by enhancing effector T-cell function and lowering the levels of tumor-promoting cytokines. Expression of mutant EGFR in bronchial epithelial cells induced PD-L1, and PD-L1 expression was reduced by EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with activated EGFR.

HER family members are activated in cancer cells and are now considered to be useful molecular targets for cancer therapy. Recently, several new drugs, including monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors that target HER members, have been developed and clinically used to treat solid tumors. Members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family are thought to mediate the shedding of EGFR ligands and this event is critical for the production of soluble functional EGFR ligands. In melanoma cells, UV irradiation activates some ADAM members and induces melanoma cell growth through EGFR ligand shedding by activated ADAMs. These findings suggest that ADAM inhibitors are also candidate anticancer drugs acting via the blockade of HER family signaling pathways. After shedding of EGFR ligands by ADAMs, the carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of EGFR ligands in the cytoplasm are translocated to the nucleus and induce cell proliferation by binding and exporting repressors and activating cyclin A and c-Myc. Based on these findings, the present molecular targeting therapy against HER members, EGFR and HER2, may not be sufficient, while ADAMs and nuclear translocation of the CTF of EGFR ligands are potential targets for the treatment of cancer, particularly malignancies that are dependent on the EGF family.",

Chemotherapies such as the topoisomerase II (TopoII) inhibitor etoposide effectively reduce disease in a minority of patients with this cancer; therefore, alternative drug targets, including epigenetic enzymes, are under consideration for therapeutic intervention. A promising potential epigenetic target is the methyltransferase EZH2, which in the context of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is well known to tri-methylate histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and elicit gene silencing. Here we demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition has differential effects on the TopoII inhibitor response of non-small-cell lung cancers in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and BRG1 mutations are genetic biomarkers that predict enhanced sensitivity to TopoII inhibitor in response to EZH2 inhibition. BRG1 loss-of-function mutant tumours respond to EZH2 inhibition with increased S phase, anaphase bridging, apoptosis and TopoII inhibitor sensitivity. Conversely, EGFR and BRG1 wild-type tumours upregulate BRG1 in response to EZH2 inhibition and ultimately become more resistant to TopoII inhibitor. EGFR gain-of-function mutant tumours are also sensitive to dual EZH2 inhibition and TopoII inhibitor, because of genetic antagonism between EGFR and BRG1. These findings suggest an opportunity for precision medicine in the genetically complex disease of non-small-cell lung cancer. ",

Immunohistochemical staining for EGFR was performed on frozen sections of primary breast cancer from 1029 patients with a mean follow-up duration of 46 months. EGFR was positive in 277 (26.9%) of 1029 cases which inversely correlated with the estrogen receptor (ER) status. A univariated analysis indicated that EGFR had a significant prognostic value in both the disease free survival (DFS) and the overall survival (OS), while the same effect was also found in node negative as well as node positive breast cancer. A multivariate analysis indicated that EGFR was an independently significant prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.0174) and OS (p = 0.0105) in all patients, but that EGFR demonstrated a prognostic significance only for DFS (p = 0.0241) in node negative and only for OS (p = 0.0333) in node positive breast cancer. When all patients were stratified for EGFR and ER, a multivariate analysis indicated that the combination of EGFR(+)/ER(-) was an independently significant factor for both DFS and OS in node negative as well as node positive breast cancer. In conclusion, the prognostic value of EGFR was demonstrated by a multivariate analysis in a large series of breast cancer patients, but the value of EGFR was somewhat insufficient to achieve statistical significance for both DFS and OS in the subgroups divided by nodal status.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key intracellular kinase integrating proliferation, survival and angiogenic pathways and has been implicated in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors.

In BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation.

Mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTEC) from Gprc5a(-/-) mice exhibited a relative increase in EGFR and downstream STAT3 signaling, whereas GPRC5A expression inhibited EGFR and STAT3 signaling. GPRC5A physically interacted with EGFR through its transmembrane domain, which was required for its EGFR inhibitory activity. Gprc5a(-/-) MTEC were much more susceptible to EGFR inhibitors than wild-type MTEC, suggesting their dependence on EGFR signaling for proliferation and survival. Dysregulated EGFR and STAT3 were identified in the normal epithelia of small and terminal bronchioles as well as tumors of Gprc5a(-/-) mouse lungs. Moreover, in these lungs EGFR inhibitor treatment inhibited EGFR and STAT3 activation along with cell proliferation. Finally, overexpression of ectopic GPRC5A in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells inhibited both EGF-induced and constitutively activated EGFR signaling.

EGFRBi-armed ATC also secreted significantly higher levels of some T(H1)/T(H2) cytokines compared with ATC alone.

Recognizing the central role that this receptor plays in cancer development and progression, various approaches have been developed to target it in order to more specifically eradicate cancer cells. These methods include, among others, low-molecular weight inhibitors of the TK domain that are commonly designed to treat those tumors that overexpress the EGFR. Nevertheless, no currently available assay provides non-invasive, longitudinal and sensitive quantitation of receptor levels in tumors so as to better identify candidate patients for EGFR-targeted therapies. Hence, attempts have been made to develop radiolabeled molecular imaging agents as potential bioprobes to quantitatively monitor treatment efficiency. Such EGFR-targeted bioprobes could not only improve patient selection and treatment monitoring, but also allow a direct delivery of radionuclides for radiotherapy. In this review, the role that EGFR plays in cancer development and therapy is briefly presented, followed by a short review of prominent milestones in the development of EGFR-TK inhibitors. These inhibitors constitute the fundamental core structure for the development of radiolabeled probes to visualize the EGFR in vivo. The considerations that need to be taken into account for the development of such probes will be presented, along with a critical examination on the progress that has been made thus far in the field.",

Dimerization plays a key role in the activation of EGFR, so targeting the conservative dimer interface probably improve the responses of anti-EGFR clinically. To evoke a high titers of antibodies (Abs) targeting the dimer interface of EGFR in patients, a chimeric peptide, comprising a linear B-cell epitope peptide from the highly conservative β-hairpin loop of dimer interface of human EGFR (EGFR237-267) and a 'promiscuous' Th-cell epitope MVF from the measles virus fusion protein, was constructed. The construct was immunogenic and able to elicit high titers of peptide-specific Abs in both mice and rabbits, while both animals' EGFRs contain a sequence 100% homologous to EGFR237-267. The peptide-specific Abs could recognize and inhibit EGFR over-expressing epithelial cancer cells, such as epidermoid carcinoma A431 and Lewis lung cancer (LLC), furthermore, the binding of the Abs to the native EGFR on the surface of cells was ligand-dependent, which meant that these Abs did target the dimer interface of EGFR as designed, because the exposure of the interface needs ligand binding. The chimeric peptide immunization was able to significantly inhibit the growth of subcutaneously transplanted LLC cells in C57BL6 mice. Therefore, the MVF-EGFR237-267 construct represents a promising candidate for active anti-EGFR immunotherapy and provides a novel targeting strategy for the anti-EGFR therapy.",

Reduced p27Kip1 expression is prevalent in a wide range of human tumours; however, the exact mechanism(s) of p27Kip1-mediated tumour suppression remains obscure. In the present study, we identified a close inverse relationship between p27Kip1 and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) expression: the parental T24 human bladder cancer cells had high p27Kip1 expression but low EGFR expression and, in striking contrast, the metastatic derivative of T24 (T24T) had low p27Kip1 expression but high EGFR expression. This relationship was also found in various human cancer tissues, and was not only just correlative but also causal; depletion of p27Kip1 in MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells resulted in markedly elevated EGFR expression, a result reproducible with an Egfr promoter-luciferase reporter in both T24 and MEF cells, suggesting transcriptional repression of EGFR by p27Kip1. Indeed, p27Kip1 was found to regulate EGFR expression via the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)/c-Jun transcription factor: p27Kip1 deficiency activated JNK/c-Jun, whereas inhibition of JNK/c-Jun by dominant-negative mutants dramatically repressed Egfr transcription. Furthermore, the proximal promoter of the Egfr gene was crucial for its transcription, where the recruiting activity of c-Jun was much greater in p27Kip1-/- cells than in p27Kip1+/+ cells. Introduction of GFP-p27Kip1 into T24T cells suppressed JNK/c-Jun activation, EGFR expression and anchorage-independent growth. The results of the present study demonstrate that p27Kip1 suppresses JNK/c-Jun activation and EGFR expression in MEFs and human bladder cancer cells, and the results obtained are consistent with those from human cancer specimens. The present study provides new insights into p27Kip1 suppression of cancer cell growth, migration and metastasis. ",

ADAMs are transmembrane proteins that cleave membrane-anchored proteins to release soluble factors, and thereby mediate important biological phenomena in tumors. The aim of this study was to analyze histopathology, expression and roles of metalloproteinases, especially ADAMs, in gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Histopathology and immunohistochemical expression of ADAMs were examined in 89 gastric GISTs. In 11 GISTs, ADAM expression was examined at mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting, respectively. RT-PCR analysis showed frequent expression of ADAM9 (91%), ADAM10 (64%), ADAM17 (82%), MMP-2 (82%), and MT1-MMP (73%). However, ADAM17 and MMP-2 were the only metalloproteinases that were up-regulated in GISTs at the protein level compared with non-neoplastic gastric tissues. ADAM17 was immunohistochemically expressed in 93% of GIST versus 16% of normal gastric tissues. Furthermore, CD117-positive interstitial cells of Cajal in normal gastric tissues were all negative for ADAM17 with double immunostaining. Expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and several EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin, and epiregulin were also demonstrated in GIST by RT-PCR. Protein expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, amphiregulin, and HB-EGF, both of which can be shed by ADAM17, was confirmed in tumors coexpressing ADAM17 by immunoblotting. Moreover, proteolytically cleaved soluble forms of amphiregulin were identified in tumor extracts. Considered together, the results suggest that ADAM17 may contribute to the progression and growth of GIST through shedding of EGFR ligands and consequent EGFR stimulation. ADAM17, as a major sheddase in GIST, could be potentially a suitable target in anticancer treatment of imatinib-resistant GISTs.",

Inducible expression of LRIG1 in head and neck cancer TW01 cells, a line with low LRIG1 levels, suppressed cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Gene expression profiling, quantitative RT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and western blot analysis demonstrated that LRIG1 modulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and EGFR-MAPK-SPHK1 transduction pathway by suppressing expression of EGFR ligands/activators, MMPs and SPHK1. In addition, LRIG1 induction triggered cell morphology changes and integrin inactivation, which coupled with reduced SNAI2 expression. By contrast, knockdown of endogenous LRIG1 in TW06 cells, a line with normal LRIG1 levels, significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness. Such tumor-promoting effects could be abolished by specific MAPK or SPHK1 inhibitors.

One of the major challenges stems from cancer stem cell-derived drug resistance. CD133 positive cells are well believed as cancer stem cells (CSC) in endometrial cancers and NOTCH pathway plays a critical role in retaining CD133+ cells by promoting CSC self-renewal and chemoresistance. Here, we initiated a therapeutic strategy to improve effects of EGFR inhibition by targeting NOTCH pathway of CD133+ cells in endometrial cancers. We first detected and purified the CD133+ cell fraction in endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa (IK), and validated activation of NOTCH pathway in the CD133+ cells that have higher proliferation rate and lower apoptosis rate, comparing to CD133- cells. Results of nude mouse xenograft experiments further demonstrated CD133+ cells retain higher tumorigenesis capacity than CD133- cells, indicating their tumor-initiating property. Last, we applied both NOTCH inhibitor DAPT and EGFR inhibitor AG1478 treatment on endometrial cancer lines IK and HEC-1A and the results suggested improvement effects of the combination therapy compared to the treatments of DAPT or AG1478 alone. These findings indicated targeting NOTCH pathway in CD133+ cells, combining with EGFR inhibition, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for endometrial cancer diseases.",

Multiple treatment strategies are now available to patients whose disease has progressed on their initial EGFR inhibitor, including therapies targeting both T790M, and non-T790M-mediated resistance.;This review summarizes information about and current treatment strategies for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer whose disease progresses on their initial EGFR inhibitor, including those with T790M and other types of acquired resistance.

Biopsy and genotyping of resistant tissue or plasma are essential to identifying resistance mechanisms and selecting the most appropriate treatment when patients' disease progresses during treatment with an initial EGFR inhibitor. Third-generation EGFR inhibitors are generally preferred for patients with T790M-positive resistance, whereas standard chemotherapy and clinical trials are preferred for those without T790M. For select patients, treatment can be continued beyond progression and local ablative therapies can be used to target sites of oligoprogression.;Treatment for patients who progress on their initial EGFR inhibitor should be tailored to identified resistance mechanisms and sites of progression.

Importantly, intragenic microdeletions of the EGFR phosphatase PTPRS were frequent (26%), identifying this gene as a target of 19p13 loss.

However, the molecular mechanism of CXCR7 ligand-independent EGFR transactivation is unknown. We used cDNA knock-in, RNAi and analysis of mitogenic signaling components in both normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells to decipher the proliferation-inducing mechanism of the CXCR7-EGFR interaction. The data demonstrate that CXCR7-induced EGFR transactivation is independent of both the release of cryptic EGFR ligands (e.g., AREG/amphiregulin) and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. An alternate signaling mechanism involving β-arrestin-2 (ARRB2/β-AR2) was examined by manipulating the levels of β-AR2 and analyzing changes in LNCaP cell growth and phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, Src, and Akt. Depletion of β-AR2 in LNCaP cells increased proliferation/colony formation and significantly increased activation of Src, phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-1110, and phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2 compared with that with control shRNA. Moreover, β-AR2 depletion downregulated the proliferation suppressor p21. Stimulation of β-AR2-expressing cells with EGF resulted in rapid nuclear translocation of phosphorylated/activated EGFR. Downregulation of β-AR2 enhanced this nuclear translocation. These results demonstrate that β-AR2 is a negative regulator of CXCR7/Src/EGFR-mediated mitogenic signaling.;This study reveals that β-AR2 functions as a tumor suppressor, underscoring its clinical importance in regulating CXCR7/EGFR-mediated tumor cell proliferation.

However, little is known about the parameters that might indicate a potential clinical response for these anti-EGFR-based therapies. In order to gain further insights into the interplay between the length of a CA-SSR I repeat in intron 1 of egfr, copy numbers of this untranslated regulatory sequence, and protein expression, the present study investigated breast cancers from Germans and Japanese patients by microsatellite analysis, quantitative 5' nuclease assay by egfr enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Japanese breast cancer patients displayed significantly longer alleles for the CA-SSR I repeat (p < 0.001), associated with significantly lower EGFR expression (mean 65 versus 36 fmol/mg membrane protein). Allelic imbalance (restricted to CA-SSR I) was observed in 55% of the informative Japanese breast cancers compared with only 34% of the German breast cancer reference group. Using a quantitative 5' nuclease assay for egfr, a significantly higher percentage of Japanese breast cancer patients revealed amplifications of the CA-SSR I repeat (p < 0.01). Japanese patients with these amplifications were characterized by a significantly higher EGFR content compared with the German breast cancer patients (p < 0.05). These data show, on the one hand, that the correlation of EGFR overexpression and an inherited CA repeat polymorphism within intron 1 of egfr is a general finding in breast cancer, as has been shown previously. On the other hand, the data demonstrate clearly for the first time an interaction between the length of a polymorphism in intron 1 of egfr as an inherited genetic factor and the frequency of egfr amplification, as an acquired genetic factor, both factors contributing to EGFR overexpression in breast cancer.

To investigate this phenomenon, we transfected a cytomegalovirus expression vector directing the expression of EGFR into estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells and into a clone of MCF-7 cells previously transfected with transforming growth factor alpha. Cells arising from single clones or pooled polyclonal populations maintained in charcoal-stripped calf serum, a medium devoid of estrogen, overexpressed EGFR. Switching these cells to a medium containing fetal calf serum or charcoal-stripped calf serum plus 17 beta-estradiol resulted in the emergence of a population expressing low EGFR levels. Loss of expression was not a consequence of nonspecific repression of the cytomegalovirus promoter, because expression of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-4 complementary DNA in a similar vector was not lost in fetal calf serum. While loss of EGFR overexpression in fetal calf serum was seen at both the protein and mRNA levels, Southern blotting shows that this was not due to loss of the transfected gene. Subclones of a cell population with low EGFR expression were capable of increasing expression upon estrogen withdrawal, demonstrating that the changes in EGFR expression were reversible and suggesting a growth advantage conferred by EGFR overexpression under these restrictive growth conditions.

Immunohistochemically, 70 (42%), 87 (52%), 68 (41%) of 167 primary gastric cancers were stained positively for EGF, TGFalpha, and EGFR, respectively. Tumors with synchronous expression of EGFR and its ligands were most frequent in the following clinicopathological groups: tumors greater than 6 cm in size, those of the infiltrating type, and those of the poorly differentiated type. Among poorly differentiated carcinomas, the synchronous expression of EGFR and its ligands was more frequent in the infiltrating gross type than in the localized type. EGFR gene amplification was found in 5 (4.9%) of 103 primary tumors. EGFR gene amplification was also observed more frequently in infiltrating gross type of poorly,differentiated adenocarcinomas, as compared to localized gross type. These results indicate that the autocrine mechanism through EGFR may play an important role in the progression of infiltrating gross type of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach.",

However, it is still unclear whether the ERbeta expression is related to EMT, invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. In the present study, we examined whether ERbeta1 through regulating EMT can influence invasion and metastasis in basal-like cancers.;Basal-like breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) in which ERbeta1 was either overexpressed or downregulated were analyzed for their ability to migrate and invade (wound-healing assay, matrigel-coated Transwell assay) as well as for the expression of EMT markers and components of the EGFR pathway (immunoblotting, RT-PCR). Coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitylation assays were employed to examine whether ERbeta1 alters EGFR protein degradation and the interaction between EGFR and the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. The metastatic potential of the ERbeta1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells was evaluated in vivo in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model and the correlation between ERbeta1 and E-cadherin expression was examined in 208 clinical breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry.;Here we show that ERbeta1 inhibits EMT and invasion in basal-like breast cancer cells when they grow either in vitro or in vivo in zebrafish. The inhibition of EMT correlates with an ERbeta1-mediated upregulation of miR-200a/b/429 and the subsequent repression of ZEB1 and SIP1, which results in increased expression of E-cadherin. The positive correlation of ERbeta1 and E-cadherin expression was additionally observed in breast tumor samples. Downregulation of the basal marker EGFR through stabilization of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl complexes and subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation of the activated receptor is involved in the ERbeta1-mediated repression of EMT and induction of EGFR signaling abolished the ability of ERbeta1 to sustain the epithelial phenotype.;Taken together, the results of our study strengthen the association of ERbeta1 with the regulation of EMT and propose the receptor as a potential crucial marker in predicting metastasis in breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is emerging as an important tumor suppressor. Its expression is lost during the progression of several types of cancer, including lung cancer. The EGF receptor (EGFR), a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, transduces intracellular signals responsible for cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. EGFR activity is frequently abnormally upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) and thus is considered to be a driving oncogene for LAC. EGFR translocates into the nucleus and transcriptionally activates genes, such as CCND1, that promote cell growth. Recently, we demonstrated that PML interacted with nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) and suppressed the nEGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of CCND1 in lung cancer cells, thereby restraining cell growth. When we further investigated the interplay between PML and EGFR in lung cancer metastasis, we found that the matrix metalloprotease-2 gene (MMP2) was a novel nEGFR target gene and was repressed by PML. We provide evidence that nEGFR bound to the AT-rich sequence (ATRS) in the MMP2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity. In addition, we demonstrated that PML repressed nEGFR-induced MMP2 transcription and reduced cell invasion. PML was recruited by nEGFR to the MMP2 promoter where it reduced histone acetylation, leading to the transcriptional repression of MMP2. Finally, we demonstrated that PML upregulation by interferon-β (IFNβ) in lung cancer cells decreased MMP2 expression and cell invasion. Together, our results suggested that IFNβ induced PML to inhibit lung cancer metastasis by repressing the nEGFR-mediated transcriptional activation of MMP2. ",

In EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines with the acquired resistance threonine-to-methionine mutation in codon 790 (T790M) mutation, XAV939 enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to an irreversible EGFR-TKI but not a reversible EGFR-TKI.

The basal-like breast cancer subtype represents one of the most aggressive and lethal types of breast cancer, and due to poor mechanistic understanding, it lacks targeted therapy. Many basal-like breast cancer patient samples display alterations of established drivers of cancer development, including elevated expression of EGFR, p53 inactivating mutations and loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN; however, their contribution to human basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis remains ill-defined. Using non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells, we set out to determine whether altering EGFR, p53 and PTEN in different combinations could contribute to basal-like breast cancer progression through transformation of cells. Altering PTEN in combination with either p53 or EGFR in contrast to any of the single alterations caused increased growth of transformed colonies in soft agar. Concomitantly modifying all three genes led to the highest rate of cellular proliferation and the greatest degree of anchorage-independent colony formation. Results from our effort to engineer a model of BBC expressing alterations of EGFR, p53 and PTEN suggest that these changes are cooperative and likely play a causal role in basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis.

Co-amplification of cancer genes plays an important role in the development of many tumour types. To better understand the effect of EGFR aberrations on vulvar cancer phenotype and patient prognosis, the authors analysed EGFR copy number changes using fluorescence in situ hybridisation and EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray containing 183 squamous cell carcinomas of vulva. Furthermore, the authors analysed the co-amplification frequency of EGFR with HER2, CCND1, MYC and PIK3CA, respectively. EGFR copy number increase was found in 39.3% of the tumours. Seventeen per cent of vulvar carcinomas showed EGFR high polysomy including 9% with amplification of the EGFR gene. Copy number gain of the EGFR locus was associated with non-basaloid phenotype (p=0.03), high-tumour stage (p<0.001), human papillomaviruse negativity of tumours (p=0.04) and the number of lymph node metastases (p=0.02). EGFR protein expression was statistically correlated to EGFR copy number increase (p<0.05). The observed co-amplification rate of EGFR with all four additionally examined oncogenes was much higher than statistically expected. There was a highly significant association between EGFR copy number increase and CCND1 amplifications (p<0.001) as well as the total number of gene amplifications (p=0.04). EGFR copy number gains were significantly related to unfavourable patient outcome in univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. In conclusion, EGFR copy number increases are detectable in a substantial proportion of vulvar carcinomas with relationships to advanced tumour stages and the development of lymph node metastases. EGFR copy number aberrations are connected to other gene amplifications and probably define an human papillomaviruses-independent pathway in the development of vulvar carcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) can phosphorylate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at threonine 654 (T654) to inhibit EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (pY-EGFR) and the associated activation of downstream effectors. However, upregulation of PKCα in a large variety of cancers is not associated with EGFR inactivation, and factors determining the potential of PKCα to downregulate EGFR are yet unknown. Here, we show that ectopic expression of annexin A6 (AnxA6), a member of the Ca(2+) and phospholipid-binding annexins, strongly reduces pY-EGFR levels while augmenting EGFR T654 phosphorylation in EGFR overexpressing A431, head and neck and breast cancer cell lines. Reduced EGFR activation in AnxA6 expressing A431 cells is associated with reduced EGFR internalization and degradation. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated PKCα knockdown in AnxA6 expressing A431 cells reduces T654-EGFR phosphorylation, but restores EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, clonogenic growth and EGFR degradation. These findings correlate with AnxA6 interacting with EGFR, and elevated AnxA6 levels promoting PKCα membrane association and interaction with EGFR. Stable expression of the cytosolic N-terminal mutant AnxA6(1-175), which cannot promote PKCα membrane recruitment, does not increase T654-EGFR phosphorylation or the association of PKCα with EGFR. AnxA6 overexpression does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of the T654A EGFR mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKCα. Most strikingly, stable plasma membrane anchoring of AnxA6 is sufficient to recruit PKCα even in the absence of EGF or Ca(2+). In summary, AnxA6 is a new PKCα scaffold to promote PKCα-mediated EGFR inactivation through increased membrane targeting of PKCα and EGFR/PKCα complex formation.",

We previously showed that EGFR was also required for colonic tumor promotion by Western diet. The goal of this study was to identify EGFR-regulated microRNAs that contribute to diet-promoted colonic tumorigenesis. Murine colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) and hypomorphic Egfr(wa2) mice were screened using micro RNA (miRNA) arrays and miR-143 and miR-145 changes confirmed by Northern, real-time PCR, and in situ analysis. Rodent and human sporadic and ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated colon cancers were examined for miR-143 and miR-145. Effects of EGFR on miR-143 and miR-145 expression were assessed in murine and human colonic cells and their putative targets examined in vitro and in vivo. miR-143 and miR-145 were readily detected in normal colonocytes and comparable in Egfr(wt) and Egfr(wa2) mice. These miRNAs were downregulated in azoxymethane and inflammation-associated colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) mice but upregulated in Egfr(wa2) tumors. They were also reduced in human sporadic and UC colon cancers. EGFR signals suppressed miR-143 and miR-145 in human and murine colonic cells. Transfected miR-143 and miR-145 inhibited HCT116 cell growth in vitro and in vivo and downregulated G(1) regulators, K-Ras, MYC, CCND2, cdk6, and E2F3, putative or established targets of these miRNAs. miRNA targets Ras and MYC were increased in colonic tumors from Egfr(wt) but not Egfr(wa2) mice fed a Western diet.

The complex nature of EGFR biology allows for potential opportunities for EGFR inhibitors in a number of areas of cancer therapy, including proliferative, angiogenic, invasive, and metastatic aspects. Different approaches have been used to target either the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the EGFR or the intracellular tyrosine kinase region that results in interference with its signaling pathways that modulate cancer-promoting responses. Examples of these include a number of monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins and ligand-binding cytotoxic agents that target the extracellular ligand binding region of EGFR, and small molecule inhibitors that target the intracellular kinase domain and act by interfering with ATP binding to the receptor. During the past 3 years, significant progress has been made towards the identification of new structural classes of small molecule inhibitors that show high potency and specificity towards EGFR. The search for new small molecules that inhibit kinases has included traditional approaches like the testing of natural products, random screening of chemical libraries, the use of classical structure-activity-relationship studies, and the incorporation of structure-based drug design and combinatorial chemistry techniques. There has been a significant improvement in the development of selective EGFR inhibitors with the use of a structure-based design approach employing a homology model of the EGFR kinase domain. Molecular modeling procedures have been used to generate novel molecules that are complementary in shape and electrostatics to the EGFR kinase domain topography.

The present hospital-based case-control study evaluated the possible association of CA repeat polymorphism in the EGFR gene with risk of lung cancer in a Korean population. A bimodal pattern appeared, with a frequency of 57.1% for 20 CA repeats and 18.6% for 16 CA repeats.

If any link of the EGFR signals system is interfered with or damaged, the proliferation, growth, and differentiation of cells would become uncontrolled. EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of malignant tumors, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Results of the study have proved that EGFR overexpression is closely associated with mutations and variants of the EGFR genes, whose mutations and variants are associated with occurrence, metastasis, and prognosis of different types of tumors, including lung cancer. This study is aimed at investigating whether the polymorphisms of CA simple sequence repeat in intron 1 (CA-SSR1), -216G/T, and R497K in the EGFR are able to induce EGFR activation and whether overexpression is associated with pleural metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma. A total of 432 lung adenocarcinoma patients with pleural metastasis (metastasis group) and 424 patients with lung adenocarcinoma but without pleural metastasis (nonmetastasis group) were enrolled in this study. For all patients, the CA-SSR1 genotypes were determined by capillary electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and direct DNA sequencing, and the R497K and -216G/T genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct DNA sequencing. EGFR expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining in primary tumor tissues with different -216G/T, R497K, and CA-SSR1 genotypes. Our results showed significant differences between pleural metastasis and nonmetastasis groups in the genotype and allele distribution of -216G/T, R497K, and CA-SSR1 polymorphisms of the EGFR gene. The -216T allele, Arg allele, and shorter CA-SSR1 (<17) had significantly increased risks of pleural metastasis compared with the -216G allele, Lys allele, and longer CA-SSR1 (≥17), respectively. The expression of EGFR was higher in patients with genotypes of -216T/T or -216G/T, Arg/Arg or Arg/Lys, and shorter CA-SSR1 (<17) than that in patients with genotypes of -216G/G, Lys/Lys, and longer CA-SSR1 (≥17), respectively. These results indicate that -216G/T, R497K, and CA-SSR1 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of pleural metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, which may be related to the overexpression of EGFR protein induced by -216G/T, R497K, and CA-SSR1 polymorphisms.

Overall specificity and sensitivity were 96% and 47%, respectively. The positive reaction showed heterogeneous distribution that agreed with the expression of the total EGFR molecule, part of which was associated with gene amplification. A clinical response to gefitinib treatment correlated with the reaction, although one of the two patients with a positive reaction responded well despite having the wild-type EGFR. Acquired T790M mutation did not change the reaction to the antibodies.;On some characteristics, the positive reaction to mutation-specific antibodies differs from the molecular EGFR mutation.

The molecular mechanism underlying the apparent link between EGFR mutations and ER beta expression in lung cancer cell lines was investigated.;Four different human lung cancer cell lines were used, including one with an exon19 delE746-A750, one with a substitution of Leu for Arg at codon 858 in exon 21 (L858R), one with a L858R+ threonine-to-methionine mutation at codon 790 of EGFR (T790M) and one with wild-type EGFR. The EGFR mutations were investigated by direct sequencing. The expression levels of ER beta in the cell lines, in tumors from SCID mice and in primary human tissue specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Cell growth was compared after treatment with 17-beta-estradiol. The proliferative activity following knockdown of ER beta by siRNA was also examined. Furthermore, the cell inhibition assay was performed for cells treated with gefitinib after knockdown of ER beta. To investigate the relevant pathways for ER beta, the expression of apoptosis-related molecules was evaluated by Western blotting analysis.;All the cell lines showed positive expression of ER beta, the cancer cells from SCID mice, and the original primary tumors showed positive expression of ER beta. All of the cell lines revealed a similar proliferative pattern, regardless of the presence of EGFR mutations. Although the suppression of ER beta slightly increased the proliferative activity, no statistically significant effect on proliferation was observed in any of the cell lines. Moreover, no significant changes in any cell signaling or apoptosis-related molecules were observed following ER beta knockdown.;A direct association between EGFR mutations and ER beta expression in lung cancer cell lines is lacking.

A 73-year-old woman was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion. She received gefitinib as second-line therapy. Tumors were reduced 1 month after gefitinib therapy. However, only a few months later, chest computed tomography results indicated cancer progression. Gefitinib therapy was stopped and docetaxel therapy started.

Microscopic examination of postmortem specimens revealed a diffuse proliferation of atypical giant cells in primary and metastatic lesions, but no adenocarcinomatous components as in the antemortem specimens. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that antemortem tumor specimens were positive for CDH1 but negative for VIM. In contrast, postmortem tumor specimens were positive for VIM but negative for CDH1. Genetic analyses revealed MET amplification. We concluded that resistance to EGFR-TKI might be caused by MET amplification and EMT.

Here, we report that treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines with erlotinib, while showing robust cell death, enriches the ALDH(+) stem-like cells through EGFR-dependent activation of Notch3. In addition, we demonstrate that erlotinib treatment increases the clonogenicity of lung cancer cells in a sphere-forming assay, suggesting increased stem-like cell potential. We demonstrate that inhibition of EGFR kinase activity leads to activation of Notch transcriptional targets in a γ secretase inhibitor-sensitive manner and causes Notch activation, leading to an increase in ALDH high(+) cells. We also find a kinase-dependent physical association between the Notch3 and EGFR receptors and tyrosine phosphorylation of Notch3. This could explain the worsened survival observed in some studies of erlotinib treatment at early-stage disease, and suggests that specific dual targeting might overcome this adverse effect.",

However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10% of all colon cancers), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.",

Although patients with EGFR-activating mutations respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), they eventually acquire resistance, which typically results from a secondary EGFR mutation or the activation of other signaling pathways. Novel approaches to overcome or prevent EGFR-TKI resistance are clinically important. In this study, we developed an EGFR-scFv-arginine nonamer peptide fusion protein, s-9R, as an siRNA carrier. Here, we show that s-9R effectively and specifically delivers EGFR-siRNAs, KRAS-siRNA and MET-siRNA into NSCLC cells and silences the expression of target genes. The sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib was restored after treatment with the s-9R/siRNA complex, and the apoptosis rates of the treated cells were significantly higher than those of the control groups. Furthermore, the co-administration of s-9R/siRNA and gefitinib successfully suppressed the progression of H1975 xenograft tumors and extended the life span of tumor-bearing nude mice. Collectively, the results of this study provide not only a new scFv derivative for delivering siRNA into EGFR-overexpressing, TKI-resistant NSCLC cells but also a novel method for overcoming TKI resistance.

Obtaining a response from lung tumors expressing wild-type EGFR is a major obstacle. The combination of gefitinib and cytotoxic drugs is one strategy against lung cancers expressing wild-type EGFR. The DNA topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan sulfate (CPT-11) is active against lung cancer. We examined the sensitivity of lung cancers expressing wild- or mutant-type EGFR to the combination of gefitinib and CPT-11. The in vitro effect of gefitinib and SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11) was examined in seven lung cancer cell lines using the dye formation assay with a combination index. When administered concurrently, gefitinib and SN-38 had a synergistic effect in five of the seven cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR, whereas the combination was antagonistic in PC-9 cells and a PC-9 subline resistant to gefitinib and expressing deletional mutant EGFR (PC-9/ZD). When administered sequentially, treatment with SN-38 followed by gefitinib had remarkable synergistic effects in the PC-9 and PC-9/ZD cells. In an in vivo tumor-bearing model, this combination had a schedule-dependent synergistic effect in the PC-9 and PC-9/ZD cells. An immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors in mice treated with CPT-11 and gefitinib demonstrated that the number of Ki-67 positive tumor cells induced by CPT-11 treatment was decreased when CPT-11 was administered in combination with gefitinib. In conclusion, the sequential combination of CPT-11 and gefitinib is considered to be active against lung cancer.",

Most importantly, the EGFR signalling cascade involving PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are particularly relevant, since they are commonly activated in several cancer entities, including colorectal cancer. In this study, we show that miRs-134 and -370 are both capable of regulating these pathways by targeting EGFR and PIK3CA. In three different colorectal cancer cell lines (DLD1, HCT-116 and RKO), suppression of EGFR and PIK3CA through the enhanced expression of miR-134 or -370 led to a suppression of the key molecules of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-134 or -370 resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and in-vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Concurrent experiments with small interfering RNAs targeting the prime targets show that our selected miRNAs exert a greater functional influence and affect more downstream molecules than is seen with silencing of the individual proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that miRs-134 and -370 are potential tumour suppressor miRNAs and could play a fundamental role in suppressing colorectal cancer tumorigenesis through their ability to co-ordinately regulate EGFR signalling cascade by independently targeting EGFR and PIK3CA.

In this study, we have characterized the effect of four E-cadherin germline missense mutations (T340A, A634V, P799R and V832M) in the interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We challenged the hypothesis that E-cadherin mutations perturb its ability to bind to EGFR, leading to constitutional activation of the EGFR, triggering activation of downstream effectors. We verified that missense mutations localized in the extracellular domain of the protein (T340A and A634V) exhibited reduced stability of the EGFR/E-cadherin heterodimers in contrast to germline mutations localized at the cytoplasmatic domain of the protein (P799R and V832M). We observed that cells expressing E-cadherin extracellular mutants displayed increased levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon ligand stimulation, when compared with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or intracellular mutants. We showed that upon treatment of E-cadherin extracellular mutant cells with the EGFR inhibitor, the increase of RhoA activation is abrogated and accompanied by decreased migratory behaviour, supporting the idea that Rho-like proteins are EGFR downstream effectors. Our results bring new insights into the understanding of the distinct in vitro behaviours observed for E-cadherin missense mutations localized in different domains of the protein.

However, rescue of Src activity is not sufficient to restore Erk1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation. Indeed, p140Cap also impairs Erk1/2 phosphorylation by affecting Ras activity, downstream to the EGFR. In conclusion, p140Cap stabilizes adherens junctions and inhibits EGFR and Ras signalling through the dual control of both Src and Ras activities, thus affecting crucial cancer properties such as invasion and growth. Interestingly, p140Cap expression is lost in more aggressive human breast cancers, showing an inverse correlation with EGFR expression.

These mutations lead to altered downstream signaling by the receptor and appear to define a subset of NSCLC characterized by \"oncogene addiction\" to the EGFR pathway, which displays dramatic responses to the reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. The rapid acquisition of drug resistance in most cases, either through mutation of the \"gateway\" residue in the EGFR kinase domain or by alternative mechanisms, appears to limit the impact on patient survival. Irreversible inhibitors of EGFR display continued effectiveness in vitro against cells with acquired resistance and are now undergoing genotype-directed clinical trials. The molecular and clinical insights derived from targeting EGFR in NSCLC offer important lessons for the broader application of targeted therapeutic agents in solid tumors.",

HPV-negative head and neck cancers abundantly express EGFR, and the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, directed against EGFR, is the only targeted therapy that has improved disease survival so far. However, response rates to single-agent cetuximab are lower than 15%, and cetuximab given with chemotherapy or radiation leads to only a modest effect on survival. Thus, investigating the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibition in HPV-negative head and neck cancer might help identify novel and active therapies. In this Review, we focus on therapies in development that target redundant receptor tyrosine kinases (eg, HER2 and MET), reduce or abrogate nuclear functions of EGFR, affect cellular trafficking by inhibition of histone deacetylase, or treatments that might address resistance that arises in the EGFR signalling stream (eg, aurora-kinase inhibitors and STAT decoys).

Although CNR2 is highly expressed in the breast cancer tissues as well as breast cancer cell lines, its functional role in breast tumorigenesis is not well understood. We observed that estrogen receptor-α negative (ERα-) breast cancer cells highly express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). We also observed IGF-IR upregulation in ERα+ breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that higher CNR2 expression correlates with better recurrence free survival in ERα- and ERα+ breast cancer patients. Therefore, we analyzed the role of CNR2 specific agonist (JWH-015) on EGF and/or IGF-I-induced tumorigenic events in ERα- and ERα+ breast cancers. Our studies showed that CNR2 activation inhibited EGF and IGF-I-induced migration and invasion of ERα+ and ERα- breast cancer cells. At the molecular level, JWH-015 inhibited EGFR and IGF-IR activation and their downstream targets STAT3, AKT, ERK, NF-kB and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In vivo studies showed that JWH-015 significantly reduced breast cancer growth in ERα+ and ERα- breast cancer mouse models. Furthermore, we found that the tumors derived from JWH-015-treated mice showed reduced activation of EGFR and IGF-IR and their downstream targets. In conclusion, we show that CNR2 activation suppresses breast cancer through novel mechanisms by inhibiting EGF/EGFR and IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling axes.",

Although unstable chromosome numbers and recurrent aneuploidies drive a large fraction of human cancers, targeted therapies selective to pre-neoplastic trisomic cells are non-existent. We have previously characterized a trisomy 7 cell line (1CT+7) spontaneously derived from normal diploid human colonic epithelial cells that aberrantly expresses the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, chromosome 7p11). Recent studies identified AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside) as a pharmacological inhibitor of aneuploid murine fibroblast proliferation. Here, we report that AICAR induces profound cytostatic and metabolic effects on 1CT+7 cells, but not on their isogenic diploid counterpart. Dose-response experiments indicate that 1CT+7 cells are fourfold preferentially sensitive to AICAR compared to diploid cells. Unexpectedly, treatment of 1CT+7 cells with AICAR led to a reversible 3.5-fold reduction (P=0.0025) in EGFR overexpression. AICAR-induced depletion of EGFR protein can be abrogated through inhibition of the proteasome with MG132. AICAR also heavily promoted EGFR ubiquitination in cell-based immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting enhanced degradation of EGFR protein mediated by the proteasome. Moreover, treatment with AICAR reduced EGFR protein levels in a panel of human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. Our data collectively support the pharmacological compound AICAR as a novel inhibitor of EGFR protein abundance and as a potential anticancer agent for aneuploidy-driven colorectal cancer. ",

Results of phase II clinical trials of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown that these compounds have little activity in breast cancer patients when used as single agents. The potential pitfalls of these clinical trials, and the molecular mechanisms that might be involved in regulating the sensitivity/resistance of breast cancer cells to EGFR TKIs are discussed in this brief article. In particular, preclinical findings clearly demonstrate that breast cancer cells are able to activate different mechanisms to escape the anti-tumor effects of drugs directed against growth factor-driven pathways. Therefore, it is conceivable that significant blockade of tumor growth might be obtained only through contemporary blockade of different growth promoting pathways, at least in advanced disease. In addition, preclinical and clinical findings support the use of EGFR TKIs in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, such as estrogen receptor positive (ER+), tamoxifen resistant patients. In this regard, we describe potential future applications of these compounds in combination with other agents in the treatment of breast carcinoma.",

We found that deoxycholyltaurine (DCT) markedly attenuated both unstimulated and TNF-alpha-stimulated programmed cell death in colon cancer cells by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. To examine the role of bile acids and PI3K signaling in maintaining colon cancer cell survival, we explored the role of signaling downstream of bile acid-induced activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in regulating both apoptosis and proliferation of HT-29 and H508 human colon cancer cells. DCT caused dose- and time-dependent Akt (Ser(473)) phosphorylation, a commonly used marker of activated PI3K/Akt signaling. Both EGFR kinase and PI3K inhibitors attenuated DCT-induced Akt phosphorylation and Akt activation, as demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of a GSK-3-paramyosin substrate. Transfection of HT-29 cells with kinase-dead EGFR (K721M) reduced DCT-induced Akt phosphorylation. In HT-29 cells, EGFR and PI3K inhibitors as well as transfection with dominant negative AKT attenuated DCT-induced cell proliferation. DCT-induced PI3K/Akt activation resulted in downstream phosphorylation of GSK-3 (Ser(21/9)) and BAD (Ser(136)), and nuclear translocation (activation) of NF-kappaB, thereby confirming that DCT-induced activation of PI3K/Akt signaling regulates both proproliferative and prosurvival signals. Collectively, these results indicate that DCT-induced activation of post-EGFR PI3K/Akt signaling stimulates both colon cancer cell survival and proliferation.",

However, identifying patients that are likely to respond to such treatments has been challenging. As a consequence, it still remains important to identify additional alterations of the tumor cell that contribute to the response to EGFR-targeted agents. While EGFR-mediated signalling pathways have been well established, there is still a rather limited understanding of how intracellular protein-protein interactions, ubiquitination, endocytosis and subsequent degradation of EGFR contribute to the determination of sensitivity to EGFR targeting agents and are emerging areas of investigation.

Additionally, a region in the promoter was sensitive to DNase I in all breast cancer cells expressing EGFR, but showed differences in both the level of nuclease sensitivity and the extent of the area that was susceptible. Fine mapping by native genomic blotting revealed the presence of multiple protein footprints in both the promoter and first intron of the EGFR gene in MDA-MB-468 cells, a breast cancer cell line that overexpresses the EGFR gene. The appearance of DH sites in intron 1 associated with high levels of EGFR expression suggests that these regions of the gene contain potential enhancer elements, while the absence of a DH site at the exon 1/intron 1 boundary when the gene is up-regulated suggests the action of a repressor that may block transcriptional elongation.",

Thus, it is important to control EGFR function in order to treat the cancer patients. It is well established that inhibiting ATP binding within the EGFR kinase domain regulates its function. The existing quinazoline derivative based drugs used for treating lung cancer that inhibits the wild type of EGFR. In this study, we have made a systematic attempt to develop QSAR models for designing quinazoline derivatives that could inhibit wild EGFR and imidazothiazoles/pyrazolopyrimidines derivatives against mutant EGFR. In this study, three types of prediction methods have been developed to design inhibitors against EGFR (wild, mutant and both). First, we developed models for predicting inhibitors against wild type EGFR by training and testing on dataset containing 128 quinazoline based inhibitors. This dataset was divided into two subsets called wild_train and wild_valid containing 103 and 25 inhibitors respectively. The models were trained and tested on wild_train dataset while performance was evaluated on the wild_valid called validation dataset. We achieved a maximum correlation between predicted and experimentally determined inhibition (IC50) of 0.90 on validation dataset. Secondly, we developed models for predicting inhibitors against mutant EGFR (L858R) on mutant_train, and mutant_valid dataset and achieved a maximum correlation between 0.834 to 0.850 on these datasets. Finally, an integrated hybrid model has been developed on a dataset containing wild and mutant inhibitors and got maximum correlation between 0.761 to 0.850 on different datasets. In order to promote open source drug discovery, we developed a webserver for designing inhibitors against wild and mutant EGFR along with providing standalone (http://osddlinux.osdd.net/) and Galaxy (http://osddlinux.osdd.net:8001) version of software. We hope our webserver (http://crdd.osdd.net/oscadd/ntegfr/) will play a vital role in designing new anticancer drugs. ",

This goal was achieved by employing structure-based drug design and traditional optimization strategies, based on WZ4002 and CO1686. These derivatives inhibited the enzymatic activity of EGFR(L858R/T790M) mutants with IC50 values in subnanomolar ranges, while exhibiting hundreds of fold less potency on EGFR(WT). These compounds also strongly inhibited the proliferation of H1975 non-small cell lung cancer cells bearing EGFR(L858R/T790M), while being significantly less toxic to A431 human epithelial carcinoma cells with overexpressed EGFR(WT). The EGFR kinase inhibitory and antiproliferative activities were further validated by Western blot analysis for activation of EGFR and the downstream signaling in cancer cells. ",

Therefore, EGFR as well as its downstream effectors have been identified as important therapeutic targets. The FDA-approved small-molecule inhibitors of EGFR, gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva), are clinically effective in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations within the kinase domain of EGFR. The current study examined effects of these drugs in 32D cells expressing native (WT) or oncogenic (L858R) EGFR as well as in cancer cell lines A431 and H3255. Distinct patterns for gefitinib and erlotinib inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation at individual tyrosines were revealed for wild-type (WT) and L858R EGFR. Phosphorylation of Y845 has been shown to be important in cancer cells and Y1045 phosphorylation is linked to Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Dramatic differences were observed by greater potency of these drugs for inhibiting downstream effectors for L858R EGFR including Cbl and STAT5. Selective targeting of Cbl may play a role in oncogene addiction and effects on STAT5 identify features of signaling circuitry for L858R EGFR that contribute to drug sensitivity and clinical efficacy. These data provide new understanding of the EGFR signaling environment and suggest useful paradigms for predicting patient response to EGFR-targeted therapy as well as combination treatments.;This study offers fundamental insights for understanding molecular mechanisms of drug sensitivity on oncogenic forms of EGFR and downstream signaling components as well as considerations for further drug optimization and design of combination therapy.",

Here, we show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 on EGFR is required for proliferation and transformation using several cell models of breast cancer. Overexpression of EGFR-Y845F or treating cells with the SFK inhibitor dasatinib abrogated tyrosine 845 phosphorylation, yet had little to no effect on other EGFR phosphorylation sites or EGFR kinase activity. Abrogation of Y845 phosphorylation inhibited cell proliferation and transformation, even though extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt remained active under these conditions. Importantly, cotransfection of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3 and p38 MAPK restored cell proliferation in the absence of EGFR tyrosine 845 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel role for p38 MAPK signaling downstream of EGFR tyrosine 845 phosphorylation in the regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and transformation and implicate SFK inhibitors as a potential therapeutic mechanism for overcoming EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer.",

Understanding EGFR regulatory mechanisms, and hence approaches for clinical intervention, has focused on ligand-receptor interactions and tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we show using the NCI-H460 lung and A431 epidermoid human cancer cell lines that EGFR binding to anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2) in the endoplasmic reticulum is required for receptor delivery to the plasma membrane and thus EGFR signaling. Reduced AGR2 protein levels or mutation of an essential cysteine in the active site result in decreased cell surface EGFR and a concomitant decrease in signaling as reflected by AREG, EGR1, and FOS expression. Similar to previously described EGFR nulls, an AGR2 null also resulted in embryonic lethality. Consistent with its role in regulating EGFR-mediated signaling, AGR2 expression is also enhanced in many human cancers and promotes the transformed phenotype. Furthermore, EGFR-mediated signaling in NCI-H460 cells, which are resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478, is also disrupted with reduced AGR2 expression. The results provide insights into why cancer prognosis or response to therapy often does not correlate with EGFR protein or RNA levels because they do not reflect delivery to the cell surface where signaling is initiated. AGR2, therefore, represents a novel post-translational regulator of EGFR-mediated signaling and a promising target for treating human cancers. ",

Expression of EREG affects sensitivity to cetuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway. The mechanism through which EREG is regulated is largely unknown, but a methyl-array study previously performed by our group revealed that EREG is methylated in gastric cancer cells. In this study, we found that EREG gene expression was low in 7 out of 11 gastric cancer cells and this downregulation was mediated by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG promoter. Treatment with 5-aza-CdR restored EREG expression and demethylated CpG sites in the EREG promoter. Compared with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), knock-down of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) significantly increased the expression of EREG and led to the demethylation of specific CpG sites in the EREG promoter, suggesting that DNMT3b primarily regulates CpG methylation and silencing of the EREG gene. EREG methylation was observed in 30% (4/13) of human primary gastric tumor tissues we evaluated. In addition to DNA methylation, results from a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that transcriptional levels of EREG were associated with the enrichment of active histone marks (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and of a repressive mark (H3K27me2). Treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased the low occupancy of H3K4me3 and AcH3, while decreasing the high enrichment of H3K27me2, indicating that dynamic histone modifications contribute to EREG regulation in addition to DNA methylation. Finally, the combination of 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results of our study showed for the first time that EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells by aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification.",

Although many CNAs have been reported in gastric cancer, their genome-wide transcriptional consequences are poorly understood. In this study, to reveal the impact of CNAs on genome-wide expression in gastric cancer, we analysed 30 cases of gastric cancers for their CNAs by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and 24 of these 30 cases for their expression profiles by oligonucleotide-expression microarray. We found that with the application of laser microdissection, most CNAs were detected at higher frequency than in previous studies. Notably, gain at 20q13 was detected in almost all cases (97%), suggesting that this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. By comparing the array CGH data with expression profiles of the same samples, we showed that both genomic amplification and deletion strongly influence the expression of genes in altered genomic regions. Furthermore, we identified 125 candidate genes, consisting of 114 up-regulated genes located in recurrent regions (>10%) of amplification and 11 down-regulated genes located in recurrent regions of deletion. Up-regulation of several candidate genes, such as CDC6, SEC61G, ANP32E, BYSL and FDFT1, was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, some candidate genes were localized at genomic loci adjacent to well-known genes such as EGFR, ERBB2 and SMAD4, and concordantly deregulated by genomic alterations. Based on these results, we propose that our list of candidate genes may contain novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of advanced gastric cancer.",

Significant growth inhibition was noted in MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells by 8 days of treatment, while BT549 cells showed none. MCF7, T47D, and BT549 cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) demonstrated a 50% decrease in EGFR mRNA within 2 h which was sustained to 72 h, while BT474 cells demonstrated a 200-500% increase.

One important target of TNF-α may be the signaling pathway downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which has been associated with many human cancers. Here, we show that long-term exposure of 18Co cells, a model of human colonic myofibroblasts, with TNF-α led to a striking increase in cell surface EGFR expression, an effect that was completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Subsequent EGFR binding by EGF and heparin binding (HB)-EGF was associated with enhanced EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, prolonged ERK activation, and a significant increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression compared with 18Co cells treated with EGF and HB-EGF alone. TNF-α also increased EGFR expression and signaling in primary myofibroblasts isolated from human colon tissue. TNF-α-induced upregulation of EGFR may be a plausible mechanism to explain the exaggerated cellular responsiveness that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease and that may contribute to a microenvironment that predisposes to colitis-associated cancer through enhanced COX-2 expression.",

Here, we report results that may explain this outcome, based on the finding that neutralizing antibodies to IL6 and STAT3 inhibition are sufficient to upregulate the EGFR pathway in high-grade serous and other ovarian cancer cells. Cell treatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib abolished upregulation of the EGFR pathway. Combining neutralizing IL6 antibodies and gefitinib inhibited malignant cell growth in 2D and 3D culture. We found that ErbB-1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells examined, contrasting with plasma membrane localization in lung cancer cells. Treatment with anti-IL6, gefitinib, or their combination all led to partial restoration of ErbB-1 on the plasma membrane. In vivo experiments confirmed the effects of IL6 inhibition on the EGFR pathway and the enhanced activity of a combination of anti-IL6 antibodies and gefitinib on malignant cell growth.

Early weaning (EW), which means the abrupt interruption of suckling, increases proliferation and differentiation in the rat gastric epithelium. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) is secreted in the stomach, binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and may control cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Here, we investigated the influence of suckling-weaning transition on the differentiation of mucous neck cells in the stomach and its association to the expression of TGFalpha and EGFR. Fifteen-day-old Wistar rats were divided into two groups: suckling (control), in which pups were kept with the dam, and early weaning (EW), in which rats were separated from their mother and fed with hydrated powdered chow. TGFalpha and EGFR levels were increased at 18 days in EW animals compared to control ones (p<0.05). Histochemical reactions with Periodic Acid-Schiff reagent+Alcian Blue or Bandeiraea simplicifolia II lectin were used to stain the mucous neck cells and showed an increase in this cell population throughout EW, which was more pronounced at 17 days when compared to suckling pups (p<0.05). These morphological results were confirmed by RT-PCR for mucin 6. The levels of mucin 6 mRNA were higher in EW animals from the 16th to the 18th day (1-3 days post-weaning) when compared to the respective control group. Inhibition of EGFR through AG1478 administration to EW animals prevented the expansion of mucous neck cell population induced by EW (p<0.05). Therefore, early weaning up regulated TGFalpha/EGFR expression and induced differentiation of mucous neck cells. Moreover, we showed that EGFR takes part in the maturation of this cell population. We conclude that regular suckling-weaning transition is crucial to guarantee the development of the gastric mucosa.",

Recently, AMPK activation was proposed to sensitize NSCLC cells against erlotinib treatment. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this work we aim to unravel the interplay between 20 proteins that were previously associated with EGFR signaling and erlotinib drug sensitivity. The inferred network shows a high level of agreement with protein-protein interactions reported in STRING and HIPPIE databases. It is further experimentally validated with protein measurements.

In this study, we demonstrate that E2-induced EGFR transactivation in human breast cancer cells is driven via a novel signaling system controlled by the lipid kinase sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1). We show that E2 stimulates SphK1 activation and the release of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), by which E2 is capable of activating the S1P receptor Edg-3, resulting in the EGFR transactivation in a matrix metalloprotease-dependent manner. Thus, these findings reveal a key role for SphK1 in the coupling of the signals between three membrane-spanning events induced by E2, S1P, and EGF.

In conclusion, CagA-positive H. pylori strains stimulate MMP10 expression. MMP-10 modulation occurs via EGFR activation in a process that involves Src, ERK, and JNK pathways. MMP-10 may be implicated in H. pylori-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling. ",

We explored whether all EGFR TKIs similarly select for the T790M mutation using data from early clinical trials and established in vitro models of acquired resistance.;We analyzed the clinical characteristics of eight patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma who were treated first-line with XL647 and then progressed. XL647 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, KDR, and EPHB4. Additional molecular preclinical studies were performed to characterize resistance.;Four patients displayed confirmed partial responses (PRs), three patients had unconfirmed PRs, and one patient displayed stable disease. Only one of five patients' tumor samples available for analysis after disease progression harbored the T790M mutation. Eight patients subsequently received erlotinib, with (n = 3) or without (n = 5) chemotherapy. Three of five patients treated with single-agent erlotinib derived additional benefit, staying on drug up to 9 months. EGFR-mutant PC-9 cells with acquired resistance to XL647 did not harbor the T790M mutation, displayed a distinct mRNA profile from PC-9 cells with T790M-mediated resistance, and were moderately sensitive to erlotinib in growth inhibition assays. Crystal structure analyses of XL647/EGFR T790M did not reveal a different binding mode from that of erlotinib.;The findings of this exploratory study suggest that different EGFR TKIs may select for distinct mechanisms of resistance. These results raise the possibility that different EGFR TKIs could be sequentially used to improve outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer.

Although the reasons for the age-related rise in colorectal cancer are not fully understood, we hypothesize that aging increases susceptibility of the colon to carcinogen(s)/toxicant(s), leading to an increase in cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) that express cancer stem cell markers, in the colonic mucosa. The current study demonstrates that aging is associated with increased expression of several colon CSLC markers [CD44, CD166, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH-1)] and a higher proportion of cells expressing these markers. Aging is also accompanied by increased expression of miR-21 in colon. These increases are further increased in response to the colonic carcinogen dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Aging is also associated with increased tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Inhibition of EGFR using the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab abrogated the age-related increase in CD166 and ALDH-1 as well as miRNA (miR)-21. Our results provide new evidence that aging and DMH are associated with increases in CSLC biomarkers and miR21, each of which have been linked to colorectal cancer.

Bronchial washings/brushings and fine-needle aspirations are often used as early screening and cytological diagnosis of lung cancer. In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate morphologically malignant from reactive cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor overexpressed in high percentage lung cancers, and contributes to tumor growth. Assessing EGFR expression levels by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) may provide critical information of tumor marker abnormalities, assist in the cytological diagnosis, and stratify patients for EGFR inhibitor therapy. Fifty patients with bronchial washings/brushings or fine-needle aspiration specimens, and corresponding histologically confirmed lung biopsies, were studied for EGFR expression with FISH and IHC. Copy numbers of the EGFR gene locus were analyzed with those of chromosome 7 by FISH. EGFR and FISH results were compared to our FISH data with combined EGFR, c-myc, 5p15.2, and chromosome 6 probes in selected cases. Cell blocks, if available, and tissue biopsy sections were used for EGFR IHC. The intensity of IHC was scored, and quantified. Only balanced aneuploidy of EGFR was identified by FISH. Gene amplification was not detected. The chromosomal abnormalities of EGFR were often accompanied by other chromosomal aneuploidies demonstrated in c-myc (8q24), 5p15.2 or 6p, indicating a general genomic instability. About half of the specimens with confirmed malignancy showed EGFR balanced aneuploidy by FISH, and gene copy number was not coupled with protein expression in many cases. The benign or reactive cytology specimens confirmed by biopsies had high specificity by FISH (96%) and IHC (88%).

Here we present a novel approach that combines EGFR-signaling inhibition with target cell-restricted apoptosis induction using a TRAIL fusion protein with engineered specificity for EGFR. This fusion protein, scFv425:sTRAIL, comprises the EGFR-blocking antibody fragment scFv425 genetically fused to soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL). Treatment with scFv425:sTRAIL resulted in the specific accretion to the cell surface of EGFR-positive cells only. EGFR-specific binding rapidly induced a dephosphorylation of EGFR and down-stream mitogenic signaling, which was accompanied by cFLIP(L) down-regulation and Bad dephosphorylation. EGFR-specific binding converted soluble scFv425:sTRAIL into a membrane-bound form of TRAIL that cross-linked agonistic TRAIL receptors in a paracrine manner, resulting in potent apoptosis induction in a series of EGFR-positive tumor cell lines. Co-treatment of EGFR-positive tumor cells with the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor Iressa resulted in a potent synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, caused by the specific down-regulation of c-FLIP. Furthermore, in mixed culture experiments binding (L)of scFv425:sTRAIL to EGFR-positive target cells conveyed a potent apoptotic effect toward EGFR-negative bystander tumor cells. The favorable characteristics of scFv425:sTRAIL, alone and in combination with Iressa, as well as its potent anti-tumor bystander activity indicate its potential value for treatment of EGFR-expressing cancers.",

Following treatment of CRC cells with anti-EGFR, anti-MEK or the combination of the two drugs, we find that EGFR blockade alone triggers acquired resistance in weeks, while combinatorial treatment does not induce resistance. In patient-derived xenografts, EGFR-MEK combination prevents the development of resistance. We employ mathematical modelling to provide a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of response and resistance to these single and combination therapies. Mechanistically, we find that the EGFR-MEK Combo blockade triggers Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 downregulation and initiates apoptosis.

TERT enables cells to avoid chromosome shortening during repeated replication by maintaining telomere length. However, several lines of evidence indicate that many cancer cells exhibit shorter telomere length than normal tissues, implying an additional function of TERT in tumor formation and progression. Here, we report a telomerase activity-independent function of TERT that induces cancer stemness in glioma cells. Overexpression of TERT712, a telomerase activity-deficient form of TERT, in U87MG cells promoted cell self-renewal in vitro, and induced EGFR expression and formation of gliomas exhibiting cellular heterogeneity in vivo. In patients with glioblastoma multiforme, TERT expression showed a high correlation with EGFR expression, which is closely linked to the stemness gene signature. Induction of differentiation and TERT-knockdown in glioma stem cells led to a marked reduction in EGFR expression, cancer stemness, and anticancer drug resistance. Together, our findings indicate that TERT plays a crucial role in tumor progression by promoting cancer stemness through expression of EGFR.",

Historically, the two molecular alterations have been viewed as mutually exclusive, but recent identified cases suggest otherwise. In this report, we describe cases of lung cancer with concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement and identify their clinical characteristics. Non-small cell lung cancer patients with multiple molecular alterations were retrospectively analyzed from an academic referral center from 2011-2013. An additional review was conducted of reported cases with dual alterations. Four cases of NSCLC with alterations in both EGFR and ALK were identified and evaluated with 16 published cases for a total of 20 cases. The age of patients ranged from 37 to 77 years. Nine patients were never smokers. The disease control rates in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors and ALK inhibitors were 46% (6/13) and 71% (5/7), respectively. This series highlights the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling of newly diagnosed lung cancer, as NSCLC may be driven by concurrent molecular alterations. EGFR- and ALK-targeted therapies appear to have modest activity in patients with tumors possessing both alterations. Dual-altered NSCLC patients may have distinct clinical characteristics warranting further study. Combination targeted therapy or novel multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove important in these patients, though necessary studies remain ongoing. ",

Stratified therapy assignment for cervical cancer patients based on the EGFR promoter methylation status requires a simple detection method in the daily practice of diagnosis. A novel assay detecting the EGFR promoter methylation status in cervical cancer tissue samples using a hybridization-fluorescence polarization (FP) technique was developed. A pair of primers was used to amplify a 156 bp fragment in the promoter region of EGFR. Two probes specific for either methylated or unmethylated EGFR promoter DNA labeled with different fluorophores hybridized, respectively, with their target amplicons. The EGFR promoter methylation status was determined by the FP values. A total of 273 cervical cancer tissue samples were simultaneously analyzed using the new assay technique and combined bisulfite restriction analysis. The new assay was more sensitive compared with the combined bisulfite restriction analysis, and it allowed the discrimination of the EGFR promoter methylation status directly in solution without the restriction enzyme digestion. Sensitivity, specificity, and stability of the hybridization-FP assay had been recorded. The minimum detection level established with the new assay was 50 copies/μL, and it was able to detect the minor population of the EGFR promoter methylation status even when its contents were as low as 10%. No cross-reaction was observed in the assay when the amount of plasmids used accounted for no more than 10(9) copies/μL. The coefficient of variation of the reproducibility for the assay was <10%.",

Resistance of cancer to radiotherapy is frequently correlated with elevated EGFR expression, activity, and nuclear translocation. However, the role of nuclear EGFR (nEGFR) in radioresistance of cancers remains elusive. In the current study, we identified a novel nEGFR-associated protein, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which possesses 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity toward c-MYC mRNA. Knockdown of PNPase increased radioresistance. Inactivation or knock-down of EGFR enhanced PNPase-mediated c-MYC mRNA degradation in breast cancer cells, and also increased its radiosensitivity. Interestingly, the association of nEGFR with PNPase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK) increased significantly in breast cancer cells after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). We also demonstrated that DNAPK phosphorylates PNPase at Ser-776, which is critical for its ribonuclease activity. The phospho-mimetic S776D mutant of PNPase impaired its ribonuclease activity whereas the nonphosphorylatable S776A mutant effectively degraded c-MYC mRNA. Here, we uncovered a novel role of nEGFR in radioresistance, and that is, upon ionizing radiation, nEGFR inactivates the ribonuclease activity of PNPase toward c-MYC mRNA through DNAPK-mediated Ser-776 phosphorylation, leading to increase of c-MYC mRNA, which contributes to radioresistance of cancer cells.",

Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has been approved for head and neck and colorectal cancer treatment, but many patients treated with cetuximab don't respond or eventually acquire resistance. To determine how tumor cells acquire resistance to cetuximab, we previously developed a model of acquired resistance using the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. These cetuximab-resistant (Ctx(R)) cells exhibit increased steady-state EGFR expression secondary to alterations in EGFR trafficking and degradation and, further, retained dependence on EGFR signaling for enhanced growth potential. Here, we examined Sym004, a novel mixture of antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR, as an alternative therapy for Ctx(R) tumor cells. Sym004 treatment of Ctx(R) clones resulted in rapid EGFR degradation, followed by robust inhibition of cell proliferation and down-regulation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. To determine whether Sym004 could have therapeutic benefit in vivo, we established de novo Ctx(R) NCI-H226 mouse xenografts and subsequently treated Ctx(R) tumors with Sym004. Sym004 treatment of mice harboring Ctx(R) tumors resulted in growth delay compared to mice continued on cetuximab. Levels of total and phospho-EGFR were robustly decreased in Ctx(R) tumors treated with Sym004. Immunohistochemical analysis of these Sym004-treated xenograft tumors further demonstrated decreased expression of Ki67, and phospho-rpS6, as well as a modest increase in cleaved caspase-3.

Predictive biomarkers of response to therapeutics targeting this pathway are necessary to select patients more likely to respond, and importantly, to avoid treating patients likely to suffer a worse outcome with therapy compared to standard of care. Determination of EGFR by immunohistochemistry(IHC) is not strongly predictive of response to EGFR-targeted therapy in CRC and NSCLC. EGFR gene mutations in the tyrosine kinase(TK) binding domain are predictive of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs) in NSCLC, and the acquisition of a point mutation in a gene encoding an amino acid in an adjacent area, T790M, is predictive of resistance. However, novel irreversible EGFR inhibitors such as BIBW-2992 and HKI-272 may retain activity in tumours with T790M mutations. It is well established in CRC that mutations in KRAS are predictive of resistance to EGFR pathway inhibition, and may predict for a poorer outcome with therapy. Other potentially useful biomarkers of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy in the process of clinical validation include mutations in BRAF, PTEN loss and PI3KCA mutations, nuclear factor-kappa beta(NF-Κβ) pathway activity, and expression of alternative EGFR ligands.

Our in vitro studies demonstrated that PEITC suppress the growth of SKOV-3, OVCAR-3 and TOV-21G human ovarian cancer cells by inducing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Growth inhibitory effects of PEITC were mediated by inhibition of EGFR and AKT, which are known to be overexpressed in ovarian tumors. PEITC treatment caused significant down regulation of constitutive protein levels as well as phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr1068 in various ovarian cancer cells. In addition, PEITC treatment drastically reduced the phosphorylation of AKT which is downstream to EGFR and disrupted mTOR signaling. PEITC treatment also inhibited the kinase activity of AKT as observed by the down regulation of p-GSK in OVCAR-3 and TOV-21G cells. AKT overexpression or TGF treatment blocked PEITC induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest that PEITC targets EGFR/AKT pathway in our model.

Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC. However, other EGFR/ErbB receptor family members than EGFR may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. ErbB2 and ErbB3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of HNSCC with gefitinib.",

In this article, we will discuss targeted therapies for colorectal cancers (CRC) based on EGFR signaling pathway and review published data about the potential usefulness of KRAS as a biological marker for response to these therapies. Results from relevant studies published since 2005 and unpublished results presented at national meetings were retrieved and summarized. These studies reflected response (or lack of response) to EGFR-targeted therapies in patients with metastatic CRC as a function of KRAS status. It has become clear that patients with colorectal cancer whose tumor has an activating mutation in KRAS do not respond to monoclonal antibody therapies targeting EGFR. It should now become a standard practice that any patients being considered for EGFR targeted therapies have their tumors tested for KRAS status and only those with wild-type KRAS being offered such therapies.",

Research has been mainly focused on driver mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PI3K. However, recent evidence suggests a crucial role for non-genetic mechanisms in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Specifically, the HER3 receptor is capable of heterodimerizing with multiple EGFR family members resulting in downstream activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Monoclonal antibodies targeted against the HER3 receptor are being investigated in clinical trials; however, preliminary data has shown limited clinical activity. Thus, given the relevance of the HER3 receptor in activating downstream effector pathways and in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, the therapeutic targeting of HER3 in combination with primary drivers of the tumor is also being investigated. Here, we review the role of HER3 as a promoter of clinical resistance to EGFR therapy and discuss therapeutic approaches that could potentially overcome this resistance. ",

Despite its well-established importance in tumor growth, progression and drug-resistant phenotype over the past several decades, targeted therapy designed to circumvent EGFR has yielded only modest clinical success in cancer patients, except those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying EGFR activation mutations. However, almost all of these NSCLC patients eventually developed resistance to small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors. These disappointing outcomes are, in part, due to the high complexity and the interactive nature of the EGFR signaling network. More recent compelling evidence further indicates that EGFR functionality can be dependent on its subcellular location. In this regard, EGFR undergoes translocation into different organelles where it elicits distinctly different functions than its best known activity as a plasma membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase. EGFR can be shuttled into the cell nucleus and mitochondrion upon ligand binding, radiation, EGFR-targeted therapy and other stimuli. Nuclear EGFR behaves as transcriptional regulator, tyrosine kinase, and mediator of other physiological processes. The role of mitochondrial EGFR remains poorly understood but it appears to regulate apoptosis and autophagy. While studies using patient tumors have shown nuclear EGFR to be an indicator for poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients, the impact of mitochondrial EGFR on tumor behavior and patient prognosis remains to be defined. Most recently, several lines of evidence suggest that mislocated EGFR may regulate tumor response to therapy and that plasma membrane-bound EGFR elicits survival signals independent of its kinase activity. In light of these recent progresses and discoveries, we will outline in this minireview an emerging line of research that uncovers and functionally characterizes several novel modes of EGFR signaling that take center stage in the cell nucleus, mitochondrion and other subcellular compartments. We will also discuss the clinical implications of these findings in the rationale design for therapeutic strategy that overcomes tumor drug resistance.",

Patients with tumors expressing wild-type EGFR lack reliable predictive markers of their clinical response to EGFR TKIs. Although epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been inversely correlated with the response of cancers to EGFR-targeted therapy, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this association have not been defined and no specific EMT-associated biomarker of clinical benefit has been identified. Here, we show that during transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-mediated EMT, inhibition of the microRNAs 200 (miR200) family results in upregulated expression of the mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), a negative regulator of EGFR. The MIG6-mediated reduction of EGFR occurs concomitantly with a TGFβ-induced EMT-associated kinase switch of tumor cells to an AKT-activated EGFR-independent state. In a panel of 25 cancer cell lines of different tissue origins, we find that the ratio of the expression levels of MIG6 and miR200c is highly correlated with EMT and resistance to erlotinib. Analyses of primary tumor xenografts of patient-derived lung and pancreatic cancers carrying wild-type EGFR showed that the tumor MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio was inversely correlated with response to erlotinib in vivo. Our data demonstrate that the TGFβ-miR200-MIG6 network orchestrates the EMT-associated kinase switch that induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and identify a low ratio of MIG6 to miR200 as a promising predictive biomarker of the response of tumors to EGFR TKIs.",

This process is frequently deregulated in cancer cells, leading to enhanced EGFR levels and signaling. Our previous study on CMTM7 is only limited to a brief description of the relationship of overexpressed CMTM7 with EGFR-AKT signaling. The biological functions of endogenous CMTM7 and its molecular mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we show that the stable knockdown of CMTM7 augments the malignant potential of NSCLC cells and enhances EGFR-AKT signaling by decreasing EGFR internalization and degradation. Mechanistically, CMTM7 knockdown reduces the activation of Rab5, a protein known to be required for early endosome fusion. In NSCLC, the loss of CMTM7 would therefore serve to sustain aberrant EGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling. Together, our findings highlight the role of CMTM7 in the regulation of EGFR signaling in tumor cells, revealing CMTM7 as a novel molecule related to Rab5 activation. ",

In this study, we tested the efficacy of a novel reversible dual inhibitor GW572016 compared with the selective EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) AG1478 and AG879 and their combination, using the human colon adenocarcinoma GEO mode. GEO cells depend on multiple ErbB receptors for aberrant growth. A synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation associated with induction of apoptosis was observed from the combination of AG1478 and AG879. Compared with AG1478 or AG879, the single TKI compound GW572016 was a more potent inhibitor of GEO cell proliferation and was able to induce apoptosis at lower concentrations. Western blot analysis revealed that AG1478 and AG879 were unable to suppress both EGFR and ErbB2 activation as well as the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways as single agents. In contrast, GW572016 suppressed the activation of EGFR, ErbB2, MAPK, and AKT in a concentration-dependent manner.

Early growth response 1, sphingosine kinase 2, dual specificity phosphatase 6, and glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding factor 1 are members of a cluster of genes downstream of EGFR that are differentially regulated by treatment with EGF compared to gefitinib in Ishikawa H cells, but not in Hec50co cells.;Type I Ishikawa H and type II Hec50co endometrial carcinoma cells both express EGFR and sEGFR, but differ markedly in their responsiveness to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib. This difference is paralleled by differences in the expression of sEGFR and EGFR, as well as in their transcriptional response following treatment with either EGF or gefitinib.

EGFR levels were examined by radioligand binding assays in 846 patients with invasive breast cancer. The median follow-up period was 50 months. There was a wide variability of EGFR levels among the studied tumors (0.01-403 fmol/mg protein). Statistical analysis showed that EGFR levels were significantly higher in younger patients (p=0.0001). EGFR were also notably higher in ER-negative or PgR-negative tumors than in ER-positive (p=0.0001) or PgR-positive tumors (p=0.001). In addition, the presence of high intratumoral EGFR levels (cut-off: 6 fmol/mg protein) was associated with both shorter relapse-free survival (p=0.04) and overall survival (p=0.01) in the group of patients as a whole, as well as with overall survival in the subgroup of patients without any type of systemic adjuvant treatment (p=0.02). However, EGFR levels did not achieve significance as independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis.

The ErbB family, including EGFR, has been demonstrated to play key roles in metastasis, tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and drug resistance. Recently, these characteristics have been linked to a small subpopulation of cells classified as cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are believed to be responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance. In this study, we investigated the possible role of EGFR as a regulator of \"stemness\" in HNSCC cells. Activation of EGFR by the addition of EGF ligand or ectopic expression of EGFR in two established HNSCC cell lines (UMSCC-22B and HN-1) resulted in the induction of CD44, BMI-1, Oct-4, NANOG, CXCR4, and SDF-1. Activation of EGFR also resulted in increased tumorsphere formation, a characteristic ability of cancer stem cells. Conversely, treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor, Gefinitib (Iressa), resulted in decreased expression of the aforementioned genes, and loss of tumorsphere-forming ability. Similar trends were observed in a 99.9% CD44 positive stem cell culture derived from a fresh HNSCC tumor, confirming our findings for the cell lines. Additionally, we found that these putative cancer stem cells, when treated with Gefitinib, possessed a lower capacity to invade and became more sensitive to cisplatin-induced death in vitro. These results suggest that EGFR plays critical roles in the survival, maintenance, and function of cancer stem cells. Drugs that target EGFR, perhaps administered in combination with conventional chemotherapy, might be an effective treatment for HNSCC.",

Other mutations have been associated with resistance to these drugs, but for rare mutations there is limited data concerning their role in predicting response to EGFR TKI. To date, four molecules have been approved for the treatment of EGFR mutated lung cancer. Gefitinib and/or erlotinib are available in almost all countries.

The identification of therapy-responsive and prognostic biomarkers is paramount important to stratify patients and guide therapies in clinical oncology and personalized medicine.;In this study, we analyzed matched pairs of tumor specimens collected from 182 patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapies (NST). Statistical analyses were conducted to determine whether EGFR/HER2/RAS pathway biomarkers and clinicopathological predictors, alone and in combination, are prognostic in breast cancer.;SIAH and EGFR outperform ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 as two logical, sensitive and prognostic biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer. We found that increased SIAH and EGFR expression correlated with advanced pathological stage and aggressive molecular subtypes. Both SIAH expression post-NST and NST-induced changes in EGFR expression in invasive mammary tumors are associated with tumor regression and increased survival, whereas ER, PR, and HER2 were not. These results suggest that SIAH and EGFR are two prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer with lymph node metastases.;The discovery of incorporating tumor heterogeneity-independent and growth-sensitive RAS pathway biomarkers, SIAH and EGFR, whose altered expression can be used to estimate therapeutic efficacy, detect emergence of resistant clones, forecast tumor regression, differentiate among partial responders, and predict patient survival in the neoadjuvant setting, has a clear clinical implication in personalizing breast cancer therapy.;This work was supported by the Dorothy G.

This synergistic outcome appears to be a combination effect in promoting apoptosis, rather than co-suppression of either EGFR or PDK signaling pathways. Moreover, we have shown that the combination treatment did not exhibit synergistic effect in other NSCLC cell lines without EGFR mutations (A549 or NCI-H460).

Here, we report the finding that treatment with EGFR inhibitors of various tumor cells, when stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and EGF, results in transient upregulation of phosphorylated AKT. Furthermore, EGFR inhibition in this setting stimulates a pro-invasive phenotype as assessed in Matrigel-based assays. Simultaneous treatment with AKT and EGFR inhibitors abrogates this invasive growth, hence functionally linking signaling and phenotype. This observation implies that during treatment of tumors a balanced ratio of EGFR and Met inhibition is required. To address this, we designed a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and Met, which has the advantage of a fixed 2:1 stoichiometry. This bispecific antibody inhibits proliferation in tumor cell cultures and co-cultures with fibroblasts in an additive manner compared with treatment with both single agents. In addition, cell migration assays reveal a higher potency of the bispecific antibody in comparison with the antibodies' combination at low doses. We demonstrate that the bispecific antibody inhibits invasive growth, which is specifically observed with cetuximab. Finally, the bispecific antibody potently inhibits tumor growth in a non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model bearing a strong autocrine HGF-loop.

Recently, the presence of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was identified as a molecular target in a proportion of patients who benefited from the addition of appropriate anti-HER2 treatments. Our study explored the clinical and prognostic role of known HER family members, human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR or HER1), HER2, HER3 and HER4.;Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples from 249 gastric cancer patients were studied by immunohistochemistry for protein expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4.;Of the 249 evaluable patients, 32 did not have complete data of treatment details and/or follow-up and were excluded from the survival analyses. Of the 217 patients with complete treatment and follow-up data, 178 were operated and treated for early disease (group 1), while 39 for advanced disease (group 2). The frequency of positive EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 protein expression in all patients was 17.5%, 11.8%, 14.8% and 32.9%, respectively. There were no differences in protein expression of any of the markers between the two groups. There were, however, statistically significant associations between HER4 and all other HER family members, as well as between HER2 and HER3 expression. Of note, EGFR-positive membranous protein expression was significantly associated with the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.027) and HER3 and HER4 negative cytoplasmic protein expression with well/moderately-differentiated tumors (p=0.030 and p=0.014, respectively). None of the HER family members were of prognostic value for OS in univariate analysis.;The present study confirmed the known protein expression frequencies of HER family members in gastric cancer in a Greek population. Several associations were observed among the HER family members and between clinicopathological characteristics and HER family members.

It seems clear that in order to kill aggressive glioma cells more efficiently and with fewer side effects on normal tissue, there must be a shift from classical cytotoxic chemotherapy to more targeted therapies. Since the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is altered in almost 50% of glioblastomas, it currently represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets. In fact, it has been associated with several distinct steps in tumorigenesis, from tumor initiation to tumor growth and survival, and also with the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. However, inhibitors of the EGFR kinase have produced poor results with this type of cancer in clinical trials, with no clear explanation for the tumor resistance observed. Here we will review what we know about the expression and function of EGFR in cancer and in particular in gliomas. We will also evaluate which are the possible molecular and cellular escape mechanisms. As a result, we hope that this review will help improve the design of future EGFR-targeted therapies for glioblastomas.",

The effects of NK-1 activation and inhibition on EGFR and its downstreaming pathway were analyzed using western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. We found that the proportion of EGFR positive cases was increased with the increasement of NK-1 levels. SMSP could promote the proliferation of TNBC cells, while L-733060 and siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Moreover, SMSP could enhance expressions of phosphorylation (p)-EGFR and EGFR, and activate p-Akt and p-Erk. NK1-siRNA could decrease p-EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk. In the presence of cetuximab (0.2mg/mL), SMSP still could stimulate cell proliferation, and activate p-EGFR. However, in the presence of erlotinib (10μM), SMSP could not stimulate cell proliferation and could not activate p-EGFR. Our study showed the interaction between NK-1 and EGFR in TNBCs.

Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly regulated in normal cells, whereas some cancer cells have high constitutive levels. Understanding naturally-occurring ways of downregulating EGFR in cancer cells was investigated. Phosphatidic acid (PA) or Nuclear Receptors (NR) PPARα/RXRα/LXRα, enhance EGFR expression, mediated by the promoter region -856(A) to -226(T). Unexpectedly, the combination of NRs and PA caused repression. PA induces a conformational change in the nuclear receptor PPARα (increase of alpha-helices at the expense of decreasing beta-sheets), as evidenced by circular dichroism. This represses the naturally-enhancing capability of PPARα on EGFR transcription. PPARα-overexpressing cells in the presence of PA > 300 nM or the enzyme that produces it, phospholipase D (PLD), downregulate EGFR expression. The reasons are two-fold. First, PA displaces PPARα binding to the EGFR promoter at those concentrations. Second, NR heterodimer-dependent promoter activity is weakened in the presence of PA in vivo. Since other genes considered (β-catenin, cyclin D3, PLD2 and ACOX-1) are also downregulated with a PA + PPARα combination, the transrepression appears to be a global phenomenon. Lastly, the reported effect is greater in MCF-7 than in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which could provide a novel basis for regulating excessive expression of EGFR in luminal cancer cells.",

They are also implicated in the growth of colonic polyps and cancers. However, the precise mechanisms of these trophic actions of PGs remain unclear. As activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) triggers mitogenic signaling in gastrointestinal mucosa, and its expression is also upregulated in colonic cancers and most neoplasms, we investigated whether PGs transactivate EGFR. Here we provide evidence that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) rapidly phosphorylates EGFR and triggers the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)--mitogenic signaling pathway in normal gastric epithelial (RGM1) and colon cancer (Caco-2, LoVo and HT-29) cell lines. Inactivation of EGFR kinase with selective inhibitors significantly reduces PGE2-induced ERK2 activation, c-fos mRNA expression and cell proliferation. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) or c-Src blocked PGE2-mediated EGFR transactivation and downstream signaling indicating that PGE2-induced EGFR transactivation involves signaling transduced via TGF-alpha, an EGFR ligand, likely released by c-Src-activated MMP(s). Our findings that PGE2 transactivates EGFR reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which PGE2 mediates trophic actions resulting in gastric and intestinal hypertrophy as well as growth of colonic polyps and cancers.",

However, there is no clear data demonstrating whether such molecular changes of EGFR per se can affect the clinical outcome of early stage cancer after surgical resection. DNA mutations of EGFR and KRAS were investigated in 71 adenocarcinoma patients who received surgical resection. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of EGFR gene amplification was performed in 48 samples. We detected EGFR mutations in 25 patients (35.2%). EGFR mutation was more frequently found in cases with BAC features (13/22 (59.1%):13/49 (26.5%); p=0.008) and in non-smokers (19/41 (46.3%):7/30 (23.3%); p=0.047). However, the EGFR mutation was not associated with age, gender, or clinical stage. The amplification of EGFR copy was frequently observed in the female gender (12/29 (41.4%):3/19 (15.8%); p=0.061) and in the advanced stage (> or =Stage IIIA, 9/19 (47.4%):6/29 (20.7%); p=0.051).

KRAS mutations (p=0.000), male gender (p=0.001), absence of BAC feature (p=0.003), advanced stage (p=0.039), and smoking history (p=0.030) were poor prognostic factors for overall survival, whereas EGFR mutation (p=0.184) and amplification (p=0.756) were not. The presence of EGFR mutation was not a prognostic factor of the clinical outcome of early lung cancer after surgical resection. This result provides an important message for the protocol design of future trials of EGFR inhibitors in early lung cancer. As the KRAS mutation was a poor prognostic factor and it presents reciprocally with EGFR mutation, KRAS mutation should be investigated in such trials. DNA mutations of EGFR and KRAS were investigated in 71 adenocarcinoma patients who received surgical resection.

In the present study, we explored the antitumor effect and associated molecular mechanisms of sorafenib against human lung cancer cell lines in vitro. We also investigated the efficacy of concurrent and sequential administration of sorafenib and gemcitabine in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive and EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines. The PC-9 (EGFR-TKI-sensitive, EGFR-mutated) and A549 (EGFR-TKI-resistant, K-Ras-mutated) NSCLC cell lines were treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine, alone, in combination or with different schedules. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay, cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry and alterations in signaling pathways were analyzed by western blotting. We found that sorafenib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in the EGFR-TKI-sensitive and EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines, and the sequence gemcitabine→sorafenib exhibited the strongest synergism. Sorafenib arrested the cell cycle at G1 phase, whereas gemcitabine caused arrest at S phase. The molecular mechanism of this synergism is that the downstream signaling pathways that were initially activated by gemcitabine exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to sorafenib. By contrast, the reverse of this sequential administration resulted in antagonism, which may be due to differential effects on cell cycle arrest. The results suggest that sorafenib as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR and K-Ras mutations and that the sequential administration of gemcitabine followed by sorafenib is superior to sorafenib followed by gemcitabine and concurrent administration.",

Here, we demonstrate that signal amplification driven by high-affinity EGFR ligands limits the capacity of monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies to block pathway signaling and cell proliferation and that these ligands are commonly coexpressed with low-affinity EGFR ligands in epithelial tumors. To develop an improved antibody therapeutic capable of overcoming high-affinity ligand-mediated signal amplification, we used a network biology approach comprised of signaling studies and computational modeling of receptor-antagonist interactions. Model simulations suggested that an oligoclonal antibody combination may overcome signal amplification within the EGFR:ERK pathway driven by all EGFR ligands. Based on this, we designed MM-151, a combination of three fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that can simultaneously engage distinct, nonoverlapping epitopes on EGFR with subnanomolar affinities. In signaling studies, MM-151 antagonized high-affinity EGFR ligands more effectively than cetuximab, leading to an approximately 65-fold greater decrease in signal amplification to ERK. In cell viability studies, MM-151 demonstrated antiproliferative activity against high-affinity EGFR ligands, either singly or in combination, while cetuximab activity was largely abrogated under these conditions. We confirmed this finding both in vitro and in vivo in a cell line model of autocrine high-affinity ligand expression. Together, these preclinical studies provide rationale for the clinical study of MM-151 and suggest that high-affinity EGFR ligand expression may be a predictive response marker that distinguishes MM-151 from other anti-EGFR therapeutics.",

In contrast, the TAE684-resistant (TR3) H3122 cell line did not contain an ALK secondary mutation but instead harbored coactivation of EGFR signaling. Dual inhibition of both ALK and EGFR was the most effective therapeutic strategy for the DFCI076 and H3122 TR3 cell lines. We further identified a subset (3/50; 6%) of treatment naive NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements that also had concurrent EGFR activating mutations. Our studies identify resistance mechanisms to ALK TKIs mediated by both ALK and by a bypass signaling pathway mediated by EGFR. These mechanisms can occur independently, or in the same cancer, suggesting that the combination of both ALK and EGFR inhibitors may represent an effective therapy for these subsets of NSCLC patients.",

Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, physical and functional interactions between β4 integrin and FAK that influence breast cancer malignancy. An amino-terminal linker within FAK is essential for its binding with the cytodomain of β4 integrin. Moreover, EGFR/Src-signaling triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 integrin, which, in turn, recruits FAK to β4 integrin and leads to FAK activation and signaling. Upon disruption of the β4 integrin/FAK complex, tumorigenesis and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer were markedly reduced. Importantly, the concomitant overexpression of β4 integrin and FAK significantly correlates with malignant potential in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. This study describes a pro-metastatic EGFR/Src-dependent β4 integrin/FAK complex that is involved in breast cancer malignancy and is a novel therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a crucial role in growth, differentiation and motility of normal as well as tumor cells. The transduction of extracellular signals to the cytoplasm via the receptor not only depends on ligand binding, but is also determined by the receptor density on the cell surface. Therefore, with regard to cancer diagnosis and therapeutic approaches targeting EGFR it is important to know how the expression level of EGFR is controlled. We found that transcription activity declines with increasing numbers of CA dinucleotides of a highly polymorphic CA repeat in the first intron of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. In vivo data from cultured cell lines support these findings, although other regulation mechanisms can compensate this effect. In addition, we showed that RNA elongation terminates at a site closely downstream of the simple sequence repeat (SSR) and that there are two separate major transcription start sites. Model calculations for the helical DNA conformation revealed a high bendability in the EGFR polymorphic region, especially if the CA stretch is extended. These data suggest that the CA-SSR can act like a joint, bringing the promoter in proximity to a putative repressor protein bound downstream of the CA-SSR. The data indicate that this polymorphism may be a marker for cancer, linking genetic and epigenetic risk factors. Furthermore, in breast cancer, heterozygous tumors with short CA-SSR showed an elevated EGFR-expression in contrast to tumours with longer CA-SSR. Tumours with loss of heterozygosity in intron 1 of egfr revealed an increased EGFR expression if the longer allele was lost. Moreover, decreased EGFR gene levels were significantly correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.",

We proposed that the combination of paclitaxel and membrane permeable ceramide would enhance the fatality of cancer cells, and reported that the combination increased cell death of both head and neck and leukemic cancer cells. In this study, we treated pancreatic cancer cells (L3.6 cells) with paclitaxel and ceramide at the concentrations of clinical relevance, and treatment was then followed up with an investigation of the molecular mechanism of the synergism of paclitaxel and ceramide. The results of Western blot analysis indicated that the combo synergistically induced ERK and JNK phosphorylation, but not p38 and Akt phosphorylation. We also found that the combination (combo) induced EGFR phosphorylation in a synergistic manner. Furthermore, we observed that paclitaxel, ceramide, or combo-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by EGFR inhibitor, PD153035, while paclitaxel, ceramide, or combo-induced JNK and ERK phosphorylation was blocked by EGFR inhibitor, PD153035 and ERK inhibitor, U126.

The patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy.

In the present study, we report that EGCG had a profound antiproliferative effect on human lung cancer cells. EGCG inhibited anchorage-independent growth and induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest. The mechanism underlying EGCG antitumor potency was mainly dependent on suppression of the EGFR signaling pathway. Short-term EGCG exposure substantially decreased EGF-induced EGFR, AKT and ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, long-term EGCG treatment not only inhibited total and membranous EGFR expression, but also markedly attenuated EGFR nuclear localization and expression of the downstream target gene cyclin D1, indicating that EGCG treatment suppressed EGFR transactivation. Additionally, knockdown of EGFR in lung cancer cells decreased their sensitivity to EGCG. Thus, inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway may partly contribute to the anticancer activity of EGCG. ",

Surprisingly, however, no reports have examined either the basis for primary trastuzumab resistance in ovarian cancer or potential ways of salvaging trastuzumab as a potential ovarian cancer therapeutic.;An in vitro model of primary trastuzumab-resistant ovarian cancer was created by long-term culture of HER2-positive ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines with trastuzumab.

Specifically, we show that responsiveness to alternative HER-targeted inhibitors, such as gefitinib and cetuximab, is dramatically potentiated by long-term trastuzumab treatment of ovarian cancer cells. HER2-positive ovarian carcinoma-derived cells are, therefore, not \"unresponsive\" to trastuzumab as previously assumed, even when they not growth inhibited by this drug.;Given the recent success of EGFR-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of other solid tumors, and the well-established safety profile of trastuzumab, results presented here provide a rationale for re-evaluation of trastuzumab as an experimental ovarian cancer therapeutic, either in concert with, or perhaps as a \"primer\" for EGFR-targeted therapeutics.",

In 4 (8%) of the 52 tumors analyzed EGFR was overexpressed, 6 (12%) of the tumors showed moderate expression while 19 (32%) were weakly stained. EGFR overexpression (3+ score) was frequently found in endocrine tumors (29%) followed of ampullary tumors (13%; p < 0.01). No significant correlation was observed between the presence of a somatic EGFR mutation and clinicopathological variables. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis did not demonstrate amplification in any tumors. Only three somatic mutations in the EGFR gene were detected in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and no association was observed with the clinical variables. Our results suggest that EGFR mutations are rare in pancreatic tumors and not associated with clinical prognosis, and treatment response.",

Although the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)) has become a valuable therapeutic option for patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer, many patients do not benefit from this therapy. To evaluate the effect of receptor activation on tumor response, we have investigated the phosphorylation status of Her-2/neu and EGFR in 46 Her-2/neu-overexpressing tumor samples from trastuzumab-treated metastatic breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. Activated (p)tyr-1248 Her-2/neu was detected in 9 of 46 breast cancers (20%), and activated (p)tyr-845 and (p)tyr-1173 EGFR were both present in 6 tumors (13%) while EGFR was present in 16 cases (35%). ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu showed a trend to correlate with increased response to trastuzumab (p = 0.063), while ptyr-845, ptyr-1173 EGFR and EGFR did not. The presence of ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu and ptyr-845 or ptyr-1173 EGFR, however, was a strong predictor of both response to trastuzumab-based treatment (OR = 8.0, p = 0.021 and OR = 8.0, p = 0.021) and clinical benefit (OR = 5.47, p = 0.041 and OR = 6.22, p = 0.028 multivariate logistic regression analysis). Furthermore, ptyr-845 EGFR and ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu were both independent predictors of progression-free survival (RR = 0.21, p = 0.01 and RR = 0.45, p = 0.026, multivariate analysis). Patients with ptyr-845 EGFR positive tumors also tended toward increased overall survival (RR = 0.17, p = 0.082). Taken together, we have demonstrated that the determination of activated EGFR improves the utility of ptyr-1248 Her-2/neu staining in predicting the clinical outcome of patients undergoing trastuzumab treatment. We hypothesize that the activation state of both Her-2/neu and EGFR are key determinants for trastuzumab efficacy.",

Two investigators independently evaluated and extracted data from each identified studies based on selected criteria of inclusion and exclusion.;The introduction of agents targeting EGFR such as cetuximab and panitumumab increased overall survival of mCRCs. Nevertheless, it has firstly became evident that response rates to cetuximab regimens in unselected patient populations were typically lower than 30%. Clinical data confirmed the predictive value of RAS mutations for resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab leading to the license of these monoclonal antibodies exclusively for the management of patients with RAS-wild type colorectal cancers. So far the identification of predictive biomarkers have generated interesting, though preliminary and, at times, conflicting data on the importance of tumour mRNA levels of EGFR ligands, of activating mutations in other genes such as NRAS and PIK3CA. The prognostic value of selected microRNAs level and ADCC activity is under investigation, while the prognostic impact of BRAF status remains controversial.;This review focuses on the personalized treatment of mCRC and discusses the potential of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers in selecting patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy.",

To assess its potential as such a target, we constructed an oncolytic adenovirus with Retargeted Infectivity Via EGFR (Delta-24-RIVER) on the backbone of Delta-24. This new oncolytic adenovirus targets, as Delta-24 does, the disrupted Rb pathway in cancer cells; in addition, this adenovirus has also been retargeted through the abrogation of CAR binding (Y477A mutation in adenoviral fiber protein) and insertion of an EGFRvIII-specific binding peptide in the HI loop of the fiber protein. As compared with Delta-24, Delta-24-RIVER induced EGFRvIII-selective cytotoxicity in U-87 MG isogenic cell lines and in tetracycline-inducible EGFRVIII expressing U-251 MG cells. Accordingly, by tittering the viral progeny and examining fiber protein expression in the above cells, we showed that the replication of this new construct also correlated with EGFRvIII expression. Consistently, immunohistochemistry staining of the adenoviral capsid protein hexon in the virus-treated tumors revealed that the virus replicated more efficiently in EGFRvIII-expressing U-87 MG.DeltaEGFR xenografts than in the tumors grown from U-87 MG cells. Importantly, treatment with Delta-24-RIVER prolonged the survival of animals with intracranial xenografts derived from U-87 MG.DeltaEGFR cells. Therefore, our results constitute the first proof of the direct targeting of a cancer-specific receptor using an oncolytic adenovirus.",

Results were confirmed in vivo by a HCC827 or HCC827GR cell xenograft mouse model, each treated with vehicle, butein or gefitinib. Butein inhibited phosphorylation and kinase activity of EGFR and MET as well as soft agar colony formation and decreased viability of HCC827 and HCC827GR cells. Butein increased apoptosis-related protein expression in these cells. Results were confirmed by co-treatment with inhibitors of EGFR/MET or double knock-down. Finally, xenograft study results showed that butein strongly suppressed HCC827 and HCC827GR tumor growth. Immunohistochemical data suggest that butein inhibited Ki-67 expression.

Mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), both of which are receptor tyrosine kinases, have been identified in a considerable percentage of NSCLC patients. EGFR and c-Met share the same downstream pathways and cooperate not only in promoting metastasis but also in conferring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies in NSCLC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs, usually 21-25 nucleotides long, and are critical in regulating gene expression. Abnormal miRNA expression has been implicated in the initiation and progression in many forms of cancers, including lung cancer. In this study, we found that miR-200a is downregulated in NSCLC cells, where it directly targets the 3'-UTR of both EGFR and c-Met mRNA. Overexpression of miR-200a in NSCLC cells significantly downregulates both EGFR and c-Met levels and severely inhibits cell migration and invasion. Moreover, in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to gefitinib, a drug often used in TKI therapies to treat NSCLC, miR-200a expression is able to render the cells much more sensitive to the drug treatment.

Twelve mammary tissue samples from five month-old female TA2 mice (Group A), as well as 28 samples from mammary (Group B) and cancer tissues (Group C) of spontaneous breast cancer-bearing TA2 mice, were subsequently used to detect the expression of decorin, EGFR and cyclin D1 by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical methods.;Several imprinted genes, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were differentially expressed between normal mammary gland tissues and breast cancer tissues of TA2 mice.

Expression of EGFR, HER2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were measured by immunoblotting in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Several lines expressed high levels of pERK1/2, with no obvious correlation with the level of EGFR/HER2. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKI166 inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in some cells with high levels of growth factor receptors (MDA-MB-468, SUM149, SKBR3), but was less effective in cells that also had high basal ERK1/2 activity (MDA-MB-231). The combination of an inhibitor of MAPK signalling (U0126) and PKI166 produced significantly more inhibition and apoptosis than either agent alone. This suggests that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway may bypass inhibition of EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinases, and lead to insensitivity to agents targeting the receptors.

How Notch3 and epidermal growth factor receptor-mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR-MAPK) pathways cooperate in modulating apoptosis is not yet known. In this study, we provide evidence that Notch3 regulates Bim, a BH-3-only protein, via MAPK signaling. Furthermore, loss of Bim expression prevents tumor apoptosis induced by Notch3 inhibition. Using gamma-secretase inhibitor and erlotinib in a xenograft model, Bim induction and tumor inhibition were observed to be enhanced compared with either agent alone, consistent with our previous observation of significant synergism between Notch and EGFR-ras-MAPK signaling. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that Notch3 not only has a crucial role in lung cancer through regulating apoptosis, but also cooperates with the EGFR-MAPK pathway in modulating Bim.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in cancer development. Recently, the EGFR pathway has been increasingly implicated in chronic cardiovascular diseases via regulating inflammation and oxidative stress. However, it is unclear if EGFR is involved in obesity-related kidney injury. Using ApoE-/- and C57BL/6 mice models and two specific EGFR inhibitors, we investigated the potential effects of EGFR inhibition in the treatment of obesity-related nephropathy and found that EGFR inhibition alleviates renal inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. In NRK-52E cells, we also elucidated the mechanism behind hyperlipidemia-induced EGFR activation. We observed that c-Src and EGFR forms a complex, and following PA stimulation, it is the successive phosphorylation, not formation, of the c-Src/EGFR complex that results in the subsequent cascade activation. Second, we found that TLR4 regulates the activation EGFR pathway mainly through the phosphorylation of the c-Src/EGFR complex. These results demonstrate the detrimental role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of obesity-related nephropathy, provide a new understanding of the mechanism behind hyperlipidemia/FFA-induced EGFR activation, and support the use of EGFR inhibitors in the treatment of obesity-induced kidney diseases.

In this study, we first observed that knockdown of the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) gene can regulate the sensitivity of TNBC cell lines to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRI) in a cell context-depended manner. Furthermore, in certain breast cancer cell lines the YES-associated protein, paralog of TAZ (YAP) expression can be upregulated by TAZ inhibition which leads to EGFRI resistance.

The identification of new potential targets will ensure that the arsenal of cancer therapies continues to expand. FAM83B was recently discovered in a forward genetic screen for novel oncogenes that drive human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) transformation. We report here that elevated FAM83B expression increases Phospholipase D (PLD) activity, and that suppression of PLD1 activity prevents FAM83B-mediated transformation. The increased PLD activity is engaged by hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is regulated by an interaction involving FAM83B and EGFR. Preventing the FAM83B/EGFR interaction by site-directed mutation of lysine 230 of FAM83B suppressed PLD activity and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, ablation of FAM83B expression from breast cancer cells inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and suppressed cell proliferation. We propose that understanding the mechanism of FAM83B-mediated transformation will provide a foundation for future therapies aimed at targeting its function as an intermediary in EGFR, MAPK and mTOR activation.

It is established that treatment with Herceptin leads to selective overexpression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src which further contributes to oncogenesis in Herceptin resistant and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Here, we show a co-regulated upregulation in the expression of Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a known substrate of Src and one of the regulators of EGFR receptor endocytosis, in Herceptin resistant and Her-2 negative breast cancer. Immunohistochemical expression analysis revealed a reciprocal regulation between Her-2 and AnxA2 in breast cancer clinical samples as well as in cell lines as confirmed by protein and RNA analysis. The siRNA and Herceptin mediated downregulation/inhibition of Her-2 in Her-2 amplified cells induced AnxA2 expression and membrane translocation. In this study we report a possible involvement of AnxA2 in maintaining constitutively activated EGFR downstream signaling intermediates and hence in cell proliferation, migration and viability. This effect was consistent in Herceptin resistant JIMT-1 cells as well as in Her-2 negative breast cancer. The siRNA mediated AnxA2 downregulation leads to increased apoptosis, decreased cell viability and migration.

In this study, the effect of EBP50 expression on CC cell proliferation and prognosis of CC patients by regulating EGFR signaling was investigated. We found that EBP50 expression level was significantly downregulated in CC tissues.

EGFR activation or ectopic expression of Ras as well as c-Myc stimulated miR-7 expression in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner, suggesting that EGFR induces miR-7 expression through a Ras/ERK/Myc pathway. In support of this likelihood, c-Myc bound to the miR-7 promoter and enhanced its activity. Ectopic miR-7 promoted cell growth and tumor formation in lung cancer cells, significantly increasing the mortality of nude mice hosts, which were orthotopically implanted with lung cancers. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that miR-7 decreased levels of the Ets2 transcriptional repression factor ERF, the coding sequence of which was found to contain a miR-7 complementary sequence. Indeed, ectopic miR-7 inhibited production of ERF messages with a wild-type but not a silently mutated coding sequence, and ectopic miR-7 rescued growth arrest produced by wild-type but not mutated ERF. Together, these results identified that ERF is a direct target of miR-7 in lung cancer.

Using machine learning analysis applied to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database, we identified expression of AXL, the gene that encodes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, as exceptionally predictive of lack of response to ErbB family receptor-targeted inhibitors. Activation of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) transactivated AXL, and this ligand-independent AXL activity diversified EGFR-induced signaling into additional downstream pathways beyond those triggered by EGFR alone. AXL-mediated signaling diversification was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)-elicited motility responses in AXL-positive TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Using cross-linking coimmunoprecipitation assays, we determined that AXL associated with EGFR, other ErbB receptor family members, MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) but not IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) or INSR (insulin receptor). From these AXL interaction data, we predicted AXL-mediated signaling synergy for additional RTKs and validated these predictions in cells. This alternative mechanism of receptor activation limits the use of ligand-blocking therapies and indicates against therapy withdrawal after acquired resistance. Further, subadditive interaction between EGFR- and AXL-targeted inhibitors across all AXL-positive TNBC cell lines may indicate that increased abundance of EGFR is principally a means to transactivation-mediated signaling.

The combination of EGFR-TKI afatinib and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab can overcome acquired resistance in mouse models and human patients. Because afatinib is also a potent HER2 inhibitor, we investigated the role of HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumor cells. We show in vitro and in vivo that afatinib plus cetuximab significantly inhibits HER2 phosphorylation. HER2 overexpression or knockdown confers resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line models. FISH analysis revealed that HER2 was amplified in 12% of tumors with acquired resistance versus only 1% of untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, HER2 amplification and EGFR(T790M) were mutually exclusive. Collectively, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs and provide a rationale to assess the status and possibly target HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",

Silencing of key glycolytic enzymes was then performed with targeted siRNAs. Furthermore, tumor-bearing nude mice treated with EGFR inhibitors were evaluated with (18)F-FDG PET/CT and tumors were analyzed for glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins.;Effective inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC cells induced a dramatic reduction of hexokinase II (HKII) and phospho-pyruvate kinase M2 (p-PKM2, Tyr105) levels as well as an upregulation of mitochondrial complexes subunits (OXPHOS). Accordingly, a decreased lactate secretion and increased intracellular ATP levels were also observed in response to EGFR inhibitors. Downregulation of HKII and PKM2 by targeted siRNA transfection did not cause upregulation of OXPHOS but enhanced the effects of EGFR TKIs. Conversely, selective inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 caused OXPHOS upregulation and glycolysis inhibition, respectively.

The objective of the current study was to characterize I3C-induced cell death in a panel of human breast tumorigenic cells (MCF7, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231 and HBL100) in comparison with normal fibroblasts. Since epithelial cells are protected from cell death by a three-dimensional environment, 3D cell culture (collagen I gel and spheroids) was employed to investigate susceptibility to I3C. Cell viability in the presence of 256 microM I3C, a concentration close to the physiologically achievable range, was in the order fibroblasts = HBL100>MDA-MB-231>MCF7>MDA-MB-468 in monolayer culture. However, 3D culture conditions increased the susceptibility of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cancer cells towards I3C. I3C induced cell death in breast cancer MCF7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. I3C significantly reduced levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in MDA-MB-468 after 6 h and in MDA-MB-231 and HBL100 cells after 30 h. Downregulation of EGFR in MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB-231 cells using an EGFR inhibitor resulted in apoptosis. EGFR modulation using EGF or an EGFR inhibitor markedly influenced viability and response to I3C in MDA-MB-468 cells in 3D conditions. EGFR expression was modulated by 3D conditions. Therefore, I3C-induced EGFR reduction in these cells is likely to be responsible for I3C-induced apoptosis.",

Dual targeting of EGFR using one monoclonal antibody (mAb; cetuximab or panitumumab) and one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib or erlotinib) is a potential therapeutic approach. We investigated the effect of these therapies in EGFR-expressing TNBC cell lines that do or do not harbor the main activating mutations of EGFR pathways. Cell lines were sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, whereas mAbs were active only in MDA-MB-468 (EGFR amplification) and SUM-1315 (KRAS and PTEN wild-type) cells. MDA-MB-231 (KRAS mutated) and HCC-1937 (PTEN deletion) cells were resistant to mAbs. The combined treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and superior inhibition of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in mAb-sensitive cells. The anti-proliferative effect was associated with G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Sensitivity to therapies was characterized by induction of positive regulators and inactivation of negative regulators of cell cycle. These results suggest that dual EGFR inhibition might result in an enhanced antitumor effect in a subgroup of TNBC.

Overall, our results show that the growth-inhibitory potency of all irreversible inhibitors against the EGFR(T790M) resistance mutation was limited by reduced target inhibition, linked to decreased binding velocity to the mutant kinase. Combined treatment of T790M-mutant tumor cells with BIBW-2992 and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor PI-103 led to synergistic induction of apoptosis.

In this study, we investigated the distribution of EGFR-lytic hybrid peptide in BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells by an immunocytochemical (ICC) method. Distribution of EGFR protein expression was unchanged after treatment with EGFR-lytic peptide compared with non-treated cells. In confocal laser scanning microscopy, immunostaining of EGFR-lytic peptide was observed in the cytoplasm, mostly in the form of granules. Some staining was also localized on the mitochondrial membrane. At the ultrastructure level, cells treated with EGFR-lytic peptide had a low electron density, disappearance of microvilli, and swollen mitochondria. Fragments of cell membrane were also observed in the proximity of the membrane. In immunoelectron microscopy, EGFR-lytic peptide was observed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. A number of granules were considered swollen mitochondria. Activation of the caspase pathway as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction was also examined to determine the cytotoxic activity of EGFR-lytic peptide; however, no effect on cell death after EGFR-lytic treatment was observed, and moreover, apoptosis was not found to play a critical role in the cell death mechanism. These results suggest that EGFR-lytic peptide is localized on cell and mitochondrial membranes, with disintegration of the cell membrane contributing mainly to cell death.",

However, the mechanisms by which constitutively activated KRAS (KRAS(G12V)) impairs effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs are incompletely understood. Here, we established isogenic cell line models to systematically investigate the impact of KRAS(G12V) on tumor growth in mouse A431 xenograft models as well as on various modes of action triggered by EGFR-Abs in vitro. KRAS(G12V) impaired EGFR-Ab-mediated growth inhibition by stimulating receptor-independent downstream signaling. KRAS(G12V) also rendered tumor cells less responsive to Fc-mediated effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs-such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Impaired CDC and ADCC activities could be linked to reduced EGFR expression in KRAS-mutated versus wild-type (wt) cells, which was restored by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of KRAS4b. Immunohistochemistry experiments also revealed lower EGFR expression in KRAS-mutated versus KRAS-wt harboring CRC samples. Analyses of potential mechanisms by which KRAS(G12V) downregulated EGFR expression demonstrated significantly decreased activity of six distinct transcription factors. Additional experiments suggested the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family to be implicated in the regulation of EGFR promoter activity in KRAS-mutated tumor cells by suppressing EGFR transcription through up-regulation of the inhibitory family member C/EBPβ-LIP. Thus, siRNA-mediated knockdown of C/EBPβ led to enhanced EGFR expression and Ab-mediated cytotoxicity against KRAS-mutated cells. Together, these results demonstrate that KRAS(G12V) signaling induced C/EBPβ-dependent suppression of EGFR expression, thereby impairing Fc-mediated effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs and rendering KRAS-mutated tumor cells less sensitive to these therapeutic agents.",

MiR-145 is downregulated in several human malignancies, including lung cancer, but the responsible molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that restoration of hsa-miR-145 inhibits cancer cell growth in lung adenocarcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. This study showed that hsa-miR-145 targets EGFR and nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type motif 1 (NUDT1 or MTH1) in lung adenocarinoma cells. The mRNA expressions of EGFR and NUDT1 were significantly downregulated after miR-145 transfection in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our results demonstrated miR-145 in the negative regulation of EGFR and NUDT1 expressions at both mRNA and protein levels. Further analysis showed that miR-145 has the ability to inhibit cell proliferation on transfected lung adenocarcinoma cells over three time points (24, 48 and 72 hours). Upregulation of miR-145 appeared to be an important gene regulation mechanism for the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells and it correlated strongly with the downregulation of EGFR and NUDT1. Interestingly, our study revealed that the altered proliferation in lung cancer cells is not accompanied by changes in apoptosis. Our findings provided new insight into the complex regulating pathway comprising of miR-145, EGFR, NUDT1 and other unknown factors which function in cell proliferation but not in apoptosis. Understanding miR-145's targets and its regulating pathways may lead to new therapeutic strategies for lung adenocarcinoma.",

Inappropriate activation of these receptors is a key feature of many human cancers, and its reversal is an important clinical goal. A natural secreted antagonist of EGFR signalling, called Argos, was identified in Drosophila. We showed previously that Argos functions by directly binding (and sequestering) growth factor ligands that activate EGFR. Here we describe the 1.6-A resolution crystal structure of Argos bound to an EGFR ligand. Contrary to expectations, Argos contains no EGF-like domain. Instead, a trio of closely related domains (resembling a three-finger toxin fold) form a clamp-like structure around the bound EGF ligand. Although structurally unrelated to the receptor, Argos mimics EGFR by using a bipartite binding surface to entrap EGF. The individual Argos domains share unexpected structural similarities with the extracellular ligand-binding regions of transforming growth factor-beta family receptors. The three-domain clamp of Argos also resembles the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor, which uses a similar mechanism to engulf the EGF-like module of uPA. Our results indicate that undiscovered mammalian counterparts of Argos may exist among other poorly characterized structural homologues. In addition, the structures presented here define requirements for the design of artificial EGF-sequestering proteins that would be valuable anti-cancer therapeutics.",

However, some mutations confer resistance to current available agents, especially the frequently occurring T790M mutation. In the current study, we have examined, in a NSCLC cell line H1975 containing both L858R and T790M mutations, the effect of T790M-specific-siRNAs versus other EGFR-specific-siRNAs. T790M-specific-siRNAs were able to inhibit T790M and EGFR mRNA, to reduce EGFR protein expression, as well as to reduce the cell growth and induce cell caspase activity in H1975 cells. However, this effect showed less potency compared to the other EGFR-specific-siRNAs. EGFR-specific-siRNAs strongly inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in H358, H1650, H292, HCC827 and also in H1975 cells, which showed weak response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or cetuximab. The addition of T790M-specific-siRNAs could rescue the sensitivity of T790M mutant H1975 cells to TKIs. The combination of T790M-specific-siRNAs and cetuximab also additively enhanced cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in H1975 cells. Among the anti-EGFR agents tested, the strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with T790M-specific-siRNAs. Afatinib also offered extra effect when combined with cetuximab in H1975 cells. In conclusion, knock-down of T790M transcript by siRNAs further decreases the cell growth of T790M mutant lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab. The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with T790M-specific-siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer containing the resistant T790M mutation.",

Well-conducted experimental studies open the way to new clinical applications with the most rewarding currently being the association between cetuximab and irinotecan. The two approaches of EGFR targeting have the same target and similar intracellular molecular impacts but they may differ under several aspects. For instance for the mechanism of action where, for monoclonal antibodies, there is a potential complement of cytotoxic activity brought by the ADCC phenomenon (antibody-directed cell cytotoxicity). One of the main current questions about the clinical use of anti-EGFR drugs is to dispose of faithful predictors for identifying tumors sensitive to this targeted treatment. The agents targeting VEGF are conceptually the same to those applied to EGFR. A major therapeutic advance brought by antiangiogenic drugs in colorectal cancer is attributable to bevacizumab.

In primary malignant gliomas, the amplification/alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play a significant role in enhancing glioma burden. In an effort to dissect the role of EGFR expression in glioma progression in vivo and evaluate targeted therapies for gliomas, we have genetically engineered glioma cells to visualize the dynamics of EGFR and targeted therapies in real time in vivo. Using engineered lentiviral vectors bearing fusions between EGFR and its exon 2 to 7 deleted variant (EGFRvIII) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc), we show that there is a direct correlation between EGFR expression and glioma cell proliferation in the initial stages of glioma progression.

Using EGFR-GFP-Rluc/firefly luciferase (Fluc)-DsRed2 glioma model, we show that both shRNAs and cetuximab result in a considerable reduction in glioma cell proliferation in culture and glioma burden in vivo that can be monitored in real time at a cellular resolution.

Signalling pathways, linking these events were investigated in detail. I3C modulated tyrosine phosphorylation from 30 min in four cell lines. In MDA-MB-468 and HBL100 cells, it induced Src activation after 5 h. In MDA-MB-468 cells, I3C induced signalling between 4.5 and 7 h, which involved sequential activation of Src, EGFR, STAT-1 and STAT-3, followed by EGFR degradation. It also induced physical association between activated Src and EGFR. In MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, I3C modulated expression of cell cycle-related proteins, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, cyclin E, cyclin D1 and CDK6, with upregulation of p21Cip1 and cyclin E being dependent on Src. Inhibition of EGFR by specific inhibitors PD153035 or ZD1839 increased susceptibility to I3C-induced apoptosis of MCF7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Inhibition of Src sensitized MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells to I3C, whereas overexpression of c-Src increased resistance to I3C in MDA-MB-468 and HBL100 cells. Modulation of Src in MDA-MB-468 cells influenced the basal level of EGFR expression and cell viability; the latter being positively correlated with EGFR activation levels. Therefore, EGFR and Src activities are essential for I3C-induced cell cycle arrest and death; however, I3C-induced pathways depend on specific features of breast cancer cells. The cancer types, which rely on 'EGFR addiction' or Src deregulation, are likely to be susceptible to I3C.",

Expression of these protooncogenes results in production of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-erbB-2. Both are transmembrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. Recent data have indicated that the external domain of c-erbB-2 is shed into the culture supernatant of certain breast cancer cell lines and sera of breast cancer patients. A body of literature has shown that the overexpression of these receptors in malignant tissue and c-erbB-2 when shed into serum is associated with bad prognosis. In the present work, tissue EGFR and c-erbB-2 were determined in the membrane fractions of histopathologically verified malignant and normal tissues from the same breast of 94 patients. These values were also determined in 48 tissue specimens of benign mastopathies. Serum c-erbB-2 was quantified in breast cancer patients (n = 105), patients with benign breast disease (n = 48) and 30 apparently healthy women as controls. Patients were followed up by determination of serum c-erbB-2 for one year and clinically for three years to detect any distant metastasis or recurrence. The levels of tissue and serum c-erbB-2 and Estrogen receptors were significantly higher in the carcinomas and sera of breast cancer patients than benign breast diseases or normal controls. Follow-up, although short, of pre-operative serum c-erbB-2 showed a prognostic value (P = 0.007) better than that of tumor size (P = 0.04), EGFR (P = 0.18), nodal involvement (P = 0.25) and tissue c-erbB-2 (P = 0.85). The shedding of soluble fragments of c-erbB-2 into the serum seems to be a characteristic of the potentially malignant cell. The EGFR mean level, however, was significantly lower in malignant tissues than benign and normal ones. A new definition of EGFR status was developed. Accordingly, the recurrence of the disease was more frequent among patients with negative EGFR. The present work did not reveal any correlation between tissue, serum c-erbB-2 or EGFR on one hand and age, menopausal status, stage, histological type and grade of carcinomas and nodal involvement on the other hand. The present work showed an inverse correlation between estrogen receptor level and level of EGFR in malignant tissues.",

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs resistance, EGFR-TKIs‑sensitive and ‑resistant human lung cancer cells were analyzed by lncRNA microarray. In the present study, we found a total of 22,587 lncRNAs expressed in lung cancer cells. Of these, the expression level of 1,731 lncRNAs was upregulated >2-fold compared with gefitinib-sensitive cells while that of 2,936 was downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis (GO and pathway analyses) revealed that some classical pathways participating in cell proliferation and apoptosis were aberrantly expressed in these cells (P-value cut-off was 0.05). Enhancer-like lncRNAs and their nearby coding genes were analyzed. Six lncRNAs were identified as potential enhancers. Several lncRNAs were validated in lung cancer cell lines using RT-qPCR. To the best of our knowledge, the results showed for the first time that differentially expressed lncRNAs responded to EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC cells.

We simultaneously imaged and quantitatively detected EGFR and collagen IV in the TNBC samples. In all patients, quantitative determination showed a statistically significant negative correlation between EGFR and collagen IV. The 5-year disease-free survival (5-DFS) of the high and low EGFR/collagen IV ratio subgroups was significantly different. The EGFR/collagen IV ratio was predictive and was an independent prognostic indicator in TNBC. Compared with EGFR expression, the EGFR/collagen IV ratio had a greater prognostic value for 5-DFS.

The effect of lapatinib on tumour cell growth and receptor activation was studied in a panel of human endometrial cancer cell lines. Candidate molecular markers predicting sensitivity were assessed by baseline gene expression profiling, ELISA, and western blot analyses. Multiple drug effect/combination index (CI) isobologram analysis was used to study the interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and lapatinib. Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of lapatinib were seen in all endometrial cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines (IC(50) range: 0.052-10.9 micromol). HER2 overexpression or increased expression of EGFR was significantly associated with in vitro sensitivity (P=0.024 or 0.011, respectively). Lapatinib exerts growth inhibition in a PTEN-independent manner. Sensitive cell lines also exhibited increased expression of EGFR ligands or HER3. In contrast, lapatinib-resistant cell lines exhibited high androgen receptor (AR) levels or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (post-EMT) features. In endometrial cancer cells, at a wide range of clinically achievable drug concentrations, additive and synergistic interactions were observed for lapatinib plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and doxorubicin. These observations provide a clear biologic rational to test lapatinib as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in endometrial cancer with HER2 overexpression.

American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends performing EGFR mutation testing in all patients; European Society for Medical Oncology, College of American Pathologists/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/Association for Molecular Pathology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest for some selected group. EGFR mutation is rarely found in LSQC; however, more importantly, it is not a valid predictive biomarker for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in LSQC as it has been shown in LADC. Available data showed that the response rate and progression-free survival in EGFR mutant LSQC patients treated with EGFR-TKI are not better than that observed in patients treated with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Therefore, in contrast to advanced LADC, EGFR mutation testing may not be necessarily performed upfront in advanced LSQC because not only the mutation rate is low, but also the predictive value is insufficient.

Genomic DNA of the tissue samples was extracted and purified, and subjected to both traditional PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing of EGFR gene in exon 18, 19, 20, 21, and ADx's EGFR mutation detection kit. The mutation rates for EGFR gene in exon 18, 19, 20, 21, as well as the frequency of each mutation detected by the two methods, were analyzed.;The traditional Sanger DNA sequencing technique was successfully performed in 196 out of 208 (94.2%) lung cancer samples, and 22 samples (11.2%) showed EGFR gene mutations. ADx-EGFR kit was successfully used in the lung cancers of all of the 208 cases (100.0%), and 40 samples (19.2%) showed mutations. In the lung cancer samples analyzed, mutations were mainly detected in the exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutation, i.e. 4.8% (10/208) and 11.6% (23/208) of total mutations, respectively, and the remaining mutations were rare.;The success rate of ADx-EGFR real-time PCR for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues samples is significantly higher than that of Sanger sequencing (P < 0.01). There are significant differences between the two methods. ADx-EGFR real-time PCR shows a much higher successful detection rate and mutation rate of lung cancer tissues compared with that of Sanger sequencing. As a result, the real-time PCR with ADx-EGFR kit is proved to have a good clinical applicability and a strong advantage over the traditional Sanger DNA sequencing.

Thus, understanding molecular mechanisms of MEC development is expected to provide critical insights into initiation and progression of breast cancer. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands play essential roles in normal and pathological mammary gland. Signals through EGFR is required for normal mammary gland development. Ligands for EGFR are over-expressed in a significant proportion of breast cancers, and elevated expression of EGFR is associated with poorer clinical outcome. In the present study, we examined the effect of signals through EGFR on MEC differentiation using the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized human stem/progenitor MECs which express cytokeratin 5 but lack cytokeratin 19 (K5(+)K19(-) hMECs). As reported previously, these cells can be induced to differentiate into luminal and myoepithelial cells under appropriate culture conditions. K5(+)K19(-) hMECs acquired distinct cell fates in response to EGFR ligands epidermal growth factor (EGF), amphiregulin (AREG) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) in differentiation-promoting MEGM medium. Specifically, presence of EGF during in vitro differentiation supported development into both luminal and myoepithelial lineages, whereas cells differentiated only towards luminal lineage when EGF was replaced with AREG. In contrast, substitution with TGFα led to differentiation only into myoepithelial lineage. Chemical inhibition of the MEK-Erk pathway, but not the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, interfered with K5(+)K19(-) hMEC differentiation. The present data validate the utility of the K5(+)K19(-) hMEC cells for modeling key features of human MEC differentiation. This system should be useful in studying molecular/biochemical mechanisms of human MEC differentiation. ",

So far, however, the clinical benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies has been rather limited. a critical review of the large amount of clinical data obtained with anti-EGFR agents, carried out from the perspective of the oncogene addiction concept, may help to understand the causes of the unsatisfactory results. In this article we intend to do such an exercise taking as basis for the analysis a few case studies of anti-EGFR agents that are currently in the clinic. There, the \"EGFR addiction\" phenomenon becomes apparent in high-responder patients. We further discuss how the concept of oncogene addiction needs to be interpreted on the light of emerging experimental evidences and ideas; in particular, that EGFR addiction may reflect the interconnection of several cellular pathways. In this regard we set forth several hypotheses; namely, that requirement of higher glucose uptake by hypoxic tumor cells may reinforce EGFR addiction; and that chronic use of EGFR-targeted antibodies in EGFR-addicted tumors would induce stable disease by reversing the malignant phenotype of cancer stem cells and also by sustaining an anti-tumor T cell response. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for the failure of certain combinatorial therapies involving anti-EGFR agents, arguing that some of these agents might produce either a negative or a positive trans-modulation effect on other oncogenes. It becomes evident that we need operational definitions of EGFR addiction in order to determine which patient populations may benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR drugs, and to improve the design of these therapies.",

We previously demonstrated that the gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell line PC9 shows efficient ligand-induced endocytosis of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR). In contrast, the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines QG56 and A549 showed internalized pEGFR accumulation in the aggregated early endosomes, and this was associated with SNX1, a protein that interacts with and enhances the degradation of EGFR upon EGF stimulation. In the present study, to investigate the role of SNX1 on EGF-stimulated EGFR/pEGFR endocytosis via the endocytic pathway, we examined the effect of depletion of SNX1 expression by siRNA in human NSCLC cell lines. Using immunofluorescence, we demonstrated that transfection of SNX1 siRNA into gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells resulted in the disappearance of a large amounts of SNX1 staining. In addition, upon 15 min of EGF stimulation, we observed an efficient EGFR phosphorylation and a rapid endocytic delivery of pEGFR from early endosomes to late endosomes. Further, western blot analysis revealed that silencing of SNX1 expression by siRNA in the gefitinib-resistant cells leads to an accelerated degradation of EGFR along with a dramatic increase in the amounts of pEGFR after EGF stimulation. Based on these findings, we suggest that SNX1 is involved in the negative regulation of ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation and mediates EGFR/pEGFR trafficking out of early endosomes for targeting to late endosomes/lysosomes via the early/late endocytic pathway in human lung cancer cells.",

The initial selection yielded only a single clone that could bind to hEGFR, but further mutation and optimization yielded a family of tight-binding aptamers. One of the selected aptamers, E07, bound tightly to the wild-type receptor (K(d) = 2.4 nM). This aptamer can compete with EGF for binding, binds to a novel epitope on EGFR, and also binds a deletion mutant, EGFRvIII, that is commonly found in breast and lung cancers, and especially in grade IV glioblastoma multiforme, a cancer which has for the most part proved unresponsive to current therapies. The aptamer binds to cells expressing EGFR, blocks receptor autophosphorylation, and prevents proliferation of tumor cells in three-dimensional matrices. In short, the aptamer is a promising candidate for further development as an anti-tumor therapeutic.

MET expression was relatively high in TNBC cell lines, and the silencing of MET via small interfering RNA reduced cell proliferation and migration. We observed reduced TNBC cell viability after treatment with the MET inhibitor PHA-665752. In the most drug-resistant cell line, MDA-MB-468, which showed elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, silencing of EGFR resulted in increased sensitivity to PHA-665752 treatment. We confirmed that PHA-665752 synergizes with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib to decrease the viability of MDA-MB-468 cells. TNBC patients coexpressing MET and EGFR showed significantly worse DFS than that in patients expressing EGFR alone (p = 0.021). Our findings strongly suggest that MET may be a therapeutic target in TNBC and that the combined therapy targeting MET and EGFR may be beneficial for the treatment of TNBC/BLBC patients.",

In this study, we attempted to specifically evaluate the signaling pathway underlying HGF/Met induced EGFR ligand release in SSCs. The Met proto-oncogene encodes for a tyrosine kinase receptor which is often hyperactivated in human cancers. Met activation correlates with poor patient outcome. Several studies revealed a role of Met in receptor-crosstalk inducing either activation of other receptors, or inducing their resistance to targeted cancer treatments. In an epithelial tumor cell line screen we recently showed that the Met ligand HGF blocks the EGFR tyrosine kinase and at the same time activates transcriptional upregulation and accumulation in the supernatant of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin (Oncogene 32:3846-56, 2013). In the present work we describe the pathway responsible for the amphiregulin induction.;Amphiregulin is transcriptionally upregulated and is released into the supernatant. We show that Erk2 but not Erk1 mediates amphiregulin upregulation upon treatment with monocyte derived HGF. A siRNA knockdown of Erk2 completely abolishes amphiregulin release in squamous cell carcinomas.;These results identify Erk2 as the key downstream signal transducer between Met activation and EGFR ligand upregulation in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from tongue, larynx and lung.",

EGFR is up-regulated in primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and in many systemic tumors that metastasize to the CNS. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of p.o.-administered ZD1839 for the treatment of established intracerebral (i.c.) tumors expressing EGFR or the tumorigenic mutated variant EGFRvIII, which is constitutively phosphorylated. Oral administration of ZD1839 at 50 or 100 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks in athymic mice with established i.c. A431 human epidermoid carcinoma expressing EGFR increased median survival by 88% (P = 0.009) and 105% (P < 0.001), respectively. Additionally, there was no evidence of systemic or CNS toxicity. However, ZD1839 failed to inhibit either s.c. or i.c. in vivo tumor growth when tumorigenicity was conferred by EGFRvIII. Western blotting revealed that treatment with ZD1839 virtually ablated phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-1173 in A431 tumors. However, treatment of NR6M tumors with ZD1839 only partially decreased phosphorylation of EGFRvIII Tyr-1173 while up-regulating overall expression, suggesting that EGFRvIII may not be susceptible to the same molecular mechanisms of tyrosine kinase inhibition as EGFR. In conclusion, ZD1839 is active in a brain tumor model expressing EGFR, but not EGFRvIII, as EGFR mutations may lead to relative therapeutic resistance. On the basis of these observations, we believe that clinical trials of ZD1839 against brain tumors expressing EGFR are warranted, but that special consideration should be given to tumors that coexpress EGFRvIII.",

However, the mechanism through which PKG II inhibits             proliferation of gastric cancer cells is still not clear. Herein, we show that             PKG II can inhibit EGF-induced MAPK signal transduction. In the gastric cancer             cell line BGC-823, the expression and activity of PKG II were increased by infecting             the cells with adenoviral construct encoding PKG II cDNA and treating the cells             with the cGMP analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP.

Upstream of ERK, PKG II inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, the phosphorylation/activation             of Raf-1, the activation of Ras, and the binding between adaptor protein Grb2             and GTP exchange factor Sos1 induced by EGF.

The results suggest             that PKG II inhibits the proliferation of gastric cancer cells through blocking             EGF-triggered MAPK signal transduction and the key blocking point is the tyrosine             phosphorylation of the EGF receptor.",

EGFR mRNA and protein expression were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting in all 7 colorectal cancer cell lines studied. Gefitinib inhibited the cell growth of the cancer cell lines in vitro with an IC(50) range of 1.2-160 microM by 3,(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Lovo cells exhibited the highest level of protein and autophosphorylation of EGFR and were the most sensitive to gefitinib. The combination of gefitinib and CPT-11 induced supra-additive inhibitory effects in COLO320DM, WiDR and Lovo cells, assessed by an in vitro MTT assay. Administration of gefitinib and CPT-11 had a supra-additive inhibitory effect on WiDR cells and tumor shrinkage was observed in Lovo cell xenografts established in nude mice, whereas no additive effect of combination therapy was observed in COLO320DM cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of synergistic effects, the effect of CPT-11-exposure on phosphorylation of EGFR was examined by immunoprecipitation. CPT-11 increased phosphorylation of EGFR in Lovo and WiDR cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. This EGFR activation was completely inhibited by 5 microM gefitinib and gefitinib-induced apoptosis was enhanced by combination with CPT-11, measured by PARP activation although no PARP activation was induced by 5 microM CPT-11 alone. These results suggested that these modification of EGFR by CPT-11, in Lovo cells, is a possible mechanism for the synergistic effect of CPT-11 and gefitinib. These findings imply that the EGFR-TKI gefitinib and CPT-11 will be effective against colorectal tumor cells that express high levels of EGFR, and support clinical evaluation of gefitinib in combination with CPT-11, in the treatment of colorectal cancers.",

This study set out to clarify the mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end, ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib. H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway activation. Further, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other ALK-TKIs.

Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data.

Targeted inhibition of the EGFR pathway has been shown to limit proliferation of cancerous cells. Hence, we employed Traditional Chinese Medicine Database (TCM Database@Taiwan) (http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw) to identify potential EGFR inhibitor. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA), and Comparative Molecular Similarities Indices Analysis (CoMSIA) models were generated using a training set of EGFR ligands of known inhibitory activities. The top four TCM candidates based on DockScore were 2-O-caffeoyl tartaric acid, Emitine, Rosmaricine, and 2-O-feruloyl tartaric acid, and all had higher binding affinities than the control Iressa®. The TCM candidates had interactions with Asp855, Lys716, and Lys728, all which are residues of the protein kinase binding site. Validated MLR (r² = 0.7858) and SVM (r² = 0.8754) models predicted good bioactivity for the TCM candidates. In addition, the TCM candidates contoured well to the 3D-Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (3D-QSAR) map derived from the CoMFA (q² = 0.721, r² = 0.986) and CoMSIA (q² = 0.662, r² = 0.988) models. The steric field, hydrophobic field, and H-bond of the 3D-QSAR map were well matched by each TCM candidate. Molecular docking indicated that all TCM candidates formed H-bonds within the EGFR protein kinase domain. Based on the different structures, H-bonds were formed at either Asp855 or Lys716/Lys728. The compounds remained stable throughout molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Based on the results of this study, 2-O-caffeoyl tartaric acid, Emitine, Rosmaricine, and 2-O-feruloyl tartaric acid are suggested to be potential EGFR inhibitors.",

There has, thus, been a concerted effort in identifying EGFR gene mutations to explain misregulation of EGFR expression as well as differential sensitivity to anti-EGFR drugs. However, such genetic alterations have proven to be rare occurrences in most types of cancer, suggesting the existence of a more general physiological trigger for aberrant EGFR expression. Here, we provide evidence that overexpression of wild-type EGFR can be induced by the hypoxic microenvironment and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF2alpha) in the core of solid tumors. Our data suggest that hypoxia/HIF2alpha activation represents a common mechanism for EGFR overexpression by increasing EGFR mRNA translation, thereby diminishing the necessity for gene mutations. This allows for the accumulation of elevated EGFR levels, increasing its availability for the autocrine signaling required for tumor cell growth autonomy. Taken together, our findings provide a nonmutational explanation for EGFR overexpression in human tumors and highlight a role for HIF2alpha activation in the regulation of EGFR protein synthesis.",

We investigated their mechanism of activation by exogenous EGF and heregulin (HRG) in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines which express different amounts and combinations of the four receptors. Consistently the predominant interaction after EGF treatment was between EGFR and HER2, whereas activation of HER3 and HER4 depended on the relative abundance of the four receptors in the cells. Remarkably HER3 activation by HRG could occurs independent of HER2, and in one cell line almost no HER4 activation by HRG was detected despite high levels expression. Both EGF and HRG induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but the time course of MAPK activation differed depending on the hetero-dimers induced. EGF and HRG mediated cell growth through the EGFR/HER2 heterodimer and HER4, respectively, but not through HER3 when it was the only HRG receptor expressed and phosphorylated in the cells. These findings reveal a distinct pattern of HRG induced EGFR family interaction in ovarian cancer that is distinct from that described in human breast cancer.

From chylous of a LAM/TSC patient, we previously isolated smooth muscle-like LAM/TSC cells whose proliferation depends on EGF and monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies reduced proliferation and caused cell death. We demonstrated that the dependency from EGF was caused by the absence of tuberin. To study the role of EGFR pathway in vivo, we developed a mouse model by administration of LAM/TSC cells to female nude mice. LAM/TSC cells caused pulmonary airspace enlargement and, after 30 weeks, nodule formation which express EGFR. Anti-EGFR antibody decreased the number and dimension of lung nodules likely for the inhibition of Erk and S6 signaling, reversed the pulmonary alterations, and reduced lymphatic and blood vessels. Moreover, in pulmonary nodules anti-EGFR antibody reduced the positivity to estrogen and progesterone receptors which enhance survival of LAM cells and Snail expression.

Robust evidence demonstrated that activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are the best predictor for sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Nine large phase III trials conducted in both the Asian and Caucasian populations demonstrated that gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are superior to standard platinum-based chemotherapy as front-line treatment and subgroup analyses confirmed the superiority of erlotinib or gefitinib over chemotherapy in the second-line setting. Although no large phase III trials have been specifically conducted in EGFR mutation-positive (EGFR (mut+)) elderly non-small-cell lung cancer patients, available data, coming from subgroup analysis, retrospective series or small prospective phase II trials, replicated in the elderly the results observed in the general population, thus suggesting that age per se does not represent a criterion for treatment selection.

Through an integrated analysis of cell lines, in vivo models, and clinical samples, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is frequently activated in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain tumor of adults. We show that the common activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (EGFRvIII) stimulates mTORC2 kinase activity, which is partially suppressed by PTEN. mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM growth and survival and activates NF-κB. Importantly, this mTORC2-NF-κB pathway renders GBM cells and tumors resistant to chemotherapy in a manner independent of Akt. These results highlight the critical role of mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of GBM, including through the activation of NF-κB downstream of mutant EGFR, leading to a previously unrecognized function in cancer chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, will be effective in the treatment of cancer.;This study demonstrates that EGFRvIII-activated mTORC2 signaling promotes GBM proliferation, survival, and chemotherapy resistance through Akt-independent activation of NF-κB. These results highlight the role of mTORC2 as an integrator of two canonical signaling networks that are commonly altered in cancer, EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and NF-κB.

EGFR mutation is considered as a predictive marker for efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. Here we show miR-200c overexpression was correlated with the epithelial phenotype and sensitivity to gefitinib in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cell lines. Up-regulated miR-200c could regain the sensitivity to gefitinib in the EGFR wild-type cell lines and miR-200c could regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition through PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. NSCLC patients at advanced stage (N=150) who received EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) as second- or third-line therapy from September 2008 to December 2012 were included in the study. In 66 NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR, high levels of miR-200c expression was associated with higher disease control rate (DCR), longer progression-free survival (PFS) and longer overall survival (OS) compared with low miR-200c expression subgroup. In the subgroup with EGFR mutation, the trend remained the same but not statistically significant. Overall, these findings indicated that miR-200c might be a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR. ",

Anti-EGFR antibodies function by binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR, preventing its activation, and ultimately providing clinical benefit. KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 are recognized prognostic and predictive biomarkers that should be analyzed at the clinic prior to the administration of anti-EGFR therapy. However, still an important fraction of KRAS wild-type patients do not respond to the treatment. The identification of additional genetic determinants of primary or secondary resistance to EGFR targeted therapy for further improving the selection of patients is urgent. Herein, we review the latest published literature highlighting the most important genes that may predict resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer patients. According to the available findings, the evaluation of BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN status could be the right strategy to select patients who are likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapies. In the future, the combination of those biomarkers will help establish consensus that can be introduced into clinical practice. ",

Further, SHIP2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells regulates EGFR levels and supports in vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis. Here we examine the role of SHIP2 in EGF signaling in breast cancer cells using RNA interference. Our results show that suppression of SHIP2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells alters EGF and EGFR internalization. Upon SHIP2 silencing, EGF-induced Akt activation was reduced causing decreased nuclear levels of activated Akt. Cytokine receptor CXCR4, a downstream element of EGFR-Akt pathway that plays an important role in metastasis, is down-regulated upon SHIP2 knockdown. Finally, cell adhesion and EGF-induced cell migration were suppressed in SHIP2 silenced cells.

The transition from normal colonocytes to colorectal cancer correlates with increased meprinα activity at primary tumor sites. A role for meprinα in invasion and metastatic dissemination is supported by its pro-angiogenic and pro-migratory activity. In the present study, we provide evidence for a meprinα-mediated transactivation of the EGFR signaling pathway and suggest that this mechanism is involved in colorectal cancer progression. Using alkaline phosphatase-tagged EGFR ligands and an ELISA assay, we demonstrate that meprinα is capable of shedding epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) from the plasma membrane. Shedding was abrogated using actinonin, an inhibitor for meprinα. The physiological effects of meprinα-mediated shedding of EGF and TGFα were investigated with human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Proteolytically active meprinα leads to an increase in EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequently enhances cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, the implication of meprinα in the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway indicates a role of meprinα in colorectal cancer progression.",

Data from several recently published studies, as reviewed in this article, in patients with metastatic CRC (OPUS, CRYSTAL) clearly indicated that benefit from cetuximab, when added to chemotherapy, was only restricted to patients with wild-type K-ras tumours. These results showed that K-ras mutations predict the lack of clinical benefit from cetuximab and panitumumab therapies in CRC and indicate that K-ras status should be considered when selecting CRC patients as candidates for these antibodies. Moreover, the results from these studies should also trigger retrospective analyses of K-ras mutations from all available trials in CRC (as well as non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer).

Toxicity varied widely, correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels (P = 0.01) and was greatly reduced by EGF, indicating that binding of TGF-alpha-PE40 to EGFR is important in mediating toxicity. Cell lines expressing low EGFR levels were most highly protected by EGF, indicating that normal (low EGFR-expressing) tissue may be selectively protected by EGF in vivo. P-glycoprotein did not confer resistance to TGF-alpha-PE40, and toxicity was unaffected by multidrug resistance-modulating agents (cyclosporin A, tamoxifen, verapamil), indicating a role for TGF-alpha-PE40 in the clinical management of drug-resistant tumours.",

Initial responders invariably develop secondary resistance, which can be accounted for by T790M-EGFR mutation in half of the relapses. We show that MET is highly expressed in lung cancer, often concomitantly with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including H1975 cell line. The erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cell line H1975, which expresses L858R/T790M-EGFR in-cis, was used to test for the effect of MET inhibition using the small molecule inhibitor SU11274. H1975 cells express wild-type MET, without genomic amplification (CNV = 1.1). At 2 microM, SU 11274 had significant in vitro pro-apoptotic effect in H1975 cells, 3.9-fold (P = 0.0015) higher than erlotinib, but had no effect on the MET and EGFR-negative H520 cells. In vivo, SU11274 also induced significant tumour cytoreduction in H1975 murine xenografts in our bioluminescence molecular imaging assay. Using small-animal microPET/MRI, SU11274 treatment was found to induce an early tumour metabolic response in H1975 tumour xenografts. MET and EGFR pathways were found to exhibit collaborative signalling with receptor cross-activation, which had different patterns between wild type (A549) and L858R/T790M-EGFR (H1975). SU11274 plus erlotinib/CL-387,785 potentiated MET inhibition of downstream cell proliferative survival signalling. Knockdown studies in H1975 cells using siRNA against MET alone, EGFR alone, or both, confirmed the enhanced downstream inhibition with dual MET-EGFR signal path inhibition. Finally, in our time-lapse video-microscopy and in vivo multimodal molecular imaging studies, dual SU11274-erlotinib concurrent treatment effectively inhibited H1975 cells with enhanced abrogation of cytoskeletal functions and complete regression of the xenograft growth. Together, our results suggest that MET-based targeted inhibition using small-molecule MET inhibitor can be a potential treatment strategy for T790M-EGFR-mediated erlotinib-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer. Furthermore, optimised inhibition may be further achieved with MET inhibition in combination with erlotinib or an irreversible EGFR-TKI.",

We recently communicated the preliminary observation that nitric oxide (NO) signaling results in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation. To further define the role of NO in the pathogenesis of ER- breast cancer, we examined the mechanism of NO-induced EGFR activation in human ER- breast cancer. NO was found to activate EGFR and Src by a mechanism that includes S-nitrosylation. NO, at physiologically relevant concentrations, induced an EGFR/Src-mediated activation of oncogenic signal transduction pathways (including c-Myc, Akt, and β-catenin) and the loss of PP2A tumor suppressor activity. In addition, NO signaling increased cellular EMT, expression and activity of COX-2, and chemoresistance to adriamycin and paclitaxel. When connected into a network, these concerted events link NO to the development of a stem cell-like phenotype, resulting in the upregulation of CD44 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Our observations are also consistent with the finding that NOS2 is associated with a basal-like transcription pattern in human breast tumors. These results indicate that the inhibition of NOS2 activity or NO signaling networks may have beneficial effects in treating basal-like breast cancer patients.",

The cellular mechanisms of ZD1839 action against human malignant cells and drug-resistant cells were evaluated in vitro. Among the cell lines tested, ZD1839 showed a strong growth-inhibitory effect in vitro on human leukemic cells resistant to phorbol ester. This cell line, K562/TPA, shows a non-P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug-resistant phenotype. The IC50 value of ZD1839 on K562/TPA was approximately 400-fold lower than that on the parental K562 cell (K562 = 12 +/- 2 microM; K562/TPA = 0.025 +/- 0.002 microM) in vitro as determined by a dye formation assay. The expression of EGFR and EGFR mRNA was clearly present in K562/TPA but not in parental K562 cells as determined by Western blotting and RT-PCR. EGFR was autophosphorylated in K562/TPA detected by the antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The in vivo antitumor effects of ZD1839 on K562 and K562/TPA cells were also investigated in BALB/c nude mice. K562/TPA cells transplanted subcutaneously into mice disappeared completely with ZD1839 treatment (20 mg/kg/day, days 3-9). This was not the case in K562 cells.

Here, we present a structure-based approach, rationalized by subsequent computational analysis of conformational ligand ensembles in solution, to design novel and irreversible EGFR inhibitors based on a screening hit that was identified in a phenotype screen of 80 NSCLC cell lines against approximately 1500 compounds. Using protein X-ray crystallography, we deciphered the binding mode in engineered cSrc (T338M/S345C), a validated model system for EGFR-T790M, which constituted the basis for further rational design approaches. Chemical synthesis led to further compound collections that revealed increased biochemical potency and, in part, selectivity toward mutated (L858R and L858R/T790M) vs nonmutated EGFR. Further cell-based and kinetic studies were performed to substantiate our initial findings. Utilizing proteolytic digestion and nano-LC-MS/MS analysis, we confirmed the alkylation of Cys797. ",

By investigating DU145 sphere cells, a population of prostate cancer cells with stem-like properties, we report here that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a critical role in the propagation of DU145 PCSCs. Activation of EGFR signaling via addition of EGF and ectopic expression of a constitutively-active EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII) increased sphere formation. Conversely, inhibition of EGFR signaling by using EGFR inhibitors (AG1478 and PD168393) and knockdown of EGFR significantly inhibited PCSC self-renewal. Consistent with the MEK-ERK pathway being a major target of EGFR signaling, activation of the MEK-ERK pathway contributed to EGFR-facilitated PCSC propagation. Modulation of EGFR signaling affected extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation. Inhibition of ERK activation through multiple approaches, including treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, ectopic expression of dominant-negative MEK1(K97M), and knockdown of either ERK1 or ERK2 resulted in a robust reduction in PCSC propagation.

Current treatment options for TNBC patients are restricted to chemotherapy; however tyrosine kinases are promising druggable targets due to their high expression in multiple TNBC subtypes. Since coexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can promote signaling crosstalk and cell survival in the presence of kinase inhibitors, it is likely that multiple RTKs will need to be inhibited to enhance therapeutic benefit and prevent resistance. The MET and EGFR receptors are actionable targets due to their high expression in TNBC; however crosstalk between MET and EGFR has been implicated in therapeutic resistance to single agent use of MET or EGFR inhibitors in several cancer types. Therefore it is likely that dual inhibition of MET and EGFR is required to prevent crosstalk signaling and acquired resistance. In this study, we evaluated the heterogeneity of MET and EGFR expression and activation in primary and metastatic TNBC tumorgrafts and determined the efficacy of MET (MGCD265 or crizotinib) and/or EGFR (erlotinib) inhibition against TNBC progression. Here we demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition with either MGCD265 and erlotinib treatment or crizotinib and erlotinib treatment were highly effective at abrogating tumor growth and significantly decreased the variability in treatment response compared to monotherapy. These results advance our understanding of the RTK signaling architecture in TNBC and demonstrate that combined MET and EGFR inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients.",

In this study, we found that integrin α6β4 up-regulates several genes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, including amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and ectodomain cleavage protease MMP1, which is mediated by promoter demethylation and NFAT5. The correlation of these genes with integrin α6β4 was confirmed in The Cancer Genome Atlas Pancreatic Cancer Database. Based on previous observations that integrin α6β4 cooperates with c-Met in pancreatic cancers, we examined the impact of EGFR signaling on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated migration and invasion. We found that AREG and EREG were required for autocrine EGFR signaling, as knocking down either ligand inhibited HGF-mediated migration and invasion. We further determined that HGF induced secretion of AREG, which is dependent on integrin-growth factor signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and PKC. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase activity and integrin α6β4 signaling were required for AREG secretion. Blocking EGFR signaling with EGFR-specific antibodies or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor hindered HGF-stimulated pancreatic carcinoma cell chemotaxis and invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Finally, we found that EGFR was phosphorylated in response to HGF stimulation that is dependent on EGFR kinase activity; however, c-Met phosphorylation in response to HGF was unaffected by EGFR signaling. Taken together, these data illustrate that integrin α6β4 stimulates invasion by promoting autocrine EGFR signaling through transcriptional up-regulation of key EGFR family members and by facilitating HGF-stimulated EGFR ligand secretion. These signaling events, in turn, promote pancreatic carcinoma migration and invasion.",

However, they are less well studied or associated with less consistent data and therefore require prospective analyses before integration into clinical decision making. Future studies need to identify patterns of single or multiple mutations to further increase the power of patient selection for anti-EGFR therapy. While molecular parameters help to predict treatment efficacy upfront, skin toxicity has been accepted as an independent predictor of response during exposure to anti-EGFR therapy.",

Erlotinib, one of the EGFR TKIs, is currently FDA approved in second and third line therapy. However, recent studies showed that erlotinib is also effective as maintenance therapy after initial chemotherapy, improving disease free survival and possibly overall survival. Our current understanding of erlotinib's mechanism of action, with the discovery that EGFR mutation confers higher response rate, has propelled this agent into the first line setting.

In this study, we combined the selectivity of EGFR × c-MET bsAbs with the potency of cytotoxic agents via bispecific antibody-toxin conjugation. Affinity-attenuated bispecific EGFR × c-MET antibody-drug conjugates demonstrated high in vitro selectivity toward tumor cells overexpressing both antigens and potent anti-tumor efficacy. Due to basal EGFR expression in the skin, ADCs targeting EGFR in general warrant early safety assessments. Reduction in EGFR affinity led to decreased toxicity in keratinocytes. Thus, the combination of bsAb affinity engineering with the concept of toxin conjugation may be a viable route to improve the safety profile of ADCs targeting ubiquitously expressed antigens.",

Pyrosequencing is a bioluminometric, real-time non-electrophoretic DNA sequencing technique with a number of advantages compared with direct sequencing, including higher sensitivity, speed, automation and cost-effectiveness. Clinical specimens from 202 lung cancer patients were analyzed for EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 using the pyrosequencing method following genomic DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. All clinical data and tumor specimens were obtained from the Konkuk University Hospital (Korea) between July 2006 and December 2008. The results and clinical responses to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were compared. Overall, EGFR mutation-positive rate was 26.7% (54/202). Activating EGFR mutations were observed more frequently in female (52.1 vs. 13.0%), non-smoking (47.8 vs. 15.8%) and adenocarcinoma (35.2 vs. 5.2%) patients. However, significant numbers of EGFR mutation-positive patients were identified as male, former or current smokers and non-adenocarcinoma patients. The combinations of favorable clinicopathological factors, including female, non-smoking and adenocarcinoma, were not identified to significantly increase the positive EGFR mutation rate (female, 52.1%; female and non-smoker, 52.6%; female, non-smoker and adenocarcinoma, 51.9%). The present findings indicate that EGFR mutation analysis is a highly useful method for the prediction of response to EGFR-TKI and the use of favorable clinicopathological factors to perform this analysis is not suitable. Exon 19 deletion was the most common mutation (63.6%) and exon 21 L858R substitution was measured at 32.7%. The exon 20 T790M mutation was identified in 1 patient prior to EGFR-TKI treatment. EGFR mutation status is associated with response to EGFR-TKI and the overall response rate in patients who have the activating EGFR mutation was 82.4 vs. 5.9% in patients with a wild-type EGFR. The present study demonstrates that EGFR mutations analyzed by the pyrosequencing method are well correlated with clinicopathological parameters and that this method may be useful in the clinical practice.",

Tumors arise due to constitutively activated EGFR signaling and are susceptible to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). First generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) and the second generation EGFR TKI afatinib are approved worldwide. Although targeted therapies against EGFR mutants induce dramatic initial responses, acquired resistance (through multiple biological mechanisms) to erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib emerges within the first 1-2 years of continued monotherapy. EGFR-T790M accounts for more than half of acquired resistance to first or second generation EGFR TKIs by modifying ATP affinity and drug binding kinetics. Two new studies have shown that two covalent pyrimidine inhibitors-AZD9291 and rociletinib of EGFR-T790M (i.e., third generation EGFR TKIs) shown remarkable clinical activity in patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib when the tumor carries EGFR-T790M in conjunction with an activating mutation. However, and regrettably, acquired resistance to these third generation EGFR TKIs has already been reported in preclinical models and clinical specimens; such as a tertiary mutation at EGFR-C797S that prevents covalent binding of EGFR TKIs. The experience with sequential EGFR TKI monotherapy highlights tumor heterogeneity and adaptability (i.e., relentless game of whack-a-mole played between TKIs and cancer), and will help shape future clinical development of novel combinatory approaches to manage EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinomas.

For decades, efforts have been made to extend the successes seen with vaccination against infectious diseases to cancer. In some instances, preventive vaccination against viruses (prototypically HPV) has successfully prevented tumorigenesis and will make a major impact on public health in the decades to come. However, the majority of cancers that arise are a result of genetic mutation within the host, or non-viral environmental exposures. We present compelling evidence that vaccination against an overexpressed self-tumor oncoprotein has the potential to prevent tumor development. Vaccination against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) using a multipeptide vaccine in a preventive setting decreased EGFR-driven lung carcinogenesis by 76.4% in a mouse model of EGFR-driven lung cancer. We also demonstrate that anti-EGFR vaccination primes the development of a robust immune response in vivo. This study provides proof of concept for the first time that targeting tumor drivers in a preventive setting in lung cancer using peptide vaccination can inhibit tumorigenesis and may provide useful clinical insights into the development of strategies to vaccinate against EGFR in populations where EGFR-mutant disease is highly prevalent. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In comparison to full length antibodies they have smaller size and therefor exhibit better tumor penetration ability.

The cDNA encoded VH domain was in frame introduced into the pET-22b(+) vector and expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells. The resultant antibody was purified via Ni- NTA column and its reactivity was assessed by ELISA and western blot techniques using A431 cell lysate. Analysis by ELISA revealed that this single domain antibody was able to bind EGFR on A431cells. This result was further confirmed by western blotting. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that single domain antibody can identify and bind to EGFR of A431 carcinoma cells.

Although BRCA1 is involved in multiple cellular processes, its functional role in EGFR regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we report a previously unrecognized posttranscriptional mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates EGFR expression through the induction of miR-146a. We demonstrate that EGFR expression correlates negatively with BRCA1, whereas miR-146a levels increase with BRCA1. We show that BRCA1 binds to MIR146A promoter and activates transcription, which in turn attenuates EGFR expression. Knockdown of miR-146a in BRCA1-overexpressing cells negated this effect and suppressed its ability to inhibit proliferation and transformation. In archived triple-negative breast cancer samples, we show a strong positive correlation between BRCA1 and miR-146a expression. We also show that low expression of miR-146a strongly predicts positive lymph node status and is associated with distinctively poor overall survival of patients. Together, these observations provide an insight into a novel BRCA1miR-146aEGFR paradigm by which BRCA1 carries out an aspect of tumor suppressor function that is potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention.

Its expression and activation leads to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Consistently, EGFR amplification or expression of EGFR variant 3 (EGFRvIII) is associated with resistance to conventional cancer therapy through activation of pro-survival signaling and DNA-repair mechanisms. EGFR targeting has successfully been exploited as strategy to increase treatment efficacy. Nevertheless, these targeting strategies have only been proven effective in a limited percentage of human tumors. Recent knowledge indicates that EGFR deregulated tumors display differences in autophagy and dependence on autophagy for growth and survival and the use of autophagy to increase resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs. In this review the dependency on autophagy and its role in mediating resistance to EGFR-targeting agents will be discussed. Considering the current knowledge, autophagy inhibition could provide a novel strategy to enhance therapy efficacy in treatment of EGFR deregulated tumors.",

However, as a scaffolding protein, AnxA6 may stabilize activated cell-surface receptors to promote cellular processes such as tumor cell motility and invasiveness. In this study, we investigated the contribution of AnxA6 in the activity of EGFR in invasive breast cancer cells and examined whether the expression status of AnxA6 influences the response of these cells to EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or patient survival.;We demonstrate that in invasive BT-549 breast cancer cells AnxA6 expression is required for sustained membrane localization of activated (phosho-Y1068) EGFR and consequently, persistent activation of MAP kinase ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Depletion of AnxA6 in these cells was accompanied by rapid degradation of activated EGFR, attenuated downstream signaling and as expected enhanced anchorage-independent growth. Besides inhibition of cell motility and invasiveness, AnxA6-depleted cells were also more sensitive to the EGFR-targeted TKIs lapatinib and PD153035. We also provide evidence suggesting that reduced AnxA6 expression is associated with a better relapse-free survival but poorer distant metastasis-free and overall survival of basal-like breast cancer patients.;Together this demonstrates that the rapid degradation of activated EGFR in AnxA6-depleted invasive tumor cells underlies their sensitivity to EGFR-targeted TKIs and reduced motility. These data also suggest that AnxA6 expression status may be useful for the prediction of the survival and likelihood of basal-like breast cancer patients to respond to EGFR-targeted therapies.",

Despite considerable individual variation, transcript levels were generally higher in 16 paired gastric tumors compared with surrounding epithelium. Marked increases were observed for the TGFs and c-sis, whereas EGFR mRNA was poorly expressed; there was no correlation with pathological staging of the cancers. In the nonneoplastic tissues, 14 had normal histology and 27 displayed superficial (SG) or atrophic gastritis (AG). Transcript levels greater than or equal to + were similar between these categories for all the growth factors, but were about 50% higher for EGFR in the tissues with gastritis. Concurrent expression of TGF alpha and EGFR (greater than or equal to + level) was more frequent in the paired tumors (38%) than in adjacent nonmalignant tissue (6%) and was seen in only one of 14 (7%) normal samples, in three of 19 (16%) of those with AG, and none of eight of those displaying SG. High levels of TGF beta and PDGFA mRNA were expressed in gastric ulcers, with little or no TGF alpha and EGFR transcripts; in contrast both TGFs and EGFR message were found in normal oesophagus. Stomach tissues are thus capable of synthesizing a variety of growth factors. These may be associated with nonneoplastic hyperplasia and/or malignant proliferation.

Long-term cancer therapy may cause the occurrence of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in tumor formation, tumor metastasis and the development of EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance, we generated an EGFR-TKI-resistant HCC827-8-1 cell line and analyzed expression patterns by lncRNA microarray and compared it with its parental HCC827 cell line. A total of 1,476 lncRNA transcripts and 1,026 mRNA transcripts were dysregulated in the HCC827‑8-1 cells. The expression levels of 7 chosen lncRNAs were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. As indicated by functional analysis, several groups of lncRNAs may be involved in the bio-pathways associated with EGFR-TKI resistance through their cis- and/or trans‑regulation of protein-coding genes. Thus, lncRNAs may be used as novel candidate biomarkers and potential targets in EGFR-TKI therapy in the future. ",

Phase III randomized studies have clearly demonstrated that a reversible EGFR-TKI is significantly superior in terms of response rate, progression-free survival and quality of life to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients who carry an activating EGFR mutation, thus resulting into a new standard of care for this biologically selected group of patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of EGFR-mutated patients show primary resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, whereas virtually all patients who initially benefit from treatment will eventually develop acquired resistance. Importantly, revealing the molecular mechanisms that underlie resistance to reversible EGFR-TKIs is key to the development of EGFR-targeting strategies with the potential to prevent, delay or overcome such resistance. Early results of clinical trials with irreversible EGFR-TKIs or dual combination strategies aiming to block EGFR-mediated signaling at different levels have shown encouraging results in EGFR-mutated patients pretreated or not with a reversible EGFR-TKI. Therefore, in the near future it is reasonable to hypothesize that EGFR-mutated NSCLCs could be treated with multiple lines of EGFR-targeting therapies beyond disease progression, limiting chemotherapy to selected cases of resistant disease. This evolving treatment scenario highlights once again how important is the identification of a single oncogenic \"addiction\" that functions as unique determinant of progression and survival of NSCLC.

Erlotinib and gefitinib, two EGFR-targeted agents, have been shown to be relevant drugs for lung cancer treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2 receptors, is clinically effective against HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In this report, we investigated the activity of lapatinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;We selected the lung cancer cell line A549, which harbors genomic amplification of EGFR and HER-2. Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assays, and signaling cascade analyses (by western blot) were performed in vitro. In vivo experiments with A549 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice treated with lapatinib (with or without radiotherapy) were also carried out.;Lapatinib dramatically reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.0001), DNA synthesis (P < 0.006), and colony formation capacity (P < 0.0001) in A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, lapatinib induced G1 cell cycle arrest (P < 0.0001) and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.0006) and reduced cyclin A and B1 levels, which are regulators of S and G2/M cell cycle stages, respectively. Stimulation of apoptosis in lapatinib-treated A549 cells was correlated with increased cleaved PARP, active caspase-3, and proapoptotic Bak-1 levels, and reduction in the antiapoptotic IAP-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels. We also demonstrate that lapatinib altered EGFR/HER-2 signaling pathways reducing p-EGFR, p-HER-2, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, c-Myc and PCNA levels. In vivo experiments revealed that A549 tumor-bearing mice treated with lapatinib had significantly less active tumors (as assessed by PET analysis) (P < 0.04) and smaller in size than controls. In addition, tumors from lapatinib-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in angiogenesis (P < 0.0001).;Overall, these data suggest that lapatinib may be a clinically useful agent for the treatment of lung cancer.",

The synergistic effect of erlotinib and gemcitabine on cancer cells did not require sensitivity to erlotinib provided that erlotinib can inhibit EGFR. The restoration of sensitivity by gemcitabine occurred through downregulation of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), which suggests that PI3K-PTEN-Akt activity is important to the synergism between the two agents. In A-431 parental cells, treatment with gemcitabine followed by erlotinib - but not the reverse sequence - was superior to erlotinib alone. The importance of the order of administration maybe due to the downregulation of p-Akt by gemcitabine in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cells with intrinsic or acquired erlotinib resistance. Our data show that gemcitabine increased the cytotoxic effect of erlotinib by downregulating p-Akt in EGFR-overexpressing cells with either intrinsic or acquired erlotinib resistance.",

In the present work, we investigated three different conjugation strategies to obtain the biologically functional QD-cetuximab conjugates for the tumor-specific imaging. Successful conjugation of cetuximab to QDs was achieved using PEG conjugated polymer-coated QDs and two long-chain heterobifunctional linkers, sulfo-LC-SPDP and sulfo-SMCC. The dissociation constant of the QD-cetuximab conjugates to EGFR was determined to be 0.61 +/- 0.28 nM. The cancer cell-specific binding ability of the QD-cetuximab conjugates was evaluated in vitro, and the cellular internalization of the QD-cetuximab conjugates was clearly demonstrated in live cells by confocal microscopy. The cellular imaging experiments using the QD-cetuximab conjugates showed a clear endocytosis pathway, which was evidenced by the colocalization of the QD-cetuximab conjugates with dye-labeled transferrin. These results suggest that the QD-cetuximab conjugates as an imaging modality for tumor EGFR overexpression can be expected to provide important information on the expression levels of EGFR on the cancer cells.",

GSR cells displayed activated EGFR-RAS-CRAF signaling with upregulated EGFR ligands and sustained activation of ERK1/2, but not MEK1/2, in the presence of GSK2118436. Treatment of GSR cells with GSK2118436 enhanced EGFR-mediated RAS activity, leading to the formation of BRAF-CRAF dimers and transactivation of CRAF. Interestingly, sustained activation of ERK1/2 was partly dependent on receptor-interacting protein kinase-2 (RIP2) activity, but not on MEK1/2 activity.

The underlying mechanism for negative control of the Notch1 gene in human cells, as well as in a mouse model of EGFR-dependent skin carcinogenesis, involves transcriptional suppression of p53 by the EGFR effector c-Jun. Suppression of Notch signalling in cancer cells counteracts the differentiation-inducing effects of EGFR inhibitors while, at the same time, synergizing with these compounds in induction of apoptosis.

The application of next-generation genomic technologies has offered a more comprehensive look at the mutational landscape across the different subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A number of recurrent mutations such as TP53, KRAS, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been identified in NSCLC. While targeted therapeutic successes have been demonstrated in the therapeutic targeting of EGFR and ALK, the majority of NSCLC tumors do not harbor these genomic events. This review looks at the current treatment paradigms for lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, examining genomic aberrations that dictate therapy selection, as well as novel therapeutic strategies for tumors harboring mutations in KRAS, TP53, and LKB1 which, to date, have been considered \"undruggable\".

The first generation of mTOR inhibitors have failed to show clinical efficiency in treating pancreatic cancers due in part to the feedback relief of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-AKT signaling pathway. The second generation of mTOR inhibitors, such as AZD8055, could inhibit AKT activation upon mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) inhibition. However, whether this generation of mTOR inhibitors can obtain satisfactory activities in pancreatic cancer therapy remains unclear. In this study, we found AZD8055 did not show great improvement compared with everolimus, AZD8055 induced a temporal inhibition of AKT kinase activities and AKT was then rephosphorylated. Additionally, we found that AZD8055-induced transient AKT inhibition increased the expression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by releasing its transcriptional factors Fork-head box O 1/3a (FoxO1/3a), which might contribute to cell resistance to AZD8055.

Over recent years, basic scientific research has dramatically increased our knowledge of the pathogenesis of lung cancer and allowed us to uncover and understand the cellular pathways involved in this process. This has led to the development of therapies to selectively target these pathways. Among these, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase family and related downstream pathways play a critical role in cancer development and over recent years have become a validated target in NSCLC. The development of monoclonal antibodies and first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted towards EGFR has had a considerable impact on patient outcomes. However, despite dramatic and sustained responses and the discovery of specific patient subgroups that may derive clinical benefit, resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs inevitably develops. A new generation of agents have been developed to provide superior potency of target inhibition and further individualize the treatment of NSCLC.

EGFR overexpression is known to be involved in carcinogenic processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR have shown antitumor activity and improved the efficacy of chemotherapy. Cetuximab is a chimeric immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Several clinical studies have shown cetuximab, either as a single agent or in combination with irinotecan, having promising efficacy in patients with metastatic CRC. Cetuximab with 5-fluorouracil/LV (leucovorin) plus irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has shown higher response rate and longer time to progression as first-line treatment of mCRC. Currently, there are no data showing that addition of cetuximab would prolong overall survival in randomized studies. Panitumumab, a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, has also shown antitumor activity against EGFR-expressing mCRC with less allergic reaction. Anti-EGFR MoAbs are well tolerated and have limited overlapping toxicities in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. The most common side effect of anti-EGFR MoAb is an acneform skin rash, which is a surrogate marker of efficacy of treatment with MoAbs.

In this study, we offer evidence of a mechanism involving ectodomain shedding of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and TGF-α, which rely upon the cell surface protease TACE/ADAM-17. Specifically, we show that AREG participates in DCA-induced EGFR and STAT3 signaling, cell-cycle progression, and tumorigenicity in human colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TACE and AREG, but not TGF-α, were overexpressed in both colorectal cancer and PDAC tissues compared with normal tissues. Exposure of colorectal cancer and PDAC cells to DCA resulted in colocalization of Src and TACE to the cell membrane, resulting in AREG-dependent activation of EGFR, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and STAT3 signaling. Src or TACE inhibition was sufficient to attenuate DCA-induced AREG, but not TGF-α shedding. We also examined a role for the BA transporter TGR5 in DCA-mediated EGFR and STAT3 signaling. RNA interference-mediated silencing of TGR5 or AREG inhibited DCA-induced EGFR, MAPK, and STAT3 signaling, blunted cyclin D1 expression and cell-cycle progression, and attenuated DCA-induced colorectal cancer or PDAC tumorigenicity. Together, our findings define an AREG-dependent signaling pathway that mediates the oncogenic effects of secondary BAs in gastrointestinal cancers, the targeting of which may enhance therapeutic responses in their treatment.",

Because some cases might pose challenges for biopsy, noninvasive genotyping of EGFR in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) would be beneficial for lung cancer treatment.;We developed a detection system for EGFR mutations in ctDNA by use of deep sequencing of plasma DNA. Mutations were searched in >100 000 reads obtained from each exon region. Parameters corresponding to the limit of detection and limit of quantification were used as the thresholds for mutation detection. We conducted a multi-institute prospective study to evaluate the detection system, enrolling 288 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.;In evaluating the performance of the detection system, we used the genotyping results from biopsy samples as a comparator: diagnostic sensitivity for exon 19 deletions, 50.9% (95% CI 37.9%-63.9%); diagnostic specificity for exon 19 deletions, 98.0% (88.5%-100%); sensitivity for the L858R mutation, 51.9% (38.7%-64.9%); and specificity for L858R, 94.1% (83.5%-98.6%). The overall sensitivities were as follows: all cases, 54.4% (44.8%-63.7%); stages IA-IIIA, 22.2% (11.5%-38.3%); and stages IIIB-IV, 72.7% (60.9%-82.1%).;Deep sequencing of plasma DNA can be used for genotyping of EGFR in lung cancer patients. In particular, the high specificity of the system may enable a direct recommendation for EGFR-TKI on the basis of positive results with plasma DNA. Because sensitivity was low in early-stage NSCLC, the detection system is preferred for stage IIIB-IV NSCLC.",

The circadian axis comprises a central clock mechanism and a downstream network of hypothalamic relay stations that modulate arousal, feeding, and sleeping behavior. Communication between the clock and these hypothalamic signaling centers is mediated, in part, by diffusible substances that include ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Preclinical studies reveal that EGFR ligands such as transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) inhibit hypothalamic signaling of rhythmic behavior; clinical observations show that elevated levels of TGF-alpha are associated with fatigue, flattened circadian rhythms, and loss of appetite in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. These data support the hypothesis that a symptom cluster of fatigue, appetite loss, and sleep disruption commonly seen in cancer patients may be related to EGFR ligands, released either by the cancer itself or by the host in response to the stress of cancer, and suggest that further examination of their role in the production of symptom clustering is warranted.",

Based on the characteristics of different hybridization efficiency in different hybridization phase conditions, different region around EGFR exon 19 deletion hotspots was selected to design DNA probes to improve biosensor performance. The results confirm that alteration of deletion location in target deliberately according to different hybridization phase is able to improve selectivity of sandwich-type DNA biosensor. Satisfactory discrimination ability can be achieved when the deletions are located in the capture probe interaction region. In order to improve efficiency of ssDNA generation from dsDNA, we introduce Lambda exonuclease (λ-exo) to sandwich-type biosensor system.

EGFR has long been considered a promising target for cancer diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

To develop lower molecular weight probes for EGFR and other tumor cell receptors, the authors immunized a llama with the extracellular domains (ECDs) of EGFR and an oncogenic mutant receptor, EGFRvIII, and with extracts of tumor cell lines. From the immune repertoire of the llama, the authors constructed a heavy chain variable domain (VHH domain)-phage library. At approximately 16 kDa, the VHH domain is a tenth of the size of a monoclonal antibody and is the smallest antibody fragment that retains specificity. By affinity selection from this library, the authors isolated many VHH domains with specificity for EGFR. The VHH domains bind to whole cells expressing the receptor but not to control cells lacking the receptor and can immunoprecipitate EGFR from cell lysates. Some VHH domains have cross-specificity with existing anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies and have reasonably high (nM) affinities. The llama-VHH domain library is also potentially a rich source of targeting agents directed toward other tumor cell receptors.",

While detection of EGFR aberrations can be expected to be relevant for glioma patients, such analysis has not yet been implemented in a routine setting, also because feasible and robust assays were lacking. We evaluated multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detection of EGFR amplification and EGFRvIII in DNA of a spectrum of 216 diffuse gliomas. EGFRvIII detection was verified at the protein level by immunohistochemistry and at the RNA level using the conventionally used endpoint RT-PCR as well as a newly developed quantitative RT-PCR. Compared to these techniques, the DNA-based MLPA assay for EGFR/EGFRvIII analysis tested showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that MLPA is a robust assay for detection of EGFR/EGFRvIII aberrations. While the exact diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of such EGFR testing remains to be seen, MLPA has great potential as it can reliably and relatively easily be performed on routinely processed (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tumor tissue in combination with testing for other relevant glioma markers.",

Resistance to these agents invariably develops, and current treatment strategies have limited efficacy in this setting. Hsp90 inhibitors, such as 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), induce the degradation of EGFR and other Hsp90 interacting proteins and may thus have utility in tumors dependent upon sensitive Hsp90 clients. We find that the EGFR mutations found most commonly in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who respond to EGFR TKIs are potently degraded by 17-AAG. Although the expression of wild-type EGFR was also down-regulated by 17-AAG, its degradation required higher concentrations of drug and a longer duration of drug exposure. In animal models, a single dose of 17-AAG was sufficient to induce degradation of mutant EGFR and inhibit downstream signaling. 17-AAG treatment, at its maximal tolerated dose, caused a significant delay in H3255 (L858R EGFR) xenograft growth but was less effective than the EGFR TKI gefitinib. 17-AAG alone delayed, but did not completely inhibit, the growth of H1650 and H1975 xenografts, two EGFR mutant models which show intermediate and high levels of gefitinib resistance. 17-AAG could be safely coadministered with paclitaxel, and the combination was significantly more effective than either drug alone.

Follow-up of these patients until 1993 showed that 38 patients had developed cancer (27 lung, 3 pleural mesothelioma, 8 diverse malignancies). As determined by ELISA for EGFR and two different assays for Neu oncoprotein (Neu, nNeu) there was a statistically significant difference between EGFR levels in all the cancer and the non-lung cancer cases compared with the controls. No statistically significant differences were detected between Neu levels in the cancer cases and the controls. Protein concentrations showed no change prior the diagnosis of cancer. The serum levels of the proteins correlated with each other (EGFR-Neu, r=0.3; Neu-nNeu, r=0.7). Among 9 factors that were analyzed by multiple regression analysis progressive asbestosis was statistically significantly associated with the elevation of Neu and smoking with the elevation of nNeu. In logistic regression analysis only unstable asbestosis associated with cancer (OR = 6.25, p=0.0012). This study shows a coherence between the severity of asbestosis and development of cancer. Furthermore, the Neu concentration in the serum was elevated in both unstable and progressive asbestosis cases and may offer tools, supplementary to X-rays, for clinical monitoring of the pneumoconiosis patients.",

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major pathway that mediates protein degradation. To target the degradation of EGFR, we generated two artificial ubiquitin ligases, which are composed of an EGFR-binding domain, i.e., the SH2 domain from growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2), and an ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain, i.e., the RING domain from Cbl or the U-box domain from CHIP. When the chimeric ubiquitin ligases were introduced into lung cancer SPC-A1 cells, they effectively associated with EGFR, promoted its ubiquitination and degradation, and as a result, blocked the downstream PI3K-Akt signal pathway. Moreover, cell proliferation and invasion were inhibited, the sensitivity to docetaxel-induced apoptosis was enhanced and the tumorigenicity was suppressed. In conclusion, negative modulation of EGFR signaling by the chimeric ubiquitin ligases can inhibit malignancy of SPC-A1 cells and sensitize these cells to chemotherapy, thus it may be applied to targeted therapy for NSCLC.

Treatment of HT-29 cells with tephrosin inhibited both the ligand-induced and constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3, and concomitantly suppressed the activation of the downstream signaling molecules such as Akt and Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Tephrosin caused internalization of EGFR and ErbB2 into vehicles, which resulted in degradation of the receptors. This degradation was blocked by the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine. We also showed that tephrosin induced apoptosis. Tephrosin did not induce the proteolytic processing of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), but did nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), suggesting that tephrosin may induce caspase-independent apoptosis.

Essentially, the resistance mechanism involves modifications of the intracellular signaling pathways. In our work, we separately investigated the EGFR and ErbB-3 heterodimerization, regarded as the origin of intracellular signaling pathways. On one hand, we combined the molecular interaction in EGFR heterodimerization with that between the EGFR tyrosine kinase and its inhibitor. For 168 clinical subjects, we characterized their corresponding EGFR mutations using molecular interactions, with three potential dimerization partners (ErbB-2, IGF-1R and c-Met) of EGFR and two of its small molecule inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib). Based on molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis, we modeled these mutant-partner or mutant-inhibitor interactions using binding free energy and its components. As a consequence, the mutant-partner interactions are amplified for mutants L858R and L858R_T790M, compared to the wild type EGFR. Mutant delL747_P753insS represents the largest difference between the mutant-IGF-1R interaction and the mutant-inhibitor interaction, which explains the shorter progression-free survival of an inhibitor to this mutant type. Besides, feature sets including different energy components were constructed, and efficient regression trees were applied to map these features to the progression-free survival of an inhibitor. On the other hand, we comparably examined the interactions between ErbB-3 and its partners (EGFR mutants, IGF-1R, ErbB-2 and c-Met). Compared to others, c-Met shows a remarkably-strong binding with ErbB-3, implying its significant role in regulating ErbB-3 signaling. Moreover, EGFR mutants corresponding to poor clinical outcomes, such as L858R_T790M, possess lower binding affinities with ErbB-3 than c-Met does. This may promote the communication between ErbB-3 and c-Met in these cancer cells. The analysis verified the important contribution of IGF-1R or c-Met in the drug resistance mechanism developed in lung cancer treatments, which may bring many benefits to specialized therapy design and innovative drug discovery.

        "Doc_abstract":"While multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer is well established, little is known about the cellular pathways regulating the expression and trafficking of the MDR efflux transporter like BCRP (ABCG2). Here we evaluated the role of signalling downstream of EGFR on BCRP expression and sub-cellular localization using lung cancer cells harboring BCRP but expressing various EGFR and Ras activating mutations; A549 (K-Ras-G12S), H292 wild-type EGFR and Ras, and H1650 (EGFR-DelE747-A750). Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that BCRP was predominantly intracellular but its expression was found also on the plasma membrane in A549 and H1650 cells with activated Ras and EGFR. Remarkably, EGFR inhibition by erlotinib at IC₅₀ concentrations induced a differential timedependent alteration in BCRP gene and protein expression. In H1650 cells, erlotinib enhanced both the total and plasma membrane degradation of BCRP by ubiquitination within 6-24 hours, whereas BCRP expression regained the original basal levels after 48 hours. In erlotinib treated H292 cells, BCRP levels decreased at 24 hours until 72 hours, whereas in A549 cells erlotinib initially reduced BCRP expression but then induced its accumulation on the plasma membrane at 72 hours. We further found that the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 down-regulated BCRP expression, hence showing that the Akt pathway is involved in the regulation of BCRP expression but not in its localization in these lung cancer cell lines. Finally, the selective BCRP transport inhibitor Ko143 did not increase erlotinib sensitivity, but did decrease the transport activity of BCRP in A549 and H1650 cells as it induced the accumulation of its transport substrate topotecan. In conclusion, our results suggest that the EGFR and Akt pathways are involved in regulation of BCRP expression, trafficking and drug transport activity. These findings warrant future studies on the pharmacologic modulation of these pathways to enhance the efficacy of anticancer combinations of erlotinib with drugs that are BCRP transport substrates.",

Even with aggressive intervention, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the overall 2-year survival rate is only 25% in the most optimistic series, and 5-year survival rates are consistently in the low single digits. Therefore, it is evident that novel therapeutic paradigms are necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional treatments. EGFR gene overexpression can be found in 40 - 50% of patients with MGs, whereas its expression is very low in normal brain. Therapeutic targeting of EGFR has indicated clinical success in the treatment of MGs.;The purpose of this review is to discuss the current status of several EGFR-targeted therapies in MGs patients and address the efficacy of these drugs as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs and/or treatments. We also emphasize the lessons learned and the future perspectives in the development of EGFR-targeted therapies for MGs.;A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular, structural and biological characteristics of EGFR and the mechanisms of action of EGFR-targeted antagonists will most likely contribute to the successful use of strategies of EGFR-targeted therapy in the clinic.;Therapeutic targeting of EGFR include anti-EGFR mAbs, small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, peptide vaccination therapy and other therapeutic strategies. Each EGFR antagonist has its own advantages and limitations in terms of BBB crossing, ease of delivery, combination therapies and potential toxicity. Therefore, a multiple approach combining different agents that target EGFR signaling at multiple levels seems to have potential as future therapeutics for MGs, once the technical and safety issues unique to each of the approaches are overcome.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of 15-PGDH in gastric carcinogenesis associated with H. pylori. 15-PGDH expression in gastric biopsies from H. pylori-infected (n = 25) and noninfected (n = 15) subjects was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. 15-PGDH DNA methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing. The expression of 15-PGDH, Snail, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, TLR4, and MyD88 in response to H. pylori infection was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Compared with negative specimens, H. pylori-positive specimens had 2-fold lower 15-PGDH mRNA levels and significantly less 15-PGDH protein. In four H. pylori-infected subjects with longitudinal follow-up, the suppression of 15-PGDH expression was reversed by H. pylori eradication therapy. In parallel with suppressing 15-PGDH expression, H. pylori infection activated expression of TLR4 and MyD88 expression, increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2, and increased expression of EGF receptor (EGFR)-Snail. Inhibition of Snail and MyD88 reversed suppression of 15-PGDH expression, and siMyD88 reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2. Similarly, treatment with an ERK1/2 and EGFR inhibitor also restored 15-PGDH expression. H. pylori appeared to promote gastric carcinogenesis by suppressing 15-PGDH. This process is mediated by the TLR4/MyD88 pathway via ERK1/2 or EGFR-Snail transcriptional regulation. 15-PGDH may be a useful marker and a potential therapeutic target in H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Abnormalities in EGF-EGFR signaling, such as mutations that render the EGFR hyperactive or cause overexpression of the wild-type receptor, have been found in a broad range of cancers, including carcinomas of the lung, breast, and colon. EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib have proven successful in the treatment of certain cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring activating mutations within the EGFR gene, but the molecular mechanisms leading to tumor regression remain unknown. Therefore, we wished to delineate these mechanisms.;We performed biochemical and genetic studies to investigate the mechanisms by which inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, such as gefitinib, inhibit the growth of human NSCLCs. We found that gefitinib triggered intrinsic (also called \"mitochondrial\") apoptosis signaling, involving the activation of BAX and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, ultimately unleashing the caspase cascade. Gefitinib caused a rapid increase in the level of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM (also called BCL2-like 11) through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors indicated that blockade of MEK-ERK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2) signaling, but not blockade of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase 8), or AKT (protein kinase B), was critical for BIM activation. Using RNA interference, we demonstrated that BIM is essential for gefitinib-induced killing of NSCLC cells. Moreover, we found that gefitinib-induced apoptosis is enhanced by addition of the BH3 mimetic ABT-737.;Inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase have proven useful in the therapy of certain cancers, in particular NSCLCs possessing activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain, but the mechanisms of tumor cell killing are still unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that activation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM is essential for tumor cell killing and that shutdown of the EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is critical for BIM activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that addition of a BH3 mimetic significantly enhances killing of NSCLC cells by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. It appears likely that this approach represents a paradigm shared by many, and perhaps all, oncogenic tyrosine kinases and suggests a powerful new strategy for cancer therapy.",

Analysis of EGFr and ER was performed on tumour samples from 231 patients with operable breast cancer followed for up to 6 years after surgery. The median duration of follow-up in patients still alive at the time of analysis was 45 months.

In a univariate analysis EGFr was second only to axillary node status as a prognostic marker for all patients both in terms of relapse-free and overall survival (P less than 0.001, log rank). For patients with histologically negative axillary nodes EGFr was superior to ER in predicting relapse and survival (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.005 respectively compared to P less than 0.1 and P less than 0.1, log rank).

It is well established that whereas EGF binding leads to lysosomal degradation of EGFR, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha causes receptor recycling. TGF-alpha therefore leads to continuous signalling and is a more potent mitogen than EGF. In addition to EGF and TGF-alpha, five EGFR ligands have been identified. Although many of these ligands are upregulated in cancers, very little is known about their effect on EGFR trafficking. We have compared the effect of six different ligands on endocytic trafficking of EGFR. We find that, whereas they all stimulate receptor internalization, they have very diverse effects on endocytic sorting. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and Betacellulin target all EGFRs for lysosomal degradation. In contrast, TGF-alpha and epiregulin lead to complete receptor recycling. EGF leads to lysosomal degradation of the majority but not all EGFRs. Amphiregulin does not target EGFR for lysosomal degradation but causes fast as well as slow EGFR recycling. The Cbl ubiquitin ligases, especially c-Cbl, are responsible for EGFR ubiquitination after stimulation with all ligands, and persistent EGFR phosphorylation and ubiquitination largely correlate with receptor degradation.",

Pleural effusion is a common complication of lung cancer. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of detection of EGFR mutations in samples of pleural effusion fluid. We obtained 43 samples, which was the cell-free supernatant of pleural fluid, from Japanese NSCLC patients, and examined them for EGFR mutations. The epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status was determined by a direct sequencing method (exons 18-21 in EGFR). EGFR mutations were detected in 11 cases (E746_A750del in seven cases, E746_T751del insA in one case, L747_T751del in one case, and L858R in two cases). The EGFR mutations were observed more frequently in women and non-smokers. A comparison between the EGFR mutant status and the response to gefitinib in the 27 patients who received gefitinib revealed that all seven patients with partial response and one of the seven patients with stable disease had an EGFR mutation. No EGFR mutations were detected in the patients with progressive disease. The results suggest that DNA in pleural effusion fluid can be used to detect EGFR mutations and that the EGFR mutation status may be useful as a predictor of the response to gefitinib.",

The aims of the current study were to analyze circulating tumor cells in the blood of breast cancer patients by investigating EGFR, CK19, CK20 and HER2 expression profiles and to evaluate their prognostic importance.;CK19, CK20 and EGFR gene expression profiles were evaluated in the blood samples of 84 female patients with primary invasive ductal breast cancer and 20 healthy female volunteers using SYBR green-based real-time qPCR assays. HER2 expression analyses were conducted in 46 patients who had an HER2-positive primary tumor and in 30 healthy women to determine the cutoff level of positivity.;The positive rates of CK20, EGFR, CK19 and HER2 mRNA expression in the peripheral blood were 28.57% (24/84), 20.23% (17/84), 5.95% (5/84) and 2.17% (1/46), respectively. The high positive ratio of CK20 mRNA expression in the peripheral blood of breast cancer was identified for the first time in the current study. Significant differences were identified in CK20 expression status and several clinical parameters related with aggressiveness of tumors using a binary logistic regression analysis. Higher CK20-positive levels were observed in patients who had lymph node metastasis and advanced-grade primary tumors, which were estrogen receptor-negative. We have demonstrated that CK20 may be a novel biomarker that is useful to identify circulating tumor cells and predict breast cancer progression.;The results suggest that the investigation of CK20 mRNA with other biomarkers in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients may be useful to monitor the presence of disseminated tumor cells in the blood circulation and to predict the prognosis of breast cancer.",

Emerging evidence suggests that MUC4 mucin is associated with metastasis of various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the functional role of MUC4 remains unclear in breast cancers, especially in TNBCs.;In the present study, we investigated the functional and mechanistic roles of MUC4 in potentiating pathogenic signals including EGFR family proteins to promote TNBC aggressiveness using in vitro and in vivo studies. Further, we studied the expression of MUC4 in invasive TNBC tissue and normal breast tissue by immunostaining.;MUC4 promotes proliferation, anchorage-dependent and-independent growth of TNBC cells, augments TNBC cell migratory and invasive potential in vitro, and enhances tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. In addition, our studies demonstrated that MUC4 up-regulates the EGFR family of proteins, and augments downstream Erk1/2, PKC-γ, and FAK mediated oncogenic signaling. Moreover, our studies also showed that knockdown of MUC4 in TNBC cells induced molecular changes suggestive of mesenchymal to epithelial transition. We also demonstrated in this study, for the first time, that knockdown of MUC4 was associated with reduced expression of EGFR and ErbB3 (EGFR family proteins) in TNBC cells, suggesting that MUC4 uses an alternative to ErbB2 mechanism to promote aggressiveness. We further demonstrate that MUC4 is differentially over-expressed in invasive TNBC tissues compared to normal breast tissue.;MUC4 mucin expression is associated with TNBC pathobiology, and its knockdown reduced aggressiveness in vitro, and tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Overall, our findings suggest that MUC4 mucin promotes invasive activities of TNBC cells by altering the expression of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 molecules and their downstream signaling.",

The follow-up period was from November 1992 to July 1998. The association between qualitative variables and the x2 or Fisher exact test was compared using the hypothesis of the proportional ordinal trend for the ordinal variables, and the quantitative variables were analyzed using Student's t test and/or variance analysis (ANOVA). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparison was performed using the Breslow exact test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was utilized. The SPSS software for Windows 7.0 was used for the analysis.;The EGFR values were higher for patients with bladder carcinoma than in controls (14.48 vs 2.54 fmol/mg of protein). EGFR values were higher in patients with superficial bladder tumor than in those with infiltrating tumors (27.03 fmol/mg vs. 10.05 fmol/mg of protein; p = 0.000). Poorly differentiated tumors showed higher values of EGFR (6.73, 14.48 and 17.07 fmol/mg of protein for grades I, II and III, respectively; p < 0.05). The EGFR values were higher in patients that died from cancer during follow-up (64.8) than in those who died from other causes (47.5) and those who are alive and on follow-up (42). An increase in EGFR values did not carry a risk of death from cancer (p = 0.1269; ns). Analysis of the grade of tumor differentiation showed that for the more aggressive tumor grade, a positive EGFR was a sign of reduced survival. Survival in patients with superficial and infiltrating tumor did not appear to change significantly according to the EGFR value. EGFR determination was not useful in predicting recurrence and increased EGFR values did not correlate with a higher risk of recurrence.;1) The normal pattern of EGFR could not be established. 2) EGFR was not useful in identifying subgroups at risk of death. 3) Knowledge about these proteins synthesized by oncogenes offers new possibilities in the treatment of cancer.",

Given the increased patient dataset now available, a comprehensive literature search for EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC was undertaken to update the results of a previously published pooled analysis. Pooling eligible progression-free survival (PFS) data from 27 erlotinib studies (n = 731), 54 gefitinib studies (n = 1802) and 20 chemotherapy studies (n = 984) provided median PFS values for each treatment. The pooled median PFS was: 12.4 months (95% accuracy intervals [AI] 11.6-13.4) for erlotinib-treated patients; 9.4 months (95% AI 9.0-9.8) for gefitinib-treated patients; and 5.6 months (95% AI 5.3-6.0) for chemotherapy. Both erlotinib and gefitinib resulted in significantly longer PFS than chemotherapy (permutation testing; P = 0.000 and P = 0.000, respectively). Data on more recent TKIs (afatinib, dacomitinib and icotinib) were insufficient at this time-point to carry out a pooled PFS analysis on these compounds.

Inhibition of EGFR signalling pathways improves the effectiveness of radiotherapy of head and neck cancers by overcoming these main mechanisms of radioresistance. The fact that only a minority of the patients respond to EGFR inhibitors reflects the complexity of interactions between EGFR-dependent signalling pathways and the tumour microenvironment. Furthermore, many components of the microenvironment are potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

The combined treatment with cetuximab and regorafenib induced synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in cetuximab-resistant cell lines by blocking MAPK and AKT pathways. Nude mice were injected s.c. with HCT116, HCT15, GEO-CR, and SW48-CR cells. The combined treatment caused significant tumor growth inhibition. Synergistic antitumor activity of regorafenib plus cetuximab was also observed in an orthotopic colorectal cancer model of HCT116 cells.

Addition of a chimeric monoclonal antibody against EGFR (cetuximab) to first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal tumours improved outcomes of patients (stratified for KRAS wild-type cancers), whereas GC patients did not benefit from this approach. In GC, however, stratification based on KRAS mutations was not performed, and the 30 % KRAS mutation frequency in microsatellite instable cancers (MSI), which represents ∼4 % of total GC, was disregarded. Further, intratumoural heterogeneity regarding KRAS mutant subpopulations might also contribute to anti-EGFR therapy failure. We assessed the mutational status of the entire KRAS coding sequence in 19 MSI-GC cases by multiplex PCR/sequencing and used peak height ratio determined from electropherograms from KRAS heterozygous mutants and histopathological evaluation to infer tumour heterogeneity in GC. Using 2 multiplex reactions per sample, we found that 26 % (5/19) of MSI-GC cases harboured KRAS mutations (2 G12D, 2 G13D, 1 G12V). No mutations were found outside the codon 12 and 13 hotspots. Our analysis supported the co-existence of KRAS-positive and KRAS-negative tumour populations in 4/5 MSI-GC cases. In conclusion, the method developed stands as a cost-effective and practical way for mutation screening of the entire KRAS coding sequence. KRAS mutations are frequent in our series of MSI cases and are often found in a subpopulation of the tumour and not in the whole tumour.

ILK stimulated Ras activity to activate the c-Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/ribosomal S6 kinase/inhibitor of κBα/NF-κB signaling by facilitating the formation of the IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1)-Ras complex. Forced enzymatic ILK expression promoted cell growth by facilitating ERK1/2/NF-κB signaling. PI3K activation or decreased PTEN expression prolonged ERK1/2 activation by protecting ILK from proteasome-mediated degradation. C-terminus of heat shock cognate 70 interacting protein, an HSP90-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediated ILK ubiquitination to control PI3K- and HSP90-regulated ILK stabilization and signaling. In addition to cell growth, the identified pathway promoted cell migration and reduced the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to the anticancer agents 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin.

We explored             the function of cucurmosin in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells using multiple cellular             and molecular approaches such as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium             bromide assay, flow cytometry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction             (RT-PCR), Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy for observing             typical changes and formation of apoptotic bodies. We found that cucurmosin inhibited             the proliferation of BxPC-3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and increased             the cell population in the G0-G1 phase.

The secreted TGFα further triggers the activation of the EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. Finally, the positive correlation of RHBDD1 expression with the EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway is further corroborated in a murine model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

Mice lacking EGFR in macrophages show impaired hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas mice lacking EGFR in hepatocytes unexpectedly develop more HCC owing to increased hepatocyte damage and compensatory proliferation. Mechanistically, following interleukin-1 stimulation, EGFR is required in liver macrophages to transcriptionally induce interleukin-6, which triggers hepatocyte proliferation and HCC. Importantly, the presence of EGFR-positive liver macrophages in HCC patients is associated with poor survival. This study demonstrates a tumour-promoting mechanism for EGFR in non-tumour cells, which could lead to more effective precision medicine strategies. ",

However, acquired resistance remains a problem in the majority of cases. t-Darpp is over-expressed in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines and its over-expression is sufficient for conferring the resistance phenotype. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, t-Darpp has been shown to increase cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. We have reported that trastuzumab-resistant BT.HerR cells that over-express endogenous t-Darpp are sensitized to EGFR inhibition in the presence (but not the absence) of trastuzumab. The purpose of the current study was to determine if t-Darpp might modulate sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in trastuzumab-resistant cells. Using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478, gefitinib and erlotinib, we found that trastuzumab-resistant SK.HerR cells were sensitized to EGFR inhibition, compared to SK-Br-3 controls, even in the absence of trastuzumab. t-Darpp knock-down in SK.HerR cells reversed their sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Increased EGFR sensitivity was also noted in SK.tDp cells that stably over-express t-Darpp. High levels of synergy between trastuzumab and the EGFR inhibitors were observed in all cell lines with high t-Darpp expression. These cells also demonstrated more robust activation of EGFR signaling and showed greater EGFR stability than parental cells. The T75A phosphorylation mutant of t-Darpp did not confer sensitivity to EGFR inhibition nor activation of EGFR signaling. The over-expression of t-Darpp might facilitate enhanced EGFR signaling as part of the trastuzumab resistance phenotype. This study suggests that the presence of t-Darpp in HER2+ cancers might predict the enhanced response to dual HER2/EGFR targeting. ",

It is important to understand the functional significance of amino acid variation occurring within TKD due to non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (nsSNPs). Therefore, we have evaluated the influence of nsSNPs on the structure of EGFR-TKD using computational methods. Out of 2,493 SNPs in the EGFR gene, only 41 were found to be non-synonymous. In silico evaluation of these nsSNPs using a sequence based SIFT tool and structure based PolyPhen algorithm revealed that 13 nsSNPs disrupted the conformation of EGFR-TKD. Protein stability analysis using CUPSAT, I-mutant2.0 and iPTree-STAB identified 6 mutants that are less stable than the wild structure. Thereafter, to evaluate the structural impact of 5 mutants (G719A, P733L, V742A, S768I and H773R) the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 2 ns was performed. The MD trajectories showed that the native EGFR was stabilized after 0.9 ns while the stability of mutants was achieved after longer simulation. The RMSF profile of P-loop and A-loop shows an increased flexibility for all the mutants. We also observed that the 3 mutants (V742A, P733L and H773R) showed large root mean square deviation (2.075, 2.59 and 2.752 Å respectively) compared to the native EGFR. Further docking studies indicate that gefitinib can be administered for combating cancer occurring due to presence of these mutations.",

First intron CA repeat amplification was assessed by Taqman RT-PCR. With FISH and RT-PCR, 4.7 and 6.3% of cases showed whole gene and first intron CA repeat amplification, respectively. Amplification dosage varied between two- and four-fold in RT-PCR. By immunohistochemistry, 17.3% showed EGFR overexpression. There was a low correlation between the different methods. In all, 2.9% of cases showed both whole gene amplification and intron CA repeat amplification, and 90.3% of cases were negative for both. Nearly 20% of cases with immunohistochemical protein overexpression showed intron CA repeat amplification, and only 2.2% of cases that were negative on immunohistochemistry showed such amplification. In all, 13% of cases with protein overexpression showed amplification by FISH, and only 1.6% of cases that were negative on immunohistochemistry showed such amplification. Of the cases with EGFR overexpression, 4 (25%) showed either whole gene or intron CA repeat amplification. In conclusion, whole gene amplifications of egfr are rare in invasive breast cancer and explain protein overexpression in only about 12.5% of invasive breast cancer cases. First intron first CA repeat amplification is another important mechanism for EGFR protein overexpression, explaining protein overexpression in about 18.7% of cases. However, since about 75% of cases with EGFR protein overexpression lack either of these amplifications, other expression regulating mechanisms must be considered.",

Presence of activating mutations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) identified a particular group of NSCLC patients with different clinical characteristics and outcome. For EGFR mutant patients first-generation EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, represent the best therapeutic option in first, second and maintenance setting. Unfortunately, all patients develop acquired resistance and despite an initial benefit, virtually all patients progress due to the development of resistance. Several molecular mechanisms are responsible for acquired resistance and the two prominent are the up-regulation of the downstream signal by mesenchymal-epidermal transition (MET) amplification and the emergence of T790M EGFR gatekeeper mutation. Preclinical and early clinical trials suggested a potential efficacy of a new class of panHER inhibitor, also called irreversible or covalent inhibitor, in overcome acquired resistance related to T790M.

This signalling route is distinct from the better-characterized, traditional EGFR pathway that involves transduction of mitogenic signals through activation of multiple signalling cascades. Transcriptional activity of nuclear EGFR appears to depend on its C-terminal transactivation domain and its physical and functional interaction with other transcription factors that contain DNA-binding activity. Likely via its ability to upregulate gene expression, nuclear EGFR pathway is associated with major characteristics of more aggressive tumours: increased proliferative potential, nitric oxide synthesis, and accelerated G1/S cell cycle progression. A role of nuclear EGFR in prognostic prediction is further suggested in patients with breast carcinomas and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. It is noted that significant advances were made towards the knowledge of the nuclear EGFR pathway; however, many aspects of this new pathway remain unresolved and will be discussed in this review. As a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors also undergo similar nuclear translocalization, a better understanding of the physiological and malignant nature of the nuclear EGFR pathway will likely shed light into the biology of cancer with nuclear RTKs.",

In this study we show that loss of the other intestinal desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) that pairs with Dsc2, results in decreased epithelial cell proliferation and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice. Dsg2-deficient cells demonstrated a compensatory increase in Dsc2 expression, and small interfering RNA-mediated loss of Dsc2 restored proliferation in Dsg2-deficient cells. Dsg2 downregulation inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and cell proliferation through altered phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in parallel with inhibited EGFR receptor internalization. Additionally, we demonstrated a central role of Dsc2 in controlling EGFR signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells. Consistent with these findings, analyses of human colon cancers demonstrated increased Dsg2 protein expression.

This pathway represents the major mechanism of long-term attenuation of EGFR signaling, and its deregulation is a significant feature in different types of cancers. Here we demonstrate, through a systematic RNAi-based approach, that several deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes extend or decrease EGFR half-life upon EGF stimulation. We focus on USP9X, whose depletion severely affects EGFR turnover, interfering with its internalization and trafficking. We identify the endocytic protein Eps15 as one of the critical substrates of USP9X, and we map the Eps15 ubiquitination sites. We found that Eps15 monoubiquitination occurs already at minimal dose of EGF stimulation and is essential for EGFR internalization. Overall, our findings identify USP9X as a novel regulator of EGFR endocytosis and suggest a model whereby cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination events on endocytic accessory proteins may regulate the internalization and trafficking of the EGFR toward the lysosomes.

Despite their best-characterized roles as plasma membrane-bound receptors, both receptors undergo nuclear translocation though the impact of this process remains unclear. In this study, we provide evidence showing that EGFR upregulates expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a transcription factor responding to inflammatory signals and regulating genes involved in inflammatory response. EGFR regulation of STAT1 expression is primarily attributed to the nuclear activity of EGFR. The oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 binds to the STAT1 promoter and synergizes with nuclear EGFR to significantly enhance STAT1 gene expression. Structural characterization of the human STAT1 gene promoter indicates the presence of four functional STAT3-binding sites in the promoter and their importance in STAT1 co-regulation by EGFR and STAT3. The constitutively activated EGFR variant, EGFRvIII, also cooperates with STAT3 to activate the STAT1 gene promoter through the identified STAT3-binding sites within the promoter. Using human breast cancer cell lines, we further found a positive association between levels of STAT1, EGFR, and p-STAT3. Furthermore, we found that STAT1 expression is transcriptionally upregulated by HER2 and heregulin stimulation in breast cancer cells, and the level is further augmented by activated STAT3. In summary, we report in this study that STAT1 expression is upregulated by nuclear EGFR, EGFRvIII and HER2, and that STAT3 synergizes with the three receptors to further enhance STAT1 expression. These novel findings establish a novel link between the mitogenic ErbB signaling pathway and the inflammatory pathway mediated by STAT1.",

Although irreversible EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib or dacomitinib, have been introduced to overcome the acquired resistance, they showed a limited efficacy in NSCLC with T790M. Herein, we identified the novel de novo resistance mechanism to irreversible EGFR TKIs in H1975 and PC9-GR cells, which are NSCLC cells with EGFR T790M. Afatinib activated interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R)/JAK1/STAT3 signaling via autocrine IL-6 secretion in both cells. Inhibition of IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway increased the sensitivity to afatinib. Cancer cells showed stronger STAT3 activation and enhanced resistance to afatinib in the presence of MRC5 lung fibroblasts. Blockade of IL-6R/JAK1 significantly increased the sensitivity to afatinib through inhibition of afatinib-induced STAT3 activation augmented by the interaction with fibroblasts, suggesting a critical role of paracrine IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 loop between fibroblasts and cancer cells in the development of drug resistance. The enhancement of afatinib sensitivity by inhibition of IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 signaling was confirmed in in vivo PC9-GR xenograft model. Similar to afatinib, de novo resistance to dacomitinib in H1975 and PC9-GR cells was also mediated by dacomitinib-induced JAK1/STAT3 activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 signaling can be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of irreversible EGFR TKIs in patients with EGFR T790M.",

Along with others, we have recently identified that proteasome inhibition is a promising therapeutic option in this highly refractory disease. The pleiotropic effects of proteasome inhibition include the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways and also antiapoptotic signaling pathways such as EGFR, AKT and the MAP kinases that reduce the apoptotic potential of this class of drug. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism behind the activation of EGFR in response to proteasome inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. We found that the second-generation proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 induced the mRNA transcription of several EGFR family ligands (EGF, HB-EGF and epiregulin), however only increases in HB-EGF were detected at the protein level. Using both pharmacological inhibitors and lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown of EGFR ligand expression, we discovered that ligand cleavage by MMP/ADAMs and HB-EGF expression is required for activation of EGFR in response to proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, we discover that induction of HB-EGF is dependent on reactive oxygen species and p38-MAPK signaling but not ERK and that the transcription factor SP-1 is involved in NPI-0052-induced HB-EGF transcription. Together, these results indicate that stress signaling leading to induction of HB-EGF expression and increases in MMP/ADAM-dependent HB-EGF cleavage are responsible for proteasome inhibitor-induced activation of EGFR in pancreatic cancer cells.",

However, as with other targeted therapies, intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms limit efficacy. In the FaDu HNSCC xenograft model, we show that combined blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 promotes rapid tumor regression, followed by the eventual outgrowth of resistant cells. RNA sequencing revealed that resistant cells express FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins, which were validated as drivers of the resistant phenotype by several approaches, including CRISPR-mediated inactivation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion genes. Interestingly, analysis of signaling in resistant cell lines demonstrated that FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance by preferentially substituting for EGFR/RAS/ERK signaling rather than ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, although FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance of additional EGFR-dependent HNSCC and lung cancer cell lines to EGFR blockade, they are unable to compensate for inhibition of PI3K signaling in PIK3CA-mutant HNSCC cell lines. Validation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins as endogenous drivers of resistance in our screen provides strong evidence that these fusions are capable of substituting for EGFR signaling. Thus, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins may represent a novel mechanism of acquired resistance in EGFR-dependent cancers of multiple cell lineages.Oncogene advance online publication, 27 June 2016 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.216.",

In the APC(min/+) mouse model short term treatment with Celecoxib reduced gut adenomas, but a prolonged administration of the drug induced fibroblast activation and intestinal fibrosis with a final tumor burden.

Compared to BRAF mutant melanoma cells, BRAF mutant CRC cells were less sensitive to vemurafenib, and P-ERK suppression was not sustained in response to treatment. Although transient inhibition of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib was observed in CRC, rapid ERK re-activation occurred through EGFR-mediated activation of RAS and CRAF. BRAF mutant CRCs expressed higher levels of phospho-EGFR than BRAF mutant melanomas, suggesting that CRCs are specifically poised for EGFR-mediated resistance. Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of MAPK signaling in BRAF mutant CRC cells and markedly improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings support evaluation of combined RAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAF mutant CRC patients.;BRAF valine 600 (V600) mutations occur in 10% to 15% of colorectal cancers, yet these tumors show a surprisingly low clinical response rate (~5%) to selective RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, which have produced dramatic response rates (60%–80%) in melanomas harboring the identical BRAF V600 mutation.

Combination             therapies with EGFR and HER2-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered             a potential therapeutic option for esophageal cancer. We evaluated the antitumor             effects of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits             EGFR and HER2, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer             cells. The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib, 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu             was measured by MTT assay and the combination index (CI) values were calculated.             Additionally, cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with             5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide             stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with             either agent alone or in combination. The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways             were monitored by western blotting. The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically             inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on             esophageal cancer cells. The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated             with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western             blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced             the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and inhibited the activation of downstream             signaling molecules, such as AKT and ERK. A significant G1 arrest was also observed             in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib, however, combination             with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest. These results indicate that the combination             of the lapatinib and 5-Fu is a promising treatment option for esophageal carcinoma             with HER2 amplification.",

        "Doc_abstract":"De-regulation of the wingless and integration site growth factor (WNT) signaling pathway via mutations in APC and Axin, proteins that target beta-catenin for destruction, have been linked to various types of human cancer. These genetic alterations rarely, if ever, are observed in breast tumors. However, various lines of evidence suggest that WNT signaling may also be de-regulated in breast cancer. Most breast tumors show hypermethylation of the promoter region of secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1), a negative WNT pathway regulator, leading to downregulation of its expression. As a consequence, WNT signaling is enhanced and may contribute to proliferation of human breast tumor cells. We previously demonstrated that, in addition to the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway, WNT signaling activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway in mouse mammary epithelial cells via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation.;Using the WNT modulator sFRP1 and short interfering RNA-mediated Dishevelled (DVL) knockdown, we interfered with autocrine WNT signaling at the ligand-receptor level. The impact on proliferation was measured by cell counting, YOPRO, and the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay; beta-catenin, EGFR, ERK1/2 activation, and PARP (poly [ADP-ribose]polymerase) cleavages were assessed by Western blotting after treatment of human breast cancer cell lines with conditioned media, purified proteins, small-molecule inhibitors, or blocking antibodies.;Phospho-DVL and stabilized beta-catenin are present in many breast tumor cell lines, indicating autocrine WNT signaling activity. Interfering with this loop decreases active beta-catenin levels, lowers ERK1/2 activity, blocks proliferation, and induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231, BT474, SkBr3, JIMT-1, and MCF-7 cells. The effects of WNT signaling are mediated partly by EGFR transactivation in human breast cancer cells in a metalloprotease- and Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, Wnt1 rescues estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells from the anti-proliferative effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) and this activity can be blocked by an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.;Our data show that interference with autocrine WNT signaling in human breast cancer reduces proliferation and survival of human breast cancer cells and rescues ER+ tumor cells from 4-HT by activation of the canonical WNT pathway and EGFR transactivation. These findings suggest that interference with WNT signaling at the ligand-receptor level in combination with other targeted therapies may improve the efficiency of breast cancer treatments.",

By contrast, the addition of anti-EGFR therapy to the treatment regime of resistant patients may lead to worse progression-free survival and overall survival. Therefore, identifying sensitive and resistant patients prior to targeted therapy of metastatic colorecal cancer is a key point during the initial decision making process. Previous research shows that primary resistance to EGFR blockade is in most cases caused by constitutive activation of signaling pathways downstream of EGFR. Of all relevant factors (mutation of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressors PTEN and TP53, amplification of EGFR and HER2, and expression of epiregulin and amphiregulin, mikroRNA miR-31-3p, and miR-31-5p), only evaluation of KRAS and NRAS mutations has entered routine clinical practice. The role of the other markers still needs to be validated. The ongoing benefit of anti-EGFR therapy could be indicated by specific clinical parameters measured after the initiation of targeted therapy, including early tumor shrinkage, the deepness of the response, or hypomagnesemia. The accuracy of predictive dia-gnostic tools could be also increased by examining a combination of predictive markers using next generation sequencing methods. However, unjustified investigation of many molecular markers should be resisted as this may complicate interpretation of the results, particularly in terms of their specific clinical relevance.;The aim of this review is to describe current possibilities with respect to predicting responses to EGFR blockade in the context of the EGFR pathway, and the utilization of such results in routine clinical practice.",

Vandetanib has demonstrated enhanced efficacy in combination with radiation therapy (RT) in human tumor models. This study aimed to evaluate the schedule-dependent interaction of clinically relevant dosing of vandetanib with RT in human head and neck cancer models that had been characterized as EGFR positive (EGFR+) or negative (EGFR-) in order to begin differentiating vandetanib and RT interactions at the level of antitumor (EGFR) or antivascular (VEGFR2) activities.;The human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines UMSCC2 (EGFR+) and UMSCC10 (EGFR(-)) are sensitive and resistant to EGFR inhibitors, respectively, while having similar sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Nude mice with UMSCC2 or UMSCC10 tumor xenografts were treated with vandetanib or RT alone, or with combinations of concomitant and sequential therapy. Vandetanib was dosed at 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) based on pharmacokinetic studies in nude mice showing that this dose results in drug exposure similar to that seen in humans at clinical doses. RT was dosed at 3 Gy twice a week for two consecutive weeks for a total dose of 12 Gy.;Vandetanib alone caused regression in EGFR+ but not EGFR- tumors and RT therapy alone was similar in both tumor types. Combinations of vandetanib and RT showed concomitant use of vandetanib and RT was superior to RT followed by vandetanib or visa versa in EGFR- tumors. Therapeutic response of EGFR+ tumors was similar regardless of treatment sequencing.;The combination of vandetanib and RT is active in both EGFR+ and EGFR- HNSCC tumor xenografts, however, vandetanib alone is only active in EGFR+ xenografts. EGFR+ tumor response to vandetanib and RT was independent of treatment sequencing, but concomitant treatment was superior to sequencing in EGFR- tumors. These results suggest that the anti-VEGFR2 antitumor activity of vandetanib is enhanced by RT as presumably the activity seen in EGFR- tumors is due to antiangiogenic activity, whereas the anti-EGFR antitumor activity dominates in EGFR+ tumors such that RT enhancement is not observed.",

However, direct head-to-head comparison between them is still lacking. We performed indirect comparisons to assess the treatment effects of EGFR-TKIs added to chemotherapy versus EGFR-TKIs alone via common comparator of standard chemotherapy in both subgroups. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken. Finally, 12 randomized controlled trials enrolling more than 2,160 patients with EGFR mutation analysis met the inclusion criteria. We found that EGFR-TKIs combined with chemotherapy did confer an additive PFS advantage over standard chemotherapy both for patients with mutant EGFR tumors (HR 0.54, 95 % CI [0.30, 0.95], P = 0.03) and for patients with wild-type EGFR tumors (HR 0.82, [0.68, 0.98], P = 0.03), but no survival difference between the treatments in both subgroups. When using standard chemotherapy as common comparator, indirect comparison indicated that addition of chemotherapy to EGFR-TKIs did confer an additive PFS benefit (HR 0.38, [0.32, 0.46], P < 0.001) and survival benefit (HR 0.75, [0.66, 0.85], P < 0.001) over EGFR-TKIs alone in patients with wild-type EGFR, but showed a PFS disadvantage (HR 1.35, [1.03, 1.77], P = 0.03) and a marginal trend toward survival disadvantage (HR 1.16, [0.99, 1.35], P = 0.06) compared with EGFR-TKIs alone in patients with mutant EGFR tumors.

Tobacco carcinogens cause cellular damage in large areas of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa and contribute to distinct molecular changes, such as increasing levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), during carcinogenesis. P-Glycoprotein (P-GP) is a multidrug-resistance transporter protein capable of extruding not only cytotoxic drugs, but also certain tobacco-related carcinogens. EGFR plays a major role in the transcriptional and functional regulation of P-GP and previous studies in our laboratory showed that stimulation of EGFR protection protected oropharyngeal cells from a carcinogen that is substrate of P-GP. Therefore, we evaluated expression levels of EGFR and P-GP and looked for a possible association with the smoking status of patients.;Tissue cultures of healthy oropharyngeal mucosa were produced from 30 patients undergoing surgery at our Department. Expression levels of EGFR on P-GP were determined by immunohistochemical staining. To evaluate possible influences of EGFR on P-GP expression, we stimulated the receptor using transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) for 24, 48 and 72 h.;Current and former smokers had significantly higher EGFR/P-GP levels than never smokers. While EGFR expression was detected in almost all samples, P-GP expression was largely restricted to former and current smokers. TGF-α had no detectable effect on EGFR/P-GP levels.;These results show an association between tobacco use and levels of both proteins. Since both these proteins are involved in drug resistance of head and neck cancer, this study might help to further understand the differences in response to therapy and prognosis of tobacco-related and -unrelated cancer.",

The histologic-molecular classification showed higher sensitivity for identification of RA-GCs and predicted patient prognosis better than the putative molecular classification. In conclusion, RA-GCs show unique clinicopathologic features.

We therefore evaluated the feasibility of combined vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) targeting with radiation therapy in an orthotopic model that closely recapitulates the clinical presentation of human lung cancer.;Effects of irradiation and/or ZD6474, a small-molecule inhibitor of VEGFR2 and EGFR tyrosine kinases, were studied in vitro for human lung adenocarcinoma cells by using proliferation and clonogenic assays. The feasibility of combining ZD6474 with radiation therapy was then evaluated in an orthotopic model of human lung adenocarcinoma. Lung tumor burden and spread within the thorax were assessed, and tumor and adjacent tissues were analyzed by means of immunohistochemical staining for multiple parameters, including CD31, VEGF, VEGFR2, EGF, EGFR, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9, and basic fibroblast growth factor.;ZD6474 enhanced the radioresponse of NCI-H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells by a factor of 1.37 and markedly inhibited sublethal damage repair. In vivo, the combined blockade of VEGFR2 and EGFR by ZD6474 blocked pleural effusion formation and angiogenesis and enhanced the antivascular and antitumor effects of radiation therapy in the orthotopic human lung cancer model and was superior to chemoradiotherapy.;When radiation therapy is combined with VEGFR2 and EGFR blockade, significant enhancement of antiangiogenic, antivascular, and antitumor effects are seen in an orthotopic model of lung cancer.

We report that inflammatory cytokines and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation respectively induce transient or sustained phosphorylation of EGFR. Subsequently, EGFR internalizes via a Clathrin-mediated process. In cytokine-stimulated cells, EGFR recycles back to the cell surface, whereas in irradiated cells it arrests in Rab5-containing endosomes. Under both conditions, receptor internalization is instigated by the p38 stress-induced kinase. The underlying mechanism entails phosphorylation of EGFR at a short segment (amino acids 1002-1022) containing multiple serines and threonines, as well as phosphorylation of two Rab5 effectors, EEA1 and GDI. Like UV irradiation, a chemotherapeutic agent activates p38 and accelerates receptor internalization. We demonstrate that abrogating EGFR internalization reduces the efficacy of chemotherapy-induced cell death. Hence, by preventing EGFR-mediated survival signaling, the internalization route we uncovered enhances the cytotoxic effect of drugs like cis-platinum, which may underlie interactions between chemotherapy and EGFR-targeting drugs.",

In the present study, Derlin-1 expression was examined in lung cancer cell lines and human tissues. Derlin-1 overexpression correlated with pTNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival. siRNA knockdown of Derlin-1 impaired anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell growth and invasion in A549 and H1299 cell lines, and its overexpression promoted proliferation and invasion in HBE and LTE cell lines. Derlin-1 depletion decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 at both protein and mRNA levels, with decreased MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/ERK phosphorylation. Derlin-1 overexpression up-regulated MMP-2/9 expression and ERK phosphorylation, which could be reversed by MAP kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, PD98059. The effect of Derlin-1 on MMP-2/9 up-regulation was abolished in ERK1/2 siRNA-treated cells. Further analysis showed that Derlin-1 overexpression induced EGFR phosphorylation. EGFR inhibitor blocked Derlin-1-mediated up-regulation of EGFR and ERK phosphorylation. MMP-2/9 and p-ERK up-regulation by Derlin-1 was partly blocked in EGFR-depleted cells with siRNA treatment. Immunoprecipitation confirmed the association between Derlin-1 and EGFR.

This endocytosis lacks many of the characteristics of ligand-induced EGFR endocytosis. We compared the two types of endocytosis with regard to the requirements for proteins in the internalization machinery. Both types of endocytosis require clathrin, but while epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EGFR internalization also required Grb2, p38 MAPK-induced internalization did not. Interestingly, AP-2 knock down blocked p38 MAPK-induced EGFR internalization, but only mildly affected EGF-induced internalization. In line with this, simultaneously mutating two AP-2 interaction sites in EGFR affected p38 MAPK-induced internalization much more than EGF-induced EGFR internalization.

Expression levels of the following target genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α).;TP, DPD, EGFR, and HIF1α gene expression levels were significantly higher in deep sections than in surface sections. TP, EGFR, VEGF, and HIF1α gene expression levels were significantly higher in lymph node metastases than in surface sections. TP, DPD, EGFR, VEGF, and HIF1α gene expression levels were positively correlated with the specific samples harvested from the tumors.;Our results show that the expression levels of some genes in tumor cells can change in specific sites of tumors and can become higher in association with tumor progression.",

In this study, we aimed to clarify its clinical significance as a biomarker for lung cancer. In 112 patients with lung tumor and 80 individuals without cancer, we measured serum hTERT mRNA and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA levels, using a quantitative one-step real-time RT-PCR assay. We examined its sensitivity and specificity in lung cancer diagnosis, its clinical significance in comparison with other tumor markers, and its correlation with the clinical parameters using multivariate analyses and correlation relative tests. The copy number of serum hTERT mRNA was independently correlated with tumor size, tumor number, presence of metastasis and recurrence, and smoking (all P < 0.05). EGFR mRNA correlated with tumor number and clinical stage (both P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity in lung cancer diagnosis were 89.0% and 72.7% for hTERT mRNA, and 71.3% and 80.0% for EGFR mRNA, respectively. hTERT mRNA was superior to other tumor markers in lung cancer diagnosis. For both mRNAs, serum levels were significantly correlated with levels in lung cancer tissues (both P < 0.05). The copy number of hTERT mRNA significantly decreased after the surgical treatment. The data suggest that hTERT mRNA, especially when combined with EGFR mRNA, is a novel and excellent biomarker for pulmonary malignancies to diagnose and assess the clinical stage.",
