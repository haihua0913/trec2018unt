Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene at the kinase domain have been found in lung cancer patients. These mutations are correlated with clinical response to targeted molecular therapy. Although Caucasian lung cancer patients have been shown to harbor Braf and erbB2 mutations, only a few reports exist concerning Braf and erbB2 mutations in Japanese lung cancer patients. We investigated the Braf and erbB2 mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing. The study included 305 surgically removed lung cancer samples from the Nagoya City University Hospital, which were EGFR and Kras wild-type centric. Six Braf mutations were found in the adenocarcinoma cases. Among the adenocarcinoma cases, Braf mutations were more frequently noted in heavy smokers (Brinkman index >400, p=0.0476). We also detected five erbB2 mutations all in the non-smokers. All of these mutations existed exclusively. The erbB2 gene mutations were predominantly found in non-smokers with adenocarcinomas. However, the completely exclusive mutation status could help us design individually tailored targeted molecular therapy for lung cancer.",

It has been reported that somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR or ERBB2 genes occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer. We searched for mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to determine the prevalence of these mutations in Korean lung cancer patients. In addition, we examined the relationship between the mutations and clinicopathologic features of lung cancers. Mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing in 115 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers. EGFR mutations were present in 20 patients (17.4%). The EGFR mutations were found only in adenocarcinomas (20 of 55 adenocarcinomas, 36.4%). The ERBB2 mutation was found in 1 adenocarcinoma of the 115 NSCLCs (0.9% overall; 1.8% of the 55 adenocarcinomas). KRAS mutations were found in 6 (5.2%) of the 115 NSCLCs (2 of 60 squamous cell carcinomas, or 3.3%, and 4 of 55 adenocarcinomas, or 7.3%). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.02) and in never-smokers (P = 0.004). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were not associated with pathologic stage in never-smokers, but were more frequent in pathologic stage II-IV than in stage I in ever-smokers (P = 0.01). Of the 55 adenocarcinomas, 25 (45.5%) had mutations of one or another of the three genes; EGFR mutations were never found in adenocarcinomas together with ERBB2 or KRAS mutations. These findings suggest that the EGFR mutation is frequent in Korean lung cancer patients, and that the ERBB2 mutation is rare. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EGFR mutations in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma among smokers.",

The heterogeneous expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in cancers supports tumor signaling robustness and plays a significant role in resistance to targeted inhibition. Recent studies have revealed interactions between the MET receptor and the ERBB receptor family in the therapeutic resistance of several cancers. In this study, the relationship between MET expression/activity and the expression/activity of the ERBB receptor family in human breast cancer was interrogated. Importantly, a significant percentage of ERBB2(+) tumors coexpressing MET and ERBB2 were observed and displayed significant heterogeneity with subpopulations of cells that are MET(-)/ERBB2(+), MET(+)/ERBB2(-), and MET(+)/ERBB2(+). In a MET(+)/ERBB2(+) breast cancer cell line, MET depletion resulted in increased ERBB2 activation, and conversely, ERBB2 depletion resulted in increased MET activation. Neither EGFR nor ERBB3 compensated for MET or ERBB2 knockdown. The loss of either MET or ERBB2 led to a decrease in PI3K/AKT signaling and increased dependency on MAPK. These data show that a subset of ERBB2(+) breast cancers express MET and contain MET(+)/ERBB2(+) subpopulations. Moreover, analysis of RTK activation during ERBB2 knockdown indicated that MET signaling is a compensatory pathway of resistance.;ERBB2(+) breast cancers with MET(+)/ERBB2(+) subpopulations may have an innate resistance to ERBB2 inhibition and may benefit from combined MET and ERBB2 inhibition.",

These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known.;We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002.;Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations.

It is well known that ErbB2 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) plays an important part in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ErbB2 action needs to be well studied. In this report, we discovered that the decreased expression levels of miR-34a were inversely correlated with the increased ErbB2 levels in breast cancer. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between ErbB2 and miR-34a. Over-expression of miR-34a reduces ErbB2 expression and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion and growth in vitro. What's more, reduced expression of ErbB2 inhibits breast Cancer cell proliferation and re-expression of ErbB2 reversed miR-34a-dependent tumor suppression. Meanwhile, miR-34a levels were correlated inversely with breast cancer malignancy. Our study demonstrates that miR-34a, like ErbB2, might be a diagnostic target in breast cancer.",

In addition to p185(ErbB2), truncated forms of ErbB2 exist in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumors. The contribution of these truncated forms, specifically those expressed in tumor cell nuclei, to the development of therapeutic resistance to ErbB2 TKIs has not been previously shown. Here, we show that expression of a 95-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated form of ErbB2, herein referred to as p95L (lapatinib-induced p95) was increased in ErbB2(+) breast cancer cells treated with potent ErbB2 TKIs (lapatinib, GW2974). Expressed in tumor cell nuclei, tyrosine phosphorylation of p95L was resistant to inhibition by ErbB2 TKIs. Furthermore, the expression of p95L was increased in ErbB2(+) breast cancer models of acquired therapeutic resistance to lapatinib that mimic the clinical setting. Pretreatment with proteasome inhibitors blocked p95L induction in response to ErbB2 TKIs, implicating the role of the proteasome in the regulation of p95L expression. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of ErbB2, generated by alternate initiation of translation and similar in molecular weight to p95L, were expressed in tumor cell nuclei, where they too were resistant to inhibition by ErbB2 TKIs. When expressed in the nuclei of lapatinib-sensitive ErbB2(+) breast cancer cells, truncated ErbB2 rendered cells resistant to lapatinib-induced apoptosis. Elucidating the function of nuclear, truncated forms of ErbB2, and developing therapeutic strategies to block their expression and/or activation may enhance the clinical efficacy of ErbB2 TKIs.",

Breast epithelial cells exogenously overexpressed with erbB2 decreased the expression of miR-205, whereas increased the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). The decreased expression of miR-205 slightly increased by the transfection of erbB2 siRNA into the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer epithelial cells. Overexpression of erbB2 enabled breast epithelial cells to grow anchorage-independently in soft agar, and the transfection of the precursor of miR-205 into the cells leaded to the decrease in the ability to grow in soft agar.

Depletion of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 leads to internalization and degradation of ErbB2. Furthermore, flotillin-1 and -2 were found to be in a molecular complex with ErbB2 and Hsp90. The depletion of one of these proteins results in disruption of this complex, followed by destabilization of ErbB2 at the membrane, and its internalization and degradation.

Strikingly, existing ErbB2 immunity correlated significantly with elevated shed ErbB2 ectodomain among the patients analyzed. Incidence of both ErbB2 immunity and elevated ErbB2 extracellular domain increased with a progressed disease stage and was significantly associated with metastatic breast cancer. These observations implicate soluble ErbB2 amounts in vivo in the development of ErbB2 immunity in breast cancer.

A new paradigm of targeted therapies holds the most promise for the future, making identification of tumor-specific therapeutic targets of prime importance. ERBB2/HER2, best known for its role in breast cancer tumorigenesis, can be targeted by two types of pharmacological manipulation: antibody therapy against the extracellular receptor domain and small molecule compounds against the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Aberrant activation of ERBB2 by gene amplification has been shown to participate in the pathophysiology of breast, ovarian, gastric, colorectal, lung, brain, and head and neck tumors. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled efficient identification of activating molecular alterations of ERBB2. In this review, we will focus on the functional role of these somatic mutations that cause ERBB2 receptor activation.

The molecular processes leading to the activation of ErbB2 in tumors and cardiac cells are, however, fundamentally different from each other. Thus, it must be feasible to design drugs that specifically target either physiological or malignant ErbB2 signaling, to activate ErbB2 signaling in heart failure with no increased risk for cancer, and to inhibit ErbB2 signaling in cancer with no increased risk for heart failure. In this review, we present a state-of-the-art on how ErbB2 is regulated in physiological conditions and in tumor cells and how this knowledge translates into smart drug design. This leads to a new generation of drugs interfering with ErbB2 in a unique way tailored for a specific clinical goal.

ErbB2 has been identified as a useful receptor for molecular targeting. A cyclic 20 amino acid phage display random peptide library was constructed using the fUSE5 gene III system. The library was panned against 2 different purified forms of the external domain of ErbB2. This resulted in the identification of several ErbB2-binding phage clones with variable binding to different ErbB2 preparations. One clone (EC-1) bound all preparations of ErbB2 including live cells and fresh frozen human breast cancer specimens. The synthetic peptide based on the deduced sequence of the EC-1 clone and its biotin-conjugated form retained binding affinity for purified ErbB2 and ErbB2 overexpressing cell lysates. EC-1 peptide was able to effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of ErbB2 on residues Y1248 and Y877 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, EC-1 peptide selectively inhibits the proliferation of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. The linear portion of the cyclic EC-1 peptide was shown to be essential for binding ErbB2. In addition, 4 biased phage libraries were constructed allowing 4 different regions of the EC-1 peptide to have random sequence. Screening these EC-1 biased libraries did not result in higher affinity peptides but did demonstrate the importance of amino acids at position 1-4 on the N-terminal flanking arm and 11-15 within the cyclic ring. Interestingly, EC-1 contains homologous motifs with known ErbB receptor family ligands. We have identified a small peptide that binds to the extracellular domain of ErbB2, inhibits ErbB2 autophosphorylation and inhibits the proliferation of ErbB2 overexpressing cells. This supports the notion that small peptides can bind to targets important in cancer therapy even if a target does not have a natural ligand. Continuing research with this peptide includes increasing its affinity to ErbB2, evaluation of pharmacokinetics and evaluation of anti-proliferative effects with conjugate anti-cancer agents.",

However, it is not clear whether ErbB2 overexpression renders the cells more resistant to specific anti-cancer drugs or renders the cells more resistant to a broad range of anti-cancer drugs. It is not clear how the function of ErbB2 in drug resistance is related to expression and activation of the other ErbB receptors. In this communication, we showed that several breast cancer cell lines including BT20, BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, and SKBR-3 cells had a similar pattern of resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer drugs including 5-Fluorouracil, Cytoxan, Doxorubincin, Taxol, and Vinorelbin, suggesting a mechanism of multidrug resistance. High expression of P-glycoprotein and the ErbB receptors contribute to drug resistance of these breast cancer cells; however, overexpression of ErbB2 alone is not a major factor in determining drug resistance. To further determine the role of the ErbB receptors in drug resistance, we selected various NIH 3T3 cell lines that specifically expressed EGF receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, ErbB3, EGFR/ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB3, or ErbB2/ErbB3. A cytotoxicity assay showed that expression of ErbB2 alone did not significantly enhance drug resistance, whereas coexpression of either EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 significantly enhanced drug resistance. Moreover, ErbB2 was highly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3 cells that coexpress ErbB2 with either EGFR or ErbB3, but not in NIH 3T3 cells that express ErbB2 alone. Together, our results suggest that coexpression of EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 induces high phosphorylation of ErbB2 and renders the cells more resistant to various anti-cancer drugs.",

We demonstrate that p130Cas is necessary for ErbB2-dependent foci formation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo growth of orthotopic N202-1A tumors. Moreover, intranipple injection of p130Cas-stabilized siRNAs in the mammary gland of Balbc-NeuT mice decreases the growth of spontaneous tumors. In ErbB2-transformed cells, p130Cas is a crucial component of a functional molecular complex consisting of ErbB2, c-Src, and Fak. In human mammary cells, MCF10A.B2, the concomitant activation of ErbB2, and p130Cas overexpression sustain and strengthen signaling, leading to Rac1 activation and MMP9 secretion, thus providing invasive properties.

In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity.

Promoter footprinting with nuclear extracts reveals an intense Ets hypersensitivity site at the EBS whose degree of intensity correlates with the level of cellular ErbB2 expression. In vitro mapping assays show that the supercoiled erbB2 promoter forms an internal triplex structure (Hr-DNA) at the mirror-repeat element. Mutations preventing Hr-DNA formation can enhance erbB2 promoter activity in human breast cancer cells, a result consistent with previous demonstration that Ets-erbB2 promoter complexes cannot form when the mirror-repeat is engaged in triplex binding, and new results suggesting that Ets binding induces severe promoter bending that may restrict local triplex formation. In addition to previously described erbB2-regulating breast cancer Ets factors (PEA3, ESX/Elf-3), Elf-1 is now shown to be another endogenously expressed Ets candidate capable of binding to and upregulating the erbB2 promoter.

As an alternative strategy, anti-erbB2 single-chain immunoglobulin (sFv) genes were constructed to direct expression of intracellular anti-erbB2 antibodies. Expression of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form of the anti-erbB2 sFv resulted in a profound down-regulation of cell surface erbB2 in an erbB2 overexpressing ovarian carcinoma cell line. In addition, expression of the intracellular antibody resulted in marked inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Whereas stable transfectants expressing the anti-erbB2 sFv could be dervied from non-erbB2 overexpressing cancer cell lines, expression of the intracellular antibody was incompatible with long-term survival of the erbB2 overpressing tumor cells.

This is largely due to a lack of understanding of the molecular pathways that are responsible for the aggressive forms of prostate cancers, the castrate-resistant prostate cancer and the metastatic prostate cancer. Cell signaling pathways activated by the ERBB2 oncogene or the RAS oncogene are frequently found to be altered in metastatic prostate cancers. To evaluate and define the role of the ERBB2/RAS pathway in prostate cancer metastasis, we have evaluated the impact of ERBB2- or RAS-overexpression on the metastatic potentials for four prostate cancer cell lines derived from tumors with different androgen sensitivities. To do so, we transfected the human DU145, LnCaP, and PC3 prostate cancer cells and the murine Myc-CaP prostate cancer cells with the activated form of ERBB2 or H-RAS and assessed their metastatic potentials by three complementary assays, a wound healing assay, a transwell motility assay, and a transwell invasion assay. We showed that while overexpression of ERBB2 increased the metastatic potential of the androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells (i.e. PC3 and DU145), it did not affect metastatic potentials of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells (i.e. LnCaP and Myc-CaP). In contrast, overexpression of H-RAS only increased the cell motility of Myc-CaP cells, which overexpress the human c-MYC oncogene. Our data suggest that ERBB2 collaborates with androgen signaling to promote prostate cancer metastasis, and that although RAS is one of the critical downstream effectors of ERBB2, it does not phenocopy ERBB2 for its impact on the metastatic potentials of prostate cancer cell lines.

The purpose of our studies was to investigate amplification of the erbB2 gene, the levels of erbB2 m-RNA and the erbB2 product (p185) in ovarian cancer, and the correlation between these findings and the pathological and clinical features.;Amplification of the erbB2 gene was investigated by Southern blot analysis in 75 samples from 62 patients; mRNA levels were evaluated by Northern blot analysis in 58 samples from 48 patients; and p185 was determined by immunohistochemistry in 65 samples from 65 patients. The erbB2 gene was amplified in only one case (1.6%), and a marked increase in erbB2 mRNA was found only in the same case. Staining for p185 was positive in 12 cases (18.5%). The staining was always confined to the cytoplasm except in the case that showed amplification of erbB2 in which p185 was localized in the membrane. No correlation was found between p185 positivity and pathological and clinical features or response to chemotherapy. Western blot analysis showed that the molecular weight of p185 in positive ovarian cancer cells was approximately 10 KDa lower than in breast cancer.;In contrast to breast cancer, in ovarian cancer the amplification of erbB2 appears infrequent. The levels of p185 detected by immunohistochemistry were not related to the amplification of the gene or to the increase in mRNA, suggesting the possibility of a longer half-life of the protein in the positive cases. The finding that erbB2 product in ovarian cancer is mostly localised in cytoplasm and not in the membrane as in breast cancer and that it has a lower molecular weight than the p185 in breast cancer suggest that this oncogene plays a different biological role in these two neoplasms.",

Growing evidence suggests interplay between ErbB2 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling. For example, ErbB2 inhibitors can block IGF-induced signaling while, conversely, IGF1R inhibitors can inhibit ErbB2 action. ErbB receptors can bind and phosphorylate insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and this may be critical for ErbB-mediated anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer. Herein, we examined crosstalk between ErbB2 and IRSs using cancer cell lines and transgenic mouse models.;MMTV-ErbB2 and MMTV-IRS2 transgenic mice were crossed to create hemizygous MMTV-ErbB2/MMTV-IRS2 bigenic mice. Signaling crosstalk between ErbB2 and IRSs was examined in vitro by knockdown or overexpression followed by western blot analysis for downstream signaling intermediates and growth assays.;A cross between MMTV-ErbB2 and MMTV-IRS2 mice demonstrated no enhancement of ErbB2 mediated mammary tumorigenesis or metastasis by elevated IRS2. Substantiating this, overexpression or knockdown of IRS1 or IRS2 in MMTV-ErbB2 mammary cancer cell lines had little effect upon ErbB2 signaling. Similar results were obtained in human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and breast cancer cell lines.;Despite previous evidence suggesting that ErbB receptors can bind and activate IRSs, our findings indicate that ErbB2 does not cooperate with the IRS pathway in these models to promote mammary tumorigenesis.",

Analysis of paired breast cancer and blood samples from informative (G1170C heterozygotic) ERBB2-positive (n = 12) and ERBB2-negative (n = 17) cases not only confirmed monoallelic amplification and ERBB2 transcriptional overexpression but also revealed that most low ERBB2 expressing breast cancers (12/17) exhibit unbalanced allelic transcription, showing 3-fold to nearly 5,000-fold preferential expression from one of two inherited alleles. To explore cis-acting transcriptional mechanisms potentially selected during ERBB2 amplification, levels of four different ERBB2 transcript variants (5.2, 4.7, 2.1, and 1.4 kb) were correlated with total (4.6 kb) ERBB2 mRNA levels in ERBB2-positive (n = 14) versus ERBB2-negative (n = 43) primary breast cancers. Relative expression of only the 2.1 kb extracellular domain-encoding splice variant and a 4.7 kb mRNA variant that uses an alternative start site were significantly increased in association with ERBB2-positivity, implicating altered promoter usage and selective transcript regulation within the ERBB2 amplicon. Altogether, these findings provide new mechanistic insights into the development of ERBB2-positive breast cancer and strong rationale for delineating candidate cis-acting regulatory elements that may link allele-specific ERBB2 transcription in premalignant breast epithelia with subsequent development of breast cancers bearing monoallelic ERBB2 amplicons.",

It has been suggested that overexpression and even amplification of ERBB2 may play a role in the development of prostate cancer. Here, we have analyzed gene copy number and expression of the ERBB2 gene in both androgen-dependent primary and metastatic tumors, as well as recurrent hormone-refractory tumors. The expression levels were compared to the expression of ERBB2 in breast cancers with or without ERBB2 gene amplification. Of 126 prostate tumors, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) revealed only 1 case containing borderline (six to eight copies) amplifications of ERBB2. This hormone-refractory tumor, however, did not express ERBB2 protein. Immunohistochemical staining of ERBB2 protein was negative (0 or 1+ intensity) in all prostate samples (n = 124) analyzed. To quantitate the level of ERBB2 mRNA expression in prostate tumors (n = 34) and cell lines (n = 3), as well as in breast tumors (n = 30) and cell lines (n = 16), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler) methodology was used. The expression level was similar in all prostate tumor types and corresponded to the level of expression in breast carcinomas without ERBB2 amplification. Breast tumors with ERBB2 amplification expressed, on average, approximately 20 times (P < 0.001) higher mRNA levels than prostate tumors or breast carcinomas without the gene amplification. In conclusion, the expression of ERBB2 in prostate cancer is relatively low, and is not altered during disease progression. Thus, it is unlikely that treatment modalities relying on the overexpression of ERBB2 gene will be useful in treating prostate cancer.",

They have all been implicated in cell transformation and tumor pathogenesis, but very little is known about the role of erbB3 in normal colon and colorectal cancer. Therefore, in the current study, we determined whether erbB3 is found in normal human colon and whether its expression is altered in colorectal cancer. Because of some evidence that erbB3 might interact with erbB2 and EGFR, respectively, by heterodimerization, we also included erbB2 and EGFR analysis with special regard to coexpression. The study was performed on 35 patients operated on for colorectal carcinoma. The normal human colon showed weak erbB3 and erbB2 immunostaining, predominantly in surface epithelial cells. EGFR immunoreactivity in normal colon varied from weak to strong. In contrast, in 31 of 35 (89%) and in 29 of 35 (83%) colonic cancers, moderate to strong immunoreactivity for erbB3 and erbB2, respectively, was present in most epithelial cancer cells. A concomitant erbB3 and erbB2 immunostaining advantage could be found in 77% of cancerous tissues in comparison with the normal colon. No difference in EGFR immunostaining was evident between normal colon and cancer. Northern blot analysis showed an increase in erbB3 and erbB2 mRNA levels in 64% of cancers in comparison with normal colon samples. By densitometry, 2.3-fold and a 1.5-fold significant increases in erbB3 and erbB2 mRNA levels, respectively, were calculated in the cancerous tissues. Eighty-five percent of cancers with erbB3 mRNA overexpression showed an increase in erbB2 mRNA. Southern blot analysis did not indicate any gene amplification or rearrangement responsible for erbB2 or erbB3 overexpression. EGFR, however, was decreased in cancer on mRNA level. These findings indicate that erbB2 and erbB3, but not EGFR, may contribute to tumor growth and disease progression in colon cancer. The correlation between increased erbB2 and erbB3 expression in both Northern blots and immunohistochemical analysis suggests a co-overexpression of erbB2 and erbB3 and might support the hypothesis that these two growth factor receptors act together by heterodimer formation.",

Oxygen consumption and activities of complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were decreased in mtErbB2-overexpressing cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels were also decreased. In contrast, mtErbB2 enhanced cellular glycolysis.

Interestingly, cancer cells with higher levels of mtErbB2 were more resistant to the ErbB2-targeting antibody trastuzumab.

Several efficacious targeted therapies, including antibodies and kinase inhibitors, have been developed but the occurring of resistance to these agents is often observed. New therapeutic agents targeting the endocytic recycling and intracellular trafficking of membrane in tumor cells overexpressing ErbB2 are actually in clinical development. Nevertheless the mechanisms underlying ErbB2 downregulation are still obscure. We have previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the p130Cas adaptor protein in ErbB2 positive breast cancer, promotes tumor aggressiveness and progression. Here we demonstrate that lowering p130Cas expression in breast cancer cells is sufficient to induce ErbB2 degradation by autophagy. Conversely, p130Cas overexpression protects ErbB2 from degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, this autophagy-dependent preferential degradation of ErbB2 in absence of p130Cas is due to an increased ErbB2 ubiquitination. Indeed, the overexpression of p130Cas impairs ErbB2 ubiquitination by inhibiting the binding of Cbl and CHIP E3 ligases to ErbB2. Finally, our results indicate that p130Cas-dependent ErbB2 protection from degradation by autophagy may alter the sensitivity to the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab.

One of the most clinically important gene amplifications in human cancer causes extensive reduplication of ERBB2. A variety of cancers also occasionally harbor somatic mutations in ERBB2. Gene amplification and activating mutations both have predictive value for clinical response to targeted inhibitors. Since the number of gene copies in an amplicon may exceed 100, and since amplicons may encompass multiple genes, high-resolution analysis of gene amplifications poses considerable technical challenges. We have overcome this obstacle by using emulsion-based resequencing to determine the sequence of many independently-amplified individual DNA molecules in parallel. We used this high throughput sequencing technology to analyze ERBB2 mutational status in five ERBB2 amplified cell lines (four breast, one ovarian) and two breast tumors. Genomic DNA was isolated and the 28 exons of ERBB2 were independently amplified. Amplicons were then pooled at equimolar ratios, subjected to emulsion PCR (emPCR) and finally to picotiter plate pyrosequencing. High-quality sequence data were obtained for all amplicons analyzed and no activating mutations within ERBB2 were identified. Although we did not find activating mutations within the multiple copies of ERBB2 in these samples, the results establish the utility of this technology as a feasible and cost-effective approach for high resolution analysis of amplified genes.",

The deregulation is the consequence of an increased transcription level and gene amplification. Several laboratories, including our own, have identified, in the proximal promoter, enhancers implicated in the gene overexpression. However, our previous studies of a 6-kb ERBB2 promoter fragment revealed the presence of repressing fragments, which were able to overcome the effect of the proximal enhancers. These repressing elements were functional in all cell lines, regardless of their endogenous ERBB2 expression level. Here, we show that a distal ERBB2 promoter region restores high transcription rates specifically in ERBB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. This distal promoter region thus contains enhancers essential for the overexpression of the gene. By EMSA, performed with nuclear extract of cells overexpressing (BT-474) or not (MDA-MB-231) the ERBB2 gene, we show that at least two sequences of the distal promoter region are bound exclusively by BT-474 extract. Further experiments reveal that AP-2 transcription factors contribute to this differential binding activity, by binding recognition sequences located 4500 bp and 4000 bp upstream of the transcription start site. These sites are occupied by AP2 in vivo, as demonstrated by ChIP assay. Inactivation of AP-2 proteins in ERBB2 overexpressing cells reduces the distal promoter activity up to 70%, indicating the AP-2 factors are implicated in the strong distal enhancing effect. Moreover, we identified a 54-bp fragment that is bound specifically by BT-474 nuclear extract. Further experiments did not lead to the identification of the protein responsible for this binding. Our results thus highlight the importance of ERBB2 distal promoter region and further implicate AP-2 in ERBB2 overexpression in breast cancer cells.",

The efficacy of lapatinib as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, however, is limited by the development of therapeutic resistance that typically occurs within 12 months of starting therapy. In contrast to small molecule inhibitors targeting other receptor tyrosine kinases where resistance has been attributed to mutations within the targeted receptor, ErbB2 mutations have not been commonly found in breast tumors. Instead, acquired resistance to lapatinib seems to be mediated by redundant survival pathways that are activated as a consequence of marked inhibition of ErbB2 kinase activity. For example, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol3 kinase-Akt in lapatinib-treated cells leads to derepression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor that up-regulates estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, resulting in a switch in the regulation of survival factors (e.g., survivin) and cell survival from ErbB2 alone to ER and ErbB2 in resistant cells. In this review, we discuss the effects of lapatinib on signaling networks in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to elucidate potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and strategies to overcome or prevent its development.",

Pertuzumab, which binds to ErbB2 near the center of domain II, and trastuzumab, which binds to the juxtamembrane region of ErbB2 domain IV, directly interfere with domain II- and domain IV-mediated heterodimerization contacts, respectively. In this study, we report a novel anti-ErbB2 antibody, 3E10, which binds to an epitope in domain III that appears to be located opposite to the dimerization interfaces in domain II and domain IV of ErbB2. Our data show that the 3E10 antibody inhibits ErbB2 heterodimerization via a mechanism that strikingly differs from trastuzumab and pertuzumab. It could be speculated that the 3E10 antibody may affect ErbB2 heterodimerization by causing major conformational changes of ErbB2. Furthermore, 3E10 provides synergistic inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization and signaling in combination with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab. The combination of these three anti-ErbB2 antibodies that have complementary mechanisms of action appears to be an extremely potent ErbB2 heterodimerization blocker. Compared with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and 3E10 provides a more potent blockade of ErbB2 signaling. Consistent with this, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus 3E10 results in greater in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumor models, suggesting its potential use for treating ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer.

Here we report that ErbB2 induces invasion and migration of MCF10A cells though up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. We also observed a marked reduction of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and an induction of vimentin in ErbB2-MCF10A cells, suggesting that epithelial-mesenchymal transition may play a role in the ErbB2-induced invasion and migration of MCF10A cells. Overexpression of ErbB2 significantly activated p38 MAPK and Akt, while Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway was not activated by ErbB2. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we further show that p38 MAPK and Akt signaling pathways are crucial for the ErbB2-induced MMP-9 up-regulation, invasion and migration of MCF10A cells.

Many lines of evidence indicate that targeting ErbB1 and ErbB2 is an important cancer therapeutic approach.

Here, we show that hPEPD-G278D binds to ErbB1 with high affinity, initially activating ErbB1 but later silencing it, and that deletion of subdomain 2 in ErbB1 extracellular domain abolishes the binding. The proliferation of ErbB1-overexpressing cells is strongly inhibited by hPEPD-G278D, regardless of ErbB2 expression or cell type, whereas cells lacking ErbB1 and ErbB2 are insensitive to it. In contrast, EGF, another ErbB1 ligand, either stimulates or mildly inhibits cell proliferation. Moreover, hPEPD-G278D treatment of mice bearing ErbB1-overexpressing tumors leads to tumor regression, which is accompanied by down regulation and decreased phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 as well as decreased phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules and activation of apoptosis in the tumor tissues. We conclude that hPEPD-G278D is a dual inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and selectively targets cancer cells overexpressing ErbB1 and/or ErbB2.

There have been scattered studies reporting ERBB2 gene mutation, but nothing is currently known about the ERBB2 binding site mutations. In the current study, we examined the ERBB2 juxtamembrane domain trastuzumab binding site for mutations in invasive breast cancers overexpressing ERBB2. Pure tumor cells of 54 breast cancer patients were procured using laser capture microdissection. Two polymerase chain reaction primer pairs were designed to amplify the trastuzumab binding site sequence. The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced.

There were nine patients treated with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting, none of which had gene mutation. Therefore, we conclude that ERBB2 juxtamembrane domain (trastuzumab binding site) gene mutation is a rare event in breast cancer.

Knockdown of laminin-binding integrins (alpha6beta4, alpha3beta1) or associated tetraspanin protein CD151 reversed laminin-5 resistance and sensitized ErbB2+ cells to trastuzumab and lapatinib. CD151 knockdown, together with trastuzumab treatment, inhibited ErbB2 activation and downstream signaling through Akt, Erk1/2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Hence, ErbB2 function in mammary tumor cells is promoted by integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-5, with strong support by CD151, leading to signaling through FAK. Consequently, removal or inhibition of any of these components (laminin-5, integrin, CD151, FAK) markedly sensitizes cells to anti-ErbB2 agents.

Targeting WD repeat domain 5 (Wdr5), which is absolutely required for H3K4me3 enrichment, decreased ErbB2 overexpression, associated with a decrease in the H3K4me3 mark on the erbB2 promoter.

The purpose of this study was to (1) determine the frequency of ERBB2 amplification (in comparison to other proto-oncogenes) in tumors from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, (2) characterize structural details of an ERBB2 amplicon in the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE19 (contains a 100-fold ERBB2 amplification), and (3) test whether growth of the OE19 cell line is sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitor trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genetech, Inc, San Francisco, CA).;First, we determined the frequency, by Southern blotting techniques, of amplification of ERBB2 and 13 other proto-oncogenes in a panel of 25 esophageal adenocarcinoma tumors. Then, in a second panel of 10 tumor specimens, expression levels of the ERBB2 gene and of several other genes that flank ERBB2 on chromosome 17 were determined by microarray analysis. Next we characterized the ERBB2 amplicon in the esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE19 using cytogenetic methods and a Rec-A protein assisted restriction endonuclease mapping technique. Finally, an in vitro growth inhibition assay was used to measure the sensitivity of OE19 and OE33 cells to treatment with trastuzumab (humanized antibody to ERBB2).;ERBB2 was the most frequently amplified proto-oncogene among 25 esophageal adenocarcinoma tumors tested (greater than 10-fold amplification in 3 of 25 (12%) tumors tested). The OE19 cell line contains a 100-fold amplification of the ERBB2 gene, and highly expresses its messenger ribonucleic acid. Transcripts from genes that flank ERBB2 including GRB7, a protein linked to metastasis in esophageal cancer, also showed high levels of expression. In OE19 cells, the ERBB2 amplicon was localized to a homogeneously staining region of chromosome 14. Southern blots from the Rec-A protein assisted restriction endonuclease cleavage mapping experiments in OE19 showed a strong band of 210 kilobases in size, demonstrating that the main amplicon was a tandem repeat. In the in vitro growth inhibition assay, trastuzumab inhibited the OE19 and OE33 cells growth by 49% and 20%, respectively, at a saturating concentration of 20 microg/mL.;ERBB2 is the most frequently amplified proto-oncogene in esophageal adenocarcinoma among the genes that we tested. In the OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, the ERBB2 amplicon is translocated onto chromosome 14, is amplified 100-fold at the deoxyribonucleic acid level, and is highly overexpressed at the messenger ribonucleic acid level. Finally, the growth of this cell line was inhibited by incubation with trastuzumab. These results demonstrate that a substantial number of esophageal adenocarcinomas have amplified copies of the ERBB2 gene, and that they may be responsive to ERBB2 targeted therapies such as trastuzumab.",

In contrast to the epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2 is normally endocytosis resistant. However, ErbB2 can be down-regulated by inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, such as geldanamycin. We now show that geldanamycin induces endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of full-length ErbB2. We further report that the endocytosis of ErbB2 is dynamin and clathrin dependent. When ErbB2 was retained at the plasma membrane due to knockdown of clathrin heavy chain, the intracellular part of ErbB2 was degraded in a proteasomal manner. However, our data strongly suggest that proteasomal activity is not required for geldanamycin-induced endocytosis of ErbB2 in SKBr3 cells. Interestingly, however, proteasomal inhibitors retarded degradation of ErbB2, and electron microscopy analysis strongly suggested that proteasomal activity is required to sort internalized ErbB2 to lysosomes. Because geldanamycin derivatives and inhibitors of proteasomal activity are both used in experimental cancer treatment, knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in geldanamycin-induced down-regulation of ErbB2 is important for future design of cancer treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of ErbB2 and ErbB3 is found in several human cancers, and ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers are known as the most potent signaling units among ErbB dimers. While ErbB2 probably undergoes weak endocytosis, ErbB3 is readily internalized even in the absence of added ligand and without requirement for kinase activity. Overexpression of ErbB2 has been demonstrated to inhibit epidermal growth factor-induced internalization and degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor. This happens due to epidermal growth factor receptor-ErbB2 dimerization and can be counteracted by the anti-ErbB2 antibody pertuzumab, which binds the dimerization arm of ErbB2. Pertuzumab does also inhibit ErbB2-ErbB3 dimerization, but to what extent this has effect on constitutive and/or ligand-induced downregulation of ErbB3 is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of ErbB2 as such did not block constitutive internalization of ErbB3, but that heregulin-induced degradation of ErbB3 was significantly slowed in cells expressing high levels of ErbB2. Incubation with pertuzumab did, however, counteract this effect. This indicates that the formation of ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers inhibits downregulation of ErbB3 and supports the notion that pertuzumab inhibits ErbB2 dimerization. The inhibitory effect of pertuzumab on ligand-induced ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization was confirmed by the observation that pertuzumab inhibited heregulin-induced phosphorylation of ErbB3 in cells expressing ErbB2 and efficiently reduced heregulin-induced downstream signaling in cells expressing low levels of ErbB2. Altogether the results indicate that pertuzumab can be a valuable therapeutic agent not only in cancers overexpressing ErbB2 but also in cancers co-expressing ErbB2 and ErbB3.",

Human clinical data and our in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest potent oncogenic cooperation between mutant p53 and Her2 (ErbB2). Yet, the translational significance of mutant p53 in Her2 positive breast cancer, especially with respect to Her2-targeted therapies, has not been evaluated. Our previous work identified novel oncogenic activity of mutant p53 whereby mutp53 amplifies ErbB2 signaling via the mutp53-HSF1-ErbB2 feed-forward loop. Here we report that pharmacological interception of this circuit by ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib downregulates mutant p53 in vitro and in vivo. We found that ErbB2 inhibition by lapatinib inhibits transcription factor HSF1, and its target Hsp90, followed by mutant p53 degradation in MDM2 dependent manner. Thus, our data suggest that mutant p53 sensitizes cancer cells to lapatinib via two complementary mechanisms: mutant p53 mediated amplification of ErbB2 signaling, and simultaneous annihilation of both potent oncogenic drivers, ErbB2 and mutant p53. Hence, our study could provide valuable information for the optimization of therapeutic protocols to achieve superior clinical effects in the treatment of Her2 positive breast cancer.",

BK5.erbB2 transgenic mice in which erbB2 is overexpressed and activated in the biliary epithelia develop adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder at a high incidence. Although it has been reported that erbB2 plays an important role in tumorigenesis, little is known about the involvement of its ligand(s). The expression level of Muc4, a potential functional ligand for erbB2, and its interaction with erbB2 in the gallbladder of BK5.erbB2 mice were determined. By immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, both Muc4 mRNA and protein levels were strongly expressed in the cancerous epithelia of gallbladder from BK5.erbB2 mice. Also, in the hyperplastic (precancerous) epithelia, the protein levels were modestly expressed. Immunostaining with Muc4 (ASGP2) Ab overlapped with that with erbB2 Ab in the apical membranous components of the cancerous epithelia, indicating the co-localization of Muc4 and erbB2. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between Muc4 and erbB2 in the gallbladders. The interaction was associated with the hyperphosphorylation of erbB2, MAPK and Akt, and also with the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2. However, in other organs that overexpressed erbB2 (trachea, esophagus and forestomach), Muc4 was expressed in only trace or modest amounts, and erbB2 was not hyperphosphorylated. Collectively, Muc4 is upregulated and interacts with erbB2 in gallbladders from BK5.erbB2 mice. It is likely that Muc4 plays an important role during gallbladder carcinogenesis and/or cancer growth by potentiating erbB2 signaling. ",

Pathologic material and data from patients undergoing cystectomy at Mayo Clinic between 1980 and 2008 were reviewed. ERBB2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and protein expression by immunohistochemistry were assessed. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate for associations of ERBB2 amplification and protein expression with survival. ERBB2 amplification was identified in 9 (15%) of 61 micropapillary carcinomas compared with 9 (9%) of 100 urothelial carcinomas. In patients with micropapillary carcinoma, ERBB2 amplification was associated with a nearly threefold increased risk of cancer death. ERBB2 amplification (hazard ratio 4.3; P=0.0008) remained associated with an increased risk of death from bladder cancer among patients with micropapillary urothelial carcinoma on multivariate analysis. The association of cancer-specific survival and ERBB2 amplification was not seen in patients with urothelial carcinoma. ERBB2 immunohistochemistry correlated with ERBB2 amplification but there was no association of ERBB2 protein expression and survival. ERBB2 amplification is more frequent in micropapillary urothelial carcinoma than typical urothelial carcinoma, and patients with micropapillary carcinoma who have ERBB2 amplification have worse cancer-specific survival than those who do not.

GAS and ERBB2 protein expression was studied by Western immunoblotting from gastric cancer cell lines with or without gain at 17q12-q21 as well as a breast cancer cell line with ERBB2 amplification. Our results showed that simultaneous amplification of both GAS and ERBB2 was four- to ninefold in the tumors with the 17q12-q21 amplification. Both genes were amplified in the same nuclei, and the hybridization signals were localized to the same region of the nucleus. Overexpression of GAS and ERBB2 was observed by Western immunoblotting only in the gastric cancer cell line with gain at 17q12-q21. The ERBB2 amplification is also a recurrent change in breast cancer. To investigate whether the GAS amplification is unique in gastric cancer, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on 40 breast cancer cell lines. The ERBB2 amplification was observed in 11 cell lines, but none of the lines showed the GAS amplification. This indicates that the formation of an amplicon, in which both the GAS and the ERBB2 genes are amplified, might be unique in gastric cancer, especially in its intestinal type, and that simultaneous amplification of both genes is important to the tumorigenesis of intestinal gastric cancer.

Experimental studies have revealed that ErbB2 shows many features of a therapeutic target: ErbB2 is able to confer many of the characteristics of a cancerous cell, including uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and increased motility; ErbB2 overexpression is specific to tumor cells; as a cell surface-associated protein, it is easily accessible to drugs and as a kinase it is amenable to targeted inhibition by small molecules. Recent clinical results demonstrate the efficacy of ErbB2-targeting therapy and promise an expanding use of ErbB2-targeting drugs for breast cancer treatment. However, as only a fraction of patients responds successfully to therapy and risks of recurrence are still high, further investigation is required for an improved understanding of the complex network of signaling pathways underlying ErbB2-driven cancer progression.",

Despite the effectiveness of trastuzumab, its efficacy remains variable and often modest. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve ErbB2-targeting therapy. Down-regulation of surface receptors induced by monoclonal antibody (mAb) contributes to its antitumor efficacy. Previous studies have demonstrated that if two anti-ErbB2 mAbs did not compete with each other for binding to ErbB2, the combination of them can enhance ErbB2 internalization. In the present study, we investigated ErbB2 internalization-inducing ability of non-competitive anti-ErbB2 mAb combinations and surprisingly found that most of the mAb combinations tested did not down-regulate ErbB2. Only 4 of 18 non-competitive mAb pairs efficiently induced ErbB2 internalization. Interestingly, although the non-competitive anti-ErbB2 mAbs trastuzumab and pertuzumab, either alone or in combination, were ineffective at inducing ErbB2 internalization, TPL, a bispecific antibody engineered from trastuzumab and pertuzumab, potently down-regulated the ErbB2 molecule. Importantly, TPL exhibited a far greater antitumor effect on ErbB2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell line than trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, suggesting that it may be a promising agent for the treatment of gastric cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB2 overexpression contributes to the evolution of a substantial group of human cancers and signifies a poor clinical prognosis. Thus, down-regulation of ErbB2 signaling has emerged as a new anti-cancer strategy. Ubiquitinylation, mediated by the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases, has emerged as a physiological mechanism of ErbB receptor down-regulation, and this mechanism appears to contribute to ErbB2 down-regulation induced by therapeutic anti-ErbB2 antibodies. Hsp90 inhibitory ansamycin antibiotics such as geldanamycin (GA) induce rapid ubiquitinylation and down-regulation of ErbB2. However, the ubiquitin ligase(s) involved has not been identified. Here, we show that ErbB2 serves as an in vitro substrate for the Hsp70/Hsp90-associated U-box ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Overexpression of wild type CHIP, but not its U-box mutant H260Q, induced ubiquitinylation and reduction in both cell surface and total levels of ectopically expressed or endogenous ErbB2 in vivo, and this effect was additive with that of 17-allylamino-geldanamycin (17-AAG). The CHIP U-box mutant H260Q reduced 17-AAG-induced ErbB2 ubiquitinylation. Wild type ErbB2 and a mutant incapable of association with Cbl (ErbB2 Y1112F) were equally sensitive to CHIP and 17-AAG, implying that Cbl does not play a major role in geldanamycin-induced ErbB2 down-regulation. Both endogenous and ectopically expressed CHIP and ErbB2 coimmunoprecipitated with each other, and this association was enhanced by 17-AAG. Notably, CHIP H260Q induced a dramatic elevation of ErbB2 association with Hsp70 and prevented the 17-AAG-induced dissociation of Hsp90. Our results demonstrate that ErbB2 is a target of CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity and suggest a role for CHIP E3 activity in controlling both the association of Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperones with ErbB2 and the down-regulation of ErbB2 induced by inhibitors of Hsp90.",

Thus, ErbB2 is an important target for cancer therapies. Increased ErbB2 expression has been associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and caspase 3/7 activity were measured as the markers of apoptosis. The relative expressions of NF-kB-p50 and Survivin mRNAs were evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our results show that Herceptin treatment inhibits cell proliferation and activates apoptosis but without effects on Survivin and NF-kB expression in Calu-3 cell line. Intracellular glutathione levels and SOD and CAT activities were decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner associated with oxidative stress. Also, ROS were increased at 24 h.

In this system, migration requires inputs from numerous cellular pathways. We discuss this data and a model for migration induced by ErbB2 and TGF-beta.

The 3D acinar morphogenesis of these cells was assessed, as well as the ability of the cells to form branching structures on extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated surfaces. Transwell-invasion assays were used to assess the invasive properties of the cells. Clinically relevant inhibitors of ErbB2, lapatinib and Herceptin (traztuzumab), were used to investigate the role of ErbB2 signaling in this model. A retrospective study on a previously published breast cancer patient dataset was carried out by using Disease Specific Genomic Analysis (DSGA) to investigate the correlation of LOXL2 mRNA expression level with metastasis and survival of ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients.;Fluorescence staining of the acini revealed increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and disrupted polarity, leading to abnormal lumen formation in response to LOXL2 expression in MCF10A cells. When plated onto ECM, the LOXL2-expressing cells formed branching structures and displayed increased invasion. We noted that LOXL2 induced ErbB2 activation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and ErbB2 inhibition by using Herceptin or lapatinib abrogated the effects of LOXL2 on MCF10A cells. Finally, we found LOXL2 expression to be correlated with decreased overall survival and metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients with ErbB2-positive tumors.;These findings suggest that LOXL2 expression in normal epithelial cells can induce abnormal changes that resemble oncogenic transformation and cancer progression, and that these effects are driven by LOXL2-mediated activation of ErbB2.

Cellular changes of viscoelastic features are prerequisite for cancer progression since they are essential for proliferation and metastasis. However, only little is known about the way how expression of oncogenes influences these biomechanical properties. To address this aspect we used a breast cancer cell line with inducible expression of an oncogenic version of ERBB2. ERBB2 is known to be correlated with bad prognosis in breast cancer. Cell elasticity was determined by the Optical Stretcher, where suspended cells are deformed by two slightly divergent laser beams. We found that induction of ERBB2 caused remarkable biomechanical alterations of the MCF-7 cells after 24 h: the cells actively contracted in response to mechanical stimuli, a phenomenon known as mechanoactivation. After this period, as the cells became senescent, the mechanoactivity returned to control levels. Time-resolved gene array analysis revealed that mechanoactivation was accompanied by temporal upregulation of 46 cytoskeletal genes. A possible role of these genes in tumor progression was investigated by expression analyses of 766 breast cancer patients. This showed an association of 12 out of these 46 genes with increased risk of metastasis. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of ERBB2 causes mechanoactivation of tumor cells, which may enhance tumor cell motility fostering distant metastasis.",

This review will focus on the signal transduction through this protein, and explains how the overexpression of erbB2 may result in poor prognosis of breast cancer, and finally it will summerize our current understanding about the therapeutic potential of receptor-targeted therapy in breast cancer. ErbB2 does not have any known ligand which is able to bind to it with high affinity. However the kinase activity of erbB2 can be activated without any ligand, if it is overexpressed, and by heteroassociation with other members of the erbB family (erbB1 or epidermal growth factor receptor, erbB3 and erbB4). This interaction substantially increases the efficiency and diversity of signal transduction through these receptor complexes. In addition, erbB2 forms large scale receptor clusters containing hundreds of proteins. These receptor islands may take part in recruiting cytosolic factors which relay the signal towards the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Overexpression of erbB2 was linked to higher transforming activity, increased metastatic potential, angiogenesis and drug resistence of breast tumor in laboratory experiments. As a corollary of these properties, erbB2 amplification is generally thought to be associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. These early findings lead to the development of antibodies that down-regulate erbB2. Such a therapeutic approach has already been found effective in experimental tumor models and in clinical trials as well. Further understanding of the importance of erbB2 and growth factor receptors in the transformation of normal cells to malignant ones may once give us a chance to cure erbB2 over-expressing breast cancer.",

While evidence accumulates to support the relationship between erbB2 overexpression and poor overall survival in human breast cancer, understanding of the biological consequence(s) of erbB2 overexpression remains elusive. Our recent discovery, cloning, sequencing, and expression of the erbB2 ligand (gp30) has allowed us to identify a number of related but distinct biological endpoints which appear responsive to signal transduction through the erbB2 receptor. These endpoints of growth, invasiveness, and differentiation have clear implications for the emergence, maintenance, and/or control of malignancy, and represent established endpoints in the assessment of malignant progression in breast cancer. Studies in vitro have shown that gp30 induces a biphasic growth effect (induction of growth at low concentrations and inhibition of growth at high concentrations) on cells with erbB2 over-expression. Strikingly, we have recently observed that the erbB2 signalling pathway can be modulated by estrogen acting through the estrogen receptor (ER). Conversely, we observed that down regulation of erbB2 by estrogen can be blocked by gp30 acting through the erbB2 receptor. Clearly, mechanistic aspects of the erbB2/ligand interaction need to be understood from a therapeutic standpoint, and may furthermore provide additional insights into treatment synergy for particular patients.

Coexpression of the ERBB2 and GATA4 genes was originally observed in tumors. Both genes are essential for cardiovascular development and GATA4 has been proposed to control the transcription of critical genes for the differentiation and the function of myocardium. We determined that ERBB2-targeted small interfering RNA repressed both ERBB2 and GATA4 genes, whereas GATA4-targeted small interfering RNA repressed GATA4 and activated ERBB2 transcription. Transfected GATA4-expressing construct repressed ERBB2 promoter. Phylogenetic foot printing revealed multiple putative GATA4 binding sites conserved in mammals within the ERBB2 promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that GATA4 binds specifically to several ERBB2 gene noncoding regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed GATA4 binding to a well-conserved consensus motif. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of this new regulatory element for the activity of the ERBB2 gene enhancer. In agreement with a repressor role of GATA4 on ERBB2 gene expression balanced by ERBB2 activation of the GATA4 gene, a negative correlation between the relative levels of ERBB2 and GATA4 mRNA was observed in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples.

Furthermore, AP-2 transcription factors are highly expressed in cancer cell lines overexpressing ERBB2. In this report, we examined the cooperative effect of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) on AP-2-induced activation of ERBB2 promoter activity. We detected high levels of YY1 transcription factor in mammary cancer cell lines. Notably, we showed that YY1 enhances AP-2alpha transcriptional activation of the ERBB2 promoter through an AP-2 site both in HepG2 and in HCT116 cells, whereas a carboxyl-terminal-truncated form of YY1 cannot. Moreover, we demonstrated the interaction between endogenous AP-2 and YY1 factors in the BT-474 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line. In addition, inhibition of endogenous YY1 protein by an antisense decreased the transcription of an AP-2-responsive ERBB2 reporter plasmid in BT-474 breast cancer cells.

Western blotting was employed to detect the expression of ERBB2, caveolin-1 and DNA-PKcs after irradiation, and immunoprecipitation to identify the ERBB2 and caveolin-1 complex before perinuclear ERBB2 localization. Confocal microscopy showed the transport of ERBB2 and caveolin-1 from the cell membrane to the nucleus 15 min after irradiation and the proteins accumulated at the perinuclear region within 45 min. Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of ERBB2, caveolin-1 and DNA-PKcs were increased after irradiation and reached a peak 45 min later. Both herceptin and PP2 treatments were found to decrease ERBB2 expression. An immune complex composed of ERBB2 and caveolin-1 was found in the herceptin group after irradiation. It was concluded that after irradiation, ERBB2 may be transported from the cell membrane to the nucleus and activate DNA-PKcs to trigger DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair; caveolin-1 may participate in this process. Treatments involving the downregulation of caveolin-1 may increase the radiosensitization of breast cancer cells.",

Radiotherapy is often used to treat early premalignant lesions regardless of ErbB2 status. Here, we show that clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (IR)-induce cellular invasion of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells, as well as MCF10A cells overexpressing ErbB2. ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 and T47D, do not invade following treatment with IR nor do MCF10A cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor. ErbB2 becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 877 in a dose- and time- dependent manner following exposure to X-rays, and activates downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt. Inhibition of these pathways, as well as inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants, prevents IR-induced invasion. Activation of ErbB2-dependent signaling results in upregulation of the forkhead family transcription factor, FoxM1, and its transcriptional targets, including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Inhibition of FoxM1 by RNA interference prevented induction of invasion by IR, and overexpression of FoxM1 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to promote IR-induced invasion. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3ζ is also upregulated by IR in cancer cells in a ROS-dependent manner, is required for IR-induced invasion in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells and together with FoxM1 is sufficient for invasion in ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells. Thus, our data show that IR-mediated activation of ErbB2 and induction of 14-3-3ζ collaborate to regulate FoxM1 and promote invasion of breast cancer cells and furthermore, may serve as therapeutic targets to enhance radiosensitivity of breast cancers.

Several studies have shown a link between activator protein 2 (AP-2) transcription factors and ERBB2 gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor has been shown to stimulate AP-2 transcriptional activity on the ERBB2 promoter in vitro. In this report, we examined the relationships between ERBB2, AP-2alpha, and YY1 both in breast cancer tissue specimens and in a mammary cancer cell line.;ERBB2, AP-2alpha, and YY1 protein levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a panel of 55 primary breast tumors. ERBB2 gene amplification status was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Correlations were evaluated by a chi2 test at a p value of less than 0.05. The functional role of AP-2alpha and YY1 on ERBB2 gene expression was analyzed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in the BT-474 mammary cancer cell line followed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.;We observed a statistically significant correlation between ERBB2 and AP-2alpha levels in the tumors (p < 0.01). Moreover, associations were found between ERBB2 protein level and the combined high expression of AP-2alpha and YY1 (p < 0.02) as well as between the expression of AP-2alpha and YY1 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the levels of both AP-2alpha and YY1 proteins were inversely correlated to ERBB2 gene amplification status in the tumors (p < 0.01). Transfection of siRNAs targeting AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma mRNAs in the BT-474 breast cancer cell line repressed the expression of the endogenous ERBB2 gene at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the additional transfection of an siRNA directed against the YY1 transcript further reduced the ERBB2 protein level, suggesting that AP-2 and YY1 transcription factors cooperate to stimulate the transcription of the ERBB2 gene.;This study highlights the role of both AP-2alpha and YY1 transcription factors in ERBB2 oncogene overexpression in breast tumors. Our results also suggest that high ERBB2 expression may result either from gene amplification or from increased transcription factor levels.",

Furthermore, adoptive transfer of genetically modified NK‑92 cells specifically reduced tumor size and lung metastasis of nude mice bearing established MDA-MB-453 cells, and significantly enhanced the survival period of these mice.

The relative ERBB2 copy number determined by FISH in 10 breast cancer cell lines correlated strongly with Southern blot results (r = 0.98) when probes for an identical reference locus were used in the two methods. Metaphase analysis of cell lines showed that amplified ERBB2 copies always occurred in intrachromosomal clusters but that the number and chromosomal location of these clusters varied among the cell lines. In interphase nuclei of primary tumors showing ERBB2 amplification (10/44), ERBB2 copies were seen as one to four clusters, also suggesting intrachromosomal localization. Regardless of the average level of amplification, all these tumors contained highly amplified cell subpopulations with at least 25, and sometimes more than 100, ERBB2 copies per cell. Tumors that did not show amplification by FISH (34/44) had an average of one to five ERBB2 copies scattered randomly in the nuclei and completely lacked cells with high copy levels.

In this study, we demonstrate that there is a strong association between the overexpression of FOXA1 and ErbB2 in ER- breast tumors. This has led us to identify a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling in ER- breast cancer. We present two mechanisms to explain the association between FOXA1 and ErbB2 overexpression in molecular apocrine cells. In one process, ErbB2 signaling genes CREB1 and c-Fos regulate FOXA1 transcription, and in another process, AP2α regulates the expression of both FOXA1 and ErbB2. Moreover, we demonstrate that FOXA1, in turn, regulates the transcription of ErbB2 signaling genes. This includes a core gene signature that is shared across two molecular apocrine cell lines. Importantly, the most upregulated (RELB) and downregulated (PAK1) genes in this signature are direct FOXA1 targets. Our data suggest that FOXA1 acts as a dual-function transcription factor and the repressive function of FOXA1 on RELB can be explained by the recruitment of its binding partner corepressor TLE3. It is notable that a group of FOXA1-regulated genes vary across molecular apocrine cell lines leading to the differences in the functional effects of FOXA1 on extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and cell viability between these lines. This study demonstrates that there is a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling that connects FOXA1 to some of the key signaling pathways in ER-breast cancer.",

Two models have emerged that account for the high surface distribution of ErbB2. In one model, the surface pool is dynamic and governed by a balance between endocytosis and recycling, whereas in the other it is retained, static, and excluded from endocytosis. These models have contrasting implications for how ErbB2 exerts its biological function and how cancer therapies might down-regulate surface ErbB2, such as the antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) or the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. Little is known, however, about how these treatments affect ErbB2 endocytic trafficking. To investigate this issue, we examined breast carcinoma cells by immunofluorescence and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy and developed imaging and trafficking kinetics assays using cell surface fluorescence quenching. Surprisingly, trastuzumab does not influence ErbB2 distribution but instead recycles passively with internalized ErbB2. By contrast, geldanamycin down-regulates surface ErbB2 through improved degradative sorting in endosomes exclusively rather than through increased endocytosis. These results reveal substantial dynamism in the surface ErbB2 pool and clearly demonstrate the significance of endosomal sorting in the maintenance of ErbB2 surface distribution, a critical feature of its biological function.",

The initial cause of amplification and the exact borders of ERBB2-amplified chromosome fragment are still not completely characterized. No specific DNA sequences were found on the junction regions at intrachromosomal DNA amplification. We hypothesized that amplification borders can be specified by DNA structural peculiarities rather than the particular DNA sequence. This study focused on the mapping of ERBB2 amplification borders in breast cancer and the search for unusual structural features of DNA at the borders of the identified amplicons. The copy number of 10 genes adjacent to ERBB2 were evaluated by real time PCR in 162 breast cancer samples. Several ERBB2-containing amplicons of various lengths were revealed. In the majority of the analyzed samples, the borders of these amplicons were located within ZNFNIA3 and RARA genes. A bioinformatics analysis of the nucleotide sequence peculiarities around ERBB2 gene revealed the presence of AT-rich DNA regions with high degree of flexibility. These regions were able to form stable secondary structures. Positions of these sites strongly coincide with the positions of the ERBB2-containing amplicon borders found in real time PCR experiments.

Finding protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) that can specifically regulate the function of ErbB should help design novel therapies for treatment. By performing a small interfering RNA screen against 43 human PTPs, we find that knockdown of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9 significantly increases ErbB2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line. In addition, knockdown of PTPN9 expression also enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of the ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Conversely, increasing expression of PTPN9 wild type (WT) inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR. To test whether ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9, PTPN9 WT, and a substrate trapping mutant (PTPN9 DA) are overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared with vector control, expression of PTPN9 WT significantly inhibits whereas expression of PTPN9 DA dramatically enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR, respectively. In contrast, expression of PTPN9 WT or DA mutant does not affect tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB3 and Shc. Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pulldown experiments show that tyrosol-phosphorylated ErbB2 or EGFR is preferentially associated with PTPN9 DA compared with PTPN9 WT, indicating that ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9. Furthermore, PTPN9 WT expression specifically impairs EGF-induced STAT3 and STAT5 activation, and inhibits the cell growth in soft agar.

Recently, efforts have been made to develop novel 4-anilinoquinazoline and pyridopyrimidine derivatives to inhibit EGFR and ErbB2 kinases simultaneously. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a novel reversible dual inhibitor GW572016 compared with the selective EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) AG1478 and AG879 and their combination, using the human colon adenocarcinoma GEO mode. GEO cells depend on multiple ErbB receptors for aberrant growth. A synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation associated with induction of apoptosis was observed from the combination of AG1478 and AG879. Compared with AG1478 or AG879, the single TKI compound GW572016 was a more potent inhibitor of GEO cell proliferation and was able to induce apoptosis at lower concentrations. Western blot analysis revealed that AG1478 and AG879 were unable to suppress both EGFR and ErbB2 activation as well as the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways as single agents. In contrast, GW572016 suppressed the activation of EGFR, ErbB2, MAPK, and AKT in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, in vivo studies showed that GW572016 treatment efficiently blocked GEO xenograft growth at a dose range of 30 to 200 mg/kg with a twice-daily schedule. In summary, our study indicates that targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 simultaneously could enhance therapy over that of single agents directed at EGFR or ErbB2 in cancers that can be identified as being primarily heterodimer-dependent.",

To study the possible signaling from such a truncated receptor, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells expressing NH(2)-terminally truncated ErbB2 (DeltaNErbB2) were compared with cells overexpressing wild-type ErbB2. Expression of DeltaNErbB2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, extensive loss of the epithelial morphology, appearance of vesicles and long protrusions as well as pronounced scattering of the cells. Similar alterations were observed upon ErbB2 overexpression but at much lower levels. Employing cell clones with inducible expression of DeltaNErbB2, it was revealed that the morphological changes were fully reversible and depended on continuous expression of DeltaNErbB2 but not on the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Interestingly, the expression of DeltaNErbB2 resulted also in the increased expression and phosphorylation of ErbB1 as well as in the prolonged ligand-induced activation of the ErbB1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, constitutive signaling upon expression of the truncated ErbB2 receptor in human breast cancer cells promotes morphological changes indicative of a more motile and aggressive phenotype.",

Therefore, we aimed to assess the copy number and prognostic role of DLX4 in breast cancer from South African patients. Due to the co-location of ERBB2 and DLX4 in the 17q21 region, its copy number was also evaluated. Our results in the analysis of 66 cases demonstrated copy number gains of DLX4 and ERBB2 in 24.1 and 29.7% of the cases, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed no dependency between the copy number alterations in these genes. Although not significant, patients with DLX4 and ERBB2 gains presented a higher frequency of advanced-grade tumors. In addition, copy number alterations of these genes were not significantly differently observed in the 3 main racial groups of the Western Cape population: Colored, White, and Black.

A 28-bp GGA repeat sequence (Pu28-mer) in the nuclease hypersensitive site of the ERBB2 promoter region may play an important role in the regulation of ERBB2 transcription, possibly involving the formation of a G-quadruplex. In order to investigate this possibility, an affinity MALDI-MS approach was used for in vitro protein capture from nuclear extracts from cultured MCF-7 and BT-474 cancer cells at Pu28-mer and control oligonucleotide-modified surfaces. Captured proteins from MCF-7 cells were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Based on these results, Western blot was then used to interrogate captured proteins from both MCF-7 and the Her-2/neu-positive BT-474 cells. Results support the formation of a G-quadruplex by Pu28-mer, indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, that selectively captures transcription factors including Ku70, Ku80, PURA, nucleolin, and hnRNP K. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of Ku70, Ku80, PURA, and nucleolin to ERBB2 promoter in the live BT-474 cells. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of non-duplex DNA structures in gene regulation and provide a more complete picture of the regulation of ErbB2 expression in breast cancer.

To understand the mechanism of differential response to these two regimens, we have evaluated the effect of signaling through the ErbB2 receptor on downstream enzymes that may affect drug response, using two different models. The first system employs breast cancer cells that have high levels of endogenous ErbB2 by gene amplification (BT-474 and SKBR3 cells). The second system allows us to isolate the effect of ErbB2 receptor-mediated intracellular signaling using an epidermal growth factor receptor-ErbB2 chimeric receptor activated by epidermal growth factor. Our experiments show that the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is inhibited in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells by the anti-ErbB2 antibody, Herceptin. This is accompanied by a decrease in topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha protein and activity, suggesting that this is the mechanism of change in doxorubicin response. In addition, a 10-100-fold (1-2 log) decrease in the LD(50) of doxorubicin is seen after ErbB2 activation using the chimeric receptor model. Furthermore, we see a 100-fold decrease in the LD(50) of etoposide, another topo II inhibitor. This increase in doxorubicin sensitivity is associated with a 4.5-fold increase in the amount of topo IIalpha protein and an increase in topo II activity as measured by DNA decatenating and unknotting activities, as well as cleavable complex formation. In contradistinction to doxorubicin, we have observed an increased resistance to cyclophosphamide chemotherapy after chimeric receptor activation. We propose that the differential benefit seen with doxorubicin- versus alkylator-based chemotherapy in ErbB2+ breast cancer is due, in some cases, to ErbB2-mediated topo IIalpha activation. These data also suggest hypotheses for the optimal sequencing of Herceptin and chemotherapy agents in ErbB2+ breast cancer.",

Intriguingly, acute treatment of mice with β1- and β2-AR agonist isoproterenol resulted in myocardial ErbB2 increase, while inhibition with either β1- or β2-AR antagonist did not completely prevent isoproterenol-induced ErbB2 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of ErbB2 kinase predisposed mice hearts to injury from chronic isoproterenol treatment while significantly reducing isoproterenol-induced pAKT and pERK levels, suggesting ErbB2's role in transactivation in the heart.;Our studies show that myocardial ErbB2 and βAR signalling are linked in a feedback loop with βAR activation leading to increased ErbB2 expression and activity, and increased ErbB2 activity regulating β2AR expression.

Importantly, ErbB2 activation in normal mammary cells causes estrogen-independent proliferation in both estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cells as well as in normally quiescent ER-positive cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation causes multiple pathologic changes in the skin including inflammation, immune suppression, photoaging, and cancer. Effects of UV irradiation include the activation of numerous signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). These responses alter gene expression in a manner that resembles the response to growth factors known as the \"UV response\". The UV response alters the kinetics of cell division and cell death allowing the skin to recover from the DNA damage caused by UV exposure. UV irradiation also rapidly activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members, including Erbb2 (human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu), through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Erbb2, a protooncogene that is activated in many types of cancer and associated with aggressive and chemotherapeutic-resistant disease, is expressed in both follicular and epidermal keratinocytes within the skin. However, the physiological functions of Erbb2 in the skin and its role in the UV response are largely unknown. In this review, evidence that Erbb2 is influential in modulating the response of the skin to UV will be presented. Erbb2 alters the expression of regulatory genes controlling inflammation, angiogenesis, cell division, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and migration following UV irradiation. In addition, Erbb2 dampens UV-induced S-phase arrest, augments inflammation in response to UV irradiation, and suppresses UV-induced apoptosis. In summary, the evidence presented herein links UV-induced Erbb2 activation to many of the effects of UV and implicates Erbb2 in UV-induced carcinogenesis.",

MP-412 (AV-412) is a potent dual inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, including the mutant EGFR(L858R,T790M), which is clinically resistant to the EGFR-specific kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. In an enzyme assay, MP-412 inhibited the EGFR variants and ErbB2 in the nanomolar range with over 100-fold selectivity compared with other kinases, apart from abl and flt-1, which were both moderately sensitive to the compound. In cells, MP-412 inhibited autophosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 with IC(50) of 43 and 282 nM, respectively. It also inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent cell proliferation with an IC(50) of 100 nM. Moreover, MP-412 abrogated EGFR signaling in the gefitinib-resistant H1975 cell line, which harbors a double mutation of L858R and T790M in EGFR. In animal studies using cancer xenograft models, MP-412 (30 mg/kg) demonstrated complete inhibition of tumor growth of the A431 and BT-474 cell lines, which overexpress EGFR and ErbB2, respectively. MP-412 suppressed autophosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 at the dose corresponding to its antitumor efficacy. When various dosing schedules were applied, MP-412 showed significant effects with daily and every-other-day schedules, but not with a once-weekly schedule, suggesting that frequent dosing is preferable for this compound. Furthermore, MP-412 showed a significant antitumor effect on the ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer KPL-4 cell line, which is resistant to gefitinib. These studies indicate that MP-412 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancers expressing EGFR and ErbB2, especially those resistant to the first generation of small-molecule inhibitors.",

The deregulated Src protein synthesis and stability in mediating malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, however, have been neglected. While investigating the signal transduction pathways contributing to ErbB2-mediated metastasis, we found that ErbB2-activated breast cancer cells that had higher metastatic potentials also had increased Src activity compared with ErbB2 low-expressing cells. The increased Src activity in ErbB2-activated cells paralleled higher Src protein levels, whereas Src RNA levels were not significantly altered. Our studies revealed two novel mechanisms that are involved in Src protein up-regulation and activation by ErbB2: (a) ErbB2 increased Src translation through activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/4E-BP1 pathway and (b) ErbB2 increased Src stability most likely through the inhibition of the calpain protease. Furthermore, inhibition of Src activity by a Src-specific inhibitor, PP2, or a Src dominant-negative mutant dramatically reduced ErbB2-mediated cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in an experimental metastasis animal model. Together, activation of ErbB2 and downstream signaling pathways can lead to increased Src protein synthesis and decreased Src protein degradation resulting in Src up-regulation and activation, which play critical roles in ErbB2-mediated breast cancer invasion and metastasis.",

BLAST programs revealed that mouse AK031099 cDNA was derived from mouse Erbb2 gene. Because AK031099 cDNA showed 806 C-->A nucleotide substitution compared with mouse genome draft sequences and mouse Erbb2 ESTs, the nucleotide sequence of mouse Erbb2 cDNA was determined in silico by correcting 806 A of AK031099 cDNA to C. Nucleotide position 48-3818 of mouse Erbb2 cDNA was the coding region. Mouse Erbb2 gene, consisting of 27 exons, was located within the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus on the mouse chromosome 11. Mouse Erbb2 protein (1256 aa) showed 87.5% total-amino-acid identity with human ERBB2 protein, and 95.2% total-amino-acid identity with rat Erbb2 protein. Mouse Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus and human Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus were evolutionarily conserved in the order and the orientation of genes therein. Nucleotide and amino-acid substitution rates of Neurod2 located centromeric to the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus were significantly lower than others within the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus.

To test this hypothesis in human breast cancer in vivo, we studied the relationship between the expression of both molecules in 247 breast carcinomas immunohistochemically. Five ductal carcinomas in situ overexpressed ERBB2 and showed preserved E-CD expression. Forty-four of 226 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (19.47%) showed ERBB2 overexpression, and a statistically significant relationship was found between ERBB2 overexpression and high histological grade.

None of the 16 infiltrating lobular carcinomas expressed ERBB2 or E-CD.

While amplification of the 17q12-21 chromosomal region often correlates with an increase in the transcriptional rates of the locus, the molecular mechanisms and the factors involved in the coordinated expression of genes residing within the ERBB2 amplicon remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα, NR3B1) and its coregulator PGC-1β are key effectors in this process. Using a mouse model of ERBB2-initiated mammary tumorigenesis, we first show that ablation of ERRα significantly delays ERBB2-induced tumor development and lowers the levels of amplicon transcripts. Chromosome 17q-wide binding site location analyses in human breast cancer cells show preferential recruitment of ERRα to DNA segments associated with the ERBB2 amplicon. Furthermore, ERRα directs the co-recruitment of the coactivator PGC-1β to segments in the 17q12 region and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of the ERBB2 and coamplified genes. ERRα and PGC-1β also participate in the de-repression of ERBB2 expression through competitive genomic cross-talk with estrogen receptor α (ERα) and, as a consequence, influence tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ERRα and PGC-1β are key players in the etiology of malignant breast cancer by coordinating the transcriptional regulation of genes located in the 17q12 region, a process that also involves interference with the repressive function of ERα on ERBB2 expression.",

We investigated eight annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms for occurrence in familial breast cancer samples. The confirmed variants Ile654Val, Ile655Val and Ala1170Pro were analysed in subsequent epidemiological studies on familial breast cancer risk. While Ala1170Pro resides within a C-terminally located regulatory domain, the two adjacent polymorphisms Ile654Val and Ile655Val are part of the transmembrane domain. A case-control study analysing a cohort of 348 German familial breast cancer cases and 960 corresponding controls showed no significant association of either Ile655Val (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.82-1.34, P = 0.728) or Ala1170Pro (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.74-1.20, P = 0.632) with familial breast cancer risk. Differences in haplotype frequencies between cases and controls could also not be detected. The ERBB2 variant Ile654Val, however, revealed an increased risk for carriers of the heterozygous Val654 allele (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.08-6.08, P = 0.028). The rare Val654 variant is linked with the more frequent Val655, resulting in two consecutive valine instead of two isoleucine residues within the transmembrane domain. Computational analyses suggest that the Val654-Val655 allele provokes receptor dimerization and activation, thus stimulating kinase activity and cell transformation.

If this is true, then we would hypothesize that a useful prognostic indicator would be the level of activity of a second messenger protein used in common by these receptors. One such second messenger is the Shc adapter protein, which is activated when tyrosine phosphorylated by receptors. Therefore, one prediction from the hypothesis is that the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc (PY-Shc) in breast cancer cell lines would correlate with total receptor tyrosine kinase activity. To begin to test this prediction, we examined Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in a diverse group of breast cancer cell lines that display varied levels of ErbB2. Using Shc immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis, we found a strong correlation between the level of ErbB2 overexpression (r = 0.91, p < 0.0002) and PY-ErbB2 levels (r = 0.89, p = 0.0005) compared with the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p52 and p46 Shc isoforms. Consistent with Shc tyrosine phosphorylation being driven by ErbB2, an ErbB2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor markedly reduced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, although all cell lines had comparable total amounts of p52 and p46 Shc, the amount of an inhibitory Shc isoform, p66, was inversely related to the level of ErbB2 expression (r = -0.86, p = 0.0013). This suggests that reduced p66 Shc expression may play a role in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. In summary, these data are consistent with our prediction that the cellular level of PY-Shc would correlate with the levels of activated ErbB2 displayed by cell lines derived from breast cancers.",

In agreement with a recent study, which reports concurrent allelic BECN1 loss and ERBB2 amplification in a small number of human breast tumors, we found that low BECN1 mRNA correlates with ERBB2-overexpression in breast cancers, suggesting that BECN1 loss and ERBB2 overexpression may functionally interact in mammary tumorigenesis. We now report that ERBB2 overexpression suppressed autophagic response to stress in mouse mammary and human breast cancer cells. ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1(+/+) and Becn1(+/-) immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells (iMMECs) formed mammary tumors in nude mice with similar kinetics, and monoallelic Becn1 loss did not alter ERBB2- and PyMT-driven mammary tumorigenesis. In human breast cancer databases, ERBB2-expressing tumors exhibit a low autophagy gene signature, independent of BECN1 mRNA expression, and have similar gene expression profiles with non-ERBB2-expressing breast tumors with low BECN1 levels. We also found that ERBB2-expressing BT474 breast cancer cells, despite being partially autophagy-deficient under stress, can be sensitized to the anti-ERBB2 antibody trastuzumab (tzb) by further pharmacological or genetic autophagy inhibition. Our results indicate that ERBB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis is associated with functional autophagy suppression and ERBB2-positive breast cancers are partially autophagy-deficient even in a wild-type BECN1 background. Furthermore and extending earlier findings using tzb-resistant cells, exogenously imposed autophagy inhibition increases the anticancer effect of trastuzumab on tzb-sensitive ERBB2-expressing breast tumor cells, indicating that pharmacological autophagy suppression has a wider role in the treatment of ERBB2-positive breast cancer.

Using ERBB2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells (SKBR3), the mRNA stability factor HuR was shown to support ERBB2 transcript integrity, bind and endogenously associate with a conserved U-rich element within the ERBB2 transcript 3' UTR, coimmunoprecipitate with RNA-associated HDAC activity, and colocalize with HDAC6. HDAC6 also coimmunoprecipitates with HuR in an RNA-dependent manner and within 6 hours of exposure to a pan-HDAC inhibitor dose, that does not significantly alter cytosolic HuR levels or HuR binding to ERBB2 mRNA. Cellular ERBB2 transcript levels decline while remaining physically associated with HDAC6. Knockdown of HDAC6 protein by small interfering RNA partially suppressed the ERBB2 transcript decay induced by either pan-HDAC or HDAC6-selective enzymatic inhibitors. Three novel hydroxamates, ST71, ST17, and ST80 were synthesized and shown to inhibit HDAC6 with 14-fold to 31-fold greater selectivity over their binding and inhibition of HDAC1. Unlike more potent pan-HDAC inhibitors, these HDAC6-selective inhibitors produced dose-dependent growth arrest of ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells by accelerating the decay of mature ERBB2 mRNA without repressing ERBB2 promoter function. In sum, these findings point to the therapeutic potential of HuR and HDAC6-selective inhibitors, contrasting ERBB2 stability effects induced by HDAC6 enzymatic inhibition and HDAC6 protein knockdown, and show that ERBB2 transcript stability mechanisms include exploitable targets for the development of novel anticancer therapies.",

We genotyped a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes and selected seven haplotype-tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) in ATM, six tagSNPs in CHEK2 and seven tagSNPs in ERBB2 that could predict common variants and haplotypes (frequency > or =0.03) in each gene with R(2) > or = 0.8. We included the tagSNPs or their haplotypes as explanatory variables in unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for age. Our results indicated an increased risk of developing endometroid endometrial cancer for homozygous carriers of the rare allele (AA) of a tagSNP (rs4987886) in CHEK2 (P = 0.005) when contrasted with GG carriers. We also found a decreased endometrial cancer risk among non-smoking carriers of a haplotype in ATM (P = 0.0007) and among carriers of a haplotype in CHEK2, who had experienced menopause below 49 years of age (P = 0.0009) compared with non-carriers of these haplotypes. We found no effect of genetic variation in ERBB2 on endometrial cancer risk. In conclusion, it is possible that common variants in the ATM and CHEK2 genes, in interaction with oestrogen-related exposures, are involved in endometrial cancer aetiology.",

Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, including EGFR and ERBB2, leads to bladder cancer cell growth and correlates with poor patients' prognosis. However, cross talk between AR and EGFR/ERBB2 pathways in bladder cancer remains poorly understood. In AR-positive bladder cancer UMUC3 and TCC-SUP cells, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased the expression of EGFR and ERBB2 both in mRNA and in protein levels, and an anti-androgen hydroxyflutamide antagonized the effect of DHT. The necessity of AR was confirmed by silencing the receptor, using short hairpin RNA (shRNA), in UMUC3 cells, as well as by expressing the receptor in AR-negative 5637 cells. Of note were much higher basal levels of EGFR and ERBB2 in UMUC3-control-shRNA than in UMUC3-AR-shRNA and those of EGFR in 5637-AR than in 5637-V. DHT additionally upregulated the levels of phosphorylation of EGFR (pEGFR) and its downstream proteins AKT (pAKT) and ERK1/2 (pERK), induced by EGF treatment, in AR-positive cells. Immunohistochemistry on cystectomy specimens showed strong associations between expressions of AR and EGFR (P=0.0136), pEGFR (P=0.0041), ERBB2 (P=0.0331), or pERK (P=0.0274), but not of pAKT (P=0.5555). The Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests further revealed that positivity of AR (P=0.0005), EGFR (P=0.2425), pEGFR (P=0.1579), ERBB2 (P=0.2997), or pERK (P=0.1270) and negativity of pAKT (P=0.0483) were associated with tumor progression. Our results indicate that AR activation upregulates the expression of EGFR and ERBB2 in bladder cancer cells. AR signals may thus contribute to the progression of bladder cancer via regulation of the EGFR/ERBB2 pathways.",

Two global, extraction-based methods using real-time quantitative PCR on DNA (Q-PCR) or RNA (RQ-PCR) and two non-global, tissue-based methods, ie fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), were used. The 94 breast cancers tested were enriched in cases scoring 2+ using the IHC scoring system currently in use and for which the actual ERBB2 status remains ill defined. To determine the best parameters and reagents for assessment, two protocols for FISH and five anti-ERBB2 antibodies were used, and both FISH and IHC were carried out on the same tissue microarrays (TMAs). It is shown that the combination of the two tissue-based methods gives the best results. The use of either PCR-based method did not improve the results significantly. A new combined IHC score based on the association of two selected anti-ERBB2 antibodies (HercepTest trade mark and TAB250) and a dual scale for improved assessment of ERBB2 protein expression, particularly in 2+ cases, are proposed.",

For example, knowledge of the expression of the estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors (ER and PR), and that of the ERBB2 in breast tumor samples enables choice of therapies for the breast cancer patients that express these proteins. Identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic agents affecting the activity of signaling pathways regulated by the hormone receptors or ERBB2 might be accelerated by knowledge of their expression levels in large gene expression profiling data sets. Unfortunately, the status of these receptors is not invariably reported in public databases of breast tumor gene expression profiles. Attempts have been made to employ a single probe set to identify ER, PR and ERBB2 status, but the specificity or sensitivity of their prediction is low. We enquired whether estimation of ER, PR and ERBB2 status of profiled tumor samples could be improved by using multiple probe sets representing these three genes and others with related expression.We used 8 independent datasets of human breast tumor samples to define gene expression signatures comprising 24, 51 and 14 genes predictive of ER, PR and ERBB2 status respectively. These signatures, as demonstrated by sensitivity and specificity measures, reliably identified hormone receptor and ERBB2 expression in breast tumors that had been previously determined using protein and DNA based assays. Our findings demonstrate that gene signatures can be identified which reliably predict the expression status of the estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors and that of ERBB2 in publically available gene expression profiles of breast tumor samples.

In all cases of ACIS and the intramucosal adenocarcinomas, almost all cancer cells overexpressed p53, however the populations overexpressing ERBB2 and EGFR varied in different cases: in one ACIS, ERBB2 was coexpressed in all the cancer cells, in the other ACIS and one intramucosal adenocarcinoma, ERBB2 was overexpressed in about 50% and only 10% of the p53-positive cells respectively.

Treatment with trastuzumab (a monoclonal antibody against erbB2) improves survival; however, it also causes cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that blockade of the erbB2 receptor induces cardiomyocyte death through a mitochondrial pathway that is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We first showed that levels of erbB2 receptor are significantly decreased in an animal model of ischemic heart disease and in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. We treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with an inhibitory erbB2 antibody to study the mechanism behind the deleterious effects of erbB2 blockade. These cells displayed a dose-dependent increase in ROS production and cell death compared with control IgG-treated cells; these processes were reversed by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine. The effects of erbB2 antibody on both cell death and ROS production were also reversed by cyclosporine A and diazoxide, chemicals that regulate the pro- and anti-apoptotic channels in the mitochondria, respectively. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Bax and Bak (proteins that mediate cell death through a mitochondrial pathway) were resistant to the deleterious effects of erbB2 antibody. These effects of erbB2 blockade appear to occur through a pathway involving AKT and PKC-alpha. Our results suggest that erbB2 plays a role in cardiomyocyte survival, and that the deleterious effects of trastuzumab on the heart occur through a mitochondrial pathway and is mediated by ROS production.

ErbB2 is a unique receptor-tyrosine kinase that does not bind ligand but possesses an extracellular domain poised to engage other ErbBs. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for ErbB2 catalytic regulation. Here we show that ErbB2 kinase is strongly autoinhibited, and a loop connecting the alphaC helix and beta4 sheet within the kinase domain plays a major role in the control of kinase activity. Mutations of two Gly residues at positions 776 and 778 in this loop dramatically increase ErbB2 catalytic activity. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that mutational activation is due to approximately 10- and approximately 7-fold increases in ATP binding affinity and turnover number, respectively. Expression of the activated ErbB2 mutants in cells resulted in elevated ligand-independent ErbB2 autophosphorylation, ErbB3 phosphorylation, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Molecular modeling suggests that the ErbB2 kinase domain is stabilized in an inactive state via a hydrophobic interaction between the alphaC-beta4 and activation loops. Importantly, many ErbB2 human cancer mutations have been identified in the alphaC-beta4 loop, including the activating G776S mutation studied here. Our findings reveal a new kinase regulatory mechanism in which the alphaC-beta4 loop functions as an intramolecular switch that controls ErbB2 activity and suggests that loss of alphaC-beta4 loop-mediated autoinhibition is involved in oncogenic activation of ErbB2.",

In all, 42% of the tumours expressed (category 1+, 2+ or 3+) either CB11 or CBE356 or both (CB11/CBE356 parameter). Associations between ERBB2 expression and clinical factors were observed only if tumours with staining category 1+ were grouped together with tumours showing staining categories 2+ and 3+. CB11/CBE356 parameter had a better predictive value than CB11 alone. CB11/CBE356 expression was negatively associated with platinum sensitivity (PS) in the TP53(-) group (P=0.022) and with disease-free survival (DFS) in the TP53(+) group (P=0.009). Our results may suggest that trastuzumab should be given postoperatively to patients with TP53(-)/ERBB2(+) ovarian carcinomas to enhance PS, and after completion of chemotherapy to patients with complete remission and TP53(+)/ERBB2(+) carcinomas to extend DFS time (in total to 30.4% of all patients analysed). Thus, novel criteria for ovarian cancer patient inclusion for clinical trials with trastuzumab should be considered and tested.",

Particular attention has focused on ErbB2, whose activation may occur by receptor overexpression or by ligand-induced oligomerization with other ErbB receptors. Whether these two modes of ErbB2 activation cause the same biological responses is unknown. Here, we uncovered important differences in the signaling, proliferation rates, and the response to anti-ErbB2 antibodies when comparing MCF7 cells expressing the ligand neuregulin, to MCF7 cells overexpressing ErbB2. Expression of neuregulin caused higher proliferation than ErbB2 overexpression. Transmembrane neuregulin expression was accompanied by constitutive activation of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors. ErbB2 overexpression caused tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2, whereas ErbB3 and ErbB4 were only slightly tyrosine phosphorylated. Autocrine transmembrane neuregulin also caused constitutive activation of several signaling pathways, such as the Erk1/2, Erk5, and Akt routes, which have been linked to breast cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, expression of neuregulin increased p21 levels and this was required for the proliferation of MCF7 cells. Treatment with the anti-ErbB2 receptor antibody Herceptin had an inhibitory effect on proliferation only in cells expressing neuregulin but not on cells overexpressing ErbB2, and its inhibitory activity was accompanied by a decrease in p21. These results suggest that Herceptin may also be of help in the treatment of tumors in which neuregulin feeds the tumoral tissue.",

Herceptin is the first approved and most widely used agent for ErbB2-targeting therapy in breast cancer. Even though the clinical application has been performed for more than 10 years, the exact mechanism underlying how Herceptin exhibits its effects has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that Herceptin could inhibit the expression of survivin in ErbB2-overexpressed cell lines. Overexpression of survivin could abrogate the inhibition of cell growth induced by Herceptin. Herceptin could reduce survivin expression at the transcriptional level. The beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) pathway played a very crucial role in this cascade. We found that Herceptin could reduce tyrosine phosphorylation levels of ErbB2 and beta-catenin. Herceptin treatment induced degradation of beta-catenin protein, resulting in reduced binding affinity of beta-catenin/TCF4 to the promoter region of survivin. When we cross-mutated the TCF4 binding sites in the promoter region of survivin, the reduction of survivin promoter activity almost diminished. Taken together, we showed that Herceptin could inhibit survivin expression through the ErbB2-beta-catenin/TCF4-survivin pathway in ErbB2-overexpressed breast cancer cells. This indicates that there may be a new cascade axis from ErbB2 to survivin.",

Both proteins are currently the subject of targeted therapeutics that are used in the treatment of breast cancer or which are in clinical trials. The focus of this study was to utilize our inducible model of IGF-IR overexpression to explore the interaction of these two potent oncogenes.;ErbB2 was overexpressed in our RM11A cell line, a murine tumor cell line that overexpresses human IGF-IR in an inducible manner. ErbB2 conferred an accelerated tumor onset and increased tumor incidence after injection of RM11A cells into the mammary glands of syngeneic wild type mice. This was associated with increased proliferation immediately after tumor cell colonization of the mammary gland; however, this effect was lost after tumor establishment. ErbB2 overexpression also impaired the regression of established RM11A tumors following IGF-IR downregulation and enhanced their metastatic potential.;This study has revealed that even in the presence of vast IGF-IR overexpression, a modest increase in ErbB2 can augment tumor establishment in vivo, mediate resistance to IGF-IR downregulation and facilitate metastasis. This supports the growing evidence suggesting a possible advantage of using IGF-IR and ErbB2-directed therapies concurrently in the treatment of breast cancer.",

We hypothesized that Erbb2 activation contributes to UV-induced skin tumorigenesis by suppressing cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of Erbb2 in v-ras(Ha) transgenic mice before UV exposure resulted in both 56% fewer skin tumors and tumors that were 70% smaller. Inhibition of the UV-induced activation of Erbb2 also resulted in milder epidermal hyperplasia, S-phase accumulation, and decreased levels of the cell cycle regulator Cdc25a, suggesting altered cell cycle regulation on inhibition of Erbb2. Further investigation using inhibition or genetic deletion of Erbb2 in vitro revealed reduced Cdc25a levels and increased S-phase arrest in UV-irradiated cells lacking Erbb2 activity. Ectopic expression of Cdc25a prevented UV-induced S-phase arrest in keratinocytes lacking Erbb2 activity, demonstrating that maintenance of Cdc25a by Erbb2 suppresses cell cycle arrest. Examination of checkpoint pathway activation upstream of Cdc25a revealed Erbb2 activation did not alter Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related/Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated activity but increased inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1-Ser(280). Since Akt phosphorylates Chk1-Ser(280), the effect of Erbb2 on phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling during UV-induced cell cycle arrest was determined. Erbb2 ablation reduced the UV-induced activation of PI3K while inhibition of PI3K/Akt increased UV-induced S-phase arrest. Thus, UV-induced Erbb2 activation increases skin tumorigenesis through inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1, Cdc25a maintenance, and suppression of S-phase arrest via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.",

ErbB2 antagonists prolong survival in cancer, but also interfere with homeostatic processes in the heart. ErbB2 is a coreceptor for ErbB4, which is activated by neuregulin-1. This epidermal growth factor-like growth factor is released from endothelial cells in the endocardium and in the myocardial microcirculation, hence contributing to intercellular crosstalk in the ventricle. We look at the physiological aspects of neuregulin-1/ErbB signaling in the ventricle, and review its (mal)adaptive responses in chronic heart failure. We also compare structural aspects of ErbB receptor activation in cancer and cardiac cells, and analyze the mode of action of current ErbB2 antagonists. This allows us to predict how these drugs interfere with paracrine processes in the ventricle. Differences in the mode of action of individual ErbB2 antagonists affect their impact on the function of the ventricle, considered to be \"on-target\" or \"off-target.\" Establishing the relation between the cardiac side effects of ErbB2 antagonists and their impact on paracrine ventricular control mechanisms may direct the design of a next generation of ErbB2 inhibitors. For cardiologists, there are lessons to be learned from the unexpected side effects of ErbB2-targeted cancer therapy.

Here, we demonstrate that ERBB2 overexpression increases the migration of medulloblastoma cells across basement membranes in vitro. Furthermore, using microarray expression profiling, we show that ERBB2 up-regulates the expression of prometastatic genes in medulloblastoma cells. These include S100A4, which was previously shown to promote metastasis of breast cancer. We demonstrate that S100A4 is a direct target of ERBB2 signaling in medulloblastoma cells via a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and that levels of ERBB2 and S100A4 are tightly correlated in samples of primary medulloblastoma.

A total of 20 human breast cancer lines were examined for expression of various receptor tyrosine kinases and activation of their down stream signaling molecules, as well as for their invasion and colony forming ability. The ErbB2 and PI3 kinase pathway inhibitors were tested for the inhibition on breast cancer cell growth and tumor development. Seven of the 20 lines displayed an elevated level of ErbB2, others had varying level of EGF, IGF-1 or insulin receptor. Over 30% of the lines also had constitutive activation of Akt and MAP kinase. The lines displayed a wide range of colony forming and invasion ability. The PI3 kinase pathway inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin inhibited the colony forming ability of all of the lines with the ErbB2 overexpressing lines having a higher sensitivity. A similar trend was observed for inhibition of invasion by LY294002. Rapamycin alone and additively together with herceptin inhibited the breast cancer cell growth especially in ErbB2 overexpressing cells. Rapamycin and herceptin synergistically inhibited tumor growth and endpoint tumor load in a xenograft model using a MCF-7 subline and in a MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic model. Rapamycin and herceptin significantly reduced the level of cyclin D1 and D3 and increased the cleavage of caspase 3 suggesting an increased apoptosis. Our results suggest that rapamycin together with herceptin has an enhanced anti-cancer effect and could be developed as an improved therapeutic regimen for breast cancer.",

We also investigated the relative expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in IDC and normal breast tissues by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry.;Transfection experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in SKBr3 cells indicated that MBP-1 negatively regulates the ERBB2 gene by binding to a genomic region between nucleotide -514 and -262 of the proximal promoter; consistent with this, a concomitant recruitment of HDAC1 and loss of acetylated histone H4 was observed. In addition, we found high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in normal tissues and a statistically significant inverse correlation with ErbB2 expression in the paired tumor samples.;Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the ERBB2 gene is a novel MBP-1 target, and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors suggests that the concomitant high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 may be considered a diagnostic marker of cancer progression for breast IDC.",

It is involved in growth regulation and has a role in the initial phases of cell proliferation, while in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested an involvement also in cell invasion and metastases. It is not clear if these two roles are mutually exclusive and little is known about the mechanisms by which erbB2 may be involved in the control of these processes. Our previous data on patient series suggested that erbB2 might be regulated in different ways depending on the neoplastic status of the cells and that it might be involved in different regulatory pathways. To test this hypothesis we have measured the serum-dependent regulation of erbB2 as a function of the expression of the antimetastatic gene, nm23, in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. The experimental model consisted of three cell lines having different proliferative and invasive potentials: a non-metastatic estrogen receptor (ER) positive cell line, MCF-7; a highly metastatic ER negative cell line, MDA-MB435; and the MDA-MB435 cell line transfected with the nm23-H1 antimetastatic gene (clone H1-177) which has lost the ability to invade and metastasize. We first analysed the serum concentration dependence of invasion and proliferation after 3-4 days of serum deprivation confirming the proliferative and invasive potential of the three cell lines. Modulation of erbB2 expression by different concentrations of serum was then studied. ErbB2 expression in MCF-7 cells showed a complex pattern due to serum modulation, whereas, it was not longer regulated by serum in the MDA-MB435 cell line. In H1-177 cells the erbB2 response to serum was restored and it was very similar to that observed in MCF-7. These data showed a tight association between nm23 and the regulation of erbB2 expression by serum factors suggesting that the role of erbB2 in invasion might be dependent on nm23 expression.",

The tumor was found to harbor both EGFR L858R and ERBB2 S310F alterations and also tested positive for a known TP53 germline mutation. The presence of the EGFR mutation was further validated by direct sequencing. Based on these results, a dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor, afatinib, was chosen for treatment. The patient achieved a rapid, complete, and durable response to afatinib monotherapy, both clinically and radiographically. The treatment was very well tolerated. This unique case raises practical questions as to the challenges of molecular testing and highlights the potential association of p53 mutations with concurrent EGFR and ERBB2 aberrations.

Muc4 can also potentiate signal transduction by modulating differential ErbB2 phosphorylation in the absence and in the presence of the ErbB3 soluble ligand heregulin (HRG-beta1). These features of Muc4 suggest that Muc4 is not merely a cancer marker, but an oncogenic factor with a unique-binding/activation relationship with the receptor ErbB2. In the present study, we examined the signaling mechanisms that are associated with the Muc4-ErbB2 module by analyzing ErbB2 differential signaling in response to Muc4 expression. Our study was carried out in the A375 human melanoma and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines as our model systems. Quantitative and comparative signaling modulations were evaluated by immunoblot using phospho-specific antibodies, and densitometry analysis. Signaling complex components were identified by chemical cross-linking, fractionation by gel filtration, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Activated downstream signaling pathways were analyzed by an antibody microarray screen and immunoblot analyses. Our results indicate that Muc4 modulates ErbB2 signaling potential significantly by stabilizing and directly interacting with the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer. Further analyses indicate that Muc4 promotes ErbB2 autocatalysis, but it has no effect on ErbB3 phosphorylation, although the chemical cross-linking data indicated that the signaling module is composed of Muc4, ErbB2, and ErbB3. Our microarray analysis indicates that Muc4 expression promotes cell migration by increasing the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase and also through an increase in the levels of beta-catenin.",

Here, we used cDNA and comparative genomic hybridization microarray technologies to undertake a broad survey of genes involved in the 17q12 amplification in breast cancer. A chromosomal region-specific cDNA microarray containing 217 expressed sequence tag (EST) clones from 17q12 was constructed and used for parallel analysis of gene copy numbers and expression levels in seven breast cancer cell lines allowing direct identification of genes whose expression is elevated because of an increase in copy number in this chromosomal region. The copy number and expression survey identified 12 transcripts that showed a consistent pattern of increased copy number and expression in three or more of the 17q12-amplified cell lines. As expected, these included ERBB2 as well as the GRB7 and MLN64 genes previously shown to be coamplified with ERBB2. In addition, five other known genes and four uncharacterized ESTs were also found to be consistently activated by amplification in these breast cancer cell lines. Amplicon mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a minimal common region of amplification containing four highly expressed genes, ERBB2, GRB7, MLN64, and an uncharacterized EST 48582. Furthermore, several other genes, although not located in the minimal common region of amplification, showed a correlated pattern of amplification and expression indicating that they might play a role in breast cancers with the 17q12 amplification. In conclusion, parallel analysis of gene copy number and expression levels by cDNA microarray can be used to directly identify candidate target genes involved in amplifications.

MPPS1 cells maintain high ErbB2 overexpression when propagated in DFCI-1 or related media, and their growth is ErbB2-dependent, as demonstrated by concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation with the ErbB kinase inhibitor Lapatinib. When grown in 3-dimensional (3-D) culture on Matrigel, MPPS1 cells predominantly form large irregular cystic and solid structures. Remarkably, low concentrations of Lapatinib led to a switch to regular acinar growth on Matrigel.

In contrast, amplification of c-erbB2 in tumors results in dramatic overexpression and constitutive activation of the receptor. Breast cancer cells overexpressing ErbB2 depend on its activity for proliferation, because treatment of these cells with ErbB2-specific antagonistic antibodies or kinase inhibitors blocks tumor cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Intriguingly, loss of ErbB2 signaling is accompanied by a decrease in the phosphotyrosine content of ErbB3. On the basis of these results, it has been proposed that ErbB3 might be a partner for ErbB2 in promoting cellular transformation. To test this hypothesis and directly examine the role of the \"kinase dead\" ErbB3, we specifically ablated its expression with a designer transcription factor (E3). By infection of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells with a retrovirus expressing E3, we show that ErbB3 is an essential partner in the transformation process. Loss of functional ErbB2 or ErbB3 has similar effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle regulators. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active protein kinase B rescues the proliferative block induced as a consequence of loss of ErbB2 or ErbB3 signaling. These results demonstrate that ErbB2 overexpression and activity alone are insufficient to promote breast tumor cell division. Furthermore, we identify ErbB3's role, which is to couple active ErbB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway. Thus, the ErbB2/ErbB3 dimer functions as an oncogenic unit to drive breast tumor cell proliferation.",

DC pulsing resulted in cross-presentation of ErbB2 both in HLAI and HLAII compartments, and ErbB2-specific CD8+ T cells from cancer patients were activated by DCs pulsed with vesicle-bound ErbB2. The microvesicle cell factory proposed may represent a source of cell free immunogen to be used for DC-based cancer therapy.",

Recently, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of ErbB2 protein in osteosarcoma is associated with the presence of pulmonary metastasis and decreased survival. By contrast, a previous study showed that the expression of ErbB2 declines in individual osteosarcomas as they become metastatic. In the current study, the authors determined the relation between ErbB2 status and outcome in a large number of selected patients with high-grade osteosarcoma.;ErbB2 status was determined immunohistochemically in biopsy specimens of osteosarcoma of the extremities from 81 patients who were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. None of the patients had metastatic disease at presentation (Stage II), and all were followed-up for at least five years. The ErbB2 status was analyzed in relation to the lengths of event-free and overall survival.;Of the 81 tumors examined, 51 (61%) demonstrated high levels of ErbB2 expression. The presence of increased levels of ErbB2 in osteosarcoma was significantly associated with the increased probability of event-free (72.2% v. 45.6% at 5 years, P = 0.03) and overall survival (79.7% v. 58.2% at 5 years, P = 0.03). Cox multivariate analysis showed that the risk of adverse events and death was increased substantially (rate ratio: 2.24 and 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.72 and 1.09-5.67, respectively) among patients with decreased levels of ErbB2 protein in tumor cells, as compared with patients who had increased levels of ErbB2 in tumor cells.;In patients with high-grade osteosarcoma without metastatic disease at presentation and treated with surgery and chemotherapy, the presence of increased levels of ErbB2 in tumor cells is associated with a significantly increased probability of event-free and overall survival.

Because signaling molecules and pathways cooperate to drive cancer progression, simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways is an appealing therapeutic strategy. With this in mind, we examined breast tumor cells for their sensitivity to the ErbB2 and FGFR inhibitors, PKI166 and PD173074, respectively. Simultaneous blocking of ErbB2 and FGFR-4 in MDA-MB-453 tumor cells had a stronger anti-proliferative effect than treatment with individual inhibitors. Examination of cell cycle regulators revealed a novel translation-mediated mechanism whereby ErbB2 and FGFR-4 cooperate to regulate cyclin D1 levels. Our results showed that FGFR-4 and ErbB2 via the MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathways, respectively, both contribute to the maintenance of constitutive activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin translational pathway. Dual inhibition of these receptors strongly blocked S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activity and cyclin D1 translation, as attested by a decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA association with polysomes. Ectopic expression of active protein kinase B or active S6K1 abrogated the dual inhibitor-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, demonstrating the importance of these FGFR-4/ErbB2 signaling targets in regulating cyclin D1 translation. S6K1 has the central role in this process, since small interfering RNA-targeted S6K1 depletion led to a decrease in cellular S6K1 activity and, as a consequence, repression of cyclin D1 expression. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism for controlling cyclin D1 expression downstream of combined activity of ErbB2 and FGFR-4 that involves S6K1-mediated translation.",

Trastuzumab, which is thought to act, at least in part, by downregulating ErbB2 expression is only effective in approximately 30-40% of ErbB2 positive breast tumors. Geldanamycin and its derivative 17-AAG are potential antitumor agents capable of downregulating client proteins of Hsp90, including ErbB2. To investigate the ability of 17-AAG to downregulate ErbB2 in trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells and the possibility of 17-AAG and trastuzumab potentiating each other's effect, the recently established trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cell line, JIMT-1 was compared to the known trastuzumab sensitive SKBR-3 line. Baseline and stimulus-evoked dimerization and activation levels of ErbB2, and the effects of trastuzumab and 17-AAG alone and in combination on cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as on ErbB2 expression and phosphorylation have been measured. Baseline activation and amenability to activation and downregulation by trastuzumab was much lower in the resistant line. However, 17-AAG enhanced ErbB2 homodimerization after 5-10 min of treatment in both cell lines, and decreased proliferation with an IC50 of 70 nM for SKBR-3 and 10nM for JIMT-1. Thus, 17-AAG may be a useful drug in trastuzumab resistant ErbB2 overexpressing tumors. The antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG was positively correlated with phosphorylation and downregulation of ErbB2 and was dominated by apoptosis, although, especially at higher doses, necrosis was also present. Interestingly, IC50 values for ErbB2 downregulation and phosphorylation, in the 30-40 nM range, were not significantly different for the two cell lines. This observation and the negative correlation between resting ErbB2 levels and the antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG may indicate that activation of ErbB2 to some extent could counteract the overall cytostatic effect, especially at higher levels of ErbB2 expression. The usual therapeutic dose of trastuzumab did not change the IC50 of 17-AAG on the proliferation of either cell line, but nevertheless decreased overall ErbB2 phosphorylation and at low doses of 17-AAG further decreased cell growth in the sensitive SKBR-3, thus trastuzumab may be a good combination partner to counteract undesired activating effects of 17-AAG.",

Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification using representative tumor sections showed gain of CCND1 and coincident amplification of ERBB2 or EGFR or neither. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the tumor comprised three cancer-cell populations: well-differentiated SCC with high-level ERBB2 amplification and ERBB2 overexpression, more infiltrative poorly-differentiated SCC with high-level EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression, and poorly-differentiated SCC lacking any ERBB2 or EGFR abnormality. These three populations each had low-level CCND1 amplification and nuclear cyclin D1 overexpression. This histological topology and gene amplification combinations suggested that genetic instability first produced CCND1 amplification, and then ERBB2 or EGFR gene amplification occurred. It is further speculated that during cancer progression and clonal selection indecisive predominance of either clone caused the rare co-amplification of ERBB2 and EGFR in a single chimeric tumor.",

In the present study, we sought to identify genes involved in ERBB2-mediated chemoresistance to docetaxel. We generated SAGE libraries from two human mammary cell lines expressing basal (HB4a) and high (C5.2) levels of ERBB2 before and after intensive exposure to docetaxel and identified potential ERBB2 target genes implicated in a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, cell adhesion, apoptosis and cytoskeleton organization. Comparison of the transcriptome of the cell lines before and after docetaxel exposure revealed substantially different expression patterns. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes between HB4a and C5.2 cell lines, before and after docetaxel treatment, were further analyzed by qPCR. The alterations in the expression patterns in HB4a and C5.2 cell lines in response to docetaxel treatment observed by SAGE analysis were confirmed by qPCR for the majority of the genes analyzed.

Herceptin, a humanized antibody directed to the ErbB2 receptor, has been proven to be effective in the immunotherapy of breast cancer. However, it can result in cardiotoxicity, and a large fraction of breast cancer patients are resistant to Herceptin treatment. We have engineered three novel, fully human, anti-ErbB2 immunoagents: Erbicin, a human single-chain antibody fragment; ERB-hRNase, a human immunoRNase composed of Erbicin fused to a human RNase; ERB-hcAb, a human 'compact' antibody in which two Erbicin molecules are fused to the Fc fragment of a human IgG1. Both ERB-hRNase and ERB-hcAb strongly inhibit the growth of ErbB2-positive cells in vivo. The interactions of the Erbicin-derived immunoagents and Herceptin with the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2-ECD) were investigated for the first time by three different methods. Erbicin-derived immunoagents bind soluble extracellular domain with a lower affinity than that measured for the native antigen on tumour cells. Herceptin, by contrast, shows a higher affinity for soluble ErbB2-ECD. Accordingly, ErbB2-ECD abolished the in vitro antitumour activity of Herceptin, with no effect on that of Erbicin-derived immunoagents. These results suggest that the fraction of immunoagent neutralized by free extracellular domain shed into the bloodstream is much higher for Herceptin than for Erbicin-derived immunoagents, which therefore may be used at lower therapeutic doses than those employed for Herceptin.",

Using the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 as a model for ERBB2 and ERBB3 dependence, infection of these cells with retroviral constructs expressing either miR-125a or miR-125b resulted in suppression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 at both the transcript and protein level. Luciferase constructs containing the 3' 3'-untranslated regions of ERBB2 and ERBB3 demonstrated approximately 35% less activity in miR-125a- and miR-125b-expressing cells relative to controls. Additionally, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT was suppressed in SKBR3 cells overexpressing either miR-125a or miR-125b. Consistent with suppression of both ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling, miR-125a-or miR-125b-overexpressing SKBR3 cells were impaired in their anchorage-dependent growth and exhibited reduced migration and invasion capacities. Parallel studies performed on MCF10A cells demonstrated that miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression produced only marginal influences on the growth and migration of these non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells.

Genetic deletion of cyclin D1 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) to cyclin D1-reduced Notch1 activity and reintroduction of cyclin D1 into cyclin D1-deficient cells restored Notch1 activity through the inhibition of Numb, an endogenous inhibitor of Notch1 activity.

Following NE treatment, we found a marked and sustained decrease in epithelial proliferation as detected by Ki67 immunostaining. 3H-thymidine incorporation was also initially depressed but increased over 72 h in NE-treated cells, which suggests that DNA synthesis constitutes an early repair process following NE exposure. We hypothesized that ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, a regulator of cancer cell proliferation, was required for epithelial DNA synthesis following NE exposure. Immediately following NE treatment, by flow cytometry analysis, we found a decrease in ErbB2 surface expression. Protein levels of the full-length 185 kD ErbB2 receptor significantly decreased following NE treatment and smaller ErbB2-positive bands, ranging in size from 23 to 40 kD, appeared, which suggests that NE caused ErbB2 degradation. By real-time RT-PCR analysis, we found no change in ErbB2 mRNA expression following NE treatment, which suggests that changes in ErbB2 protein levels were regulated at the post-translational level. Following NE treatment, full-length 185 kD ErbB2 levels increased to pretreatment levels, correlating with the increase in thymidine incorporation during the same time period. Importantly, inhibition of ErbB2 activity with AG825 (5 microM) or Herceptin (3.1 microM), an ErbB2-neutralizing antibody, blocked thymidine incorporation only in NE-treated cells.

A total of 61 significantly up- or downregulated (2.0-fold) genes were identified and further validated by RT-PCR analysis as well as microarray comparisons with a spontaneously ERBB2- overexpressing breast cancer cell line and ERBB2-positive primary breast tumors. The expression and clinical relevance of proteins predicted to be associated with ERBB2 overexpression in breast cancers were analysed together with their clinical relevance by antibody screening using a tissue array. Differentially regulated genes include those involved in cell-matrix interactions including proline 4-hydroxylase (P4HA2), galectin 1 (LGALS1) and galectin 3 (LGALS3), fibronectin 1 (FN1) and p-cadherin (CDH3), and cell proliferation (CRIP1, IGFBP3) and transformation (S100P, S100A4). A number of genes associated with MYC signalling were also differentially expressed, including NDRG1, USF2 and the epithelial membrane proteins 1 and 3 (EMP1, EMP3). These data represent profiles of the transcriptional changes associated with ERBB2-related pathways in the breast, and identify novel and potentially useful targets for prognosis and therapy.",

Oestrogen receptor (ER) positive tumour-derived cell lines are known to express relatively low levels of ERBB2 protein under oestrogenic conditions, but markedly higher levels following withdrawal of oestrogens or administration of tamoxifen. Expression of the closely related ERBB3 gene, which co-operates with ERBB2 in cellular transformation, is now shown to respond to oestrogenic manipulation in a similar way, both responses being mediated largely by transcriptional changes. Six previously undescribed DNase I hypersensitive sites occur within the first intron of ERBB2 in cells that overexpress the gene. A 409 base pair DNA fragment containing one of these sites conferred ER dependent oestrogen inhibition on the ERBB2 promoter in two types of transient transfection assay. DNase I footprinting revealed four separate transcription factor binding sites within this fragment consistent with a role as a transcriptional enhancer. These findings implicate intron 1 sequences in the control of ERBB2 expression for the first time and demonstrate that one site within this region is involved in mediating the transcriptional response to oestrogens. Additionally, there is likely to be synergism between ERBB2 and ERBB3 signalling when both are overexpressed in response to oestrogen inhibition, thereby driving transformed cell behaviour.",

Tissue RNA was prepared and the specific mRNA analyzed by the highly sensitive nuclease S1 protection assay. Oncogene mRNA in the tumors was quantified by comparison with the homogeneously weak signals in normal lung tissue preparations with densitometry. The presence of two- to four-fold excess RNA was defined as moderate and a greater than fourfold RNA amount as strong gene overexpression. In contrast to normal tissue the oncogene mRNA amount varied considerably among tumors, showing increases up to 64-fold in erbB2, 13-fold in Ki-ras, and 57-fold in c-myc. Moderate and strong (in brackets) mRNA overexpression occurred with 33% (33%) in erbB2, 36% (18%) in Ki-ras, and 18% (23%) in c-myc. Simultaneous overexpression of two genes was observed with 41% and increased mRNA of all genes tested with 20% of the NSCLC samples. Augmented oncogene mRNA was observed most frequently in large-cell carcinoma. The c-myc overexpression was significantly more prevalent in large-cell cancer than in adenocarcinoma.

The amplification/overexpression occurs in 25 to 30% of all breast cancers. In breast cancer, aneusomy of chromosome 17, either monosomy or polysomy, is frequently observed by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The aim of this study was to discover whether or not numerical aberrations on chromosome 17 have a correlation to the amplification or overexpression of the ERBB2 gene and to analyze their clinical implications in subgroups showing 2+ or 3+ positive scores by immunohistochemistry (IHC).;We used FISH on a series of 175 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas to detect ERBB2 amplification, using a dual-probe system for the simultaneous enumeration of the ERBB2 gene and the centromeric region of chromosome 17, as well as using IHC to detect overexpression. We analyzed clinical and pathological variables in a subgroup of patients with 2+ and 3+ IHC scores (147 patients), to describe any differences in clinicopathological characteristics between polysomic and non-polysomic cases with the use of the chi2 test.;We found 13% of cases presenting polysomy, and three cases presented monosomy 17 (2%). According to the status of the ERBB2 gene, instances of polysomy 17 were more frequently observed in non-amplified cases than in FISH-amplified cases, suggesting that the mechanism for ERBB2 amplification is independent of polysomy 17. Polysomy 17 was detected in patients with 2+ and 3+ IHC scores. We found that nodal involvement was more frequent in polysomic than in non-polysomic cases (P = 0.046).;The determination of the copy number of chromosome 17 should be incorporated into the assesment of ERBB2 status.

The amino acid sequence of the loop determines the electrostatic and hydrophobic character of the protein's surface, which in turn govern interaction with Hsp90. A point mutation within the loop that alters ErbB2 surface properties disrupts Hsp90 association and confers GA resistance.

Although much work has focused on the role of these growth factor receptors in the differentiation of a variety of tissues, there is little information in regards to normal stromal cells. We investigated erbB2 expression in the murine fibroblast cell line Swiss 3T3L1, which naturally or hormonally induced undergoes adipocyte differentiation. We found that the Swiss 3T3-L1 fibroblasts express erbB2, in addition to EGFR, and in a quantity comparable to or even greater than the breast cancer cell line T47D. Proliferating cells increased erbB2 and EGFR levels when reaching confluence up to 4- and 10-fold, respectively. This expression showed a significant decrease when growth-arrested cells were stimulated to differentiate with dexamethasone and isobutyl-methylxanthine. Differentiated cells presented a decreased expression of both erbB2 and EGFR regardless of whether the cells were hormonally or spontaneously differentiated. EGF stimulation of serum-starved cells increased erbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation and retarded erbB2 migration in SDS-PAGE, suggesting receptor association and activation. Heregulin-alpha1 and -beta1, two EGF related factors, had no effect on erbB2 or EGFR phosphorylation. Although 3T3-L1 cells expressed heregulin, its specific receptors, erbB3 and erbB4, were not found. This is the first time in which erbB2 is reported to be expressed in an adipocytic cell line which does not depend on non EGF family growth factors (thyroid hormone, growth hormone, etc.) to accomplish adipose differentiation.

Only patients overexpressing ERBB2 are treated with trastuzumab, whereas its use in tumours without ERBB2 expression is useless. This led to the concept that the subgroup of trastuzumab-sensitive tumours is 'ERBB2-dependent', meaning that ERBB2 signalling is indispensable for growth of these tumours. We used a mouse model that allows anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-controlled downregulation of ERBB2 in tumour tissue. ERBB2 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated below detection limit leading to a macroscopically complete tumour remission within 14 days. Tumour remission was accompanied by a strong decrease in proliferation, a moderate increase in apoptosis, as well as dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB. These data clearly indicate ERBB2 dependence. Therefore, a high sensitivity to trastuzumab may be suspected. Surprisingly, trastuzumab caused a much weaker effect compared to ATc-induced ERBB2 downregulation, although a decrease in ERBB2 membrane localisation was induced. Only a slight decrease in proliferation and a weak transient increase in apoptosis were observed. Interestingly, tumours responded to trastuzumab by a sharp fivefold increase in phosphorylated AKT/PKB as well as a 3.5- and 5.3-fold increase in AKT1 and AKT2 mRNA levels, respectively. In conclusion, 'ERBB2 dependence' is not sufficient to define trastuzumab-responsive tumours. The suboptimal effect of trastuzumab compared to the maximally possible effect induced by ATc demonstrates a high potential for improved ERBB2 blocking therapies.",

Our goal was to establish a new method to assign oestrogen receptor and ERBB2-receptor status to breast carcinoma based on mRNA expression measured using Affymetrix U133A gene-expression profiling.;We used gene expression data of 495 breast cancer samples to assess the correlation between oestrogen receptor (ESR1) and ERBB2 mRNA and clinical status of these genes (as established by immunohistochemical [IHC] or fluorescence in-situ hybridisation [FISH], or both). Data from 195 fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples were used to define mRNA cutoff values that assign receptor status. We assessed the accuracy of these cutoffs in two independent datasets: 123 FNA samples and 177 tissue samples (ie, resected or core-needle biopsied tissues). Profiling was done at two institutions by use of the same platform (Affymetrix U133A GeneChip). All data were uniformly normalised with dCHIP software.;ESR1 and ERBB2 mRNA levels correlated closely with routine measurements for receptor status in all three datasets. Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.62 to 0.77. An ESR1 mRNA cutoff value of 500 identified oestrogen-receptor-positive status with an overall accuracy of 90% (training set), 88% (first validation set), and 96% (second validation set). An ERBB2 mRNA threshold of 1150 identified ERBB2-positive status with the overall accuracy of 93% (training set), 89% (first validation set), and 90% (second validation set). Reproducibility of mRNA measurements in 34 replicate experiments was high (correlation coefficient 0.975 for ESR1, 0.984 for ERBB2).;Amounts of ESR1 and ERBB2 mRNA as measured by the Affymetrix GeneChip reliably and reproducibly establish oestrogen-receptor status and ERBB2 status, respectively.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cardiotoxicity is a common and potentially devastating side effect of antineoplastic drug therapy. This empiric observation is seen as paradoxical given that the cardiomyocyte is considered to be a terminally differentiated cell. Despite the fact that these cells do not divide after birth, adult cardiomyocytes may become \"innocent bystander\" targets of anticancer drugs designed to interfere with cell signaling pathways in rapidly proliferating cells. In breast cancer clinical trials, treatment with the erbB2 receptor antibody trastuzumab combined with anthracyclines has been associated with an increased risk for the development of cardiac pump failure. Trastuzumab/anthracycline cardiomyopathy may be the first clinically significant cardiotoxicity to emerge from signal transduction therapeutics. The erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is known to have a critical role in cardiac development. In addition, erbB2 is thought to participate in an important pathway for growth, repair, and survival of adult cardiomyocytes as part of a signaling network that involves neuregulins and the neuregulin receptor erbB4. However, erbB2 levels in the adult heart are low when compared with the levels found in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells that are the intended targets of trastuzumab therapy. Thus, trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity must be explained by some alternative mechanism. After confirming that trastuzumab is capable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the human cardiomyocyte erbB2 protein, a novel system for culturing human myocardium was developed in our laboratory. We used this system to study the effects of trastuzumab on human cardiomyocytes in vitro and observed trastuzumab-induced structural and functional changes in human cardiomyocytes that were at least partially reversible with the addition of recombinant neuregulins. The results obtained in these experiments support a direct action of trastuzumab on human cardiomyocytes. In addition, these data provide insight regarding potential molecular mechanisms. Most importantly, these data draw attention to the inherent risk of cardiotoxicity associated with a newly emerging class of antineoplastic drugs that interfere with signal transduction pathways.",

The present study reveals that a polymorphism (rs12976445) within the pri-miR-125a sequence correlates with the amount of mature hsa-miR-125a in breast tumor samples. miRNA, RNA and DNA were extracted from breast cancer samples obtained from 26 patients.

The recent demonstration that mutant epidermal growth factor receptor is an Hsp90 client, irrespective of the presence of the secondary threonine-to-methionine amino acid substitution mutation at position 790 mediating anilinoquinazoline resistance, suggests Hsp90 inhibition as a novel strategy against this group of lung cancers. The rarer epidermal growth factor receptors harboring exon 20 insertions and vIII mutations are also Hsp90 clients. Lung cancers may also be driven by mutant ErbB2, mutant B-Raf, or mutant or overexpressed c-Met, all of which are also degraded on Hsp90 inhibition. Hsp90 inhibitors may be synergistic with other drugs that disrupt chaperone function, including inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 and the proteasome and agents that inhibit Hsp70 function. Hsp90 plays a unique antiapoptotic role in small cell lung cancer cells, so that Hsp90 inhibition results in substantial cell death in both chemosensitive and chemoresistant small cell lung cancer cell lines. Clinically, the geldanamycin compounds are the most mature, with manageable toxic effects.

Because breast cancer initiation is different between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and women who do not carry mutations, it is possible that the mechanism of breast cancer progression is also different. Histopathologic and genetic studies have supported this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis further, we utilized a large cohort of women who underwent therapeutic mastectomy (TM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (PM). From this cohort, we developed case groups of women with a family history of breast cancer with BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations, with unclassified variant alterations, and with no detected mutation and matched these cases with sporadic controls from the same TM and PM cohort. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on paraffin sections by use of dual-color probes for ERBB2/CEP17, MYC/CEP8, TBX2/CEP17, and RPS6KB1/CEP17. All malignant and benign lesions, including putative precursor lesions, were studied. The invasive cancers from deleterious mutation carriers had a higher prevalence of duplication of MYC (P = 0.006) and TBX2 (P = 0.0008) compared to controls and a lower prevalence of ERBB2 amplification (P = 0.011). Coduplication of MYC and TBX2 was common in the in situ and invasive lesions from the deleterious mutation carriers. The odds ratio of having a BRCA1/2 mutation is 31.4 (95% CI = 1.7-569) when MYC and TBX2 are coduplicated but ERBB2 is normal. Unclassified variant carriers/no mutation detected and sporadic controls had a similar prevalence of alterations, suggesting that hereditary patients with no deleterious mutations follow a progression pathway similar to that of sporadic cases. With the exception of one atypical ductal hyperplasia lesion, no putative precursor lesion showed any detectable alteration of the probes tested. There was no significant intratumoral heterogeneity of genetic alterations. Our data confirm that a specific pattern of genomic instability characterizes BRCA1/2-related cancers and that this pattern has implications for the biology of these cancers. Moreover, our current and previous results emphasize the interaction between phenotype and genotype in BRCA1/2-related breast cancers and that a combination of morphologic features and alterations of ERBB2, MYC, and TBX2 may better define mechanisms of tumor progression, as well as determine which patients are more likely to carry BRCA1/2 mutations.",

By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations, we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar.

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB2 (HER2, Neu), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase family, is often overexpressed in breast cancer and other malignancies. ErbB2 homodimerizes but also presents as a common auxiliary subunit of the EGF and heregulin receptors (erbB1 or EGFR; and erbB3-4, respectively), with which it heteroassociates. ErbB2 is generally regarded as an orphan (ligand-less) receptor with a very potent kinase domain activated either via its associated partners or constitutively as a consequence of discrete mutations. It follows that the extent and regulation of its cell surface interactions are of central importance. We have studied the large-scale association pattern of erbB2 in quiescent and activated cells labeled with fluorescent anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibodies using scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). ErbB2 was found to be concentrated in irregular membrane patches with a mean diameter of approx. 0.5 microm in nonactivated SKBR3 and MDA453 human breast tumor cells. The average number of erbB2 proteins in a single cluster on nonactivated SKBR3 cells was about 10(3). Activation of SKBR3 cells with EGF, heregulin as well as a partially agonistic anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibody led to an increase in the mean cluster diameter to 0.6-0.9 microm, irrespective of the ligand. The EGF-induced increase in the erbB2 cluster size was inhibited by the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035. The average size of erbB2 clusters on the erbB2-transfected line of CHO cells (CB2) was similar to that of activated SKBR3 cells, a finding correlated with the increased base-line tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB2 in cells expressing only erbB2. We conclude that an increase in cluster size may constitute a general phenomenon in the activation of erbB2.",

Exposure of keratinocytes to UVA has previously been reported to lead to the activation of a variety of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), including ErbB2, and ErbB2 activation is involved in skin tumor development. Here, we demonstrate that ErbB2 expression is enhanced by low-energy UVA (300-3000 mJ/cm(2)) irradiation in the skin tissues of both hairless mice and HaCaT keratinocytes. Luciferase reporter-gene activity using the 756-bp flanking region of the human erbB2 gene was increased by UVA irradiation. UVA irradiation also selectively increased the levels of activator protein (AP)-2 alpha, but not AP-2 beta and AP-2 gamma. The increase in the reporter gene activity of HaCaT cells exposed to UVA was abolished by mutation of the two AP-2 binding sites in the promoter region of the erbB2 gene. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase caused complete blockage of ErbB2 induction and AP-2 alpha activation by UVA irradiation. Finally, we reveal that pre-exposure of HaCaT cells to UVA potentiates EGF-inducible anchorage-independent growth of the keratinocytes, which is significantly suppressed by ErbB2 inhibition. These results support the hypothesis that UVA enhances the expression of ErbB2 via cAMP- and protein kinase-dependent AP-2 alpha activation in keratinocytes, which may serve as a key mechanistic basis for the malignant transformation of keratinocytes exposed to UVA irradiation.",

Previous studies suggest that WWP1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, the mechanism of WWP1 action is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that WWP1 upregulates and maintains erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) in multiple cell lines. WWP1 depletion dramatically attenuates the EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. WWP1 forms a protein complex with RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a negative regulator of ErbB2 and EGFR. The protein-protein interaction is through the first and third WW domains of WWP1 and the PY motif of RNF11. Although WWP1 is able to ubiquitinate RNF11 in vitro and in vivo, WWP1 neither targets RNF11 for degradation nor changes RNF11's cellular localization. Importantly, inhibition of RNF11 can rescue WWP1 siRNA-induced ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation and growth arrest. Finally, we demonstrated that RNF11 is overexpressed in a panel of prostate and breast cancer cell lines with WWP1 expression.

To understand the mechanism of doxorubicin cardiac toxicity and the potent synergic effect seen when doxorubicin is combined with anti-ErbB2 (trastuzumab), we developed an in vivo rat model that exhibits progressive dose-dependent cardiac damage and loss of cardiac function after doxorubicin treatment. The hearts of these animals respond to doxorubicin damage by increasing levels of ErbB2 and the ErbB family ligand, neuregulin 1beta, and by activating the downstream Akt signaling pathway. These increases in ErbB2 protein levels are not due to increased ErbB2 mRNA, however, suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms for regulating this protein in the heart. Accordingly, levels of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a known ErbB2 protein stabilizer and chaperone, are increased by doxorubicin treatment, and coimmunoprecipitation reveals binding of HSP90 to ErbB2. Isolated cardiomyocytes are more susceptible to doxorubicin after treatment with HSP90 inhibitor, 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, suggesting that the HSP90 is protective during doxorubicin treatment. Thus, our results provide one plausible mechanism for the susceptibility of the heart to anti-ErbB2 therapy post-doxorubicin therapy in subclinical and clinical conditions. Additionally, these results suggest that further testing is needed for HSP90 inhibitors under various conditions in the heart.",

Mutations conferring the greatest lapatinib resistance cluster in the NH2-terminal kinase lobe and hinge region. Structural computer modeling studies suggest that lapatinib resistance is caused by multiple mechanisms; including direct steric interference and restriction of conformational flexibility (the inactive state required for lapatinib binding is energetically unfavorable). ErbB2 T798I imparts the strongest lapatinib resistance effect and is analogous to the epidermal growth factor receptor T790M, ABL T315I, and cKIT T670I gatekeeper mutations that are associated with clinical drug resistance. ErbB2 mutants associated with lapatinib resistance transformed NIH-3T3 cells, including L755S and T733I mutations known to occur in human breast and gastric carcinomas, supporting a direct mechanism for lapatinib resistance in ErbB2-driven human cancers. The epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB2/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor EXEL-7647 was found to inhibit almost all lapatinib resistance-associated mutations. Furthermore, no ErbB2 mutations were found to be associated with EXEL-7647 resistance and lapatinib sensitivity.;Taken together, these data suggest potential target-based mechanisms of resistance to lapatinib and suggest that EXEL-7647 may be able to circumvent these effects.",

Phosphopeptide competition and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Tyr-1139 of erbB2 is the major binding site for the Grb7 SH2 domain, indicating an overlap in binding specificity between the Grb7 and Grb2 SH2 domains. Substituting individual amino acids in the Grb14 SH2 domain with the corresponding residues from Grb7 demonstrated that a Gln to Leu change at the betaD6 position imparted high affinity erbB2 interaction, paralleled by a marked increase in affinity for the Tyr-1139 phosphopeptide.

We therefore tested an ErbB1-(CGP059326) and an ErbB1/ErbB2-(PKI166) tyrosine kinase inhibitor in an in-vitro system of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and assessed their effects on 1. cell viability, 2. myofibrillar structure, 3. contractile function, and 4.

These changes were associated with an inhibition of excitation-contraction coupling. PKI but not CGP decreased p-Erk1/2, suggesting a role for this MAP-kinase signaling pathway in the maintenance of myofibrils.

A major contributor for this course of the disease is the insensitivity of these tumors toward chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, inhibiting the ligand-induced activation of the receptor and tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting on the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the intracellular domain, have been developed as targeted drugs. Both have been shown to be beneficial for breast cancer patients. We targeted a third aspect of receptor function: its association with intracellular signaling components. For this purpose, we selected peptide aptamers, which specifically interact with defined domains of the intracellular part of the receptor. The peptide aptamers were selected from a random peptide library using a yeast two-hybrid system with the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB2 as a bait construct. The peptide aptamer AII-7 interacts with high specificity with the ErbB2 receptor in vitro and in vivo. The aptamers colocalized with the intracellular domain of ErbB2 within cells. We investigated the functional consequences of the aptamer interaction with the ErbB2 receptor within tumor cells. The aptamer sequences were either expressed intracellularly or introduced into the cells as recombinant aptamer proteins. The phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase was nearly unaffected and the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 was only modestly reduced. In contrast, they strongly inhibited the induction of AKT kinase in MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with heregulin, whereas AKT activation downstream of insulin-like growth factor I or epidermal growth factor receptor was not or only slightly affected. High AKT activity is responsible for the enhanced resistance of ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells toward chemotherapeutic agents. Peptide aptamer interference with AKT activation resulted in the restoration of regular sensitivity of breast cancer cells toward Taxol.",

Interestingly, MYC but not ERBB2 RNA levels were increased (t-test, P = 0.03) in benign mastopathies of patients with a first-degree (mother/sister) family history (FH) of breast cancer. Among patients without a first-degree FH, MYC RNA levels were significantly higher (t-test, P = 0.02) during the follicular (preovulatory) than the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase and also significantly higher than levels observed in patients with no menstrual cycle (peri- or postmenopausal) (P = 0.004), indicating an in vivo hormonal regulation of MYC. After exclusion of the first-degree FH patients a higher MYC expression was detected in atypia than in other histological types at the follicular but not at the luteal phase, suggesting an increased sensitivity of these high-risk lesions to estrogens. We propose that in addition to a family history and proliferative atypia, elevated MYC RNA levels during the post-ovulatory phase could potentially be used as a marker of the risk of developing breast cancer.

Less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in HNSCC patients.;We analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established HNSCC lines in vitro. IC50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. ErbB signaling was assessed by Western and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pEGFR, pErbB2, pErbB3, pAkt, and pErk. EGFR sequences encoding kinase domain and EGFR gene copy numbers were determined by cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux).;Expression levels of pErbB2 (P = 0.02) and total ErbB3 protein (P = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC. However, other EGFR/ErbB receptor family members than EGFR may contribute to resistance to gefitinib.

Estradiol promoted cell proliferation and activated erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling exclusively in mammary and breast epithelial cell lines with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3.

Here we examined whether the variable amplicon size may be associated with patient response to trastuzumab. In addition, we looked at associations between response and several signaling pathway-related genes unrelated to the ERBB2 amplicon, including AKT3, PTEN, PIK3CA, and PTGS2. In 35 patients with ERBB2-amplified metastatic breast cancer, with 40% overall response to trastuzumab, fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the telomeric extent of the ERBB2 amplicon and the status of the several pathway-related genes. Objective response strongly correlated with the telomeric amplicon size, with 62% of patients with shorter amplicons responding, compared with only 7% of patients with longer amplicons (P = 0.0015). Abnormal copy number of PTGS2 was marginally associated with objective response (P = 0.066), while abnormal copy numbers of two reference loci, 1q25 and the chromosome 10 centromere, were significantly associated with response. Pairwise combinations of copy number status of these loci and ERBB2 amplicon size provided stronger associations and identified a group of patients without responders.

Given that integrins and growth factor receptors are highly interdependent for function, we examined the role of integrin subunits in ErbB2-mediated survival signaling. Here, we show that MCF-10A cells overexpressing ErbB2 upregulate integrin alpha5 via the MAP-kinase pathway in three-dimensional acini and found elevated integrin alpha5 levels associated with ErbB2 status in human breast cancer. Integrin alpha5 is required for ErbB2-mediated anoikis resistance and for optimal ErbB2 signaling to the Mek-Erk-Bim axis as depletion of integrin alpha5 reverses anoikis resistance and Bim inhibition. Integrin alpha5 is required for full activation of ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation on Y877 and ErbB2 phosphorylation is associated with increased activity of Src in the absence of adhesion. Indeed, we show that blocking elevated Src activity during cell detachment reverses ErbB2-mediated survival and Bim repression. Thus, integrin alpha5 serves as a key mediator of Src and ErbB2-survival signaling in low adhesion states, which are necessary to block the pro-anoikis mediator Bim, and we suggest that this pathway represents a potential novel therapeutic target in ErbB2-positive tumors.",

This represents a novel subtype of breast cancer characterized by remarkable sensitivity to ATRA and RARα agonists, regardless of positivity to the estrogen receptor, a known modulator of retinoid sensitivity. In estrogen-receptor-negative cellular models showing coamplification of ERBB2 and RARA, simultaneous targeting of the corresponding gene products with combinations of lapatinib and ATRA causes synergistic growth inhibition, cyto-differentiation and apoptosis. This provides proof-of-principle that coamplification of ERBB2 and RARA can be exploited for the stratified and targeted therapy of a novel subtype of breast cancer patients, with an approach characterized by tumor cell selectivity and low predicted toxicity. The available cellular models were exploited to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of combinations between lapatinib and ATRA. Global gene expression and functional approaches provide evidence for three components of the antiproliferative/apoptotic responses triggered by lapatinib+ATRA. Induction of the retinoid-dependent RARRES3 protein by ATRA stabilizes the effect of lapatinib inhibiting ERBB2 phosphorylation. Upregulation and activation of the transcription factor FOXO3A integrates ATRA-dependent transcriptional and lapatinib-dependent posttranscriptional signals, controlling the levels of effector proteins like the antiapoptotic factor, BIRC5. Stimulation of the TGFβ pathway by ATRA mediates other components of the apoptotic process set in motion by simultaneous targeting of ERBB2 and RARα.",

The authors queried 5605 advanced/metastatic breast cancers (mBC) to uncover the frequency of ERBB2mut genomic alterations. Clinical responses to anti-HER2 therapeutics were identified.;DNA was extracted from 40 µm of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was used to evaluate up to 315 genes (592× mean coverage depth). Results were analyzed for base substitutions, short indels, copy number changes, and selected rearrangements.;Of 5605 cases, 698 (12.5%) featured ERBB2 alterations, including 596 (10.6%) ERBB2 amplifications (ERBB2amp) and 138 (2.4%) ERBB2mut; 38 cases (0.7%) had co-occurring ERBB2amp and ERBB2mut. ERBB2mut predominantly affected the kinase (124 cases; 90%) or extracellular (15 cases; 11%) domains. Both primary BC (52 cases; 38%) and metastatic site biopsies (86 cases; 62%) were found to harbor ERBB2mut, which were distributed across carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS) (69 cases; 50%), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (40 cases; 29%), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (27 cases; 20%), and mucinous mBC (2 cases; 1%). Genes commonly coaltered with ERBB2 were tumor protein 53 (TP53) (49%); phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (42%); cadherin 1, type 1 (CDH1) (37%); MYC (17%); and cyclin D1 protein (CCND1) (16%). CDH1 mutations were enriched in ERBB2mut mBC (P<0.0006) and associated with recurrent mBC. Selected patients with ERBB2mut, without ERBB2amp, who responded to anti-HER2 targeted therapies are presented herein.;Within this large series, 1.8% of cases harbored ERBB2mut, which are undetectable by standard-of-care IHC or FISH tests. Metastatic BC driven by ERBB2mut respond to anti-HER2 targeted therapies, and expanding clinical trials designed to detect ERBB2mut by CGP and optimize targeted treatments are warranted.

The status of the ERBB2 overexpression or gene amplification is an important predictive marker in gastric cancer. However, it is controversial whether the primary tumor is representative of distant metastases in terms of ERBB2 status. Quadruplicated tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 498 advanced primary gastric carcinomas and 97 matched metastatic lymph nodes were investigated by immunohistochemistry with HercepTest and silver in situ hybridization. For further comparison, another set of 41 paired primary and distant metastatic gastric carcinomas were also tested. Intratumoral heterogeneity was defined as different results between tissue microarray cores. ERBB2-positivity was observed in 52 gastric carcinomas (10%) and was not associated with recurrence of disease or survival of patients. In ERBB2-positive primary gastric carcinomas, heterogeneous ERBB2 overexpression was observed in 21/63 (33%) gastric carcinomas and heterogeneous ERBB2 gene amplification in 14/62 (23%) cases. Repeated immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization in representative paraffin tumor blocks confirmed focal ERBB2 overexpression and ERBB2 gene amplification and did not change the final results. Discrepancies in ERBB2 results between primary and paired metastatic lymph nodes were observed in 11% of cases by immunohistochemistry and 7% by silver in situ hybridization. Out of the 41 paired primary and distant metastases, 5 (12%) cases were ERBB2-positive, and discrepancy was observed in one case. Intratumoral heterogeneity and discrepant ERBB2 results in primary and metastatic tumor are not uncommon in gastric carcinoma. Results of silver in situ hybridization showed less frequent heterogeneity compared with immunohistochemistry.

In order to further delineate the mechanistic basis of the induced apoptosis, transient and stable cotransfections were performed. Transient cotransfection of erbB2 mutant and chimeric molecules demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of erbB2, or the homologous cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, is required for apoptosis induction. These results were confirmed in assays utilizing differential derivation of stable clones. To examine the effects of varying ratios of the anti-erbB2 sFv and its target erbB2 we performed additional cotransfection experiments in erbB2 negative target cells. When erbB2 levels are held constant, observed cytotoxicity is proportional to the amount of sFv added. In addition, when sFv levels are held constant, increasing levels of cotransfected erbB2 can overcome the apoptotic response. These results indicate that a minimal threshold level of the sFv and its target are required to induce cytotoxicity. To examine this phenomenon in an erbB2 positive cell line, SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells were utilized to derive a stable clone expressing low levels of sFv. When this cell line was compared to the parental SKOV3 cell line, it was shown that less exogenous sFv was needed to induce cytotoxicity in the clone already expressing low levels of sFv, indicating that endogenous and exogenous levels of sFv are additive. In summary, the results presented here indicate that the carboxy-terminus of the intracellular domain of the erbB2 molecule is involved in the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression levels of the sFv and its target protein need to overcome a threshold level in order to achieve a cytotoxic response.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

Overexpressed ERBB2 signals constitutively and elevated UCP2 can uncouple mitochondria and alleviate oxidative stress. However, the physiological contributions of UCP2 and ERBB2 at the low expression levels that are typical of most tissues, as well as the path to oncogenic deregulation, are poorly understood. We now show that ERBB2 directly controls UCP2 levels, both at low physiological levels and oncogenic overexpression. At low levels of receptor and UCP2, ligand stimulation creates a distinct temporal response pattern driven by the opposing forces of translational suppression of the exceptionally short lived UCP2 protein and a time delayed transcriptional up-regulation. The latter becomes dominant through constitutive signaling by overexpressed ERBB2, resulting in high levels of UCP2 that contribute mitochondrial uncoupling. By contrast, ligand stimulation of non-overexpressed ERBB2 transiently removes UCP2 and paradoxically reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and OXPHOS on a signaling time scale. However, neither the transporter activity nor down-regulation of already low UCP2 levels drive this reduction in mitochondrial activity. Instead, UCP2 is required to establish mitochondria that are capable of responding to ligand. UCP2 knockdown impairs proliferation at high glucose but its absence specifically impairs ligand-induced growth when glucose levels fluctuate. These findings demonstrate the ability of growth factor signaling to control oxidative phosphorylation on a signaling time scale and point toward a non-transporter role for low levels of UCP2 in establishing dynamic response capability.

To inform clinical studies evaluating UPS inhibitors as breast cancer therapeutics, seven phenotypically diverse human breast cancer cell line models were characterized for their cellular and molecular responses to the clinically approved 20S inhibitor bortezomib (PS341; Velcade), focusing on those overexpressing estrogen receptor (ER) or ERBB2/HER2, because these oncogenic receptor pathways are constitutively activated in approximately 80% of all breast cancers. All models demonstrated dose-dependent bortezomib reduction in intracellular 20S activity correlating with cell growth inhibition, and bortezomib IC(50) values (concentrations producing 50% growth inhibition) varied directly with pretreatment 20S activities (r = 0.74; *, p < 0.05), suggesting that basal 20S activity may serve as a clinical predictor of tumor responsiveness to UPS inhibition. Reduction in 20S activity (> 60%) was associated with early (24 h) intracellular relocalization of ER (nucleus to cytoplasm) and ERBB2 (plasma membrane to perinuclear lysosomes), buildup of ubiquitinated and Hsp70-associated receptor, degradation and loss of ER and ERBB2 function, and induction of cellular apoptosis. These models were also used to screen a pharmacologic panel of pathway-targeted anticancer agents [4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-(benzothiazolylthiomethyl)benzylidenecyanoacetamide (AG825), 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide (AZD6244/ARRY142886), 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin (17AAG), and (2E)-N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[(2-hydroxyethyl)[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2-propenamide (LAQ824)] for those capable of sensitizing to bortezomib. In keeping with the observation that 20S reduction has little effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) signaling in either ER-positive or ERBB2-positive models, only the MEK-1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 consistently improved the antitumor activity of bortezomib.",

We successfully designed 12-finger ATFs capable of coregulating ErbB3 and ICAM-1 or ErbB2 and ErbB3. With ATFs, the effects of changes in ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptor levels were evaluated by using cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell signaling assays. Cell proliferation was increased when ErbB2 and ErbB3 were both overexpressed. Cell migration on collagen was decreased when ErbB2 was down-regulated, yet migration on laminin was significantly increased with ErbB3 overexpression. ErbB2 and ErbB3 overexpression also stimulated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Our ATF approach has elucidated differences in ErbB receptor-mediated proliferation, migration, and intracellular signaling that cannot be explained merely by the presence or absence of particular ErbB receptors and emphasizes the dynamic nature of the ErbB signaling system. The transcription factor approach developed here provides a gene-economical route to the regulation of multiple genes and may be important for complex gene therapies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inappropriate signalling through the EGFR and ErbB2/HER2 members of the epidermal growth factor family of receptor tyrosine kinases is well recognised as being causally linked to a variety of cancers. Consequently, monoclonal antibodies specific for these receptors have become increasingly important components of effective treatment strategies for cancer. Increasing evidence suggests that ErbB3 plays a critical role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy. We hypothesised that co-targeting the preferred ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer with a bispecific single-chain Fv (bs-scFv) antibody would promote increased targeting selectivity over antibodies specific for a single tumour-associated antigen (TAA). In addition, we hypothesised that targeting this important heterodimer could induce a therapeutic effect. Here, we describe the construction and evaluation of the A5-linker-ML3.9 bs-scFv (ALM), an anti-ErbB3/ErbB2 bs-scFv. The A5-linker-ML3.9 bs-scFv exhibits selective targeting of tumour cells in vitro and in vivo that co-express the two target antigens over tumour cells that express only one target antigen or normal cells that express low levels of both antigens. The A5-linker-ML3.9 bs-scFv also exhibits significantly greater in vivo targeting of ErbB2'+'/ErbB3'+' tumours than derivative molecules that contain only one functional arm targeting ErbB2 or ErbB3. Binding of ALM to ErbB2'+'/ErbB3'+' cells mediates inhibition of tumour cell growth in vitro by effectively targeting the therapeutic anti-ErbB3 A5 scFv. This suggests both that ALM could provide the basis for an effective therapeutic agent and that engineered antibodies selected to co-target critical functional pairs of TAAs can enhance the targeting specificity and efficacy of antibody-based cancer therapeutics.",

Here we reveal unexpected combinatorial integration of a growth factor co-receptor with a heterodimeric partner and ligand known to regulate angiogenesis and vascular patterning. We show that ErbB2, which can mediate epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuregulin signalling in multiple tissues, is unexpectedly expressed by endothelial cells where it partners with neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) to form a functional receptor for the vascular guidance molecule semaphorin 3d (Sema3d). Loss of Sema3d leads to improper patterning of the coronary veins, a phenotype recapitulated by endothelial loss of ErbB2. These findings have implications for possible cardiovascular side-effects of anti-ErbB2 therapies commonly used for cancer, and provide an example of integration at the molecular level of pathways involved in tissue growth and vascular patterning.

Using the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, cell cytotoxicity and proliferation were evaluated by MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was established by transient transfecting MCF-7 cells with plasmids containing either the ERBB2 or the ESR1 promoter region linked to the luciferase gene. Chinese herbal extracts were used to treat the cells at 24 h after transfection, followed by measurement of their luciferase activity. The screening results were verified by Western blotting to measure HER2 and ER α protein expression. Results. At concentrations that induced little cytotoxicity, thirteen single herbal extracts and five compound recipes were found to increase either ERBB2 or ESR1 luciferase activity. By Western blotting, Si-Wu-Tang, Kuan-Shin-Yin, and Suan-Tsao-Ren-Tang were found to increase either HER2 or ER α protein expression. In addition, Ligusticum chuanxiong was shown to have a great effect on ERBB2 gene expression and synergistically with estrogen to stimulate MCF-7 cell growth. Conclusion. Our results provide important information that should affect clinical treatment strategies among breast cancer patients who are receiving hormonal or targeted therapies. ",

We have previously demonstrated that mammary tissue-specific expression of activated ErbB2 under the control of its endogenous promoter results in mammary tumor formation. Tumor development was associated with amplification and overexpression of ErbB2 at both the transcript and protein levels. Here we demonstrate that the EGR2/Krox20 transcription factor and its coactivator CITED1 are coordinately upregulated during ErbB2 tumor induction. We have identified an EGR2 binding site in the erbB2 promoter and demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that EGR2 and CITED1 associate specifically with this region of the promoter. EGR2 and CITED1 were shown to associate, and expression from an erbB2 promoter-reporter construct was stimulated by EGR2 and was further enhanced by CITED1 coexpression. Furthermore, expression of the 14-3-3sigma tumor suppressor led to downregulation of ErbB2 protein levels and relocalization of EGR2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Taken together, these observations suggest that, in addition to an increased gene copy number and upregulation of EGR2 and CITED1, an elevated erbB2 transcript level involves the loss of 14-3-3sigma, which sequesters a key transcriptional regulator of the erbB2 promoter.",

Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which androgens regulate EGFR and ERBB2 expression in PCa cells. In steroid-depleted medium (SDM), EGFR protein was less abundant in androgen-sensitive LNCaP than in androgen ablation-resistant 22Rv1 cells, whereas transcript levels were similar. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment increased both EGFR mRNA and protein levels and stimulated RNA polymerase II recruitment to the EGFR gene promoter, whereas it decreased ERBB2 transcript and protein levels in LNCaP cells. DHT altered neither EGFR or ERBB2 levels nor the abundance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), TMEPA1, or TMPRSS2 mRNAs in 22Rv1 cells, which express the full-length and a shorter AR isoform deleted from the COOH-terminal domain (ARDeltaCTD). The contribution of both AR isoforms to the expression of these genes was assessed by small interfering RNAs targeting only the full-length or both AR isoforms. Silencing of both isoforms strongly reduced PSA, TMEPA1, and TMPRSS2 transcript levels. Inhibition of both AR isoforms did not affect EGFR and ERBB2 transcript levels but decreased EGFR and increased ERBB2 protein levels. Proliferation of 22Rv1 cells in SDM was inhibited in the absence of AR and ARDeltaCTD. A further decrease was obtained with PKI166, an EGFR/ERBB2 kinase inhibitor. Overall, we showed that ARDeltaCTD is responsible for constitutive EGFR expression and ERBB2 repression in 22Rv1 cells and that ARDeltaCTD and tyrosine kinase receptors are necessary for sustained 22Rv1 cell growth.",

Conversely, down-regulation of ErbB2 inhibits AKT activation. Here, we identify PP1 as a serine/threonine phosphatase that associates with and dephosphorylates AKT in breast cancer cells, and we show that ErbB2 inhibits PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition of ErbB2 by either the HSP (heat shock protein) 90 inhibitor geldanamycin or the ErbB inhibitor ZD1839 in SKBR3 cells, a human breast cancer cell line overexpressing ErbB2 protein, induces a rapid and dramatic decrease in AKT activity. Decreased AKT activity occurs many hours before the HSP90-dependent decline of AKT protein but is correlated with loss of AKT phosphorylation. Decreased AKT phosphorylation is not due to blockade of AKT activation or to preferential HSP90-mediated degradation of phosphorylated AKT. Instead, it is caused by increased AKT dephosphorylation. Sensitivity to a panel of phosphatase inhibitors suggests involvement of the phosphatase PP1 in this process. In vitro phosphatase assay (using PP1 immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells transiently transfected with the wild-type protein, as well as purified PP1) confirmed that AKT is a substrate of PP1. Furthermore, endogenous PP1 and AKT associate with each other in SKBR3. However, the phosphatase is phosphorylated and its activity is suppressed (determined by in vitro assay). In contrast, ErbB2 inhibition abrogates PP1 phosphorylation and restores its activity (measured by its ability to dephosphorylate AKT in vitro). Finally, transient overexpression of constitutively active PP1 in SKBR3 cells promotes marked dephosphorylation of endogenous AKT protein. These data indicate that ErbB2 acts to preserve the phosphorylation, and hence to prolong the activation, of AKT kinase by repressing the activity of the phosphatase PP1. ErbB2 thus functions to regulate AKT kinase by simultaneously promoting its activation while inhibiting its inactivation.",

This study investigates whether the gene expression and the immunohistochemical status of FASN, ErbB2, and USP2a correlate with the clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC cases. A strong positive correlation among ErbB2, FASN, and USP2a expression (p=0.001) was observed by qRT-PCR in laser capture microdissected OSCC samples. Perineural infiltration was associated with ErbB2 mRNA expression (p=0.046). The presence of metastatic cervical lymph nodes was associated with FASN (p=0.002), ErbB2 (p=0.001), and USP2a (p=0.006) mRNA levels. ErbB2 staining at the cell membranes was stronger in well-differentiated lesions while a cytoplasmic positivity was found in poorly differentiated tumors. Most of the OSCC (97.06%) that showed a high positivity for FASN were also labeled for ErbB2 at the cell membranes (p=0.001). FASN and ErbB2 positivity was associated with tumor thickness and lymphatic embolization (p=0.006 and p=0.035, p=0.006 and p=0.024 respectively).

Down-regulation of beta(4) integrin by beta(4) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased Ras activity and carcinoma invasion whereas reexpression of this integrin restored Ras activity. ErbB2, a binding partner of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EGFR modulated Ras activity, and integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulated phospho-EGFR level without affecting EGFR expression. We also found that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) is involved in ErbB2 expression. Depletion of beta(4) by shRNA reduced ErbB2 protein level without affecting ErbB2 mRNA level and reexpression of beta(4) increased ErbB2 protein level. Reduction of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, a rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, decreased ErbB2 protein level, and beta(4) shRNA cells exhibited a shift in ErbB2 mRNA to light polysomes compared with control cells.

However, its prognosis value, albeit recognized for node-positive patients, remains controversial for those without apparent nodal involvement. One possible reason for this problem is likely to be the difficulty of defining threshold levels for ERBB2 protein overexpression. ERBB2 protein expression was therefore analyzed in primary invasive breast tumors. Quantification of the gene product by a commercial ELISA test was compared to results obtained by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, as well as to gene amplification status determined by Southern blotting. Correlations between results obtained by the different techniques were highly significant (P value < 10(-6)). Nevertheless, ELISA permitted us to determine three levels of protein expression corresponding to distinct tumor subsets. 1) Tumors with p185/ERBB2 expression levels exceeding 10 U/microgram exhibited in most cases amplification of the gene (83% of cases), DNA aneuploidy (81%) and absence of estrogen receptor (ER) (44%). Such high levels of protein expression were exclusively observed in invasive ductal carcinomas and were prevalent in those showing a significant in situ component. 2) \"Intermediate\" levels of expression (3-10 U/micrograms) were rarely observed in tumors exhibiting gene amplification (9%), but were preferentially found in cancers of more favorable prognosis (only 49% were aneuploid and 9% estrogen receptor negative). 3) Levels of p185/ERBB2 below 3 U/micrograms were detected in benign mastopathies and, thus, carcinomas presenting such levels were scored ERBB2 negative. Interestingly, invasive lobular carcinomas were rarely ERBB2 positive, and if so, only at intermediate levels. Moreover, our data show a complex interrelationship between p185/ERBB2 expression and ER levels. Indeed, tumors with more than 10 U/micrograms of p185 were prevalently ER, whereas those with p185 ranging from 3 to 10 U presented elevated levels of ER.",

Strikingly, the mice invariably developed multifocal lung adenocarcinomas of varying sizes at between 5 and 6 weeks of age, and they died from tumor progression approximately 2 months later if left untreated. Daily oral administration of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (5 mg/kg/day) reduced the total and phosphorylation levels of EGFR to those in wild-type mouse lung tissue; in addition, it abrogated tumor growth within 1 week and prolonged survival to >30 weeks. Interestingly, phosphorylated ErbB2, ErbB3, and thyroid transcriptional factor-1 increased in the transgenic mice compared with those in wild-type mice. They might play some roles in tumors progression in the transgenic mice. This model will be useful for studying the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer patients carrying activating EGFR mutations.",

Overexpression of the ERBB2 gene is due to increased transcription and gene amplification. Our previous studies have identified a new cis element in the ERBB2 promoter which is involved in the gene's overexpression. This cis element, located 501 bp upstream from the main ERBB2 transcription initiation site, binds a transcription factor called HTF (HER2 transcription factor). We report here the identification of HTF as an AP-2 (activator protein-2) transcription factor. The new cis element is bound by AP-2 with high affinity, compared with a previously described AP-2 binding site located 284 bp downstream. Co-transfection of an AP-2alpha expression vector with a reporter vector containing the newly identified AP-2 binding site in front of a minimal ERBB2 promoter induced a dose-dependent increase in transcriptional activity. We examined the contribution of the new AP-2 binding site to ERBB2 overexpression. For this purpose we abolished the new and/or the previously described AP-2 binding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. The results show that the two functional AP-2 sites in the first 700 bp of the ERBB2 promoter co-operate to achieve maximal transcriptional activity.",

Effectiveness estimators for such therapy were identified from primary studies; all direct medical costs based on national fees-guidelines were included. Sensitivity was analyzed and acceptability curves estimated. A 3 % discount rate and third-payer perspective were used within a 5-year horizon.;L+C dominated its comparators. Its cost-effectiveness ratio was COP $49,725,045 per progression-free year.

Here we report on studies of the influence of ErbB2 over-expression on localization and signaling in polarized Caco-2 and MDCK cells, two established models to study molecular trafficking. In these cells, ErbB2 is not over-expressed and shares basolateral localization with ErbB3. Over-expression of ErbB2 by transient transfection resulted in partial separation of the receptors by relocalization of ErbB2, but not ErbB3, to the apical surface, as shown by biotinylation of the apical or basolateral surfaces. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Polarity controls indicated that the relocalization of ErbB2 is not the result of depolarization of the cells. Biotinylation and confocal microscopy also showed that apical, but not basolateral ErbB2 is activated at tyrosine 1139. This phosphotyrosine binds adaptor protein Grb2, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation. However, we found that it does not initiate the canonical Grb2-Ras-Raf-Erk pathway. Instead, our data supports the activation of a survival pathway via Bcl-2. The effects of ErbB2 over-expression were abrogated by the humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody Herceptin added only from the apical side. The ability of apical ErbB2 to initiate an altered downstream cascade suggests that subcellular localization of the receptor plays an important role in regulating ErbB2 signaling in polarized epithelia.",

Expression levels are, however, only one factor that determines the physiological activity of a receptor. For some surface receptors, their distribution on the cell surface, especially their clustering, provides additional mechanisms for regulation. To access this spatial information robust assays are required that provide detailed insight into the organization of cell surface receptors on nanometer length scales. In this manuscript, we demonstrate through combination of scattering spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and generalized multiple particle Mie theory (GMT) simulations that the density- and morphology-dependent spectral response of Au nanoparticle (NP) immunolabels bound to the epidermal growth factor receptors ErbB1 and ErbB2 encodes quantitative information of both the cell surface expression and spatial clustering of the two receptors in different unliganded in vitro cancer cell lines (SKBR3, MCF7, A431). A systematic characterization of the collective spectral responses of NPs targeted at ErbB1 and ErbB2 at various NP concentrations indicates differences in the large-scale organization of ErbB1 and ErbB2 in cell lines that overexpress these receptors. Validation experiments in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirm that NPs targeted at ErbB1 on A431 are more strongly clustered than NPs bound to ErbB2 on SKBR3 or MCF7 at overall comparable NP surface densities. This finding is consistent with the existence of larger receptor clusters for ErbB1 than for ErbB2 in the plasma membranes of the respective cells.",

HER2 (also known as NEU, EGFR2, or ERBB2) is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of certain human cancers, and mutations have recently been reported in lung cancers. We sequenced the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 in 671 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 80 NSCLC cell lines, and 55 SCLCs and other neuroendocrine lung tumors as well as 85 other epithelial cancers (breast, bladder, prostate, and colorectal cancers) and compared the mutational status with clinicopathologic features and the presence of EGFR or KRAS mutations. HER2 mutations were present in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC and were absent in other types of cancers. Only one adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H1781) had a mutation. All HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions in exon 20 and target the identical corresponding region as did EGFR insertions. HER2 mutations were significantly more frequent in never smokers (3.2%, 8 of 248; P=0.02) and adenocarcinoma histology (2.8%, 11 of 394; P=0.003). In 394 adenocarcinoma cases, HER2 mutations preferentially targeted Oriental ethnicity (3.9%) compared with other ethnicities (0.7%), female gender (3.6%) compared with male gender (1.9%) and never smokers (4.1%) compared with smokers (1.4%). Mutations in EGFR, HER2, and KRAS genes were never present together in individual tumors and cell lines. The remarkable similarities of mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes involving tumor type and subtype, mutation type, gene location, and specific patient subpopulations targeted are unprecedented and suggest similar etiologic factors.

The target specific molecular agent lapatinib, a dual ErbB1 and ErbB2             receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown significant activity against ErbB1             and ErbB2-expressing tumors. Since pancreatic tumors frequently overexpress these             proteins, we investigated its effects, both alone and in conjunction with 5-FU             or GEM. The pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and AsPC were treated with varying             doses of lapatinib in vitro. The effects on ErbB1/ErbB2 protein phosphorylation             and on the cell survival protein survivin were determined by western blotting.             Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay and apoptosis was measured using the             caspase-3 colorimetric assay. Similar dose-response lapatinib experiments were             conducted with varying concentrations of 5-FU or GEM and isobolograms were constructed             to evaluate therapeutic synergy. Lapatinib inhibited protein phosphorylation in             the range of 4-16 µM, a clinically achievable concentration. The lapatinib-treated             cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of             apoptosis at the same concentrations that blocked ErbB1/ErbB2 phosphorylation.             The addition of 5-FU or GEM to these cells resulted in synergistic effects. The             lapatinib-treated cells also demonstrated downregulation of survivin. Simultaneous             dual ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition with lapatinib results             in significant reduction of pancreatic cancer cell growth and proliferation. These             effects occur at clinically achievable concentrations and are synergistic with             the effects of 5-FU or GEM.

However, the way they function is still largely unknown. In this work, we aimed to identify the cellular mechanisms and the intracellular signalling pathways under the control of both ErbB2 and MUC4 in a human pancreatic adenocarcinomatous cell line. Using co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down, we show that MUC4 and ErbB2 interact in the human pancreatic adenocarcinomatous cell line CAPAN-2 via the EGF domains of MUC4. Stable cell clones were generated in which either MUC4 or ErbB2 were knocked down (KD) by a shRNA approach. Biological properties of these cells were then studied in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that ErbB2-KD cells are more apoptotic and less proliferative (decreased cyclin D1 and increased p27kip1 expression) while migration and invasive properties were not altered. MUC4-KD clones were less proliferative with decreased cyclin D1 expression, G1 cell cycle arrest and altered ErbB2/ErbB3 expression. Their migration properties were reduced whereas invasive properties were increased. Importantly, inhibition of ErbB2 and MUC4 expression did not impair the same signalling pathways (inhibition of MUC4 expression affected the JNK pathway whereas that of ErbB2 altered the MAPK pathway). Finally, ErbB2-KD and MUC4-KD cells showed impaired tumour growth in vivo.

A two-step approach was used. In step 1, a consensus panel of pathologists adapted existing protocols for use in colorectal cancer to test ERBB2 expression and amplification. Collegial revision of an archival test cohort of colorectal cancer samples led to specific recommendations for adapting current breast and gastric cancer criteria for scoring ERBB2 in colorectal cancer. In step 2, from September 2012 to January 2015, colorectal-specific ERBB2 testing protocols and ERBB2 scoring criteria were used to centrally screen for ERBB2-positive KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients to be enrolled in the HERACLES trial (clinical validation cohort). In both archival test (N=256) and clinical validation (N=830) cohorts, a clinically sizeable 5% fraction of KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients was found to be ERBB2-positive according to the colorectal cancer-specific ERBB2 scoring criteria. ERBB2-positive tumors showed ERBB2 immunostaining consisting of intense membranous ERBB2 protein expression, corresponding to homogenous ERBB2 amplification, in >50% of cells. None of the immunohistochemistry 0 or 1+ cases was amplified. Concordance between SISH and FISH was 100%. In conclusion, we propose specific criteria for defining ERBB2-positivity in colorectal cancer (HERACLES Diagnostic Criteria).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a tissue microarray containing 90 pairs of primary gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissue samples. TOB1 expression was evaluated separately with cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Western blot analysis revealed significantly lower expression levels of TOB1 in gastric cancer tissues than those in adjacent normal tissues in 91.7% of cases. This was confirmed by IHC, which revealed decreased cytoplasmic TOB1 expression in cancer tissues compared with those of normal tissue samples in 84.4% of cases. The IHC data also revealed low cytoplasmic expression of TOB1 in 67.8% of human gastric cancer samples. Nuclear TOB1 expression exhibited no significant association with specific pathological features. However, a significant association was identified between cytoplasmic expression levels of TOB1 and clinicopathological characteristics, including the depth of invasion (P=0.017), differentiation grade (P=0.034) and tumor-node-metastasis stage (P<0.000).

Here, we describe the molecular cytogenetic/genetic characterization of two sister rat mammary tumor cell lines, HH-16 cl.2/1 and HH-16.cl.4, for the first time. Molecular cytogenetic analysis using rat and mouse chromosome paint probes and BAC/PAC clones allowed the characterization of clonal chromosome rearrangements; moreover, this strategy assisted in revealing detected breakpoint regions and complex chromosome rearrangements. This comprehensive cytogenetic analysis revealed an increase in the number of copies of the Mycn and Erbb2 genes in the investigated cell lines. To analyze its possible correlation with expression changes, relative RNA expression was assessed by real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR and RNA FISH. Erbb2 was found to be overexpressed in HH-16.cl.4, but not in the sister cell line HH-16 cl.2/1, even though these lines share the same initial genetic environment. Moreover, the relative expression of Erbb2 decreased after global genome demethylation in the HH-16.cl.4 cell line. As these cell lines are commercially available and have been used in previous studies, the present detailed characterization improves their value as an in vitro cell model. We believe that the development of appropriate in vitro cell models for breast cancer is of crucial importance for revealing the genetic and cellular pathways underlying this neoplasy and for employing them as experimental tools to assist in the generation of new biotherapies.",

In             this study, we have independently investigated the KIF5B/RET fusion gene status             in 371 surgically-treated NSCLCs (270 were adenocarcinomas and 101 were squamous             cell carcinomas), 60 breast cancers, 11 metastatic lung cancers from colon cancers             and thyroid papillary adenocarcinoma cases at the Nagoya City University Hospital.             The fusion gene status was analyzed by an RT-PCR-based assay and by using direct             sequencing. We detected 3 of 270 cases of KIF5B/RET fusion genes in adenocarcinomas             (1.1%) consisting of female and never smokers with mixed subtype adenocarcinomas.             The fusion genes were detected exclusively with other mutations, such as EGFR,             Kras, Braf, erbB2 mutations, and EML4/ALK fusion. KIF5B/RET fusion was not detected             in the cases with squamous cell carcinoma or other types of cancers. From the             3 cases, 2 were KIF5B (exon 15); RET (exon 12) fusions with papillary dominant             and 1 case was KIF5B (exon 22); RET (exon 12) fusion with solid dominant adenocarcinoma.

To explore contributions of PTK6 to mammary gland tumorigenesis promoted by activated ERBB2, we crossed Ptk6-/- mice with the mouse mammary tumor virus-ERBB2 transgenic mouse line expressing activated ERBB2 and characterized tumor development and progression. ERBB2-induced tumorigenesis was significantly delayed and diminished in mice lacking PTK6. PTK6 expression was induced in the mammary glands of ERBB2 transgenic mice before tumor development and correlated with activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and increased proliferation. Disruption of PTK6 impaired STAT3 activation and proliferation. Phosphorylation of the PTK6 substrates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1; p130CAS) was decreased in Ptk6-/- mammary gland tumors. Reduced numbers of metastases were detected in the lungs of Ptk6-/- mice expressing activated ERBB2, compared with wild-type ERBB2 transgenic mice. PTK6 activation was detected at the edges of ERBB2-positive tumors. These data support roles for PTK6 in both ERBB2-induced mammary gland tumor initiation and metastasis, and identify STAT3, FAK, and BCAR1 as physiologically relevant PTK6 substrates in breast cancer.

Here we demonstrate that 2 of 10 of the cancer-associated mutations of ErbB4 lead to loss of ErbB4 kinase activity due to disruption of functionally important structural features. Interestingly, the kinase-dead ErbB4 mutants were as efficient as wild-type ErbB4 in forming a heterodimeric neuregulin receptor with ErbB2 and promoting phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt in an ErbB2 kinase-dependent manner. However, the mutant ErbB4 receptors failed to phosphorylate STAT5 and suppressed differentiation of MDA-MB-468 mammary carcinoma cells.

Assessment of ErbB2 status is crucial for identifying patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with trastuzumab. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of ErbB2 amplification and expression in 142 oesophageal adenocarcinomas by comparing the most commonly used methods for ErbB2 assessment: ErbB2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and was scored (0, 1+, 2+ and 3+) according to a recently described modified scoring system for gastric cancer. ErbB2 amplification was evaluated by bright field double in situ hybridisation. The results were compared with pathologic features, patients' survival and previously published data from fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis. On the basis of immunohistochemistry, which was applicable in 110 cores of the cases, 83 tumours (75%) had a score of 0 or 1+ (immunohistochemistry negative), 13 tumours (12%) were scored as 2+ and 14 tumours (13%) were scored as 3+. In situ hybridisation data were obtained from 142 cases. There was a highly significant correlation of immunohistochemistry, bright field in situ hybridisation and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (P<0.001 each). In total, 41 tumours (29%) were categorised as ErbB2 positive, which was defined as immunohistochemistry 3+ and/or an ErbB2/Chr17 quotient of ≥2 as assessed by either bright field double in situ hybridisation or fluorescence in situ hybridisation. ErbB2 positivity was observed more frequently in tumours with lower differentiation grades (P=0.029). Patients with ErbB2-positive tumours had a significantly worse prognosis, both in univariate analysis (P=0.004) and in multivariate analysis (P=0.03). In conclusion, we demonstrate that a significant number of oesophageal adenocarcinomas are positive for ErbB2.

By comparing the transcriptional profiles of ErbB2(KI) mammary tumors and human ERBB2-positive breast cancers, we show that ErbB2(KI) tumors possess molecular features of the basal subtype of ERBB2-positive human breast cancer, including activation of canonical β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of β-catenin-dependent signaling in ErbB2(KI)-derived tumor cells using RNA interference impaired tumor initiation and metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of ErbB2(KI) or human ERBB2-overexpressing tumor cells with a selective β-catenin/CBP inhibitor significantly decreased proliferation and ErbB2 expression.

In this study, the role of ErbB2 in the exocrine pancreas was examined by ectopic overexpression under the control of the proximal rat elastase promoter. Three independent transgenic mouse lines overexpressing ErbB2 were established by pronuclear injection. Pancreatic mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by real time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis, RAS activity by using a specific immunoprecipitation assay and various kinase activities by phosphospecific antibodies. Overexpression of ErbB2 in the exocrine pancreas resulted in increased RAS activity and downstream activation of ERK1/2, but not in transgenic increased proliferation of acinar and ductal cells. At later timepoints, some mice showed focal areas of acinar cell damage with upregulated mRNA levels for Cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a). Despite the increased mRNA level, cyclin D1 protein levels were downregulated. We observed areas of focal infiltrations with inflammatory cells interspersed in the exocrine pancreas. NF-kappaB activity was induced in transgenic acinar cells compared with controls contributing to high levels of chemokine and cytokine gene expression such as CCR-1 and CCL3. These data suggest that overexpression of ErbB2 in acinar cells leads to increased RAS activity without cell cycle progression and mediates inflammation via NF-kappaB. We conclude that the biological response of ErbB2/RAS signaling depends highly on cellular context.",

Quantifying the expression and PTMs of biomarkers such as ErbB2 by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry has several limitations, including minimal coverage and extensive assay development time. Therefore, we assessed the utility of two high resolution, full scan mass spectrometry approaches, MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2, for targeted ErbB2 proteomics. Endogenous ErbB2 immunoprecipitated from SK-BR-3 cells was in-gel digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, Asp-N, or trypsin plus Asp-N in triplicate. Data-dependent acquisition with an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600 and MS1 Filtering data processing was used to assess peptide and PTM coverage as well as the reproducibility of enzyme digestion. Data-independent acquisition (SWATH) was also performed for MS2 quantitation. MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2 allow quantitation of all detected analytes after acquisition, enabling the use of multiple proteases for quantitative assessment of target proteins. Combining high resolution proteomics with multiprotease digestion enabled quantitative mapping of ErbB2 with excellent reproducibility, improved amino acid sequence and PTM coverage, and decreased assay development time compared to typical SRM assays. These results demonstrate that high resolution quantitative proteomic approaches are an effective tool for targeted biomarker quantitation.",

To identify the site of interaction, we recently used a chimeric EGFR/ErbB2 receptor approach to show that c-Src requires the kinase region of ErbB2 for binding. Here, we demonstrate that retention of a conserved amino acid motif surrounding tyrosine 877 (referred to here as EGFR(YHAD)) is sufficient to confer binding to c-Src. Surprisingly the association of c-Src was not dependent on its SH2 or SH3 domain or on the phosphorylation or kinase activity of the receptor. We further show that the chimeric EGFRs that contain the Y877 motif are transforming in vitro and in vivo following ligand stimulation. Transformation was also partially dependent on sustained activation of Stat3. Finally, we demonstrate that EGFRs with mutations in the catalytic domain, originally identified in lung cancer and conferring increased sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib, two EGFR kinase inhibitors, gained the capacity to bind c-Src. Moreover, transformation by these EGFR mutants was inhibited by Src inhibitors regardless of their sensitivities to gefitinib and erlotinib. These observations have important implications for understanding the molecular basis for resistance to EGFR inhibitors and implicate c-Src as a critical signaling molecule in EGFR mutant-induced transformation.",

According to the general opinion, chronic pancreatitis is a de novo disease with a silent but progressive restructure of the pancreas in response to environmental, nutritional or genetic factors. The necrosis-fibrosis sequence hypothesis, on the other hand, postulates that relapsing attacks of acute pancreatitis with subsequent development of fibrosis leads to chronic pancreatitis. Since in our previous studies the expression of two anti-ErbB2 growth factor receptor (ErbB2) antibodies was shown to discriminate between primary chronic pancreatitis, normal tissue, and secondary chronic pancreatitis caused by pancreatic cancer, we studied the ErbB2 expression in tissues obtained from acute, recurrent acute, and chronic pancreatitis to investigate a possible evolution of the ErbB2 expression pattern during the course of the disease. We subjected 14 normal pancreas, 15 chronic pancreatitis, and 12 acute pancreatitis (three with recurrent acute pancreatitis) specimens to immunohistochemical studies using polyclonal anti-ErbB2 antibodies from Santa Cruz and Dako. The immunoreactivity of islet cells in acute pancreatitis cases with the Santa Cruz antibody was less than that in normal pancreas in relation to the degree of tissue damage and fibrosis, and was negative in recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis tissues. The Dako antibody, on the other hand, revealed a membrane staining of ductal and ductular cells only in chronic pancreatitis specimens and in some areas of recurrent acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, the similarities in the immunoreactivity of anti-ErbB2 antibodies in recurrent acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis support the hypothesis that acute pancreatitis can be a forerunner of chronic pancreatitis.",

Using a unique study set of 42 brain metastases from patients with breast or nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the phosphorylation/activation states of 128 key signaling proteins involved in cancer signaling were measured in laser capture microdissected tumor epithelium using reverse phase protein microarray (RPMA) technology. Distinct pathway activation subgroups from both breast and lung metastases were underpinned by, among others, ERBB2, AKT, mTOR, EGFR, SMAD, and ERK-p38 signaling. Breast cancer metastases showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher activation of the c-ERBB2/IGFR-AKT pathway network compared to NSCLC metastases, whereas NSCLC metastases to the brain exhibited higher relative levels of many members of the EGFR-ERK signaling network.

ErbB2 presents itself, therefore, as a target for antibody-mediated therapies. In this respect, anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody 4D5 specifically inhibits the growth of tumor cells overexpressing ErbB2. We have analyzed the effect of 4D5-mediated ErbB2 inhibition on the cell cycle of the breast tumor cell line BT474. 4D5 treatment of BT474 cells resulted in a G(1) arrest, preceded by rapid dephosphorylation of ErbB2, inhibition of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways, accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1), and inactivation of cyclin-Cdk2 complexes. Time courses demonstrated that 4D5 treatment redirects p27(Kip1) onto Cdk2 complexes, an event preceding increased p27(Kip1) expression; this correlates with the downregulation of c-Myc and D-type cyclins (proteins involved in p27(Kip1) sequestration) and the loss of p27(Kip1) from Cdk4 complexes. Similar events were observed in ErbB2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells, which exhibited reduced proliferation in response to 4D5 treatment. Here, p27(Kip1) redistribution resulted in partial Cdk2 inactivation, consistent with a G1 accumulation. Moreover, p27(Kip1) protein levels remained constant. Antisense-mediated inhibition of p27(Kip1) expression in 4D5-treated BT474 cells further demonstrated that in the absence of p27(Kip1) accumulation, p27(Kip1) redirection onto Cdk2 complexes is sufficient to inactivate Cdk2 and establish the G(1) block. These data suggest that ErbB2 overexpression leads to potentiation of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity through regulation of p27(Kip1) sequestration proteins, thus deregulating the G(1)/S transition. Moreover, through comparison with an ErbB2-overexpressing cell line insensitive to 4D5 treatment, we demonstrate the specificity of these cell cycle events and show that ErbB2 overexpression alone is insufficient to determine the cellular response to receptor inhibition.",

According to recent recommendations (\"ASCO/CAP Guidelines\" and German S3 guidelines for breast cancer) the choice of primary test procedure--IHC or ISH - is left to the individual institution. Both techniques are of equal predictive value provided that strict quality precautions have been taken: internal test validation by comparing IHC and (F)ISH, carrying out controls, and annual participation in round-robin tests. Equivocal IHC (score 2+) has to be checked by ISH for amplification. Borderline ISH (ratio 1.8-2.2 or gene copy number 4.0-6.0) should be retested by counting additional cells or performing IHC. In approximately 5% of cases these criteria give conflicting results and the gene copy number alone generates over 90% of the equivocal ISH cases, mostly due to chromosome 17 polysomy.

We have analysed breast cancer biopsy specimens for genetic alterations at and around topoisomerase loci in order to obtain molecular insight into factors which may determine how tumours respond to chemotherapy. We show that of 50 tumours examined, the topoisomerase II alpha locus is co-amplified in 3 cases out of 6 with erbB2 amplification and that amplification can be accompanied by high expression of topoisomerase II alpha. In our attempts to distinguish amplification from aneuploidy and define the limits of amplification, we also observed co-amplification of the retinoic acid-alpha receptor with erbB2 and topoisomerase II alpha in the same three samples. At the topoisomerase I locus on chromosome 20, we observed allelic loss in two out of 17 samples. Genetics abberations at topoisomerase loci, therefore, appear to be relatively common in breast cancer.",

As an attempt to meet the crucial need for identification of the subpopulation of patients that will benefit from more individualized therapies, rapidly evolving therapies should allow a profiling of the tumors and/or of the CTCs. We established a triple fluorescence staining using eight cell lines to visualize the CTCs (cytokeratin detection) and then to define their individual ERα and ErbB2 status. Afterward, we used this method for blood samples from 26 metastatic breast cancer patients. We identified major differences of ERα levels between the cell lines and even within one cell line. For the metastatic patients, we detected and characterized CTCs in 38.5% of the patients with a total of 92 CTCs. We could demonstrate that at least 69.6% of the CTCs exhibit an ERα and/or ErbB2 status different from the status of the primary tumor and that the CTCs from only 30% of the patients had no change of receptor status. Strikingly, heterogeneities of the status, aggregation, and size clearly appear within the CTCs. The data we generated outline the importance of a profiling not only of tumors but also of CTCs to establish individualized treatments. CTCs may then appear as new prognosis and treatment marker for both metastatic and adjuvant breast cancers.",

The effect of ectopic expression of MDGI on EGFR, ErbB2, and integrin function and traffic was investigated in breast and lung cancer cell lines using multiple methods. The effect of anti-EGFR agents on these cells were tested by cell proliferation measurements and by assessing tumor growth of breast cancer cells in cetuximab treated and control athymic nude mice.;Here, we show that although MDGI is absent in cultured cell lines because of epigenetic silencing, MDGI mRNA is expressed in 40% of clinical breast carcinomas and 85% of lung cancers. Ectopic expression of MDGI rendered breast and lung cancer cells resistant to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in vitro and in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. When expressed in cancer cells, MDGI induces intracellular accumulation of EGFR, but not ErbB2, and the internalized receptor is phosphorylated and not degraded.;MDGI-driven inherent desensitization of cancer cells is a novel molecular mechanism for resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and MDGI may be a biomarker for responsiveness to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.",

Amplification was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and defined as an HER2-to-chromosome enumeration probe 17 ratio of at least 2.0. Mutation was assessed by fragment analysis, mass spectrometry genotyping, and Sanger sequencing. Overexpression was assessed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The frequencies of HER2 amplification and mutation and HER2 overexpression were calculated and their overlap examined.;HER2 amplification was detected by FISH in 5 of 175 cases (3%). HER2 mutation was detected in 4 of 148 specimens (3%), including three identical 12-base pair insertions (p.A775_G776insYVMA) and a 9-base pair insertion, all in exon 20.

However, specific mechanisms of how a particular receptor contributes to generating the flexibility that leads to aberrant growth regulation have not been well described. We compared the utilization of ErbB2 in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heregulin stimulation in colon carcinoma cells. Anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody 2C4 blocked heregulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3; activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K), and Akt; proliferation; and anchorage-independent growth. 2C4 blocked EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ErbB2 and inhibited PI3K/Akt and anchorage-independent growth but did not affect ErbB1 or MAPK. Immunoprecipitations showed that ErbB3 and Grb2-associated binder (Gab) 1 were phosphorylated and associated with PI3K activity after heregulin treatment and that Gab1 and Gab2, but not ErbB3, were phosphorylated and associated with PI3K activity after EGF treatment. These data show that monoclonal antibody 2C4 inhibited all aspects of heregulin signaling as well as anchorage-independent and monolayer growth. Furthermore, we identify ErbB2 as a critical component of EGF signaling to the Gab1/Gab2-PI3K-Akt pathway and anchorage-independent growth, but EGF stimulation of MAPK and monolayer growth can occur efficiently without the contribution of ErbB2.",

One larger MCR of gain contained NSD1. One focal amplification and nine gains contained FUS. NSD1 and FUS are oncogenes hitherto not known to be associated with lung cancer. FISH showed that the amplicon containing FUS was joined to the next telomeric amplicon at 16p11.2. FUS was over-expressed in 10 tumors with gain of 16p11.2 compared to 30 tumors without that gain. Other cancer genes present in aberrations included ARNT, BCL9, CDK4, CDKN2B, EGFR, ERBB2, MDM2, MDM4, MET, MYC and KRAS. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with adjustment for false-discovery rate revealed clusters differing by the level and pattern of aberrations and displaying particular tumor characteristics. One cluster was strongly associated with gain of MYC. Another cluster was characterized by extensive losses containing tumor suppressor genes of which RB1 and WRN. Tumors in that cluster frequently harbored a central scar-like fibrosis. A third cluster was associated with gains on 7p and 7q, containing ETV1 and BRAF, and displayed the highest rate of EGFR mutations. SNP array analysis validated copy-number aberrations and revealed that RB1 and WRN were altered by recurrent copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity.;The present study has uncovered new aberrations containing cancer genes. The oncogene FUS is a candidate gene in the 16p region that is frequently gained in never smokers.

Tissue samples of 118 women treated for breast cancer were obtained. Evaluation of aluminum content was carried out using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. A tissue microarray slide containing the tumor samples was used in FISH assays to assess ERBB2, C-MYC, and CCND1 expressions as well as the statuses of their respective chromosomes 17, 8, and 11. Clinicopathological data were obtained from patient's records. Aluminum levels of >2.0 mg/kg were found in 20.3 and 22.1% of the central and peripheral breast tumor areas, respectively. Amplification and/or aneuploid-positive statuses for ERBB2/CEP17, C-MYC/CEP8, and CCND1/CEP11 were detected in 24, 36.7, and 29.3% of the tumors, respectively. We found that aluminum concentration was not related to these altered gene statuses. Our findings suggest that aluminum concentration does not affect genomic stability in breast tissues.

To go further in the characterization of the EGF pathway, we screened EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA for mutations in 2 groups of White patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (45 cancers from women and 46 cancers from men). Associations between TP53 mutations, clinicopathologic parameters, and EGF pathway molecular alterations were analyzed. All mutations were exclusive and essentially found in EGFR and KRAS. We demonstrated that EGFR mutations were linked to female sex, absence of smoking, late age at diagnosis, and adenocarcinoma (ADC) with bronchioloalveolar (BAC) features. Moreover, in invasive ADC with BAC component, microdissection assays showed that mutations were retrieved in both tumor subtypes suggesting that EGFR mutations appear early in lung carcinogenesis. On the contrary, KRAS mutations correlated with smoking, younger age at diagnosis, and ADC subtype regardless of BAC differentiation. These results suggest the existence of distinct carcinogenesis pathways both leading to disruption of EGF regulation and targeted either by tobacco carcinogens or by unidentified toxic. The identification of BAC features in ADC helps clustering patients that are more likely to fit the EGFR-mutated group.",

Recent studies have suggested that the NF2 protein, merlin (or schwannomin), may regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, intracellular mitogenic growth control pathways, or adherens junction organization in non-nervous-system cell types. For this report, we used glial fibrillary acidic protein conditional knockout mice and derivative glia to determine how merlin regulates CNS glial cell proliferation. We show that the loss of merlin in glial cells results in increased proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Merlin regulation of glial cell growth reflects deregulated Src activity, such that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of Src activation reduces Nf2(-/-) glial cell growth to wild-type levels. We further show that Src regulates Nf2(-/-) glial cell growth by sequentially regulating FAK and paxillin phosphorylation/activity. Next, we demonstrate that Src activation results from merlin regulation of ErbB2 activation and that genetic or pharmacologic ErbB2 inhibition reduces Nf2(-/-) glial cell Src/Src effector activation and proliferation to wild-type levels. Lastly, we show that merlin competes with Src for direct binding to ErbB2 and present a novel molecular mechanism for merlin regulation of ErbB2-dependent Src signaling and growth control.",

We determined whether BCAR4 expression sensitises breast cancer cells to lapatinib, and identifies a subgroup of patients who possibly may benefit from ERBB2-targeted therapies despite having tumours with low ERBB2 expression.;Proliferation assays were applied to determine the effect of BCAR4 expression on lapatinib treatment. Changes in cell signalling were quantified with reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of ERBB2 and BCAR4 was performed in 1418 primary breast cancers. Combined BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA levels were evaluated for association with progression-free survival (PFS) in 293 oestrogen receptor-α (ER)-positive patients receiving tamoxifen as first-line monotherapy for recurrent disease.;BCAR4 expression strongly sensitised ZR-75-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells to the combination of lapatinib and antioestrogens. Lapatinib interfered with phosphorylation of ERBB2 and its downstream mediators AKT, FAK, SHC, STAT5, and STAT6. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that 27.6% of the breast cancers were positive for BCAR4 and 22% expressed also low levels of ERBB2. The clinical significance of combining BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA status was underscored by the finding that the group of patients having BCAR4-positive/ERBB2-low-expressing cancers had a shorter PFS on tamoxifen treatment than the BCAR4-negative group.;This study shows that BCAR4 expression identifies a subgroup of ER-positive breast cancer patients without overexpression of ERBB2 who have a poor outcome and might benefit from combined ERBB2-targeted and antioestrogen therapy.",

We assessed the oncogene status with reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) values for ERBB2 (14.4, 400, and 300 for SUM149, SUM190, and SKBR3, respectively) and for EGFR (60.1, not detected, and 1.4 for the same 3 cell lines). We then used RNA-Seq data to identify those oncogenes with significant transcript levels in these cell lines (total 31) and interrogated the corresponding proteomics data sets for proteins with significant interaction values with these oncogenes. The number of observed interactors for each oncogene showed a significant range, e.g., 4.2% (JAK1) to 27.3% (MYC). The percentage is measured as a fraction of the total protein interactions in a given data set vs total interactors for that oncogene in STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, version 9.0) and I2D (Interologous Interaction Database, version 1.95). This approach allowed us to focus on 4 main oncogenes, ERBB2, EGFR, MYC, and GRB2, for pathway analysis. We used bioinformatics sites GeneGo, PathwayCommons and NCI receptor signaling networks to identify pathways that contained the four main oncogenes and had good coverage in the transcriptomic and proteomic data sets as well as a significant number of oncogene interactors. The four pathways identified were ERBB signaling, EGFR1 signaling, integrin outside-in signaling, and validated targets of C-MYC transcriptional activation. The greater dynamic range of the RNA-Seq values allowed the use of transcript ratios to correlate observed protein values with the relative levels of the ERBB2 and EGFR transcripts in each of the four pathways. This provided us with potential proteomic signatures for the SUM149 and 190 cell lines, growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7), Crk-like protein (CRKL) and Catenin delta-1 (CTNND1) for ERBB signaling; caveolin 1 (CAV1), plectin (PLEC) for EGFR signaling; filamin A (FLNA) and actinin alpha1 (ACTN1) (associated with high levels of EGFR transcript) for integrin signalings; branched chain amino-acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CAD), nucleolin (NCL) (high levels of EGFR transcript); transferrin receptor (TFRC), metadherin (MTDH) (high levels of ERBB2 transcript) for MYC signaling; S100-A2 protein (S100A2), caveolin 1 (CAV1), Serpin B5 (SERPINB5), stratifin (SFN), PYD and CARD domain containing (PYCARD), and EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2) for PI3K signaling, p53 subpathway.

Mutations in BRCA1 gene is one of the important genetic predisposing factors inbreast cancer. Similarly ERBB2 and TP53 are also key prognostic markers in breast cancer treatment.We were interested to explore the gene expression profiles of BRCA1, ERBB2 and TP53 in breast cancer women patients from Iraq so as to assess the potential of such markers in breast cancer treatment. The mRNA levels were significantly over-expressed in tumor tissues in comparison to normal ones with p values (p<0.005) observed between malignant BRCA1 and control tissue samples. Similarly significant difference (p<0.001) was observed between malignant ERBB2 in comparison to control, and malignant TP53 and benign tissue samples as well. However in blood samples, no considerable expression of these markers was observed. Out of three selected genes, ERBB2 expression was significantly expressed in comparison to BRCA1 and TP53 in cancer tissue. Mutation analysis of BRCA1, ERBB2 and TP53 has been made to find out the region most susceptible to mutations in these genes The BRCA1 exon 11, ERBB2 16 and TP53 exon 5 displayed increased chances of having mutations. We can conclude from the study that differential gene expression of BRCA1, ERBB2 and TP53 at mRNA levels may act as a diagnostic marker of circulating tumor cells having important prognostic value in breast cancer patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"To clarify the pathogenic and biological significance of EGFR mutations in lung cancer, we compared the status of ERBB family receptors, their downstream signal transductions and biological phenotypes between lung cancer cell lines with mutant and wild type EGFR. We initially analyzed expression and phosphorylation of ERBB family receptors and their major downstream proteins, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3, in a series of lung cancer cell lines with or without EGFR mutation. The expression levels of EGFR as well as of ERBB2 and ERBB3 proteins in cells with EGFR mutation tended to be higher than those in cells with wild type EGFR. There was no difference in stability between mutant and wild type EGFR proteins. EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 to various extents, but the level of induction was not associated with the existence of EGFR mutation. These results implied that the activation of AKT, p44/42 MAPK and STAT3 signaling transmitted by EGFR would be critical for the growth and survival of lung cancer cells, but specific features of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells was not discriminated by these approaches. We therefore performed transfection studies using PC-13 cells with no detectable endogenous EGFR expression. Exogenous expression of wild type and mutant EGFR (delE746-A750) in the cells revealed that only in the mutant EGFR transfected cells, EGFR itself as well as AKT and STAT3 were highly phosphorylated after 24h of serum deprivation. The survival time of mutant EGFR transfected cells was prolonged under serum-free culture conditions, but not under standard culture conditions with 10% serum. These results suggest that cells with a mutant EGFR survive through the activation of the AKT and/or STAT3 pathways, even in low EGF microenvironments. This specific property due to EGFR mutation could be an important step of multistage lung cancer progression.",

In this study, we compared the role of EGF-mediated signaling in nonmalignant (BPH-1, PNT1A, and PNT1B) and PC cell lines (DU145, PC3, LNCaP, and CWR22Rv1). EGF-induced proliferation was observed in all EGFR-expressing PC cells except PC3, indicating that EGFR expression does not unequivocally trigger proliferation following EGF stimulation. ErbB2 recruitment potentiated EGF-induced signals and was associated with the most pronounced effects of EGF despite low EGFR expression. In this way, the sum of EGFR and ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation proved to be a more sensitive indicator of EGF-induced proliferation than quantification of the expression of either receptor alone. Both Akt and ERK were rapidly phosphorylated in response to EGF, with ERK phosphorylation being the weakest in PC3 cells. Extrapolation of these findings to clinical PC suggests that assessment of phosphorylated EGFR + ErbB2 together could serve as a marker for sensitivity to anti-EGFR-targeted therapies.",

NF1 and KRAS cohorts were identified, with subsequent clinical and genomic analysis.;Among 591 patients, 60 had NF1 mutations (10%) and 141 (24%) had KRAS mutations. 15 NF1 mutations (25%) occurred with other oncogenic mutations [BRAF (2); ERBB2 (2); KRAS (9); HRAS (1); NRAS (1)]. There were 72 unique NF1 variants. NF1 tumor pathology was diverse, including both adenocarcinoma (36, 60%) and squamous cell carcinoma (10, 17%). In contrast, KRAS mutations occurred predominantly in adenocarcinoma (136, 96%). Both mutations were common in former/current smokers. Among NF1 tumors without concurrent oncogenic alterations, TP53 mutations/2-copy deletions occurred more often (33, 65%) than with KRAS mutation (46, 35%; P < 0.001). No difference between cohorts was seen with other tumor suppressors.;NF1 mutations define a unique population of NSCLC.

However, deletion of PTP1B activity in the NDL2 transgenic mice either by breeding with Ptpn1-deficient mice or by treatment with a specific PTP1B inhibitor results in significant mammary tumor latency and resistance to lung metastasis.

We studied the activity of metformin against diverse molecular subtypes of breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Metformin showed biological activity against all estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative, erbB2 normal and abnormal breast cancer cell lines tested. It inhibited cellular proliferation, reduced colony formation and caused partial cell cycle arrest at the G(1) checkpoint. Metformin did not induce apoptosis (as measured by DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage) in luminal A, B or erbB2 subtype breast cancer cell lines. At the molecular level, metformin treatment was associated with a reduction of cyclin D1 and E2F1 expression with no changes in p27(kip1) or p21(waf1). It inhibited mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt activity, as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in both ER positive and negative, erbB2-overexpressing and erbB2-normal expressing breast cancer cells. In erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, metformin reduced erbB2 expression at higher concentrations, and at lower concentrations within the therapeutic range, it inhibited erbB2 tyrosine kinase activity evidenced by a reduction of phosphorylated erbB2 (P-erbB2) at both auto- and Src- phosphorylation sites. These data suggest that metformin may have potential therapeutic utility against ER positive and negative, erbB2-overexpressing and erbB2-normal expressing breast cancer cells.",

Recently, reductive carboxylation of glutamine for lipogenesis has been shown to constitute a key anabolic route in cancer cells. However, little is known regarding central regulators of the various glutamine metabolic pathways in cancer cells.;The impact of PGC-1α and ERRα on glutamine enzyme expression was assessed in ERBB2+ breast cancer cell lines with quantitative RT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting experiments. Glutamine flux was quantified using 13C-labeled glutamine and GC/MS analyses. Functional assays for lipogenesis were performed using 14C-labeled glutamine. The expression of glutamine metabolism genes in breast cancer patients was determined by bioinformatics analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas.;We show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, along with the transcription factor ERRα, is a positive regulator of the expression of glutamine metabolism genes in ERBB2+ breast cancer. Indeed, ERBB2+ breast cancer cells with increased expression of PGC-1α display elevated expression of glutamine metabolism genes. Furthermore, ERBB2+ breast cancer cells with reduced expression of PGC-1α or when treated with C29, a pharmacological inhibitor of ERRα, exhibit diminished expression of glutamine metabolism genes. The biological relevance of the control of glutamine metabolism genes by the PGC-1α/ERRα axis is demonstrated by consequent regulation of glutamine flux through the citric acid cycle. PGC-1α and ERRα regulate both the canonical citric acid cycle (forward) and the reductive carboxylation (reverse) fluxes; the latter can be used to support de novo lipogenesis reactions, most notably in hypoxic conditions. Importantly, murine and human ERBB2+ cells lines display a significant dependence on glutamine availability for their growth. Finally, we show that PGC-1α expression is positively correlated with that of the glutamine pathway in ERBB2+ breast cancer patients, and high expression of this pathway is associated with reduced patient survival.;These data reveal that the PGC-1α/ERRα axis is a central regulator of glutamine metabolism in ERBB2+ breast cancer. This novel regulatory link, as well as the marked reduction in patient survival time associated with increased glutamine pathway gene expression, suggests that targeting glutamine metabolism may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of ERBB2+ breast cancer.",

Concurrent targeting of ErbB2 stability with HSP90 inhibitors is synergistic with Trastuzumab, suggesting that pharmacological agents that can inhibit HSP90 as well as signaling pathways activated by ErbB2 could be useful against ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers. The triterpene natural product Celastrol inhibits HSP90 and several pathways relevant to ErbB2-dependent oncogenesis including the NFκB pathway and the proteasome, and has shown promising activity in other cancer models. Here, we demonstrate that Celastrol exhibits in vitro antitumor activity against a panel of human breast cancer cell lines with selectivity towards those overexpressing ErbB2. Celastrol strongly synergized with ErbB2-targeted therapeutics Trastuzumab and Lapatinib, producing higher cytotoxicity with substantially lower doses of Celastrol. Celastrol significantly retarded the rate of growth of ErbB2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model with only minor systemic toxicity. Mechanistically, Celastrol not only induced the expected ubiquitinylation and degradation of ErbB2 and other HSP90 client proteins, but it also increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our studies show that the Michael Acceptor functionality in Celastrol is important for its ability to destabilize ErbB2 and exert its bioactivity against ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.

Here, we demonstrate that the ErbB2ΔEx16 is a major oncogenic driver in breast cancer that constitutively signals from the cell surface. We further show that inducible expression of the ErbB2ΔEx16 variant in mammary gland of transgenic mice results in the rapid development of metastatic multifocal mammary tumors. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the ErbB2ΔEx16-derived mammary tumors exhibit several unique features that distinguish this model from the conventional ErbB2 ones expressing the erbB2 proto-oncogene in mammary epithelium. Unlike the wild-type ErbB2-derived tumors that express luminal keratins, ErbB2ΔEx16-derived tumors exhibit high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity co-expressing both basal and luminal keratins.

The ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimer appears to be the strongest and most potent inducer of cellular transformation and mitogenic signaling compared to other ErbB homodimers and heterodimers. Spatial structure of the heterodimeric complex formed by TM domains of ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors embedded into lipid bicelles was obtained by solution NMR.

In order to discuss the flexibility of the complex ErbB2-ECD/trastuzumab, we present, in this study, a multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation (MD) together with an analysis of fluctuations, through a principal component analysis (PCA) of this system. Previous to this step and in order to validate the simulations, we have performed a detailed analysis of the variable antibody domain interactions with the extracellular domain IV of ErbB2. This structure has been statically elucidated by x-ray studies. Indeed, the simulation results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental information during the full trajectory. The PCA shows eigenvector fluctuations resulting in a hinge motion in which domain II and C(H) domains approach each other. This move is likely stabilized by the formation of H-bonds and salt bridge interactions between residues of the dimerization arm in the domain II and trastuzumab residues located in the C(H) domain. Finally, we discuss the flexibility of the MD/PCA model in relation with the static x-ray structure.

The goal of this study was to examine the splice variants expressed in three ERBB2 expressed breast cancer cell-line models of hormone-receptor-negative breast cancers by integrating RNA-Seq and proteomic mass spectrometry data. The cell lines represent distinct phenotypic variations subtype: SKBR3 (ERBB2+ (overexpression)/ER-/PR-; adenocarcinoma), SUM190 (ERBB2+ (overexpression)/ER-/PR-; inflammatory breast cancer), and SUM149 (ERBB2 (low expression) ER-/PR-; inflammatory breast cancer). We identified more than one splice variant for 1167 genes expressed in at least one of the three cancer cell lines. We found multiple variants of genes that are in the signaling pathways downstream of ERBB2 along with variants specific to one cancer cell line compared with the other two cancer cell lines and with normal mammary cells. The overall transcript profiles based on read counts indicated more similarities between SKBR3 and SUM190. The top-ranking Gene Ontology and BioCarta pathways for the cell-line specific variants pointed to distinct key mechanisms including: amino sugar metabolism, caspase activity, and endocytosis in SKBR3; different aspects of metabolism, especially of lipids in SUM190; cell-to-cell adhesion, integrin, and ERK1/ERK2 signaling; and translational control in SUM149. The analyses indicated an enrichment in the electron transport chain processes in the ERBB2 overexpressed cell line models and an association of nucleotide binding, RNA splicing, and translation processes with the IBC models, SUM190 and SUM149. Detailed experimental studies on the distinct variants identified from each of these three breast cancer cell line models that may open opportunities for drug target discovery and help unveil their specific roles in cancer progression and metastasis.

The combined treatment of the cancer cell lines with Seleno-methionine and ionizing radiation resulted in increased cell killing as assessed by clonogenic survival assay whereas it had little effect on the normal diploid WI-38 cells. The increased radiosensitivity in the cancer cells was correlated with the attenuation of the key proteins involved in either cell survival signaling [Akt, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ErbB2 and Raf1] or DNA damage response (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, Ku80, 53BP1 and DNAPK). The attenuation of the proteins by the selenium compound was possibly caused by the effect on transcription and on protein stability since selenium treatment decreased both the RNA transcript and the protein stability of EGFR and DNAPK. By contrast, Seleno-L-methionine had no effect on the protein profile of a normal diploid fibroblast which is consistent with an intact radiosensitivity. These data provide possible clinical applications, as selenium selectively enhanced the radiosensitivity of the tumor cells whereas that of the normal cells was unaffected. Moreover, the selective decrease of cell proliferation signaling in tumor cells but not in normal cells should facilitate the repopulation of normal cells required for healing during radiation therapy. On the whole, the results suggest that the cancer preventive activity of selenium can be combined with ionizing radiation to improve the control of lung cancer.",

In human breast cancer (HBC), erbB-2 protein overexpression has been repeatedly correlated with poor prognosis. In more recent works, underexpression of this gene has been described in HBC. Moreover, it is also recognised that oncogenes that are commonly amplified or deleted encompass point mutations, and some of these are associated with HBC. In cat mammary lesions (CMLs), the overexpression of ERBB2 (27%-59.6%) has also been described, mostly at the protein level and although cat mammary neoplasias are considered to be a natural model of HBC, molecular information is still scarce. In the present work, a cat ERBB2 fragment, comprising exons 10 to 15 (ERBB2_10-15) was achieved for the first time. Allelic variants and genomic haplotype analyses were also performed, and differences between normal and CML populations were observed. Three amino acid changes, corresponding to 3 non-synonymous genomic sequence variants that were only detected in CMLs, were proposed to damage the 3D structure of the protein. We analysed the cat ERBB2 gene at the DNA (copy number determination), mRNA (expression levels assessment) and protein levels (in extra- and intra protein domains) in CML samples and correlated the last two evaluations with clinicopathological features. We found a positive correlation between the expression levels of the ERBB2 RNA and erbB-2 protein, corresponding to the intracellular region. Additionally, we detected a positive correlation between higher mRNA expression and better clinical outcome. Our results suggest that the ERBB2 gene is post-transcriptionally regulated and that proteins with truncations and single point mutations are present in cat mammary neoplastic lesions. We would like to emphasise that the recurrent occurrence of low erbB-2 expression levels in cat mammary tumours, suggests the cat mammary neoplasias as a valuable model for erbB-2 negative HBC. ",

However, the mechanism of ErbB2-mediated p21(Cip1) up-regulation is unclear. Here, we show that ErbB2 up-regulates p21(Cip1) transcription through increased Src activity in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Src activation further activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) that recognizes a SIE binding site on the p21(Cip1) promoter required for ErbB2-mediated p21(Cip1) transcriptional up-regulation. Both Src and STAT3 inhibitors restored Taxol sensitivity in resistant ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that ErbB2 overexpression can activate STAT3 through Src leading to transcriptional up-regulation of p21(Cip1) that confers Taxol resistance of breast cancer cells.

Tissue samples from 248 patients with primary breast cancer were consecutively assayed. We used two different cut-off levels for WB, ELISA, and EIA, defined as follows: 1) the highest level of expression of non malignant tissue was chosen as the discriminant threshold between 'low' and 'elevated' samples: 2) the elevated group was further subdivided into two subgroups: 'intermediate' and 'high', according to their median value. According to the first cut-off, the results were considered 'elevated' in about 52% of cases with the three biochemical methods, while using the second cut-off the percentage lowered to about 26%. Considering this cut-off, the concordance rates between the paired biochemical methods ranged between: 78.4% (WB vs EIA), 93% (ELISA vs EIA), and 82.6% (ELISA vs WB). The comparison between biochemical and immunohistochemical methods gave these concordance rates: 82% (WB vs IHC), 90.5% (ELISA vs IHC), and 85.5% (EIA vs. IHC). According to the first cut off level, 27.5% of tumor samples showed IHC detectable p185 levels, in agreement with other immunohistochemical studies. The relationship between high erbB2 and estrogen and progesterone receptors showed an inverse association. No relationship was found between erbB2 and axillary lymph node positivity or tumor size. In short, the results of the four methods seem generally well correlated; nevertheless, it appears that different methodological approaches of measuring p185neu are not completely equivalent, and there is a need for an authoritative standardization and quality control for clinical applications.",

Although the results showed overlapping of genomic alterations between the two subtypes, trends including more frequent KRAS alterations in pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma (61 vs 29%) and more frequent mutations in APC in intestinal-type ampullary carcinoma (43 vs 17%) were observed.

In the second phase of the study, we aimed at validating our observation on ERBB2 and assessed ERBB2 amplification and protein overexpression in a series of 100 ampullary carcinomas. We found that (1) gene amplification and immunohistochemical overexpression of ERBB2 occurred in 13% of all ampullary carcinomas, therefore providing a potential target for anti-HER2 therapy in these tumors; (2) amplification and immunohistochemical expression correlated in all cases, thus indicating that immunohistochemistry could be used to screen tumors; and (3) none of the 14 ERBB2-amplified tumors harbored any downstream driver mutations in KRAS/NRAS, whereas 56% of the cases negative for ERBB2 amplification did, an observation clinically pertinent as downstream mutations may cause primary resistance to inhibition of EGFR family members.

One of the molecular mechanisms of ErbB2-mediated paclitaxel resistance is that overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor leads to deregulation of the G2/M cell cycle check-point that inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Several promising ErbB2-targeting strategies have now been developed to conquer the adverse consequences of ErbB2 overexpression such as paclitaxel resistance. Among these, trastuzumab has brought great promise. We have recently shown that trastuzumab can effectively sensitize ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to paclitaxel by reversing the antiapoptotic function of ErbB2.

However, the pathobiologic role of FIP family members, such as FIP1C, in a tumor-specific setting remains elusive. In this study, we used ErbB2 mouse models of human breast cancer to investigate FIP1C function in tumorigenesis. Doxycycline-induced expression of FIP1C in the MMTV-ErbB2 mouse model resulted in delayed mammary tumor progression. Conversely, targeted deletion of FIP1C in the mammary epithelium of an ErbB2 model coexpressing Cre recombinase led to accelerated tumor onset. Genetic and biochemical characterization of these FIP1C-proficient and -deficient tumor models revealed that FIP1C regulated E-cadherin (CDH1) trafficking and ZONAB (YBX3) function in Cdk4-mediated cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FIP1C promoted lysosomal degradation of ErbB2. Consistent with our findings in the mouse, the expression of FIP1C was inversely correlated with ErbB2 levels in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that FIP1C acts as a tumor suppressor in the context of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and may be therapeutically exploited as an alternative strategy for targeting aberrant ErbB2 expression.

Similarly, stimulation with humanized anti ErbB2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was found to be internalized and co-localized with caveolin-1 in SKBR-3/Cav-1 cells. Internalized EC-eGFP and Trastuzumab in SKBR-3/Cav-1 cells were then delivered via caveolae to the caveolin-1 containing early endosomes. Consequently, attenuated Fc receptor mediated ADCC functions were observed when exposed to Trastuzumab and EC-Fc (EC-1 peptide conjugated to Fc part of human IgG). On the other hand, this caveolae dependent endocytic synergy was not observed in parental SKBR-3 cells.

Over-expression of ErbB2 is positively associated with elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations activates MMP-2 without altering its expression level in mammary epithelial cells over-expressing ErbB2, but not in cells expressing low levels of ErbB2. The activation is dependent on c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and reactive oxygen species. Selective inhibitors of MMP-2 and anti-oxidants significantly inhibit ethanol-stimulated cell invasion. Similarly, knocking down MMP-2 by small interference RNA induces a partial blockage on ethanol-promoted cell invasion.

        "Doc_abstract":"Abnormalities of chromosome 17, recognised over two decades ago to be important in tumorigenesis, often occur in breast cancer. Changes of specific loci on chromosome 17 including ERBB2 amplification, P53 loss, BRCA1 loss, and TOP2A amplification or deletion are known to have important roles in breast-cancer pathophysiology. Numerical aberrations of chromosome 17 are linked to breast-cancer initiation and progression, and possibly to treatment response. However, the clinical importance of chromosome 17 anomalies, in particular the effect on ERBB2 protein expression, is unknown. Reports are conflicting regarding the association of copy gain of chromosome 17 (polysomy 17) with strong ERBB2 protein expression in the absence of true ERBB2 gene amplification. Copy-number anomalies in chromosome 17 seem to be common in tumours that show discrepant ERBB2 expression and in tumours with discordant ERBB2-protein and ERBB2 gene copy number measurements. The mechanisms of ERBB2 dosage changes-gene amplification versus chromosome gain and loss-probably differ in primary and metastatic disease; however, a correction for chromosome 17 copy-number is necessary to completely distinguish between these mechanisms. A better understanding of how polysomy 17 affects gene-copy number and protein expression will help to select patients who will respond to therapies targeting ERBB2 and other protein products of chromosome 17 loci.",

We have previously demonstrated that p130Cas adaptor is a crucial mediator of ErbB2 transformation. Here, we analysed the molecular mechanisms through which p130Cas controls ErbB2-dependent invasion in three-dimensional cultures of mammary epithelial cells. Concomitant p130Cas over-expression and ErbB2 activation enhance PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 MAPK signalling pathways and promote invasion of mammary acini. By using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that both signalling cascades are required for the invasive behaviour of p130Cas over-expressing and ErbB2 activated acini. Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signalling triggers invasion through distinct downstream effectors involving mTOR/p70S6K and Rac1 activation, respectively. Moreover, in silico analyses indicate that p130Cas expression in ErbB2 positive human breast cancers significantly correlates with higher risk to develop distant metastasis, thus underlying the value of the p130Cas/ErbB2 synergism in regulating breast cancer invasion. In conclusion, high levels of p130Cas favour progression of ErbB2-transformed cells towards an invasive phenotype.",

In this study, we determine the role of erbB3 in erbB2-mediated paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer cells. The overexpression of exogenous erbB3 via either stable or transient transfection in erbB2-overexpressing, but not epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing, breast cancer cells significantly decreases paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Consistently, knockdown of erbB3 expression with a specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in breast cancer cells with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3 enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis evidenced by increased DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and -8. Furthermore, while forced overexpression of erbB3 increases, specific knockdown of erbB3 decreases the expression levels of Survivin only in the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Targeting Survivin with specific shRNA overcomes paclitaxel resistance without effect on the expression levels of either erbB2 or erbB3. Mechanistic studies indicate that the specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K), Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, not only abrogate erbB3-mediated upregulation of Survivin, but also reinforce the erbB2/erbB3-coexpressing breast cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition. These data demonstrate that heterodimerization of erbB2/erbB3 is a prerequisite for erbB2 tyrosine kinase activation; and elevated expression of erbB3 is required for erbB2-mediated paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer cells via PI-3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway-dependent upregulation of Survivin. Our studies suggest that new strategies targeting erbB3 or Survivin may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents against erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer.",

Altogether, 397 individual tumors were arrayed in a single paraffin block. To determine whether results from the literature can be reproduced on minute tissue samples (diameter, 0.6 mm), amplification of three extensively studied oncogenes (CCND1, CMYC, and ERBB2) was analyzed in three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments from consecutive sections cut from the tissue microarray. Amplification of CCND1 was found in breast, lung, head and neck, and bladder cancer, as well as in melanoma. ERBB2 was amplified in bladder, breast, colon, stomach, testis, and lung cancer. CMYC was amplified in breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovary, bladder, head and neck, and endometrial cancer. These results confirm and even extend existing data in the literature on such amplifications.

We observed that the rate of larger tumors in triple negative patients was higher than that in HR+/ERBB2- women, but lower than that in ERBB2+ subgroup (P = 0.0001). In addition, 21.83% of triple negative patients had four or more axillary lymph nodes involved as compared to 27.40% of ERBB2+ women and 22.75% of HR+/ERBB2- subgroup (P = 0.0056). In the survival analysis, we found a statistical significance for recurrence-free survival (RFS) among the three subgroups (P = 0.0037), with the rate of 72.89% for ERBB2+ patients, 78.40% for HR+/ERBB2- ones and 75.76% for triple negative ones at the 11th year respectively. When it came to hazard peaks, discrepancies existed in different subgroups. Similar to HR+/ERBB2- patients, triple negative subgroup showed an early major recurrence surge peaking at approximately year 2.5 as opposed to ERBB2+ counterparts with a tapering sharp at the 1st year. Furthermore, the first peak of triple negative tumors was higher than that of HR+/ERBB2- patients, but lower than that of ERBB2+ ones.

We show that p85-sErbB3 binds to HRG with an affinity comparable to that of full-length ErbB3 and competitively inhibits high affinity HRG binding to ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers on the cell surface of breast carcinoma cells with an IC(50) of 0.5 nM. p85-sErbB3 inhibits HRG-induced phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 in breast carcinoma-derived cell lines and can also block HRG-stimulated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt, and association of ErbB3 with the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase p85 regulatory subunit. Cell growth assays show that exogenous addition of a 100-fold molar excess of p85-sErbB3 inhibits HRG-stimulated cell growth by as much as 90%. Whereas several potential mechanisms of p85-sErbB3 inhibition of ErbB receptor activation exist, our results suggest that at least one means of inhibition is competition for HRG binding. The IC(50) for both p85-sErbB3- and 2C4 (a monoclonal antibody specific for ErbB2)-mediated inhibition of HRG binding is approximately 0.5 nM, although the mechanism of inhibition by these two proteins is distinct.

Relative mRNA values, that is, T/NT ratios, of target genes were calculated and hazard ratios (HRs) for each gene of interest were adjusted for age, gender, performance status, minor RAS mutations and other clinicopathological variables which exhibited P-values<0.1 on the basis of univariate analysis.;Among 108 cases who received anti-EGFR antibodies, there were 96 cases of KRAS exon2 wild-type patients enroled in this study.

Patients with high AREG had longer OS compared with low AREG (HR: 0.227, 95% CI: 0.095-0.808).;Our study has shown that higher T/NT ratios of ERBB2, MET and VEGFA mRNA were associated with worse OS in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR antibodies, with higher EREG and AREG were associated with better prognosis in the same setting.

The fluorinated analog of deoxycytidine, gemcitabine and emerging FOLFIRINOX protocol (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan/SN-38, oxaliplatin and leucovorin) are the main chemotherapies to treat PDAC. The ErbB2/HER2 oncogenic receptor is commonly overexpressed in PDAC. In this context, we aimed to decipher the ErbB2-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance to the two main chemotherapy protocols used to treat PDAC.ErbB2 knocking down (KD) in CAPAN-1 and CAPAN-2 cells led to an increased sensitivity to gemcitabine and an increased resistance to irinotecan/SN-38 both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous xenografts) This was correlated to an increase of hCNT1 and hCNT3 transporters and ABCG2, MRP1 and MRP2 ATP-binding cassette transporters expression and resistance to cell death. We also show that MRP2 is repressed following activation of JNK, Erk1/2 and NF-κB pathways by ErbB2. Finally, in datasets of human PDAC samples, ErbB2 and MRP2 expression was conversely correlated. Altogether, we propose that ErbB2 mediates several intracellular mechanisms linked to PDAC cell chemoresistance that may represent potential targets in order to ameliorate chemotherapy response and allow stratification of patients eligible for either gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX treatment.",

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of gefitinib against the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines NCI-H82, NCI-H209, NCI-H510, NCI-H526 and NCI-H660. SCLC has been reported to express a low to undetectable level of EGFR. We compared the effects of gefitinib between cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression. First, we evaluated expression levels of EGFR and HER2/neu by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation respectively; EGFR protein was detected in two of the five SCLC cell lines, whereas HER2/neu was not detected in any. Next, we analyzed expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and compared these results with EGFR (HER-1/ErbB1) and HER2/neu (ErbB2) expression levels, as EGFR conducts signals through Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway; gefitinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF addition in cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression.

Mutually exclusive somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene (36/86, 41.8%), K-ras gene (11/86, 12.8%) and BRAF gene (1/86, 1.1%) were detected.

Twenty-seven genes showed increased expression in EGFR-mutated tumors and these included molecules that function in the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF pathway (EGFR, AKT1 and BCR). In particular, expression of BCR, which is required for EGFR protein degradation, was induced by EGF stimulation, suggesting a negative feedback loop in lung cancer.

ErbB2 kinase activity promotes Ras-mediated stimulation of downstream protein kinase cascades, including the Ras/Raf-1/MAPK/ERK kinase (Mek)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway, leading to tumor cell growth and migration. Signaling through the Ras-Erk pathway can be influenced by p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1), an effector of the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42. In this study, we asked if ErbB2 expression correlates with Pak1 and Erk activity in human breast cancer specimens, and if Pak1 signaling is required for ErbB2 transformation in a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro setting and in xenografts. We found a correlation between ErbB2 expression and activation of Pak in estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumor samples and observed that in 3D cultures, activation of Rac-Pak1 pathway by ErbB2 homodimers induced growth factor-independent proliferation and promoted disruption of 3D mammary acinar-like structures through activation of the Erk and Akt pathways. Further, we found that inhibition of Pak1 by small molecules compromised activation of Erk and Akt, resulting in reversion of the malignant phenotype and restoration of normal acinar architecture. Finally, ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells expressing a specific Pak inhibitor showed delayed tumor formation and downregulation of Erk and Akt signaling in vivo. These data imply that the Rac-Pak pathway is vital to ErbB2-mediated transformation and that Pak inhibitors represent plausible drug targets in breast cancers in which ErbB2 signaling is activated.",

Prior results have suggested that tetraspanin CD151 might contribute to ErbB2-driven breast cancer growth, survival, and metastasis. In other cancer types, CD151 sometimes supports tumor growth and metastasis. However, a definitive test of CD151 effects on de novo breast cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis has not previously been done. We used CD151 gene-deleted mice expressing the MMTV-ErbB2 transgene to show that CD151 strongly supports ErbB2+ mammary tumor initiation and metastasis. Delayed tumor onset (by 70-100 days) in the absence of CD151 was accompanied by reduced survival of mammary epithelial cells and impaired activation of FAK- and MAPK-dependent pathways. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules showed smooth, regular borders, consistent with a less invasive phenotype. Furthermore, consistent with impaired oncogenesis and decreased metastasis, CD151-targeted MCF-10A/ErbB2 cells showed substantial decreases in three-dimensional colony formation, EGF-stimulated tumor cell motility, invasion, and transendothelial migration. These CD151-dependent functions were largely mediated through α6β4 integrin. Moreover, CD151 ablation substantially prevented PKC- and EGFR/ERK-dependent α6β4 integrin phosphorylation, consistent with retention of epithelial cell polarity and intermediate filament cytoskeletal connections, which helps to explain diminished metastasis. Finally, clinical data analyses revealed a strong correlation between CD151 and ErbB2 expression and metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that CD151 collaborates with LB integrins (particularly α6β4 and ErbB2 (and EGFR) receptors to regulate multiple signaling pathways, thereby driving mammary tumor onset, survival, and metastasis. Consequently, CD151 is a useful therapeutic target in malignant ErbB2+ breast cancer.",

The inhibition of ErbB2 signal transduction pathways by the use of human antibodies could be a valuable alternative strategy for cancer therapy.

Mutations in BRCA1 also predispose to other types of cancers, pointing to a fundamental role of this pathway in tumor suppression and emphasizing the need for effective chemoprevention in these high-risk patients. Because the methyl ester of the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) is a potent chemopreventive agent, we tested its efficacy in a highly relevant mouse model of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer. Beginning at 12 weeks of age, Brca1(Co/Co); MMTV-Cre;p53(+/-) mice were fed powdered control diet or diet containing CDDO-Me (50 mg/kg diet). CDDO-Me significantly (P < 0.05) delayed tumor development in the Brca1-mutated mice by an average of 5.2 weeks. We also observed that levels of ErbB2, p-ErbB2, and cyclin D1 increased in a time-dependent manner in the mammary glands in Brca1-deficient mice, and CDDO-Me inhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB2 in tumor tissues from these mice. In BRCA1-deficient cell lines, the triterpenoids directly interacted with ErbB2, decreased constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB2, inhibited proliferation, and induced G(0)-G(1) arrest. These results suggest that CDDO-Me has the potential to prevent BRCA1-mutated breast cancer.",

Inhibitors targeting them are vigorously developed and some of them are tested in the clinical setting. Amplifications of certain RTKs (c-Met, FGFR2 and ErbB2) have been associated with human gastric cancer progression. According to our genome-wide scans of genetic lesions in 34 gastric cancer cell lines using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping microarrays, we confirmed that the c-met locus was amplified in four gastric cancer cell lines (Hs746T, MKN45, NUGC4 and SNU5). It was reported that somatic mutation is occasionally detected in tumor samples of a certain type of cancer with gene amplification. Previous reports showed gastric cancers harbored mutations of FGFR2 and ErbB2, but c-Met oncogenic mutation had not yet been reported. We performed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domains of c-Met using the genome DNA of the gastric cancer cell lines, and found that Hs746T cells had a splice site mutation of exon 14. By cDNA sequencing and Western blotting, we showed that the mutation caused juxtamembrane domain deletion. Previously, this mutation had been detected only in lung cancer specimens and this deletion resulted in the loss of Cbl E3-ligase binding causing decreased ubiquitination and delayed down-regulation. In conclusion, four gastric cancer cell lines harbored amplification of c-met locus, and among them, Hs746T had a putative oncogenic mutation with amplification. This information will be useful for screening of inhibitors targeting gastric cancer with c-Met aberration.",

Unfortunately, the outcome of current therapies for ErbB2-positive breast cancers remains unsatisfying due to resistance and side effects. New therapies for ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers continue to be in great need. Peptide therapy using cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) as peptide carriers is promising because the internalization is highly efficient, and the cargoes delivered can be bioactive. However, the major obstacle in using these powerful CPPs for therapy is their lack of specificity. Here, we sought to develop a peptide carrier that could introduce therapeutics specifically to ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. By modifying the HIV TAT-derived CPP and conjugating anti-HER-2/neu peptide mimetic (AHNP), we developed the peptide carrier (P3-AHNP) that specifically targeted ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. A signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-inhibiting peptide conjugated to this peptide carrier (P3-AHNP-STAT3BP) was delivered more efficiently into ErbB2-overexpressing than ErbB2 low-expressing cancer cells in vitro and successfully decreased STAT3 binding to STAT3-interacting DNA sequence. P3-AHNP-STAT3BP inhibited cell growth in vitro, with ErbB2-overexpressing 435.eB breast cancer cells being more sensitive to the treatment than the ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells. Compared with ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 xenografts, i.p. injected P3-AHNP-STAT3BP preferentially accumulated in 435.eB xenografts, which led to more reduction of proliferation and increased apoptosis and targeted inhibition of tumor growth. This novel peptide delivery system provided a sound basis for the future development of safe and effective new-generation therapeutics to cancer-specific molecular targets.",

Well-characterized liposomes, containing the ErbB2 (p63-71) TCD8(+) and HA (p307-319) TCD4(+) peptide epitopes and the Pam2CAG adjuvant, were formulated and administered into the airway of naïve BALB/c mice. The nanoparticle vaccine candidate induced local and specific systemic immune response, as measured by immune cell infiltration and chemokine and cytokine production in BALF or lung tissue, and by spleen T-cell activation ex vivo, respectively. This potent immune response resulted in an efficient antitumor activity against both lung and solid s.c. tumors. Interestingly, the antitumor efficacy was observed after both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccinations, which are the most judicious ones to fight cancer.

We also show that coordinate inhibition of this multi-kinase signaling has substantially greater effect on ovarian cancer proliferation and survival, compared to inhibition of individual activated kinases. The inhibition of this multi-RTK signaling by HSP90 suppression results in profound pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects, and is associated with the inactivation of RTK downstream PI3-K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MAPK signaling.;These studies suggest that anti-multiple RTK strategy could be useful in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB receptors play an important role in normal cellular growth, differentiation and development, but overexpression or poor downregulation can result in enhanced signaling and cancerous growth. ErbB signaling is terminated by clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by incorporation in multi-vesicular bodies and subsequent degradation in lysosomes. In contrast to EGFR, ErbB2 displays poor ligand-induced downregulation and enhanced recycling, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this difference are poorly understood. Given our previous observation that both EGFR and an EGFR-ErbB2 chimera undergo Cbl-mediated K63-polyubiquitination, we investigated in the present study whether activation of the EGFR and the EGFR-ErbB2 chimera is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the ESCRT-0 complex subunit Hrs and AMSH-mediated deubiquitination. EGF stimulation of the EGFR resulted in efficient Hrs tyrosine phosphorylation and deubiquitination by the K63-polyubiquitin chain-specific deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH. In contrast, EGF activation of EGFR-ErbB2 showed significantly decreased Hrs tyrosine phosphorylation and deubiquitination by AMSH. To test whether this phenotype is the result of endosomal recycling, we induced recycling of the EGFR by stimulation with TGFα. Indeed, even though TGFα-stimulation of EGFR is associated with efficient ligand-stimulated K63-polyubiquitination, we observed that Hrs tyrosine phosphorylation as well as AMSH-mediated deubiquitination is significantly reduced under these conditions. Using various EGFR-ErbB2 chimeras, we demonstrate that enhanced recycling, decreased Hrs tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased AMSH mediated deubiquitination of EGFR-ErbB2 chimeras is primarily due to the presence of ErbB2 sequences or the absence of EGFR sequences C-terminal to the Cbl binding site. We conclude that endosomal recycling of the EGFR and ErbB2 receptors is associated with significantly impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of the ESCRT-0 subunit Hrs as well as decreased deubiquitination by AMSH, which is consistent with the finding that recycling receptors are not efficiently incorporated in the MVB pathway.",

However, a detailed understanding is required to target desensitized pathways and mechanisms for successful reactivation as part of a tailored therapy. To gain insight, which malfunctions contribute to chemoresistance, two mechanisms relevant for tissue homeostasis, the regulation of the cell cycle and of apoptosis, were investigated. Maternal MCF-7- and ErbB2-overexpressing MCF-7(erbB2) breast cancer cells were long term pretreated with 2'-deoxy-5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FdUrd) or 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) and the acquisition of drug-insensitivity was analyzed. A phosphate-conjugated heterodinucleoside consisting of one 5-FdUrd- and one AraC-moiety (5-fluoro-2'-desoxyuridylyl-(3'-->5')-Arabinocytidine) was utilized as a tool to assess the type of acquired resistances. ErbB2-overexpression disrupted proper cell cycle regulation and furthermore facilitated the development of an apoptosis-refractory phenotype upon exposure to 5-FdUrd. Experiments with dimer 5-FdUrd-araC in ErbB2-overexpressing MCF-7(erbB2) cells, and also with nucleoside 5-FdUrd in maternal MCF-7 cells, evidenced that the phenotypes of resistance to cell cycle inhibition and to apoptosis induction were differently affected. The expression profile of cyclin D1 (but not that of p53, p21, or p27) correlated with the proliferative phenotypes and nuclear accumulation of apoptosis inducing factor (but not activation of caspase 7) with apoptotic phenotypes. Dimer 5-FdUrd-araC overrode acquired chemoresistances, whereas combined application of 5-FdUrd and AraC exhibited significantly less activity. Dimer 5-FdUrd-araC remained active in MCF-7 clones most likely by circumventing the prerequisite of first-step phosphorylation. The acquisition of chemoresistance encompassed the affection of apoptosis- and cell-cycle regulation to, respectively, different extents. Thus, drug-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are independent of each other.",

By use of monoclonal antibody CK2 to the epithelial cytokeratin component number 18 (CK18), individual disseminated carcinoma cells present in bone marrow of cancer patients can now be identified (G. Schlimok, I. Funke, B. Holzmann, G. Göttlinger, G. Schmidt, H. Häuser, S. Swierkot, H. H. Warnecke, B. Schneider, H. Koprowski, and G. Riethmüller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84: 8672-8676, 1987; F. Lindemann, G. Schlimok, P. Dirschedl, J. Witte, and G. Riethmüller, Lancet, 340: 685-689, 1992). In the present study, we applied this approach to patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer. CK18 was expressed on 84 of 88 (95.5%) primary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Irrespective of primary tumor histology, single aspirates of iliac bone marrow from 18 of 82 (21.9%) lung cancer patients exhibited between 1 and 531 CK18+ cells/4 x 10(5) nucleated marrow cells. The specificity of our assay is underlined by the small rate of \"false-positive\" cells being observed in only 2 of 117 (1.7%) marrow samples from control patients with no evidence for an epithelial malignancy at the time of aspiration. Comparison with established risk factors demonstrated positive correlations (P < 0.05) between the size and histological grade of the primary carcinoma and cytokeratin positivity in iliac bone marrow. In contrast, the association with the metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes was only weak (P = 0.09). Following a median observation period of 13 months, patients who displayed cytokeratin-positive cells in iliac bone marrow at the time of primary surgery relapsed more frequently as compared to patients with a negative marrow finding (66.7 versus 36.6%; P < 0.05). This difference was even more pronounced by comparing the rates of manifest skeleton metastasis observed in both groups (26.7 versus 2.4%; P < 0.005). Finally, colabeling of CK18+ cells in marrow with monoclonal antibodies to proliferation-associated markers, such as the nucleolar antigen p120 or the tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2, exemplified the oncogenic capacity of CK18+ micrometastatic cells. In conclusion, CK18+ cells present in the bone marrow of patients with apparently operable non-small cell lung cancer exhibit the potential to form solid metastases. Therefore, the approach presented here may be used to determine the risk of early relapse in operable non-small cell lung cancer with potential consequences for adjuvant therapy.",

In gefitinib-treated patients, the presence of EGFR mutation was associated with a higher response rate to gefitinib and a longer overall survival, but the increased EGFR gene copy number was not. In gefitinib-naïve cases, EGFR mutation but not EGFR gene copy number was significantly correlated with gender, pathological subtypes, and smoking status. The erbB2 copy number was not significantly correlated with the EGFR mutation or EGFR copy number in 59 cases. In conclusion, EGFR mutation was a better predictor of clinical outcome in gefitinib-treated patients than the EGFR gene copy number.",

Treatment of human cancer cells with JNJ-28871063 inhibited phosphorylation of functionally important tyrosine residues in both EGFR and ErbB2 and blocked downstream signal transduction pathways responsible for proliferation and survival.

To this end, we use time-lapsed confocal microscopy to investigate the interplay among cell motility, three-dimensional (3D) matrix stiffness, matrix architecture, and transforming potential in a mammary epithelial cell (MEC) cancer progression series. We use a well characterized breast cancer progression model where human-derived MCF10A MECs overexpress either ErbB2, 14-3-3ζ, or both ErbB2 and 14-3-3ζ, with empty vector as a control. Cell motility assays showed that MECs overexpressing ErbB2 alone exhibited notably high migration speeds when cultured atop two-dimensional (2D) matrices, while overexpression of 14-3-3ζ alone most suppressed migration atop 2D matrices (as compared to non-transformed MECs). Our results also suggest that co-overexpression of the 14-3-3ζ and ErbB2 proteins facilitates cell migratory capacity in 3D matrices, as reflected in cell migration speed. Additionally, 3D matrices of sufficient stiffness can significantly hinder the migratory ability of partially transformed cells, but increased 3D matrix stiffness has a lesser effect on the aggressive migratory behavior exhibited by fully transformed cells that co-overexpress both ErbB2 and 14-3-3ζ. Finally, this study shows that for MECs possessing partial or full transforming potential, those overexpressing ErbB2 alone show the greatest sensitivity of cell migration speed to matrix architecture, while those overexpressing 14-3-3ζ alone exhibit the least sensitivity to matrix architecture. Given the current knowledge of breast cancer mechanobiology, these findings overall suggest that cell motility is governed by a complex interplay between matrix mechanics and transforming potential.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood and there is no reported evidence that directly links glycolysis to breast cancer cell migration. In this study, we investigated the role of FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis in breast cancer cell migration. First, we compared lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) protein levels, glycolysis and cell migration between FASN, ErbB2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells and FASN, ErbB2-low-expressing MCF7 cells. Then, SK-BR-3 cells were treated with cerulenin (Cer), an inhibitor of FASN, and ErbB2, LDHA protein levels, glycolysis, and cell migration were detected. Next, we transiently transfected ErbB2 plasmid into MCF7 cells and detected FASN, LDHA protein levels, glycolysis and cell migration. Heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1) is an activator of ErbB2 and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and oxamate (OX) are inhibitors of glycolysis. MCF7 cells were treated with HRG-β1 alone, HRG-β1 plus 2-DG, OX or cerulenin and glycolysis, and cell migration were measured. We found that FASN, ErbB2-high-expressing SK-BR-3 cells displayed higher levels of glycolysis and migration than FASN, ErbB2-low-expressing MCF7 cells. Inhibition of FASN by cerulenin impaired glycolysis and migration in SK-BR-3 cells. Transient overexpression of ErbB2 in MCF7 cells promotes glycolysis and migration. Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), oxamate (OX), or cerulenin partially reverses heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1)-induced glycolysis and migration in MCF7 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis is required for breast cancer cell migration. These novel findings indicate that targeting FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis may be a new approach to reverse breast cancer cell migration.",

Transgenic mice expressing erbB2 develop ER-negative mammary tumors, mimicking human breast carcinogenesis. Previously, we have shown that activator protein 1 (AP-1) regulates proliferation of ER-negative breast cancer cells. We hypothesized that blockade of AP-1 in mouse mammary epithelial cells will suppress ER-negative tumorigenesis induced by erbB2. Trigenic erbB2 mice were generated by crossing a bigenic pUHD-Tam67/MMTV-rtTA mouse to a MMTV-erbB2 mouse. The resulting trigenic mice develop tumors and express a doxycycline-inducible c-Jun dominant negative mutant (Tam67) in the mammary glands. In vivo AP-1 blockade by Tam67 expression started delayed mammary tumor formation in MMTV-erbB2 mice by more than 11 weeks. By 52 weeks of age, 100% (18 of 18) of the untreated animals had developed mammary tumors, whereas 56% (9 of 16) of the doxycycline-treated trigenic mice developed tumors. In addition, the tumors that arose in the AP-1-blocked erbB2 mice failed to express Tam67. Twenty-five percent of the doxycycline-treated MMTV-erbB2 mice survived more than 72 weeks of age without developing mammary tumors. Examination of normal-appearing mammary glands from these mice showed that AP-1 blockade by Tam67 also significantly prevents the development of premalignant lesions in these glands. The expression of erbB2 either in normal mammary tissue or in mammary tumors was not altered. Our results show that blocking the AP-1 signaling in mammary cells suppresses erbB2-induced transformation, and show that the AP-1 transcription factor is a critical transducer of erbB2. These results provide a scientific rationale to develop targeted drugs that inhibit AP-1 to prevent the development of ER-negative breast cancer.",

One of the most promising of the selective genetic strategies against cancer is VDEPT (virally directed enzyme prodrug therapy). This uses a viral vector to carry a prodrug-activating enzyme gene into both tumour and normal cells. By linking the foreign gene downstream of tumour-specific transcription units, tumour-specific expression of the foreign enzyme gene can be achieved. We have developed a genetic therapy strategy using VDEPT against cancers that overexpress the oncogene ERBB2. This occurs in approximately one-third of breast and pancreatic tumours (and in a smaller proportion of other tumours) and involves transcriptional up-regulation of the ERBB2 gene with or without gene amplification. We have constructed a chimeric minigene consisting of the proximal ERBB2 promoter linked to the gene encoding cytosine deaminase, an enzyme that can deaminate the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to form cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We have constructed a double-copy recombinant retrovirus to deliver the enzyme gene under the control of the ERBB2 promoter into a panel of ERBB2 expression-positive (ERBB2+) and -negative (ERBB2-) pancreatic and breast cell lines. Cytosine deaminase activity was high in ERBB2+ transduced cells but was not detected in ERBB2- transduced cells. Significant cell death was observed in ERBB2+ transduced cells treated with 5-FC whereas ERBB2- cells were not affected. Hence we present a novel gene therapy strategy that is potentially tumour-specific and could be used against a range of tumour types that overexpress the ERBB2 oncogene.",

In biologically relevant systems, interaction of HRG with ErbB3 or ErbB4 results in the transactivation of ErbB2. In this report, we show that ErbB2 is a critical component in mediating HRG responsiveness in a panel of human breast and ovarian tumor cell lines. Because HRGs have been reported to elicit diverse biological effects on cultured cells, including growth stimulation, growth inhibition, and induction of differentiation, we systematically examined the effect of rHRG beta 1 on tumor cell proliferation. HRG binding studies were performed with a panel of breast and ovarian tumor cell lines expressing a range of levels of ErbB2. The biological responses to HRG were also compared to EGF and to the growth-inhibitory anti-ErbB2 antibody, 4D5. In most cases, HRG stimulation of DNA synthesis correlated with positive effects on cell cycle progression and cell number and with enhancement of colony formation in soft agar. On each cell line tested, the HRG effects were distinguishable from EGF and 4D5. Our findings indicate that HRG induces cell proliferation in a number of tumor cell lines. In addition, we show that methods for measuring cell proliferation, as well as experimental conditions, are critical for determining HRGs effect on tumor cell growth in vitro.",

We employed an activated ErbB2 mouse model of breast cancer to investigate the in vivo role of Stat3 in mammary tumor progression and found that Stat3 does not alter mammary tumor initiation but dramatically affects metastatic progression. Four-fold fewer animals exhibited lung metastases in the absence of Stat3 and a 12-fold reduction in the number of lung lesions was observed in animals bearing Stat3-null tumors when compared with the wild-type cohort. The decreased malignancy in Stat3-deficient tumors is attributed to a reduction in both angiogenic and inflammatory responses associated with a Stat3-dependent transcriptional cascade involving CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta.",

The erbB2 proto-oncogene is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancers and is a major prognostic parameter when present in invasive disease. A ligand for the erbB2 receptor has not yet been identified but it can be activated by heterodimerization with heregulin (HRG)-stimulated erbB3 and erbB4 receptors. The HRGs are a family of polypeptide growth factors that have been shown to play a role in embryogenesis, tumor formation, growth and differentiation of breast cancer cells. The erbB3 and erbB4 receptors are involved in transregulation of erbB2 signaling. The work presented here suggests biological roles for HRG including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and induction of motility and invasion in breast cancer cells. HRG-expressing breast cancer cell lines are characterized by low erbB receptor levels and a high invasive and metastatic index, while those which overexpress erbB2 demonstrate minimal invasive potential in vitro and are non-tumorigenic in vivo. Treatment of the highly tumorigenic and metastatic HRG-expressing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with an HRG-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited proliferation in culture and motility in the Boyden chamber assay. Addition of exogenous HRG to non-invasive erbB2 overexpressing cells (SKBr-3) at low concentrations induced formation of pseudopodia, enhanced phagocytic activity and increased chemomigration and invasion in the Boyden chamber assay. The specificity of the chemomigration response to HRG is demonstrated by inhibition with the anti-HRG neutralizing antibody. These results suggest that either HRG can act as an autocrine or paracrine ligand to promote the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells in vitro or thus may enhance the metastatic process in vivo.",

Notch and ErbB1/2 receptor signalling cross talk has been demonstrated in invasive breast cancer, but their role in DCIS stem and progenitor cells has not been investigated. We have utilised 2 DCIS cell lines, MCF10DCIS.com (ErbB2-normal) and SUM225 (ErbB2-overexpressing) and 7 human primary DCIS samples were cultured in 3D matrigel and as mammospheres in the presence, absence or combination of the Notch inhibitor, DAPT, and ErbB1/2 inhibitors, lapatinib or gefitinib. Western blotting was applied to assess downstream signalling. In this study we demonstrate that DAPT reduced acini size and mammosphere formation in MCF10DCIS.com whereas there was no effect in SUM225. Lapatinb reduced acini size and mammosphere formation in SUM225, whereas mammosphere formation and Notch1 activity were increased in MCF10DCIS.com. Combined DAPT/lapatinib treatment was more effective at reducing acini size in both DCIS cell lines. Mammosphere formation in cell lines and human primary DCIS was reduced further by DAPT/lapatinib or DAPT/gefitinib regardless of ErbB2 receptor status. Our pre-clinical human models of DCIS demonstrate that Notch and ErbB1/2 both play a role in DCIS acini growth and stem cell activity. We report for the first time that cross talk between the two pathways in DCIS occurs regardless of ErbB2 receptor status and inhibition of Notch and ErbB1/2 was more efficacious than either alone. These data provide further understanding of DCIS biology and suggest treatment strategies combining Notch and ErbB1/2 inhibitors should be investigated regardless of ErbB2 receptor status.",

The implications of cross-talk among ErbB family receptors in human cancer, however, remain to be clarified. This cohort study was performed to examine the expression patterns of ErbB receptors by immunohistochemistry in primary human bladder cancer (n = 245) and compared with conventional biological indicators for their prognostic significance. Expression of individual EGF receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 receptors was detected in 72.2, 44.5, 56.3, and 29.8% of bladder cancer cases, respectively. Expression of two of the receptors varied from 14.7 to 42.4%, of three of the receptors between 11.0 and 22.0%, and of all four of the ErbB receptors by 8.6%. Important indicators in association with patient survival were tumor staging (P = 0.017), ErbB2 (P = 0.018), EGFR-ErbB2 (P = 0.023), and ErbB2-ErbB3 (P = 0.042). In the subset of grade-2 tumors, EGFR-ErbB2-ErbB3 and EGFR-ErbB2 predicted the development of second recurrence (P = 0.026 and 0.039, respectively), and ErbB2-ErbB3 tended to correlate with patient survival (P = 0.09). The results indicate that a combination of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 expression profile may be a better prognostic indicator than any family member alone. Given that ErbB2 is the preferred coexpression partner of ErbB family members, expression of other ErbB receptors may significantly affect the prognostic implication of ErbB2 for bladder cancer patients.",

Since ERBB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, signal transduction occurs through formation of heterodimers with EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4. ERBB3 is a signaling specialist since it has six binding sites for the p85 SH2 adapter subunit of phosphoinositide 3' kinases. These lipid kinases coordinate regulation of metabolism, cell size, proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Not surprisingly, ERBB3 signaling has been linked to cancer etiology and progression. In breast cancer, the partnership of ERBB2 and ERBB3 may be crucial for the aggressive properties of cancers with ERBB2 amplification, and may contribute to pre-existing and acquired resistance to therapy. This partnership creates opportunities for improving efficacy of ERBB-targeted pharmaceuticals, by interfering with coupling of ERBB2 to ERBB3 through dimerization inhibitors, and by use of therapeutic compounds that target AKT-dependent pathways activated through ERBB3. Additional therapeutic opportunities may be identified through better understanding of how ERBBs are regulated and deployed in normal mammary gland processes. Work using mouse models has identified the main processes regulated by each of the four ERBBs, which has practical implications in understanding breast cancer etiology, and eventual development of better prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic tools.",

Enhanced metastatic ability due to increased expression of ErbB2 or ErbB3 correlated with stronger chemotaxis and invasion responses to heregulin beta1. Suppression of ErbB3 expression reduced both intravasation and metastasis. A human breast cancer tumor tissue microarray showed a significant association between ErbB3 and ErbB2 expression and metastasis independent of tumor size.

The triple negative is a particular type of breast cancer defined by absence of oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression as well as absence of ERBB2 amplification. It is characterized by its biological aggressiveness, worse prognosis and lack of a therapeutic target in contrast with hormonal receptor positive and ERBB2+ breast cancers. Given these characteristics, triple-negative breast cancer is a challenge in today's clinical practice. A new breast cancer classification emerged recently in the scientific scene based in gene expression profiles. The new subgroups (luminal, ERBB2, normal breast and basal-like) have distinct gene expression patterns and phenotypical characteristics. Triple-negative breast cancer shares phenotypical features with basal-like breast cancer, which is in turn the most aggressive and with worse outcome. Since microarray gene-expression assays are only used in the research setting, clinicians use the triple-negative definition as a surrogate of basal-like breast cancer. The aim of this review, that focuses on triple-negative breast cancer, is to summarize the most relevant knowledge on this particular type of cancer in terms of molecular features, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, current treatments and the new therapeutic options that include the use of platinum compounds, EGFR antagonists, antiangiogenics and PARP inhibitors. Advances in research are promising and new types of active drugs will become a reality in the near future, making possible a better outcome for this subgroup of breast cancer patients.",

The objective of this review was to summarize the reported prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors from a large sample of Asian patients and to examine ErbB2 assessment methods in Asia. From searches of MEDLINE, local language journals, and local and international conference proceedings as well as locoregional breast cancer experts' recommendations, the authors selected up to 5 studies each from India, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand that reported ErbB2 results based on assessment with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The reported prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors in 22 studies on 24,671 patients, of whom 14,398 patients were assessed for ErbB2 status, varied widely (range, 6%-65%) as did the assessment methods used. Most studies (n=21) used IHC to assess ErbB2 status, but definitions for positivity varied. When robust assessment methods were used, the median prevalence was 19% based on strong IHC staining (IHC3+; n=9812 patients) and 25% based on FISH (n=681 patients). Data on the prevalence of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in Asia are limited. The current survey indicated that the prevalence in Asia may be similar to that in Western countries; thus, up to 1 in 4 Asian patients with breast cancer potentially could benefit from ErbB2-targeted treatment.

We have previously reported that the growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) is required for the proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We investigated here whether Grb2 protein plays a role in heregulin-stimulated proliferation. Grb2 protein inhibition led to growth inhibition of heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells, but not Erk1,2 inactivation. These findings are similar to our earlier observations in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Since Akt can also be activated by heregulin, the effects of Grb2 inhibition on Akt were examined. Akt was inactivated following Grb2 downregulation in heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells. We then examined the effects of Grb2 downregulation on Akt in ErbB2-overexpressing cells in the absence of heregulin. Similar to heregulin-stimulated cells, Grb2 inhibition also led to Akt inactivation in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.

The oncogene MET is associated with decreased survival in breast cancer, yet the role that MET plays in the various breast cancer subtypes is unclear. We describe a knockin mouse with mutationally activated Met (Met(mut)) that develops a high incidence of diverse mammary tumors with basal characteristics, including metaplasia, absence of progesterone receptor and ERBB2 expression, and expression of cytokeratin 5. With gene expression and tissue microarray analysis, we show that high MET expression in human breast cancers significantly correlated with estrogen receptor negative/ERBB2 negative tumors and with basal breast cancers. Few treatment options exist for breast cancers of the basal or trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2 subtypes. We conclude from these studies that MET may play a critical role in the development of the most aggressive breast cancers and may be a rational therapeutic target.",

Given previous findings that ADA3 is a critical component of HAT complexes that regulate ER function and evidence that overexpression of other ER coactivators such as SRC-3 is associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer, the current study was designed to assess the potential significance of ADA3 expression/localization in human breast cancer patients. In this study, we analyzed ADA3 expression in breast cancer tissue specimens and assessed the correlation of ADA3 staining with cancer progression and patient outcome. Tissue microarrays prepared from large series of breast cancer patients with long-term follow-ups were stained with anti-ADA3 monoclonal antibody using immunohistochemistry. Samples were analyzed for ADA3 expression followed by correlation with various clinicopathological parameters and patients' outcomes. We report that breast cancer specimens show predominant nuclear, cytoplasmic, or mixed nuclear + cytoplasmic ADA3 staining patterns. Predominant nuclear ADA3 staining correlated with ER+ status. While predominant cytoplasmic ADA3 staining negatively correlated with ER+ status, but positively correlated with ErbB2, EGFR, and Ki67. Furthermore, a positive correlation of cytoplasmic ADA3 was observed with higher histological grade, mitotic counts, Nottingham Prognostic Index, and positive vascular invasion. Patients with nuclear ADA3 and ER positivity have better breast cancer specific survival and distant metastasis free survival. Significantly, cytoplasmic expression of ADA3 showed a strong positive association with reduced BCSS and DMFS in ErbB2+/EGFR+ patients. Although in multivariate analyses ADA3 expression was not an independent marker of survival, predominant nuclear ADA3 staining in breast cancer tissues correlates with ER+ expression and together serves as a marker of good prognosis, whereas predominant cytoplasmic ADA3 expression correlates with ErbB2+/EGFR+ expression and together is a marker of poor prognosis. Thus, ADA3 cytoplasmic localization together with ErbB2+/EGFR+ status may serve as better prognostic marker than individual proteins to predict survival of patients.",

We have conducted a comparative analysis of functional footprints (that is, effect on signaling and transcriptional landscapes in cells) associated with oncogenic and tumor suppressor mutations in EGFR pathway genes in human cancers. We have found that mutations in the EGFR pathway differentially have an impact on signaling and metabolic pathways in cancer cells in a mutation- and tissue-selective manner. For example, although signaling and metabolic profiles of breast tumors with PIK3CA or AKT1 mutations are, as expected, highly similar, they display markedly different, sometimes even opposite, profiles to those with ERBB2 or EGFR amplifications. On the other hand, although low-grade gliomas and glioblastomas, both brain cancers, driven by EGFR amplifications are highly functionally similar, their functional footprints are significantly different from lung and breast tumors driven by EGFR or ERBB2. Overall, these observations argue that, contrary to expectations, the mechanisms of tumorigenicity associated with mutations in different genes along the same pathway, or in the same gene across different tissues, may be highly different. We present evidence that oncogenic functional footprints in cancer cell lines have significantly diverged from those in tumor tissues, which potentially explains the discrepancy of our findings with the current knowledge. Nevertheless, our analyses reveal a common inflammatory response signature in EGFR-driven human cancers of different tissue origins. Our results may have implications in the design of therapeutic strategies in cancers driven by these oncogenes. ",

However, there is little information available as to the function and signaling of RTKs in colon cancers. In the present study, we performed protein array technology to determine the expression status of various RTKs that are activated in colon cancer compared to normal colonic cells and tissues. Of the 42 different phospho-RTKs, 5 (ErbB2, FGFR1, FGFR2a, FGFR3 and MSPR) were activated in Caco-2, SW480, WiDr, Lovo colon cancer cell lines and cancerous tissues. In order to determine the effect of inhibition of RTKs, especially ErbB2, athymic nude mice bearing xenograft tumors were treated with the ErbB2-targeting drug trastuzumab alone, or in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Similar to the treatment of 5-FU alone, trastuzumab suppressed the growth of colon cancer. Combination therapy of trastuzumab and 5-FU inhibited tumor growth significantly compared to the treatment of 5-FU alone or trastuzumab alone. In addition, xenograft tumors were also analyzed by phospho-MAPK protein array. The activity of Akt3/PKBgamma was inhibited with 5-FU alone and trastuzumab, indicating that trastuzumab may inhibit colon cancer growth through ErbB2-Akt3/PKBgamma signaling. These data demonstrate that ErbB2 could be an important candidate for colon cancer therapy and the addition of trastuzumab to 5-FU therapy might augment the clinical response in colon cancer patients. Therefore, the analysis of phospho-RTK expression by protein array as a useful tool might identify novel therapies for individual patients with colon cancer.",

Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including AXL, are involved in the progression of NSCLC. The AXL/MER/SKY subfamily is involved in cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis, and signal transduction and may play a significant role in the invasiveness of cancer cells. Notably, no specific inhibitors of AXL have been described. A series of CL1 sublines with progressive invasiveness established from a patient with NSCLC has been identified that positively correlates with AXL expression and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The ectopic overexpression of AXL results in elevated cell invasiveness and drug resistance. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling activity is associated with AXL expression and may play an important role in the enhancement of invasiveness and doxorubicin resistance, as shown by using the NF-kappaB inhibitor, sulfasalazine, and IkappaB dominant-negative transfectants. In the current study, sulfasalazine exerted a synergistic anticancer effect with doxorubicin and suppressed cancer cell invasiveness in parallel in CL1 sublines and various AXL-expressing cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation of AXL and other RTKs (ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor receptor) was abolished by sulfasalazine within 15 min, suggesting that the inhibition of NF-kappaB and the kinase activity of RTKs are involved in the pharmacologic effects of sulfasalazine. Our study suggests that AXL is involved in NSCLC metastasis and drug resistance and may therefore provide a molecular basis for RTK-targeted therapy using sulfasalazine to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in NSCLC.",

This has been attributed to the disruption of ERBB3/ERBB2 heterodimers that maintain a crucial cell survival signal via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT. ERBB2 confers a poor clinical outcome in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Here, we show that medulloblastoma cell sensitivity to 17-AAG is directly related to ERBB2 expression level. Furthermore, overexpression of exogenous ERBB2 in these cells induces spontaneous homodimerization, further enhancing cell sensitivity to 17-AAG. In contrast to breast cancer cells, this increased sensitivity to 17-AAG does not result from cell dependence on AKT1 activity. Rather, we show that 17-AAG generates a dose- and time-dependent increase in MEK/ERK signaling that is required for the drug to inhibit the proliferation of medulloblastoma cells and that ERBB2 sensitizes medulloblastoma cells to 17-AAG by up-regulating basal MEK/ERK signaling. We further show that down-regulation of MEK1 activity markedly reduces the sensitivity of medulloblastoma, breast, and ovarian cancer cells to 17-AAG, whereas expression of a constitutively active MEK1 potentiates the activity of 17-AAG against these cells. Therefore, intact MEK/ERK signaling may be required for optimal 17AAG activity against a variety of tumor cell types. These data identify a new mechanism by which 17-AAG inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. Defining the precise mode of action of these agents within specific tumor cell types will be crucial if this class of drugs is to be efficiently developed in the clinic.",

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is often activated in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, is known to regulate cell proliferation and cell survival. Selective inhibitors of the PI3K pathway were used to assess the relevance of PI3K signaling in the anchorage-independent growth of a series of human mammary carcinoma cell lines. Wortmannin, LY294002, and rapamycin at concentrations that did not affect MAPK phosphorylation but substantially inhibited PI3K, Akt, and p70(S6K) significantly suppressed the soft agar growth of tumor cell lines that overexpress ErbB2 but not the growth of tumor lines with low ErbB2 expression. A similar growth inhibition of ErbB2-overexpressing carcinoma lines was observed when a dominant negative p85(PI3K) mutant was introduced into these cells. Forced expression of ErbB2 in breast cancer lines originally expressing low ErbB2 levels augmented receptor expression and sensitized those lines to LY294002- and rapamycin-mediated inhibition of colony formation. Furthermore, treatment with LY294002 resulted in the selective increase of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Cip1) or p27(Kip1) and suppression of cyclin E-associated Cdk2 kinase activity in ErbB2-overexpressing lines, which may account for their hypersensitivity toward inhibitors of the PI3K pathway in anchorage-independent growth. Our results indicate that the PI3K/Akt/p70(S6K) pathway plays an enhanced role in the anchorage-independent growth of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, therefore providing a molecular basis for the selective targeting of this signaling pathway in the treatment of ErbB2-related human breast malignancies.",

Whereas expression of Ki-67 or p120 on micrometastatic cells was observed only in 11 (15.9%) of 69 cancer patients analyzed, ErbB2+/CK18+ cells were found in 48 (67.6%) of 71 breast cancer patients and 14 (28.0%) of 50 patients with gastrointestinal cancer (P = .0001). The incidence of ErbB2+/CK18+ cells was positively correlated with the clinical stage of tumor progression.;The high incidence of ErbB2 expression on micrometastatic breast cancer cells in the bone marrow suggests that these cells might have been positively selected during early stages of metastasis. The majority of these cells appear to be in a dormant state of cell growth.;Although support from clinical follow-up is still needed, this study demonstrates that, beyond the mere presence of micrometastatic cells in bone marrow, useful prognostic information can be obtained by analysis of additional cell growth markers.",

Likewise, overexpression of heregulin (HRG/NRG1), a growth factor responsible for ErbB2 activation, has also been shown to be a driver of breast cancer progression. Although ErbB2 inhibitors offer a major advancement in the treatment of ErbB2-dependent breast cancers, patients are highly susceptible to developing clinical resistance to these drugs. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism that underlies HRG/ErbB2-induced tumorigenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for this subset of patients with breast cancer. Here, it was demonstrated that HRG promoted anchorage-independent breast cancer cell growth more potently than EGF, and that the HRG-dependent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mTORC1 are necessary events for cell transformation. Functional evaluation of two distinct mTOR (MTOR) inhibitors, rapamycin and INK-128, on HRG-dependent signaling activities, uncovered a necessary role for mTORC2 in the regulation of the AKT/TSC2/mTORC1 axis by affecting the phosphorylation of AKT at the PDK1(PDPK1)-dependent site (T308) as well as at the mTORC2-dependent site (S473). The elimination of Rictor (RICTOR), a critical component of mTORC2, is detrimental to both the activation of mTORC1 and HRG-mediated cellular transformation. Similar results were obtained in multiple breast cancer model systems, highlighting an important role for mTORC2 in HRG/ErbB2-dependent breast cancer.;These findings suggest the potential benefits of targeting mTORC2 in HRG/ErbB2-induced breast cancer.",

It is produced by multiple epithelia in both membrane and soluble forms and serves as a protective agent for the epithelia. The membrane form of Muc4 acts as a steric barrier to the apical cell surface of epithelial or tumor cells. An important example is the uterus of the rat, in which Muc4 expression is downregulated for blastocyst implantation. The soluble form facilitates the protection and lubrication of epithelia by mucous gels composed of gel-forming mucins, as in the airway, where Muc4 is proposed to participate in mucociliary transport as a constituent of the periciliary fluid. The soluble form is also found in body fluids, such as milk, tears, and saliva. The transmembrane subunit ASGP-2 acts as an intramembrane ligand and activator for the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2. Formation of this ligand-receptor complex is proposed to repress apopotosis in epithelial and cancer cells in which the ligand-receptor complex is formed, providing a second type of cell protective mechanism. Muc4 expression is regulated in epithelial tissues in a cell- and tissue-specific manner during epithelial differentiation. In stratified epithelia, it is predominantly in the most superficial, differentiated layers, often coincident with ErbB2. Dysregulation of Muc4 expression may contribute to cell and tissue dysfunction, such as the proposed contribution of Muc4 to mammary tumor progression. These observations clearly show that Muc4 has multiple roles in epithelia, which may provide insights into aberrant behaviors of these tissues and their derivative carcinomas.",

Because of its resistance to degradation, ErbB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for other members of the ErbB family, and its overexpression in vivo is associated with poor prognosis. We now show that the chaperone-binding ubiquitin ligase CHIP efficiently ubiquitinates and down-regulates ErbB2. CHIP expression shortens the half-life of both nascent and mature ErbB2 protein.

Furthermore, CHIP association with ErbB2 requires a chaperone intermediate and is increased by the chaperone-binding drug geldanamycin, a potent stimulator of ErbB2 ubiquitination and degradation.

At last, specific PI3K/Akt and Src inhibitors were used to investigate the involvement of these two pathways in ErbB2-mediated survivin up-regulation and Taxol resistance.;We found that ErbB2-overexpressing cells expressed higher levels of survivin in multiple breast cancer cell lines and patient samples. ErbB2-overexpressing cells exited M phase faster than ErbB2-low-expressing cells, which correlated with the increased resistance to Taxol-induced apoptosis. Down-regulation of survivin by antisense oligonucleotide delayed mitotic exit of ErbB2-overexpressing cells and also sensitized ErbB2-overexpressing cells to Taxol-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ErbB2 up-regulated survivin at translational level and PI3K/Akt and Src activation are involved.

Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that irreversible ErbB inhibitors have the potential to override this resistance. Here, we found that AST1306, a novel anilino-quinazoline compound, inhibited the enzymatic activities of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 as well as EGFR resistant mutant in both cell-free and cell-based systems. Importantly, AST1306 functions as an irreversible inhibitor, most likely through covalent interaction with Cys797 and Cys805 in the catalytic domains of EGFR and ErbB2, respectively. Further studies showed that AST1306 inactivated pathways downstream of these receptors and thereby inhibited the proliferation of a panel of cancer cell lines. Although the activities of EGFR and ErbB2 were similarly sensitive to AST1306, ErbB2-overexpressing cell lines consistently exhibited more sensitivity to AST1306 antiproliferative effects. Consistent with this, knockdown of ErbB2, but not EGFR, decreased the sensitivity of SK-OV-3 cells to AST1306. In vivo, AST1306 potently suppressed tumor growth in ErbB2-overexpressing adenocarcinoma xenograft and FVB-2/N(neu) transgenic breast cancer mouse models, but weakly inhibited the growth of EGFR-overexpressing tumor xenografts. Tumor growth inhibition induced by a single dose of AST1306 in the SK-OV-3 xenograft model was accompanied by a rapid (within 2 h) and sustained (≥24 h) inhibition of both EGFR and ErbB2, consistent with an irreversible inhibition mechanism. Taken together, these results establish AST1306 as a selective, irreversible ErbB2 and EGFR inhibitor whose growth-inhibitory effects are more potent in ErbB2-overexpressing cells.",

In these tumors, high levels of ERBB2 are strongly associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis. Paradoxically, an inherent cellular response to hypermitogenic signaling by ERBB2 and other oncogenes seems to be growth arrest, rather than proliferation. Molecular characterization of this yet undefined antiproliferative state in independent cell lines overexpressing either wild-type ERBB2 or the mutationally activated receptor unveiled a dramatic induction of the alpha5beta1 integrin fibronectin receptor. alpha5 Integrin up-regulation is mainly a transcriptional response mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF), leading to a massive increase in membrane-resident receptor molecules and enhanced fibronectin adhesiveness of the respective cells. Functionally, ERBB2-dependent ligation of fibronectin results in improved survival of mammary adenocarcinoma cells under adverse conditions, like serum withdrawal, hypoxia, and chemotherapy. HIF-1alpha is an independent predictor of poor overall survival in patients with breast cancer. In particular, HIF-1alpha overexpression correlates significantly with early local relapse and distant metastasis, a phenotype also highly characteristic of ERBB2-positive tumors. As HIF-1alpha is known to be stabilized by ERBB2 signaling under normoxic conditions, we propose that alpha5 integrin is a major effector in this regulatory circuit and may represent the molecular basis for the HIF-1alpha-dependent aggressiveness observed in ERBB2-overexpressing breast carcinomas. Hypermitogenic ERBB2 signaling and tumor hypoxia may act synergistically to favor the establishment of chemoresistant dormant micrometastatic cells frequently observed in patients with breast cancer. This new insight could be the basis for additional approaches complementing current cancer therapy.",

Additional information on NSCLC cell lines such as that of transcriptomic data, genomic aberrations, and drug sensitivity was analyzed in the context of proteomic data using supervised and non-supervised approaches for data analysis. First, the unsupervised analysis of proteomic data indicated that proteins clustering closely together reflect well-known signaling modules, e.g. PI3K/AKT- and RAS/RAF/ERK-signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. However, mutations of EGFR, ERBB2, RAF, RAS, TP53, and PI3K were found dispersed across different signaling pathway clusters. Merely cell lines with an amplification of EGFR and/or ERBB2 clustered closely together on the proteomic, but not on the transcriptomic level. Secondly, supervised data analysis revealed that sensitivity towards anti-EGFR drugs generally correlated better with high level EGFR phosphorylation than with EGFR abundance itself. High level phosphorylation of RB and high abundance of AURKA were identified as candidates that can potentially predict sensitivity towards the aurora kinase inhibitor VX680. Examples shown demonstrate that the RPPA approach presents a useful platform for targeted proteomics with high potential for biomarker discovery.

Our purpose was to test ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) as a potential therapeutic target for gefitinib-resistant and -sensitive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;Testing the effect of knockdown of USP8 and use of a synthetic USP8 inhibitor to selectively kill gefitinib-resistant (or -sensitive) NSCLCs with little effect on normal cells in cell culture and a xenograft mouse model.;Knockdown of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) selectively kills gefitinib-resistant NSCLCs while having little toxicity toward normal cells. Genetic silencing of USP8 led to the downregulation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, and MET. We also determined that a synthetic USP8 inhibitor markedly decreased the viability of gefitinib-resistant and -sensitive NSCLC cells by decreasing RTK expression while having no effect on normal cells. Moreover, treatment with a USP8 inhibitor led to significant reductions in tumor size in a mouse xenograft model using gefitinib-resistant and -sensitive NSCLC cells.;Our results show for the first time that the inhibition of USP8 activity or reduction in USP8 expression can selectively kill NSCLC cells.

As demonstrated in the EGF30008 trial, a combined targeted strategy with letrozole and lapatinib significantly increased progression-free survival and clinical benefit rates in patients with metastatic breast cancer that co-expresses ER and ErbB2.

Rac1, a Ras-like small GTPase, has been implicated in the control of cell growth and morphology and is believed to be associated with breast cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we show that when parental SKBR3 cells become resistant to trastuzumab, Rac1 activity is increased, leading to altered cell morphology, which is accompanied by significant cytoskeleton disorganization. Furthermore, both trastuzumab-mediated down-regulation of ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor-induced down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor are impaired in the trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells, indicating that the endocytic down-regulation of ErbB receptors is compromised in the resistant cells. This results in an aberrant accumulation of ErbB2 on the cell surface and enhanced ErbB2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells. Additionally, overexpression of constitutively active Rac1G12V in parental SKBR3 cells reduces sensitivity to trastuzumab. After reduction of Rac1 activity by NSC23766, a specific Rac1 inhibitor, trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells display a cellular morphology similar to parental SKBR3 cells. Moreover, we show that NSC23766 restores trastuzumab-mediated endocytic down-regulation of ErbB2 and reduces extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in resistant SKBR3 cells. Our findings highlight an important role for Rac1 in trastuzumab resistance of human breast cancer cells and identify the impaired trastuzumab-mediated endocytic down-regulation of ErbB2 as a novel mechanism of trastuzumab resistance.

Efficacy and safety data of numerous trials led to the approval of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab as the first ErbB2-targeting therapy in ErbB2-positive breast cancer.

We review recent data focusing on how erbB2 monoclonal antibodies could exert a cardiotoxic effect through unique cardiomyocyte cell surface and intracellular structural features, and how an individual's cardiac susceptibility to erbB2 monoclonal antibodies may be dictated by the ability of erbB2 monoclonal antibodies to bind cardiomyocytes. In addition, we discuss ways that anthracyclines may also affect erbB2/erbB4/neuregulin receptor signaling, explaining the apparent synergistic effect. Further investigation of the role of normal and aberrant erbB2 signaling in the development of cardiac dysfunction could lead to an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction and may lead to novel therapies for the treatment of heart failure, regardless of etiology.

The NLS sequence KRRQQKIRKYTMRR (aa655-668) contains three clusters of basic amino acids and it is sufficient to target GFP into the nucleus. However, mutation in any basic amino acid cluster of this NLS sequence significantly affects its nuclear localization. Furthermore, it was found that this NLS is essential for the nuclear localization of ErbB2 since the intracellular domain of Erb2 lacking NLS completely abrogates its nuclear translocation.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential relevance of a series of genes known to be amplified in female breast cancer (FBC) in a the development and pathogenesis of MBC. To this end, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to the analysis of 128 breast tumors from males. Amplification of ERBB2, MYC, PPM1D and ZNF217 was detected rarely (1-2% of tumors) indicating a considerably lower amplification frequency than in FBC. CCND1 amplification was observed in 12% of cases, being in good concordance with findings from FBC. In addition, CCND1 overexpression was detected in 63% of tumors and was associated with ER positivity (p < 0.0001). Our results indicate distinct differences in the genetic basis of MBC and FBC and suggest that marked differences exist in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The lack of ERBB2 involvement was especially unexpected and implies that ERBB2-targeted therapies are unlikely to be beneficial in MBC.

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is known to stabilize mutant EGFR and ErbB2, but its role in cancers with wild-type (WT) WT-EGFR is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that fully mature, membrane-bound WT-EGFR interacts with HSP90 independent of ErbB2. Further, the HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin (GA) and AT13387 cause a decrease in WT-EGFR in cultured head and neck cancer cells. This decrease results from a significantly reduced half-life of WT-EGFR. WT-EGFR was also lost in head and neck xenograft specimens after treatment with AT13387 under conditions that inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice. Our findings demonstrate that WT-EGFR is a client protein of HSP90 and that their interaction is critical for maintaining both the stability of the receptor as well as the growth of EGFR-dependent cancers.

The relationship between C(t) and log starting concentration was linear (r(2) >/=0.99). The mean (SD) normalized expression of ERBB2 in healthy breast tissue was 0.95 (0.37). Overexpression (>5 SD above mean for healthy breast) of the ERBB2 gene was observed (at 3.2- to 135-fold) in 23 (17%) of 134 breast tumor RNA samples. As expected, ERBB2 overexpression was present in all tumors with ERBB2 gene amplification but was uncommon and at a low ratio (<5) in breast cancers without gene amplification.;This new simple, rapid, semi-automated assay is a major alternative to fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunochemistry for gene alteration analysis in human tumors and may be a powerful tool for large randomized, prospective cooperative group trials and to support future ERBB2-based biological and gene therapy approaches.",

Previously we have shown that the beta galactoside binding protein (betaGBP) cytokine, an antiproliferative molecule, induces functional inhibition of class 1A and class 1B PI3K. Here, we have investigated whether, by targeting PI3K, betaGBP has therapeutic efficacy in aggressive breast cancer cells where strong mitogenic input is fuelled by overexpression of the ErbB2 (also known as HER/neu, for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) oncoprotein receptor and have used immortalised ductal cells and non-aggressive mammary cancer cells, which express ErbB2 at low levels, as controls.;Aggressive BT474 and SKBR3 cancer cells where ErbB2 is overexpressed, MCF10A immortalised ductal cells and non-invasive MCF-7 cancer cells which express low levels of ErbB2, both in their naive state and when forced to mimic aggressive behaviour, were used. Class IA PI3K was immunoprecipitated and the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) assessed by ELISA. The consequences of PI3K inhibition by betaGBP were analysed at proliferation level, by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, by akt gene expression and by apoptosis. Apoptosis was documented by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, alteration of the plasma membrane, caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Phosphorylated and total ERK were measured by Western blot analysis and akt mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis. The results obtained with the BT474 and SKBR3 cells were validated in the MCF10A ductal cells and in non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells forced into mimicking the in vitro behaviour of the BT474 and SKBR3 cells.;In aggressive breast cancer cells, where mitogenic signalling is enforced by the ErbB2 oncoprotein receptor, functional inhibition of the catalytic activity of PI3K by the betaGBP cytokine and loss of akt mRNA results in apoptotic death. A functional correlation between ERK and the kt gene was also found. The relationship between ERK, akt mRNA, PI3K and cell vulnerability to betaGBP challenge was sustained both in mammary ductal cells forced to mimic an aggressive behaviour and in non-aggressive breast cancer cells undergoing an enforced shift into an aggressive phenotype.;betaGBP, a newly discovered physiological inhibitor of PI3K, is a selective and potent inducer of apoptosis in aggressive breast cancer cells. Due to its physiological nature, which carries no chemotherapeutic disadvantages, betaGBP has the potential to be safely tested in clinical trials.",

Our aim was also to identify molecular genetic alterations that are specific to particular clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer. Distinct molecular genetic profiles were identified for intestinal and diffuse gastric cancers and for tumors obtained from 2 different locations of the stomach. Interestingly, the ERBB2 amplification and gains at 20q13.12-q13.33 almost exclusively discriminated intestinal cancers from the diffuse type. In addition, the 17q12-q25 gain was characteristic to cancers located in corpus and the 20q13.12-q13.13 gain was more common in the antrum. Statistical analysis was performed using integrated copy number and expression data to identify genes showing differential expression associated with a copy number alteration. Genes with the highest statistical significance included ERBB2, MUC1, GRB7, PPP1R1B and PPARBP with concomitant changes in copy number and expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of ERBB2 and MUC1 on a tissue microarray containing 78 independent gastric tissues showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05 and <0.001) in immunopositivity in the intestinal (31 and 70%) and diffuse subtypes (14 and 41%), respectively. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that intestinal and diffuse type gastric cancers as well as cancers located in different sites of the stomach have distinct molecular profiles which may have clinical value.",

However, the role of endogenous c-Jun in mammary tumor progression is unknown. Herein, transgenic mice expressing the mammary gland-targeted ErbB2 oncogene were crossed with c-jun(f/f) transgenic mice to determine the role of endogenous c-Jun in mammary tumor invasion and stem cell function. The excision of c-jun by Cre recombinase reduced cellular migration, invasion, and mammosphere formation of ErbB2-induced mammary tumors. Proteomic analysis identified a subset of secreted proteins (stem cell factor (SCF) and CCL5) induced by ErbB2 expression that were dependent upon endogenous c-Jun expression. SCF and CCL5 were identified as transcriptionally induced by c-Jun. CCL5 rescued the c-Jun-deficient breast tumor cellular invasion phenotype. SCF rescued the c-Jun-deficient mammosphere production.

Defining the genes and pathways in the RTK signaling network that are important regulators of tumorigenesis in vivo will unveil potential candidates for targeted therapeutics. To this end, we used microarray comparative genomic hybridization to identify and compare copy number aberrations in five mouse models of breast cancer induced by wild-type and mutated forms of oncogenic ErbB2 or the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT). We observed distinct genomic alterations among the various models, including recurrent chromosome 11 amplifications and chromosome 4 deletions, syntenic with human 17q21-25 and 1p35-36, respectively. Expression of oncogenic Erbb2 (NeuNT) under control of the endogenous Erbb2 promoter results in frequent (85%) amplification at the Erbb2 locus with striking structural similarity to the human amplicon, resulting in overexpression of at least two of the genes, Erbb2 and Grb7. Chromosome 11 amplicons distal to Erbb2 arise in a model (DB) overexpressing a mutant variant of PyMT (Y315/322F) unable to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These amplicons are not observed in DB hyperplasias or in tumors overexpressing wild-type PyMT and result in overexpression of Grb2 and Itgb4. Distal chromosome 4 deletions occur in a significantly higher proportion of Erbb2 than PyMT tumors and encompass 14-3-3sigma (Stratifin), which is expressed at low or undetectable levels in the majority of NeuNT tumors.

The objective of the present study was to investigate a putative role for PAX2 in the control of luminal breast cancer cells invasion, and to begin to characterize its regulation.;PAX2 activity was higher in cell lines from luminal compared to non-luminal subtype, and activation of PAX2 by estradiol was selectively achieved in breast cancer cell lines of the luminal subtype. This process was blocked by ICI 182780 and could be antagonized by IGF-1. Knockdown of PAX2 in luminal MCF-7 cells completely abrogated estradiol-induced downregulation of ERBB2 and decrease of cell invasion, whereas overexpression of PAX2 in these cells enhanced estradiol effects on ERBB2 levels and cell invasion.;The study demonstrates that PAX2 activation by estradiol is selectively achieved in breast cancer cells of the luminal subtype, via ERα, and identifies IGF-1 as a negative regulator of PAX2 activity in these cells.

Phosphorylation levels of EGFR in all cell lines decreased during lapatinib treatment in anchorage‑dependent culture. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of ErbB2, ErbB3 and Akt and the protein levels of cyclin D1 were decreased by lapatinib treatment of HSC3, HSC4 and Ca9-22 cells. ErbB3 was not expressed and cyclin D1 protein levels were not altered by lapatinib treatment in KB, DU145 and SAS cells. The phosphorylation of ErbB2 and AKT was not affected by lapatinib in SAS cells and was not detected in KB and DU145 cells. Lapatinib-resistant cell lines exhibited sphere-forming ability, and SAS cells developed sensitivity to lapatinib during sphere formation. The phosphorylation levels of ErbB2 and AKT and protein levels of cyclin D2 increased during sphere formation of SAS cells and decreased with lapatinib treatment. In addition, sphere formation of SAS cells was inhibited by the AKT inhibitor MK2206. AKT phosphorylation and cyclin D2 levels in SAS spheres were decreased by MK2206 treatment. SAS cells expressed E-cadherin, but not vimentin and KB cells expressed vimentin, but not E-cadherin. DU145 cells expressed vimentin and E-cadherin. These results suggested that phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 by cell detachment from the substratum induces the AKT pathway/cyclin D2-dependent sphere growth in SAS epithelial cancer stem-like cells, thereby rendering SAS spheres sensitive to lapatinib treatment.",

Unlike typical dual specificity phosphatases, VHR lacks the MAPK-binding domain and shows poor activity against MAPKs. We found that EGF receptor (EGFR) was a direct substrate of VHR and that overexpression of VHR down-regulated EGFR phosphorylation, particularly at Tyr-992 residue. Expression of VHR inhibited the activation of phospholipase Cγ and protein kinase C, both downstream effectors of Tyr-992 phosphorylation of EGFR. Decreasing VHR expression by RNA interference caused higher EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-992. In addition to EGFR, VHR also directly dephosphorylated ErbB2. Consistent with these results, suppression of VHR augmented the foci formation ability of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, whereas overexpression of VHR suppressed cell growth in both two- and three-dimensional cultures. Expression of VHR also suppressed tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, VHR expression was significantly lower in NSCLC tissues in comparison to that in normal lung tissues. Collectively, this study shows that down-regulation of VHR expression enhances the signaling of ErbB receptors and may be involved in NSCLC pathogenesis.",

Immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLC biopsy samples using a Tyr416 phosphorylation-specific, pan-SFK antibody revealed staining in 123 (33%) of 370 tumors. Because c-Src is known to be both an upstream activator and downstream mediator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we next investigated SFK phosphorylation in a panel of NSCLC cell lines, including ones that depend on EGFR for survival. The EGFR-dependent NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and H3255 had increased phosphorylation of SFKs, and treatment of these cells with an SFK inhibitor (PP1 or SKI-606) induced apoptosis. PP1 decreased phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 and strikingly enhanced apoptosis by gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor. HCC827 cells transfected with c-Src short hairpin RNA exhibited diminished phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 and decreased sensitivity to apoptosis by PP1 or gefitinib.

Tumor genotype, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes were collected and studied at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between age and mutation status, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for survival analysis.;The frequency of targetable genomic alterations by defined age categories as well as the association of these age groups with survival. Age categories used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older.;A cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC was studied. Of the 2237 participants, 1939 (87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, 269 (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 29 (1%) had squamous histologic findings; 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or IV cancers; and median (range) age was 62 (20-95) years. We found that gene mutations for EGFR (P = .02) and ALK (P < .001) were associated with cancer diagnosis at a younger age, and a similar trend existed for ERBB2 (P = .15) and ROS1 (P = .10) but not BRAF V600E (P = .43). Among patients tested for all 5 targetable genomic alterations (n = 1325), younger age was associated with an increased frequency of a targetable genotype (P < .001). Those diagnosed at 50 years or younger have a 59% increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype. While presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration treated with a targeted agent was associated with improved survival, the youngest and oldest age groups had similarly poor outcomes even when a targetable genotype was present.;Younger age is associated with an increased likelihood of harboring a targetable genotype and is an underappreciated clinical biomarker in NSCLC. The survival of young patients with NCSLC is unexpectedly poor compared with other age groups, suggesting more aggressive disease biology.

Molecular apocrine is a subtype of ER-negative breast cancer that is characterized by the overexpression of steroid-response genes such as AR and a high rate of ErbB2 amplification. In this study, we have identified a positive feedback loop between the AR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in molecular apocrine breast cancer. In this process, AR regulates ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity. In addition, AR inhibition results in the down-regulation of ERK target proteins phospho-RSK1, phospho-Elk-1, and c-Fos using an in vivo molecular apocrine model. Furthermore, we show that AR-mediated induction of ERK requires ErbB2, and AR activity, in turn, regulates ErbB2 expression as an AR target gene. These findings suggest that ErbB2 is an upstream connector between the AR and ERK signaling pathways. Another feature of this feedback loop is an ERK-mediated regulation of AR. In this respect, the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation reduces AR expression and CREB1-mediated transcriptional regulation of AR acts as a downstream connector between the AR and ERK signaling pathways in molecular apocrine cells. Finally, we demonstrate that AR-positive staining is associated with the overexpression of ERK signaling targets phospho-Elk-1 and c-Fos in ER-negative breast tumors, which further supports a cross-regulation between the AR and ERK signaling pathways in molecular apocrine subtype.

To understand the molecular basis of MLN64 overexpression in cancer, the genomic region containing the MLN64 and ERBB2 genes was isolated and mapped. The two genes, DARPP32 and Telethonin, flanking MLN64 respectively on its centromeric and telomeric sides, although coamplified, are not overexpressed in breast cancer cells, indicating that gene amplification is not sufficient to allow overexpression. The MLN64 minimal promoter was isolated and found to be a housekeeping gene promoter containing four potential Sp1 binding elements. Using Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells, MLN64 promoter activity was induced in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous Sp1 addition. Furthermore, mutation of each individual Sp1 element resulted in a significant decrease in reporter gene activity, indicating that all the Sp1 binding elements are functional and act together to promote gene expression. Since the ERBB2 promoter is also positively regulated by Sp1, this study indicates that MLN64 and ERBB2 genes share common transcriptional controls together with a physical link on chromosome 17q.

One group of proteins whose activity depends on this nucleocytoplasmic traffic includes the mitogen-activated protein kinases. Usually, these kinases reside in the cytoplasm and move to the nucleus upon dual phosphorylation. One of these kinases, Erk5, has been found to reside in the nucleus of breast cancer cells that overexpress the ErbB2 receptor. This raises questions with respect to the mechanisms implicated in Erk5 nuclear location in these cells, as well as the biological consequences of this nuclear residency. In breast cancer cells overexpressing ErbB2, Erk5 dual phosphorylation required ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity; however, Erk5 nuclear residency did not require ErbB2 activity. Furthermore, translocation of Erk5 from the cytosol to the nucleus occurred in the absence of dual phosphorylation. Nuclear residency of Erk5 in these cells depended on the integrity of a nuclear localization signal present in the unique C-terminus of Erk5. The Erk5 form expressed by these breast cancer cells included the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic targeting signals, yet Erk5 was nuclear, and remained at this location throughout the interphase without being tightly bound to DNA. Biological studies using a mutant Erk5 that accumulates in the nucleus indicate that nuclear Erk5 favours MEF2-dependent transcriptional activity, and inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death.",

In mammary epithelial cells the expression of cyclin D1 is regulated through the oestrogen receptor and via ErbB2 signalling. Here we investigated the prognostic significance of cyclin D1 among 230 breast cancer patients randomised for tamoxifen, CMF chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The importance of combined cyclin D1 and ErbB2 overexpression was also analysed. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cyclin D1 expression resulted in 69 (29.8%) weakly positive, 107 (46.5%) moderately positive and 54 (23.7%) strongly positive cases. The prognostic importance of ErbB2 was significantly greater for patients whose tumours overexpressed cyclin D1 than for other patients (p = 0.026). In the former group, ErbB2 overexpression was strongly associated with increased risk of recurrence (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1-10.4) and breast cancer death (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 2.3-12.6). This result is in accordance with experimental studies demonstrating a link between cyclin D1 and ErbB2 in oncogenesis. Among oestrogen receptor positive patients, those with moderate cyclin D1 expression significantly did benefit from tamoxifen treatment (RR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82) whereas those with weak or strong expression did not.

In the ITT population, no significant differences in QOL or Q-TWiST scores were observed. In the ErbB2+ subgroup, the lapatinib plus paclitaxel (L + P) arm demonstrated stable FACT-B scores over the first year, while average scores for patients on P + placebo (P + pla) monotherapy decreased (change from baseline: L + P, p = 0.99; P + pla, p = 0.01). Clinically meaningful differences were observed between treatment arms on the FACT-B, Trial Outcome Index and breast cancer subscale scores. Pattern mixture models suggested more QOL differentiation between treatments among patients who progressed or withdrew early. Q-TWiST differences between the arms in the ErbB2+ subgroup ranged from 2 to 15 weeks with an L + P advantage across all utility weight combinations.;In the ITT population, results provide no evidence of QOL differences between treatment groups.

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase contributes to tumorigenesis. However, mechanisms regulating ErbB2 protein levels remain largely unclear. Here, we identified novel mechanisms of ErbB2 downregulation. ErbB2 constitutively binds to an adaptor protein FRS2β. We found that FRS2β bound to CD2AP and CIN85, which induces endosomal trafficking that targets lysosomes. FRS2β colocalized with CIN85 in the cytoplasm. Expression of wild type FRS2β but not its CIN85 non-binding mutant, downregulated the ErbB2 protein and inhibited anchorage-independent cell growth. Moreover, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Cbl was contained within a complex of FRS2β and CIN85. Knockdown of both CIN85 and CD2AP or of Cbl, or treatment with lysosomal degradation inhibitors diminished FRS2β downregulation of ErbB2. In addition, knockdown of endogenous FRS2β caused upregulation of ErbB2 in primary neural cells. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis showed that human breast cancer tissues that overexpress ErbB2 expressed low levels of FRS2β. Thus, an FRS2β-CIN85/CD2AP-Cbl axis for downregulation of ErbB2 may regulate ErbB2 protein levels in physiological and pathological settings. Molecular targeting drugs that can increase or stabilize the ErbB2-FRS2β-CIN85/CD2AP-Cbl axis may have promise for the control of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors.",

Some indications can be obtained by combining mathematical modeling and experimental data to understand tumor dynamics and to generate new experimental hypotheses. Here, we present a model describing the initial phase of ErbB2(+) mammary cancer progression, which arises from a joint effort combing mathematical modeling and cancer biology. The proposed model represents a new approach to investigate the CSC-driven tumorigenesis and to analyze the relations among crucial events involving cancer cell subpopulations. Using in vivo and in vitro data we tuned the model to reproduce the initial dynamics of cancer growth, and we used its solution to characterize observed cancer progression with respect to mutual CSC and progenitor cell variation. The model was also used to investigate which association occurs among cell phenotypes when specific cell markers are considered.

In order for metastasis to occur, cancer cells need to evade anoikis, which is defined as apoptosis caused by loss of attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM). Signaling from ErbB2 has previously been linked to the evasion of anoikis in breast cancer cells but the precise molecular mechanisms by which ErbB2 blocks anoikis have yet to be unveiled. In this study, we have identified a novel mechanism by which anoikis is inhibited in ErbB2-expressing cells: multicellular aggregation during ECM-detachment. Our data demonstrate that disruption of aggregation in ErbB2-positive cells is sufficient to induce anoikis and that this anoikis inhibition is a result of aggregation-induced stabilization of EGFR and consequent ERK/MAPK survival signaling. Furthermore, these data suggest that ECM-detached ErbB2-expressing cells may be uniquely susceptible to targeted therapy against EGFR and that this sensitivity could be exploited for specific elimination of ECM-detached cancer cells.

Since the successful targeting of amplified ERBB2 with a humanized monoclonal antibody, the amplified genes of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, FGFR2, and MET, as well as those of other cell regulator genes, are being considered as candidate targets of molecular therapy. The aim of the present study was to determine the amplification status of 26 genes, which are frequently amplified in solid cancers, in advanced gastric cancers. A total of 93 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded advanced gastric cancer tissues were examined by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification, and 32 cases with 'gain' or 'amplified' status of 16 genes were further examined for the respective gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and for the respective protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of gene amplifications in advanced gastric cancers were as follows: ERBB2 (13 cases, 14%), FGFR2 (7 cases, 8%), MYC (7 cases, 8%), TOP2A (7 cases, 8%), MET (4 cases, 4%), MDM2 (4 cases, 4%), CCND1 (3 cases, 3%), FGF10 (2 cases, 3%), and EGFR (1 case, 1%). Amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinases genes occurred in a mutually exclusive manner except for one tumor in which ERBB2 and FGFR2 were both amplified but in different cancer cells. Co-amplification of ERBB2 and MYC, and EGFR and CCND1, in single nuclei but on different amplicons, was confirmed in one case each. Attempts at correlating the FISH status with the immunohistochemical staining pattern showed variable results from complete concordance to no correlation. In conclusion, combination of multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and FISH analysis is a feasible approach for obtaining the semi-comprehensive genetic information that is necessary for personalized molecular targeted therapy.

Immediate early response protein IEX-1, small stress protein 1 (HSPB8), and tumor necrosis factor-associated factor-interacting protein mRNAs displayed higher expression levels in invasive lesions than in preinvasive lesions using samples obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from transgenic erbB2, ras, and cyclin D1 mice. LCM-isolated tissues from patient-matched normal, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma revealed similar increased expression in invasive human cancers compared with preinvasive and normal samples. These genes induced anchorage independence, increased cell proliferation, and protected against apoptosis, singly or in collaboration with erbB2. Surprisingly, they were all up-regulated by 17beta-estradiol and cyclin D1, and cyclin D1 overexpression increased p300/CBP binding to their promoters, supporting the model that cyclin D1-estrogen receptor (ER) coactivator interactions may be important to its role in ER-positive breast cancer. Additionally, an irreversible dual kinase inhibitor of ErbB signaling inhibited expression of the same genes. The up-regulation of genes contributing to increased invasiveness of ER-positive cancers offers a novel explanation for the contribution of cyclin D1 to a worse prognosis in ER-positive cancers. As targets of estrogen, cyclin D1, and erbB2 signaling, these candidates offer insights into the nature of the second events involved in breast cancer progression, regulatory events contributing to invasion, and potential targets of combined inhibition of hormone and growth factor signaling pathways.",

This was based on several lines of evidence. First, the S1P stimulation of ERK-1/2 was abolished by JTE013, which we show here is an S1P(2/4) antagonist and reduced by siRNA knockdown of S1P(4). Second, the S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 was almost completely abolished by a HER2 inhibitor (ErbB2 inhibitor II) and reduced by siRNA knockdown of HER2 expression. Third, phyto-S1P, which is an S1P(4) agonist, stimulated ERK-1/2 activation in an S1P(4)- and HER2-dependent manner. Fourth, FTY720 phosphate, which is an agonist at S1P(1,3,4,5) but not S1P(2) stimulated activation of ERK-1/2. Fifth, S1P stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2, which was reduced by JTE013. HER2 which is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase is the preferred dimerization partner of the EGF receptor. However, EGF-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 was not affected by siRNA knockdown of HER2 or by ErbB2 (epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (or HER2)) inhibitor II in MDA-MB-453 cells. Moreover, S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 does not require an EGF receptor. Thus, S1P and EGF function in a mutually exclusive manner. In conclusion, the magnitude of the signaling gain on the ERK-1/2 pathway produced in response to S1P can be increased by HER2 in MDA-MB-453 cells.

Tumor-bearing mice were used to compare the in vivo efficacy of two anti-cancer agents: PKI166, a kinase inhibitor selective for EGF receptor and ErbB2, and Taxol, a microtubule assembly blocker. PKI166 inhibited NeuT-induced mammary tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner and at a dose below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was significantly more inhibitory than Taxol at its MTD (57% vs. 25% tumor regression). Importantly, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphotyrosine content of NeuT isolated from PKI166-treated, tumor-bearing mice, providing a mechanistic link between kinase inhibition and its anti-tumor activity. Thus, implantation of genetically manipulated HC11 cells into mammary glands appears to be an excellent model for studying effects of anti-cancer agents in an orthotopic site.",

The currently available TKI (gefitinib and erlotinib) are EGFR reversible inhibitors. Afatinib is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker that covalently binds and blocks signaling from EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2) and ErbB4. The compound inhibits also the transphosphorylation of ErbB3. With this mode of action, afatinib is thought to have a mechanistic advantage over EGFR blockade alone, in that it provides a sustained, covalent inhibition of ErbB homo- and hetero-dimers. In the pivotal LUX-Lung 3 study, afatinib demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival over standard pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy (11.1 versus 6.9 months; HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.43-0.78; P = 0.001) in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.

We hypothesized that NSCLC has a distinct mutational profile in this group.;We collected NSCLC samples resected from self-reported AAs in five sites from Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio. Gene mutations were assessed by either SNaPshot or next generation sequencing, and ALK translocations were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;Two hundred sixty patients were included, mostly males (62.3%) and smokers (86.6%). Eighty-one samples (31.2%) were squamous cell carcinomas. The most frequently mutated genes were KRAS (15.4%), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, 5.0%), PIK3CA (0.8%), BRAF, NRAS, ERBB2, and AKT1 (0.4% each). ALK translocations were detected in two nonsquamous tumors (1.7%), totaling 61 cases (23.5%) with driver oncogenic alterations. Among 179 nonsquamous samples, 54 (30.2%) presented a driver alteration. The frequency of driver alterations altogether was lower than that reported in Caucasians, whereas no difference was detected in either EGFR or KRAS mutations. Overall survival was longer among patients with EGFR mutations.;We demonstrated that NSCLC from AAs has a different pattern of somatic driver mutations than from Caucasians. The majority of driver alterations in this group are yet to be described, which will require more comprehensive panels and assessment of noncanonical alterations.",

We investigated 98 primary breast tumors for amplification of these five loci. Twenty-five tumors (25.5%) showed amplification of at least one of these markers, but most amplifications did not encompass all of the tested loci. The genes most frequently amplified were ERBB2 and MLN 64 (22 of 25 amplified cases). MLN 64 was always coamplified with ERBB2, and to a similar level. Amplification of these five genes always leads to overexpression of their mRNA; we observed no cases of overexpression without amplification in any of these genes. Our results suggest that: (a) an independent, amplified region defined by MLN 62 (also called CART1 or TRAF4) is located in 17q11-q12; (b) in addition to ERBB2, MLN 64 is a major target for the 17q12-q21 amplicon; and (c) these MLN genes could be of pathogenetic significance in breast cancer.",

This receptor tyrosine kinase is upregulated in 10-20% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues, and amplification of ERBB2 has been correlated with poor prognosis in esophageal cancer. Tissues from 131 ESCC patients, along with cell and animal models of the disease were used to probe the underlying mechanisms by which ERBB2 upregulation occurs and causes negative outcomes in ESCC. We found that overexpression of ERBB2 inhibited radiosensitivity in vitro. Furthermore, miR-193a-5p reduced ERBB2 expression by directly targeting the 3'UTR. Increased miR-193a-5p enhanced radiosensitivity and inhibited tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, low miR-193a-5p expression correlated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients, and ESCC patients with good CCRT response exhibited higher miR-193a-5p expression.

Unlike other members in the family, erbB3 lacks or has impaired kinase activity. To transduce cell signaling, erbB3 has to interact with other RTKs and to be phosphorylated by its interactive partners, of those, erbB2 is the most important one. ErbB3 is frequently co-expressed with other RTKs in cancer cells to activate oncogenic signaling, such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway, etc. and thereby promote tumorigenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that activation of erbB3 signaling plays an important role in the progression of a variety of tumor types, such as erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer, epidermal growth factor receptor TKI-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer, and others. Basic research on the underlying mechanisms implicated the functions of erbB3 as a major cause of treatment failure in cancer therapy. Thus, concomitant inhibition of erbB3 is thought to be required to overcome the resistance and to effectively treat human cancers. This review focuses on the latest advances in our understanding of erbB3-initiated signaling in the development of resistance to cancer treatments.",

Although             hormonotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) represent valid therapies for prostate cancer             treatment, novel immunological approaches have been explored.

Immune response to tumor antigens could also be enhanced after standard             therapies. In the present study, we determined the occurrence of antibodies to             extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, heat shock protein (HSP), ribosomal P0 protein,             EGFR, ErbB2 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 35 prostate cancer patients             prior to and following local RT and hormonotherapy. We demonstrated that immunity             to P0, ECM molecules [collagens (C) CI, CIII, CV, fibronectin (FN) and laminin             (LM)] and to HSP90 was associated with malignancy in untreated patients. None             of the patient sera showed antibodies to EGFR, while 2 and 1 patients showed reactivity             to ErbB2 and PSA, respectively. We also demonstrated that 8 months after therapy             the IgG serum levels to CI, CIII, FN and HSP90 significantly decreased. Conversely,             the level of P0 autoantibodies increased after therapy in 10 patients. Five of             the 10 patients with increased levels of P0 autoantibodies were treated with RT             plus hormonotherapy. Treatment of patients did not change the levels of antibodies             against EGFR, ErbB2 and PSA. Our results indicated that the modification of antibody             level to self molecules after standard treatment of prostate cancer patients is             influenced by the type of antigen. Ribosomal P0 protein appears to be a high immunogenic             antigen and its immunogenicity increases following RT. In addition, 10 patients             with increased levels of autoantibodies to P0 showed PSA mean levels lower than             the remaining 25 patients at 18 months.

To determine whether such growth inhibition signifies an interaction between the cell cycle machinery and ErbB2-dependent alterations of cell signalling kinetics, we used MCF7 breast cancer cells (which express wild-type p53) to create transient and stable ErbB2 transfectants (MCF7-B2). Compared with parental cells, MCF7-B2 cells are characterised by upregulation of p53, p21(WAF) and Myc, downregulation of Bcl2, and apoptosis. In contrast, MCF7-B2 cells co-transfected with dominant negative p53 (MCF7-B2/Delta p53) exhibit reduced apoptosis and enhanced growth relative to both parental MCF7-B2 and control cells. These data imply that wild-type p53 limits survival of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and suggest that signals of varying length and/or intensity may evoke different cell outcomes depending upon the integrity of cell cycle control genes. We submit that acquisition of cell cycle control defects may play a permissive role in ErbB2 upregulation, and that the ErbB2 overexpression phenotype may in turn select for the survival of cells with p53 mutations or other tumour suppressor gene defects.",

Additional sources were identified from bibliographies in the articles and from Web sites and reports from the National Cancer Institute, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.;Progress in identifying the biochemical and molecular causes of cancer has led to discovery of abnormalities that characterize cancer cells and represent targets for development of drug therapies. TK receptors represent one such target when these are present in elevated quantities and/or aberrant forms. Abnormalities in these cell surface receptors have been correlated with development and progression of cancer, poor response to chemotherapeutic agents, and low survival rates. Several subtypes of TK receptors have been identified, and mutations in these have been associated with neoplasms of the breast, lung, colon, ovaries, and other organs. Approved agents, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin-Genentech) work by blocking a subtype of TK receptors that has been associated with breast cancer growth. Gefitinib (Iressa-AstraZeneca) was recently approved for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in patients who have failed treatment with traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Other agents such as cetuximab, erlotinib, and canertinib are in advanced stages of clinical trials and may be available for general clinical use in the next few years.;Cancer continues to be a difficult disease to treat, but newly identified cellular targets have resulted in new medications, and these promising agents are giving hope for additional options for patients with various solid tumors.",

Two anti-ErbB2 immunoconjugates, called Erb-hRNase and Erb-hcAb, have been prepared and found to be selectively cytotoxic on ErbB2-positive cancer cells in vitro and vivo. In Erb-hRNase, Erbicin is linked to a human RNase and in Erb-hcAb it is linked to the key structural and functional regions of a human IgG. Herceptin is an anti-ErbB2 humanised antibody successfully used in the immunotherapy of breast cancer. We report here that the Erbicin-derived immunoagents target on breast cancer cells an ErbB2 epitope different than that of Herceptin. This finding led us to verify the effects of Herceptin on breast cancer cells when it was used in combination with the Erbicin-derived immunoagents. The results indicated that in combination experiments the antitumour action of Herceptin and that of the novel agents were significantly increased in an additive fashion. An inspection of the mechanism of action of Erb-hRNase or Erb-hcAb combined with Herceptin provided evidence that the antibody combinations engendered an increased downregulation of the ErbB2 receptor, and led to an enhanced apoptotic cell death.",

For example, altered signaling in the networks activated by the ErbB family of receptors, particularly in ERBB2-amplified cancers, contributes to drug resistance. We developed a multiscale systems model of signaling networks in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer to quantitatively investigate relationships between biomarkers (markers of network activity) and combination drug efficacy. This model linked ErbB receptor family signaling to breast tumor growth through two kinase cascades: the PI3K/AKT survival pathway and the Ras/MEK/ERK growth and proliferation pathway. The model predicted molecular mechanisms of resistance to individual therapeutics. In particular, ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cells stimulated with the ErbB3 ligand heregulin were resistant to growth arrest induced by inhibitors of AKT and MEK or coapplication of two inhibitors of the receptor ErbB2 [Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Tykerb (lapatinib)]. We used model simulations to predict the response of ErbB2-positive breast cancer xenografts to combination therapies and verified these predictions in mice. Treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, and the ErbB3 inhibitor MM-111 was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than the combination of AKT and MEK inhibitors and even induced tumor regression, indicating that targeting both ErbB3 and ErbB2 may be an improved therapeutic approach for ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients.

Mutation hotspots on the gene were PCR amplified and sequenced, and the trace data were analyzed with software designed to detect mutations. Seven of the cell lines tested have PIK3Ca mutations: two lines derived from breast cancer, two from colon cancer, two from ovarian cancer, and one from lung cancer. BRAF and EGFR genes were normal in the PIK3Ca mutant lines. Two of the cell lines with mutant PIK3Ca also have a mutant version of the KRAS gene. The mutation status was correlated with array-based gene expression that is publicly available for the NCI-60 cell lines. We found increased expression levels for estrogen receptor (ER) and ERBB2 in PIK3Ca mutant lines. The PIK3Ca mutation status was also correlated with compound screening data for the cell lines. PIK3Ca-mutant cell lines were relatively more sensitive than PIK3Ca-normal cell lines to the ER inhibitor tamoxifen and the AKT inhibitor triciribine, among other compounds.

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous heregulin, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",

We investigated this using immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy in primary isolated E19 fetal rat lung fibroblasts and epithelial type II cells, stimulated with epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, neuregulin 1beta, or treated with conditioned medium (CM) from the respective other cell type. Fetal type II cells expressed significantly more ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3 protein than fibroblasts. ErbB4 was consistently identified by co-immunoprecipitation of all other ErbB receptors in both cell types independent of the treatments. Downregulation of ErbB4 in fibroblasts initiated cell-cell communication that stimulated surfactant phospholipid synthesis in type II cells. Confocal microscopy in type II cells revealed nuclear localization of all receptors, most prominently for ErbB4. Neuregulin treatment resulted in relocation to the extra-nuclear cytoplasmic region, which was distinct from fibroblast CM treatment which led to nuclear localization of ErbB4 and ErbB2, inducing co-localization of both receptors.

Amplification of at least one gene near ERBB2, topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A), has been shown to be clinically significant, but the prevailing patterns of gene amplification in this region of chromosome arm 17q have not been studied systematically in clinical cases of breast cancer. For characterizing this region, a commercial ERBB2-containing contig probe and 7 probes prepared from single overlapping BAC and P1 clones lying telomeric to ERBB2 and including TOP2A were hybridized to 77 ERBB2-amplified archival breast tumor specimens from 75 patients. The 7 single-clone probes covered a region of approximately 650 kb starting 114 kb telomeric to ERBB2. Amplification of the ERBB2 contig target alone was found in 32% of the tumors, whereas all 8 probe targets were amplified in 12% of the tumors, based on an amplification criterion of there being more than or equal to 2 targets per chromosome 17 centromere. When one of the 7 overlapping probes encompassing TOP2A indicated amplification within a specimen, all probes telomeric to that probe usually showed amplification. Only 5 specimens had regions of normal or deleted targets separating 2 amplified targets. Also, tumors that showed deletion of TOP2A usually showed deletion of one or more contiguous targets. The observed patterns of amplification and deletion are consistent with the break-fusion-bridge model for gene amplification. TOP2A was amplified in 25% of all tumor specimens and was deleted in 24%, based on a deletion criterion of there being fewer than or equal to 0.75 targets per chromosome 17 centromere. Considering the relevance of the TOP2A gene product to anthracycline therapy and the wealth of other cancer-associated genes within the ERBB2/TOP2A region, the pattern of amplification and deletion near ERBB2 and TOP2A may have a dramatic effect on the malignant potential of breast carcinomas and their response to therapy.",

Breast cancer patients with ERBB2 amplifications are currently treated with lapatinib, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks EGFR/ERBB2 signaling. Here, we show that hypoxia, via HIF-1, induces resistance to lapatinib-mediated effects in ERBB2-expressing mammary epithelial and ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. Lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in three-dimensional (3D) cultures are decreased under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia can maintain activation of signaling pathways downstream from ERBB2 including AKT and ERK in the presence of lapatinib. HIF-1 is both required and sufficient to induce lapatinib resistance as overexpression of stable HIF-1 in ERBB2-expressing cells blocks lapatinib-mediated effects and maintains ERBB2-downstream signaling under normoxic conditions. Under hypoxia, activation of ERK signaling is required for lapatinib resistance as treatment with MEK inhibitor trametinib reverses hypoxia-mediated lapatinib resistance. HIF-1 can bypass the lapatinib-treated inhibition of the ERK pathway via inhibition of the dual-specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2). Indeed, overexpression of DUSP2 in ErbB2-positve breast cancer cells reverses hypoxia-mediated lapatinib resistance. Thus, our results provide rationale for therapeutic evaluation of the treatment of hypoxic ERBB2 expressing breast tumors with a combination of lapatinib and MEK inhibitors.",

One such candidate, the scaffolding adapter protein, GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), functions in ErbB signaling and was recently shown to enhance mammary epithelial cell proliferation, and metastasis of ERBB2 (HER2/neu)-driven murine breast cancer. However, the amplification status and function of GAB2 in the context of amplification remain undefined. In this study, by genomic profiling of 172 breast tumors, and fluorescence in situ hybridization validation in an independent set of 210 scorable cases, we observed focal amplification spanning GAB2 (11q14.1) independent of CCND1 (11q13.2) amplification, consistent with a driver role. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of GAB2 in breast cancer lines (SUM52, SUM44PE and MDA468) with GAB2 amplification revealed a dependency on GAB2 for cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, survival and invasion, likely mediated through altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. GAB2 knockdown also reduced proliferation and survival in a cell line (BT474) with ERBB2 amplification, consistent with the possibility that GAB2 can function downstream of ERBB2. Our studies implicate focal amplification of GAB2 in breast carcinogenesis, and underscore an oncogenic role of scaffolding adapter proteins, and a potential new point of therapeutic intervention.",

The HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) depletes some proteins involved in PI3K/AKT signaling, e.g., ERBB2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT). 17-AAG and paclitaxel were combined (at a fixed 1:1 ratio of their IC(50)) in four ovarian cancer cell lines that differ in expression of p-AKT, EGFR, and ERBB2. The EGFR-overexpressing A431 and KB epidermoid cell lines were also included. Combination indices (CI) were calculated using the median-effect equation and interpreted in the context of 17-AAG-mediated inhibition of PI3K signaling. Synergy was observed in IGROV-1- and ERBB2-overexpressing SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells that express a high level of constitutively activated p-AKT [CI at fraction unaffected (fu)(0.5) = 0.50 and 0.53, respectively]. Slight synergy was observed in A431 cells (moderate p-AKT/overexpressed EGFR; CI at fu(0.5) = 0.76) and antagonism in CH1 (moderate p-AKT), HX62 cells (low p-AKT), and KB cells (low p-AKT/overexpressed EGFR; CI at fu(50) = 3.0, 3.5, and 2.0, respectively). The observed effects correlated with changes in the rate of apoptosis induction. 17-AAG induced a decrease in HSP90 client proteins (e.g., C-RAF, ERBB2, and p-AKT) or in downstream markers of their activity (e.g., phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p-AKT) in SKOV-3, IGROV-1, and CH1 cells at IC(50) concentrations. A non-growth-inhibitory concentration (6 nmol/L) reduced the phosphorylation of AKT (but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and sensitized SKOV-3 cells to paclitaxel. In conclusion, 17-AAG may sensitize a subset of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel, particularly those tumors in which resistance is driven by ERBB2 and/or p-AKT.",

This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.",

Clinical outcome can be substantially improved by ERBB2-targeted therapy. Lapatinib is a potent, orally bioavailable small molecule that reversibly and selectively inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR1 or ERBB1) and ERBB2 tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib binds the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of the receptor's intracellular domain to inhibit tumor cell growth. This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of lapatinib, and reviews both Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational uses of lapatinib in breast cancer therapy. The drug is generally well tolerated in patients, with diarrhea and rashes being the most common (usually mild or moderate) adverse effects. Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib has infrequent adverse effects on cardiac function. Lapatinib has substantial activity for advanced ERBB2-positive breast cancer, particularly in combination with capecitabine, following progression after anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Lapatinib combined with capecitabine yielded significant improvements in time to progression and response rate compared with capecitabine alone. This drug can also be combined with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer, for whom hormonal therapy is indicated. Lapatinib has shown early promise in treatment of central nervous system metastasis and is being further evaluated in various clinical settings. ",

Moreover, we found several positive correlations between specific amplicons from different chromosomes, suggesting the existence of cooperating genetic loci. Queried by gene, the most frequently amplified kinase was PTK2 (79% of tumors), whereas the most frequently lost kinase was PTK2B (hemizygous loss in 34% of tumors). Amplification of ERBB2 as measured by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) correlated closely with ERBB2 DNA and RNA levels measured by quantitative PCR as well as with ERBB2 protein levels. The overall frequency of recurrent losses was lower, with no region lost in more than 50% of tumors; the most frequently lost tumor suppressor gene was RB1 (hemizygous loss in 26% of tumors). Finally, we find that specific copy number changes in cell lines closely mimicked those in primary tumors, with an overall Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.843 for gains and 0.734 for losses.;High resolution CGH analysis of breast cancer reveals several regions where DNA copy number is commonly gained or lost, that non-random correlations between specific amplicons exist, and that specific genetic alterations are maintained in breast cancer cell lines despite repeat passage in tissue culture.

Targeted therapies such as endocrine therapy and growth factor receptor inhibitors have had a significant impact on the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, resistance to these agents eventually occurs, and currently represents a significant clinical problem in the management of breast cancers. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi) exhibit anticancer activity in a variety of tumor cell models and have been shown to target mechanisms of resistance to a number of targeted agents. It is unclear, however, if there are specific breast cancer subtypes for which an HDACi may be more or less effective. Here, we report that the class I isoform-selective HDACi entinostat (SNDX-275) preferentially inhibits cell proliferation/survival and inactivates downstream signaling in erbB2-overexpressing compared with basal breast cancer cells. SNDX-275 reduces the levels of both erbB2 and erbB3, as well as significantly decreases P-erbB2, P-erbB3, P-Akt, and P-MAPK in erbB2-overexpressing cells. Additionally, SNDX-275 promotes apoptosis and induces cell cycle arrest predominantly at G(1) phase in erbB2-overexpressing cells, whereas SNDX-275 mainly induces G(2)-M arrest in basal breast cancer cells. The cellular bias of SNDX-275 is shown to be related partly to the levels of erbB3 expression that directly impact the ability of SNDX-275 to inhibit proliferation/survival of the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings show that SNDX-275 may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent to treat breast cancers with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3.",

They are excellent targets for selective anti-cancer therapies because of their transmembrane location and pro-oncogenic activity. While several therapeutic agents against erbB2 and/or EGFR have been used in the treatment of human cancers with efficacy, there has been relatively less emphasis on erbB3 as a molecular target. Elevated expression of erbB3 is frequently observed in various malignancies, where it promotes tumor progression via interactions with other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) due to its lack of or weak intrinsic kinase activity. Studies on the underlying mechanisms implicate erbB3 as a major cause of treatment failure in cancer therapy, mainly through activation of the PI-3 K/Akt, MEK/MAPK, and Jak/Stat signaling pathways as well as Src kinase. It is believed that inhibition of erbB3 signaling may be required to overcome therapeutic resistance and effectively treat cancers. To date, no erbB3-targeted therapy has been approved for cancer treatment. Targeting of erbB3 receptor with a monoclonal antibody (Ab) is the only strategy currently under preclinical study and clinical evaluation. In this review, we focus on the role of erbB3-initiated signaling in the development of cancer drug resistance and discuss the latest advances in identifying therapeutic strategies inactivating erbB3 to overcome the resistance and enhance efficacy of cancer therapeutics.

In order to identify potential molecular targets in breast cancer, we performed a synthetic siRNA-mediated RNAi screen of the human tyrosine kinome.

Similar sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition was observed in cell lines from all subtypes of breast cancer. RNAi-mediated silencing or small compound inhibition of WEE1 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in an increase in gammaH2AX levels, arrest in the S-phase of the cell cycle, and a significant decrease in cell proliferation. WEE1-inhibited cells underwent apoptosis as demonstrated by positive Annexin V staining, increased sub-G1 DNA content, apoptotic morphology, caspase activation, and rescue by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK.

In our present study, we constructed oncogenetic tree to imitate the occurrence of genetic and cytogenetic alterations in human breast cancer. The oncogenetic tree model was built on CNV of ErbB2, AKT2, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and CCND1 genes in 963 cases of tumors with sequencing and CNA data of human breast cancer from TCGA. Results from the oncogenetic tree model indicate that ErbB2 copy number variation is the frequent early event of human breast cancer.

The mechanisms and downstream effectors through which the ErbB receptors influence processes linked to malignant development, including proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion, are, however, only now becoming apparent. Our particular emphasis in this review will be on how ErbB receptors, in particular ErbB1 and ErbB2, contribute to processes linked to cancer progression. Importantly, in keeping with the emerging theme that ErbB receptors do not function in isolation, we will focus on receptor cooperativity, i.e., ErbB1 cooperates with other classes of receptors, and the ligand-less ErbB2 functions as a heterodimer with other ErbBs.",

In addition to the traditional pathways of EGFR signaling, EGFR translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor in the proliferation of cancer cells. Heregulin is known as both an ErbB3 and an ErbB4 ligand. This study aimed to investigate the expression of heregulin and its relevant EGFR family members as well as their phosphorylated forms in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and to determine the relationship between their expression and clinicopathological factors including patient prognosis.;We analyzed the effects of exogenous heregulin on ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 phosphorylation in Caco-2, DLD-1, and HCT 116 colon cancer cell lines by western blot analysis. We examined 155 surgical resections from colorectomy patients. Cellular localization of ErbB1-4, their phosphorylated forms and heregulin protein was analyzed in CRC surgical resections by immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical results were compared with clinicopathological factors and patient prognosis.;Phosphorylated ErbB2 (pErbB2) and phosphorylated ErbB3 (pErbB3) were detected in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions of Caco-2 and DLD-1 cells stimulated by exogenous heregulin. Whereas, phosphorylated ErbB4 (pErbB4) was detected only in cytosolic fractions of HCT 116 cells stimulated by exogenous heregulin. Phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of cancer cells, whereas the pattern of EGFR staining was membranous and cytoplasmic. Subcellular localization of pErbB2, cytoplasmic, membranous, or nuclear, varied among cases. pErbB3 immunoreactivity was exclusively observed in the nuclei of cancer cells. pErbB4 immunoreactivity was observed in the cell membrane of cancer cells. Statistically, heregulin immunoreactivity correlated with pErbB2 and pErbB4 expression. In multivariate analysis for disease free survival, lymph node status, pErbB3 and pErbB4 expression retained independent prognostic significance. In multivariate analysis for overall survival, lymph node status, pEGFR and pErbB4 retained independent prognostic significance.;ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylated by heregulin localized in the nucleus of CRC cells.

Fourteen cases with coexisting HER2 mutation and amplification and/or overexpression were identified. Fifty-two of 68 patients had additional mutations in other analyzed genes, whereas 16 patients (23%) had HER2 mutations identified as the sole driver mutation.

However, such mutations have been reported in only ∼55% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in the United States, suggesting other mechanisms of malignancy are involved in the remaining cases. Here we report somatic mutations in the small GTPase gene RIT1 in ∼2% of lung adenocarcinoma cases that cluster in a hotspot near the switch II domain of the protein. RIT1 switch II domain mutations are mutually exclusive with all other known lung adenocarcinoma driver mutations. Ectopic expression of mutated RIT1 induces cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, which can be reversed by combined PI3K and MEK inhibition.

They are categorized into functional groups of carcinogenesis, metabolism and others. A combination of sequence analysis, reporter gene assays, quantitative real-time PCR, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and immunoblot analysis further confirmed the four AP-2gamma target genes in carcinogenesis group: ErbB2, CDH2, HPSE and IGSF11. Our results were consistent with the previous reports that ErbB2 was the target gene of AP-2gamma. Decreased expression and overexpression of AP-2gamma in human breast cancer cells significantly altered the expression of these four genes, indicating that AP-2gamma directly regulates them.;This suggested that AP-2gamma can coordinate the expression of a network of genes, involving in carcinogenesis, especially in breast cancer.

ErbB receptor ligands neuregulin (NRG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) play a major role in the developing lung, specifically in mesenchymal induced fetal surfactant synthesis by type II epithelial cells. Different erbB receptor ligands cause diverse biologic effects by stimulating specific erbB-dimers. It is not known how dimerization, cellular localization, and co-localization of erbB dimers are regulated in type II epithelial cells. We hypothesized that erbB receptors have a distinct dimerization, localization, and co-localization pattern in type II cells. In mouse type II epithelial cells, which express all four erbB receptors, erbB1 and erbB4 were the preferred dimerization partners. These dimerization patterns were ligand independent. Confocal microscopy showed these transmembrane receptors exhibited a strong nuclear localization. In non-stimulated cells, both erbB1 and erbB2 were predominantly localized to the nucleus and less intensely to the cytoplasm. However, erbB1 was mainly found in the nucleoli, whereas erbB2 spared the nucleolar region. ErbB3 was exclusively located in the nucleoli. ErbB4 was diffusely located in nucleus and cytoplasm, and like erbB2 spared the nucleolar region. Short stimulation with either EGF or NRG led to a more pronounced nuclear staining for erbB1, erbB2, and erbB4. All four receptors co-localized with each other after stimulation, but with varying intensity. The two known stimulators of fetal surfactant synthesis, NRG and NRG-containing fibroblast conditioned medium, changed cellular localization of the dimerization partners erbB4 and erbB2 in a distinct fashion.

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in breast cancer strongly correlates with aggressive tumors and poor prognosis. Recently, a positive correlation between HER2 and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a tumor-promoting protein and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) client) protein levels was shown in cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanistic link remained unknown. Here we show that overexpressed HER2 constitutively activates heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the inducible proteotoxic stress response of heat-shock chaperones, including HSP90, and a crucial factor in initiation and maintenance of the malignant state. Inhibiting HER2 pharmacologically by Lapatinib (a dual HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) or CP724.714 (a specific HER2 inhibitor), or by knockdown via siRNA leads to inhibition of phosphoactivated Ser326 HSF1, and subsequently blocks the activity of the HSP90 chaperone machinery in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer lines. Consequently, HSP90 clients, including MIF, AKT, mutant p53 and HSF1 itself, become destabilized, which in turn inhibits tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, HER2 signals via the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis to induce activated pSer326 HSF1. Heat-shock stress experiments confirm this functional link between HER2 and HSF1, as HER2 (and PI3K) inhibition attenuate the HSF1-mediated heat-shock response. Importantly, we confirmed this axis in vivo. In the mouse model of HER2-driven breast cancer, ErbB2 inhibition by Lapatinib strongly suppresses tumor progression, and this is associated with inactivation of the HSF1 pathway. Moreover, ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells derived from a primary mouse ErbB2 tumor also show HSF1 inactivation and HSP90 client destabilization in response to ErbB2 inhibition. Furthermore, in HER2-positive human breast cancers HER2 levels strongly correlate with pSer326 HSF1 activity. Our results show for the first time that HER2/ErbB2 overexpression controls HSF1 activity, with subsequent stabilization of numerous tumor-promoting HSP90 clients such as MIF, AKT and HSF1 itself, thereby causing a robust promotion in tumor growth in HER2-positive breast cancer.

A secondary mutation of threonine 790 (T790M) is associated with approximately half of the cases of acquired resistance. This study investigated whether the addition of silibinin to therapy with gefitinib or erlotinib could overcome T790M-mediated drug resistance considering that silibinin has various antitumor effects, including EGFR modulation. Silibinin selectively reduced the activity of the EGFR family (EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3) through the inhibition of receptor dimerization in lung cancer cells with EGFR mutations, but not in those harboring the wild type. In primary and acquired resistant cells with T790M, addition of silibinin enhanced the ability of EGFR-TKIs to downregulate EGFR signals and to inhibit cell growth. Similarly, the combination of silibinin and erlotinib effectively suppressed tumor growth in erlotinib resistance-bearing PC-9 xenografts. The results indicate that the addition of silibinin to EGFR-TKIs is a promising strategy to overcome T790M-mediated drug resistance.",

Breast cancers are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Each of the three major subtypes [ERBB2 amplified, estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive and triple-negative] poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Here we show, using high-resolution next-generation transcriptome sequencing, that in all three breast cancer subtypes, but not matched controls, there was significant overexpression of transcripts from intronic and untranslated regions in addition to exons from specific genes, particularly amplified oncogenes and hormone receptors. For key genes ERBB2 and ESR1, we demonstrate that overexpression is linked to the production of highly modified and truncated splice variants in tumours, but not controls, correlated with tumour subtype. Translation of these tumour-specific splice variants generates truncated proteins with altered subcellular locations and functions, modifying the phenotype, affecting tumour biology, and targeted antitumour therapies. In contrast, tumour suppressors TP53, BRCA1/2 and NF1 did not show intronic overexpression or truncated splice variants in cancers. These findings emphasize the detection of intronic as well as exonic changes in the transcriptional landscapes of cancers have profound therapeutic implications. ",

However, most patients with advanced ERBB2 amplified breast cancers whose tumors initially respond to trastuzumab develop resistance to the drug, leading to tumor progression. To identify factors responsible for acquired resistance to trastuzumab, gene expression profiling was performed on subclones of an ERBB2 amplified breast cancer cell line, BT474, which had acquired resistance to trastuzumab. The most overexpressed gene in these subclones was PPP1R1B, encoding the DARPP-32 phosphatase inhibitor. Western analysis revealed that only the truncated isoform of the DARPP-32 protein, t-Darpp, was overexpressed in the trastuzumab resistant cells. Using gene silencing experiments, we confirmed that t-Darpp over-expression was required for trastuzumab resistance in these cells. Furthermore, transfecting t-Darpp in parental BT-474 cells conferred resistance to trastuzumab, suggesting that t-Darpp expression was sufficient for trastuzumab resistance. We also found that t-Darpp over-expression was associated with Akt activation and that the T75 residue in t-Darpp was required for both Akt activation and trastuzumab resistance. Finally, we found that full-length DARPP-32 and t-Darpp are expressed in a majority of primary breast tumors. Over-expression of full-length DARPP-32 can also confer resistance to trastuzumab and, moreover, is associated with a poor prognostic value in breast cancers. Thus, t-Darpp and DARPP-32 expression are novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers in breast cancer.",

We have demonstrated that gene expression programs in mammary epithelial cells grown in monolayer cultures differ significantly from those in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. We identify a protein tyrosine phosphate, PTPRO, that was upregulated in mature MCF-10A mammary epithelial 3D structures but had low to undetectable levels in monolayer cultures. Downregulation of PTPRO by RNA interference inhibited proliferation arrest during morphogenesis. Low levels of PTPRO expression correlated with reduced survival for breast cancer patients, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, we showed that the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2/HER2 is a direct substrate of PTPRO and that loss of PTPRO increased ErbB2-induced cell proliferation and transformation, together with tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2. Moreover, in patients with ErbB2-positive breast tumors, low PTPRO expression correlated with poor clinical prognosis compared to ErbB2-positive patients with high levels of PTPRO. Thus, PTPRO is a novel regulator of ErbB2 signaling, a potential tumor suppressor, and a novel prognostic marker for patients with ErbB2-positive breast cancers. We have identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRO as a regulator of three-dimensional epithelial morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells and as a regulator of ErbB2-mediated transformation. In addition, we demonstrated that ErbB2 is a direct substrate of PTPRO and that decreased expression of PTPRO predicts poor prognosis for ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients. Thus, our results identify PTPRO as a novel regulator of mammary epithelial transformation, a potential tumor suppressor, and a predictive biomarker for breast cancer.",

In particular, the incorporation of trastuzumab into regimens containing existing chemotherapeutic agents has significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. De novo and acquired resistance to this treatment, however, is widespread. A substantial amount of research has therefore been dedicated to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms that could explain resistance to this otherwise effective therapy. Potential mechanisms for resistance to trastuzumab include steric inhibition imposed by other extracellular factors, molecular changes in the target receptor itself (ErbB2), alterations in the regulation of downstream signaling components, and crosstalk with other pathways that could compensate for attenuated ErbB2 signaling. In addition, preclinical and clinical studies have been performed to identify potential methods for overcoming trastuzumab resistance, including targeting alternate ErbB2 epitopes and the combined inhibition of multiple signaling components and/or pathways (vertical or horizontal inhibition). Studies continue to evaluate the most promising approaches for overcoming mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab and other ErbB2-targeted therapies. This review will summarize the most recent research designed to address this substantial clinical problem and provide clinicians with relevant background for understanding some of the potential molecular mechanisms for resistance to targeted therapies in the treatment of patients with breast cancer.",

We used phosphoprotein and microarray analyses to carry out targeted pathway studies of phosphorylation and gene expression changes in human breast cancer cell lines in the presence or absence of lapatinib. Studies were done in four breast cancer cell lines, two of which were responsive and two of which were nonresponsive to lapatinib. Responsive cell lines, BT474 and SKBr3, constitutively overexpress ErbB2 and show an IC(50) of 25 or 32 nmol/L for lapatinib, respectively. In contrast, nonresponsive MDA-MB-468 and T47D cells expressed a low basal level of ErbB2 and showed IC(50) values in the micromolar range. Cells responsive to lapatinib exhibited strong differential effects on multiple genes in the AKT pathway. After 12 h of exposure to 1.0 micromol/L of lapatinib, AKT1, MAPK9, HSPCA, IRAK1, and CCND1 transcripts were down-regulated 7- to 25-fold in responsive BT474 and SKBr3 cells. In contrast, lapatinib weakly down-regulated the AKT pathway in nonresponsive breast cancer cell lines (<5-fold down-regulation of most genes in the pathway). Furthermore, the proapoptotic gene FOXO3A, which is negatively regulated by AKT, was up-regulated 7- and 25-fold in lapatinib-responsive SKBr3 and BT474 cells, respectively. Phosphorylated Akt and Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3A also decreased in responsive breast cancer cell lines exposed to lapatinib. Gene expression profiling also revealed that lapatinib stimulated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and modulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism. In BT474 and T47D cells, which expressed moderate basal levels of the estrogen and progesterone receptors, 1.0 micromol/L of lapatinib induced expression by 7- to 11-fold.

        "Doc_abstract":"The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly ErbB2, has been linked to the genesis and progression of breast cancer. Two of the central signaling pathways activated by ErbB2 are the Ras/Raf-1/Mek/Erk pathway, which plays an important role in tumor cell growth and migration, and the PI3K/Akt pathway, which plays an important role in cell survival. Recently, we and others have shown that signaling through the Ras-Erk pathway can be influenced by p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), an effector of the Rho family GTP ases Rac and Cdc42. Expression of activated forms of Rac promotes activation of Erk through mechanisms involving Pak1 phosphorylation of Raf-1 and Mek1. In addition, Pak1 has also been implicated in the activation of Akt. However, our understanding regarding the degree to which Rho GTPases, and their effectors such as Pak1, contribute to ErbB2-mediated signaling is very limited.Recent results from our laboratory indicate that ErbB2 expression correlates with Pak activation in estrogen receptor negative human breast tumor samples. Using a three-dimensional (3D) culture of human MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells, we found that activation of Rac-Pak pathway by ErbB2 induces growth factor independent proliferation and promotes disruption of acini-like structures through the activation of the Erk and Akt pathways. We also observed that blocking Pak1 activity by small molecule inhibitors impeded the ability of activated ErbB2 to transform these cells and to activate its associated downstream signaling targets. In addition, we found that suppressing Pak activity in ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells delayed tumor formation and downregulated Erk and Akt signaling in vivo. These results support a model in which Pak, by activating Erk and Akt, cooperates with ErbB2 in transforming mammary epithelial cells.",

In order to identify genetic alterations associated with this tumor, we screened 23 gastric adenocarcinomas for recurrent chromosomal imbalances by using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The most common gains of chromosomal material were found on chromosome arms 20q (10 cases), 16p (7 cases), and 1q (4 cases) and on chromosome 11 (4 cases). Losses were observed on chromosome arms 4q, 5q, 9p, and 21q (3 cases each). Four tumors exhibited high-level amplifications localized on chromosome regions 2p23-p24, 7q31-q32, 8p21-p22, 10q25-q26, 11q13, 17q11-q21, and 20q. Based on the position of these amplifications, candidate (onco)genes were selected and subsequently tested by Southern blot analysis of the respective tumors. Of the seven tested candidates, MYCN, MET, WNT2, and ERBB2 were found to participate in the amplicons of the respective tumor samples. Of these four presumably activated oncogenes, two, MYCN and WNT2, were previously not assumed to play a pathogenic role in stomach cancer. Among the other regions of imbalance, gain of 20q seems particularly interesting, because it is found in almost half of the analyzed cases and is highly amplified. Our data allowed us to narrow the relevant region down to the commonly gained bands 20q12-q13.1. This and other imbalanced regions provide a basis for searching new putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in the development or progression of gastric adenocarcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family consists of four members that belong to the ErbB lineage of proteins (ErbB1-4). These receptors consist of an extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and an intracellular portion with a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyterminal tail. The ErbB proteins function as homo and heterodimers. Growth factor binding to EGFR induces a large conformational change in the extracellular domain. Two ligand-EGFR complexes unite to form a back-to-back dimer in which the ligands are on opposite sides of the aggregate. Following ligand binding, EGFR intracellular kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer. The carboxyterminal lobe of the activator kinase of the dimer interacts with the amino-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase thereby leading to its allosteric stimulation. Several malignancies are associated with the mutation or increased expression of members of the ErbB family including lung, breast, stomach, colorectal, head and neck, and pancreatic carcinomas. Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are orally effective protein-kinase targeted quinazoline derivatives that are used in the treatment of ERBB1-mutant lung cancer and lapatinib is an orally effective quinazoline derivative used in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies that target the extracellular domain of ErbB2 are used for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and monoclonal antibodies that target ErbB1 and are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cancers treated with these targeted drugs eventually become resistant to them, and a current goal of research is to develop drugs that are effective against drug-resistant tumors. ",

Particular attention was paid to the CRKL gene, the product of which is an adaptor protein containing Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2/SH3) domains. An extremely high CRKL copy number was confirmed in the MKN74 gastric cancer cell line using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and a high level of CRKL expression was also observed in the cells. The RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of CRKL in MKN74 disclosed the ability of CRKL to upregulate gastric cell proliferation. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CRKL protein was overexpressed in 24.4% (88/360) of the primary gastric cancers that were analyzed. The CRKL copy number was also examined in 360 primary gastric cancers using a FISH analysis, and CRKL amplification was found to be associated with CRKL overexpression. Finally, we showed that MKN74 cells with CRKL amplification were responsive to the dual Src/BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor BMS354825, likely via the inhibition of CRKL phosphorylation, and that the proliferation of MKN74 cells was suppressed by treatment with a CRKL-targeting peptide.;These results suggested that CRKL protein is overexpressed in a subset of gastric cancers and is associated with CRKL amplification in gastric cancer.

The EGFR homodimers are quickly endocytosed after EGF stimulation as a means of down-regulation. However, the results from experiments on the ability of ErbB2 to undergo ligand-induced endocytosis are very controversial. It is unclear how the EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimers might behave. In this research, we showed by subcellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence, and microinjection that, in the four breast cancer cell lines MDA453, SKBR3, BT474, and BT20, the EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimerization levels were positively correlated with the ratio of ErbB2/EGFR expression levels. ErbB2 was not endocytosed in response to EGF stimulation. Moreover, in MDA453, SKBR3, and BT474 cells, which have very high levels of EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimerization, EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis was greatly inhibited compared with that in BT20 cells, which have a very low level of EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimerization. Microinjection of an ErbB2 expression plasmid into BT20 cells significantly inhibited EGF-stimulated EGFR endocytosis. Coexpression of ErbB2 with EGFR in 293T cells also significantly inhibited EGF-stimulated EGFR endocytosis. EGF did not stimulate the endocytosis of ectopically expressed ErbB2 in BT20 and 293T cells. These results indicate that ErbB2 and the EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimers are impaired in EGF-induced endocytosis. Moreover, when expressed in BT20 cells by microinjection, a chimeric receptor composed of the ErbB2 extracellular domain and the EGFR intracellular domain underwent normal endocytosis in response to EGF, and this chimera did not block EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis. Thus, the endocytosis deficiency of ErbB2 is due to the sequence of its intracellular domain.",

However, resistances to trastuzumab frequently occur, and novel strategies/agents are urgently needed to abrogate the resistant phenotype. Our current study explores the potential of SNDX-275, a class I HDAC inhibitor, to overcome trastuzumab resistance and investigates the combinational effects of SNDX-275 and trastuzumab on both sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells. Cell proliferation assays showed that SNDX-275 significantly enhanced trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition in trastuzumab-sensitive, erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Importantly, SNDX-275 at its therapeutic range re-sensitized trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition. SNDX-275 in combination with trastuzumab resulted in a dramatic reduction of erbB3 and its phosphorylation (P-erbB3), and inhibition of Akt signaling. Apoptotic-ELISA and western blot analyses confirmed that the combinations of SNDX-275 and trastuzumab as compared to SNDX-275 alone significantly enhanced DNA fragmentation and induced more PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation in both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SNDX-275 mainly attenuated the interactions of erbB2 and erbB3 receptors, but had no significant effect on erbB2/IGF-1R or erbB3/IGF-1R associations in the trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. These data indicated that SNDX-275 enhanced trastuzumab efficacy against erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and exhibited potential to overcome trastuzumab resistance via disrupting erbB2/erbB3 interactions and inactivating PI-3K/Akt signaling.

A major problem in breast cancer therapy is the heterogeneity among different tumor types and cell lines commonly used in preclinical studies. To characterize the signaling pathways of some of the commonly used breast cancer cell lines and dissect the relationship among a number of pathways and some key genetic and molecular events in breast cancer development, such as p53 mutation, ErbB2 expression, and estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) status, we performed pathway profiling of 14 breast cancer cell lines by measuring the expression and phosphorylation status of 40 different cell signaling proteins with 53 specific antibodies using a protein lysate array. Cluster analysis of the expression data showed that there was close clustering of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Src, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) in all of the cell lines. The most differentially expressed proteins between ER- and PR-positive and ER- and PR-negative breast cells were mTOR, Akt (pThr308), PDGFRbeta, PDGFRbeta (pTyr751), panSrc, Akt (pSer473), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), Src (pTyr418), mTOR (pSer2448), and IGFBP2. Many apoptotic proteins, such as apoptosis-inducing factor, IGFBP3, bad, bax, and cleaved caspase 9, were overexpressed in mutant p53-carrying breast cancer cells. Hexokinase isoenzyme 1, ND2, and c-kit were the most differentially expressed proteins in high and low ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells. This study demonstrated that ER/PR status, ErbB2 expression, and p53 status are major molecules that impact downstream signaling pathways.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In normal healthy tissues, an equilibrium is established between cell death and survival. This equilibrium ensures that cells survive in the right milieu, but undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) when damaged, or when the environment is no longer supportive. Diseases may occur with alterations in this homeostasis. For example, cancer cells may survive in an environment in which they would not normally exist. This is accomplished by alterations in the expressions or functions of genes controlling both survival and apoptotic signaling pathways. Survival signaling pathways involve the activation of cell surface receptors, serine threonine kinases, transcription factors as well as other molecules. In breast and ovarian cancers, the ErbB2 growth factor receptor is overexpressed and this contributes to the progression of these cancers, in part by constitutively activating survival signaling pathways. In contrast, apoptotic signal transduction pathways are often inhibited in cancer. For example, overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis and this contributes to the accumulation of cells in follicular lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Furthermore, alterations in these signaling pathways in cancer cells may lead to drug resistance. Recent advances in molecular targeted therapies have taken advantage of alterations in survival and apoptotic signaling pathways in cancer to specifically target aberrantly regulated molecules. For example, Herceptin trade mark inhibits ErbB2 function and anti-sense oligonucleotides against Bcl-2 reduce Bcl-2 expression. These agents can thus induce apoptosis in the specific cancer cell against which they have been targeted. In this review, we will discuss alteration in survival and apoptotic signal transduction pathways in cancer and the development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs to target these pathways.",

Nevertheless, it up-regulates the expression of these EGF family ligands. To understand the biologic significance of RAS-induced up-regulation of these ligands in both RAS-induced PAK activation and malignant transformation, we have conducted the following studies, based on the previous observations that (1) the N-terminal SH3 domain of PIX selectively binds a Pro-rich domain of 18 amino acids of PAKs, CDC42/Rac-dependent Ser/Thr kinase family, and (2) this specific interaction is essential for both PAK activation and membrane ruffling;Using four distinct, cell-permeable, and highly specific inhibitors, namely WR-PAK18, which blocks the PAK-PIX interaction; AG 1478, which inhibits ErbB1 kinase activity; and AG 825 or AG 879, which inhibits ErbB2 kinase activity, we demonstrate that (1) the PAK-PIX interaction is essential for v-Ha-RAS-induced malignant transformation; (2) v-Ha-RAS requires not only ErbB1 but also ErbB2, which are activated through two independent autocrine pathways to induce both the PIX/Rac/CDC42-dependent PAK activation and malignant transformation in vitro; and (3) a combination of AG 879 and the Src family kinase-specific inhibitor PP1 suppresses almost completely the growth of RAS-induced sarcomas in nude mice.;These findings not only change our conventional view on the role of these RAS-inducible ligands and ErbB family receptors (serving as RAS activators) but also suggest a new avenue for the treatment of RAS-associated cancers by a combination of inhibitors specific for ERbB, Src, or PAK family kinases.",

However, their clinical application is hampered by resistance and toxicity. To meet this important challenge, we developed and tested a novel concept of biomarker-guided sequential applications of various targeted therapies using ErbB2-overexpressing/PTEN-low, highly aggressive breast cancer as our model. Strikingly, sustained activation of ErbB2 and downstream pathways drives trastuzumab resistance in both PTEN-low/trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers from patients and mammary tumors with intratumoral heterogeneity from genetically-engineered mice. Although lapatinib initially inhibited trastuzumab-resistant mouse tumors, tumors by-passed the inhibition by activating the PI3K/mTOR signaling network as shown by the quantitative protein arrays. Interestingly, activation of the mTOR pathway was also observed in neoadjuvant lapatinib-treated patients manifesting lapatinib resistance. Trastuzumab + lapatinib resistance was effectively overcome by sequential application of a PI3K/mTOR dual kinase inhibitor (BEZ235) with no significant toxicity. However, our p-RTK array analysis demonstrated that BEZ235 treatment led to increased ErbB2 expression and phosphorylation in genetically-engineered mouse tumors and in 3-D, but not 2-D, culture, leading to BEZ235 resistance. Mechanistically, we identified ErbB2 protein stabilization and activation as a novel mechanism of BEZ235 resistance, which was reversed by subsequent treatment with lapatinib + BEZ235 combination. Remarkably, this sequential application of targeted therapies guided by biomarker changes in the tumors rapidly evolving resistance doubled the life-span of mice bearing exceedingly aggressive tumors. This fundamentally novel approach of using targeted therapies in a sequential order can effectively target and reprogram the signaling networks in cancers evolving resistance during treatment. ",

MiR-25 inhibition significantly decreased the metastasis, invasion and proliferation of GC cells in vitro, and reduced their capacity to develop distal pulmonary metastases and peritoneal dissemination in vivo.

ErbB2, an oncoprotein that is often overproduced in breast tumors, can block breast cancer cell anoikis via mechanisms that are understood only in part. In an effort to understand them better we found that detachment of the non-malignant human breast epithelial cells from the ECM upregulates a protein Perp in these cells. Perp is a component of the desmosomes, multiprotein complexes involved in cell-to-cell adhesion. Perp can cause apoptosis via unknown mechanisms. We demonstrated that Perp upregulation by cell detachment is driven by detachment-induced loss of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We also found that Perp knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) rescues detached cells from death which indicates that Perp contributes to their anoikis. We observed that ErbB2, when overexpressed in detached breast epithelial cells, causes Perp downregulation. Furthermore, ErbB2-directed RNAi or treatment with lapatinib, an ErbB2/EGFR small-molecule inhibitor used for breast cancer therapy, upregulated Perp in ErbB2-positive human breast and ovarian carcinoma cells. We established that ErbB2 downregulates Perp by activating an ErbB2 effector protein kinase Mek that blocks detachment-induced EGFR loss in a manner that requires the presence of a signaling protein Sprouty-2. Finally, we observed that restoration of the wild-type Perp levels in ErbB2-overproducing breast epithelial cells increases their anoikis susceptibility and blocks their clonogenicity in the absence of adhesion to the ECM. In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism of ErbB2-mediated mechanism of anoikis resistance of ErbB2-overproducing breast epithelial cells. This mechanism allows such cells to grow without adhesion to the ECM and is driven by ErbB2-induced activation of Mek, subsequent EGFR upregulation and further EGFR-dependent Perp loss.",

Gap junctions play an important role in vital functions, including the regulation of cell growth and cell differentiation. Here, we examined the expression of Cx43, a major Cx in breast tissue, in 32 surgical specimens obtained from breast cancer patients who underwent a primary surgical resection prior to chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments. The expression of Cx43 gap junctions was compared to the levels of estrogen, progesterone, and erbB2 tyrosine kinase receptors. In addition, a panel of breast cancer cell lines and a series of normal rat mammary tissues and rat mammary tumors induced in vivo by dimethylbenz(a)anthracene were studied. We demonstrated that the lack of Cx43 gap junctions is a common feature of human mammary cancer tissues compared to nonneoplastic breast tissues surrounding primary tumors. Cx43 gap junctions were not observed in ductal carcinomas in situ, infiltrating ductal carcinomas, and infiltrating lobular carcinomas, and they seem to be independent of estrogen, progesterone, and erbB2 receptor status. In breast cancer cell lines and rodent mammary carcinoma tissues, down-regulation of Cx43 occurs at the mRNA level, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism for the decrease of Cx43 protein in breast cancer. In summary, this study provides evidence of decreased expression of Cx43 gap junctions in breast cancer at various stages of progression as well as breast cancer cell lines and raises the possibility that Cx43 may be a useful marker for detecting early oncogenesis in the breast. Because Cx43 gap junctions are lacking in breast cancer and restoration of Cx43 has been shown to reverse the malignant phenotype in vitro, pharmacological up-regulation of Cx43 may prove beneficial in cancer therapeutics.",

The principal adverse event attributable to Herceptin is cardiac toxicity. Data from clinical trials show that, unlike Herceptin, Lapatinib may have reduced cardiac toxicity. This study was conducted to elucidate pathways which may contribute to cardiac toxicity or survival using Lapatinib and Herceptin. Our results show that treatments directed to ErbB1/2 receptors using GW-2974 (a generic ErbB1/2 inhibitor) activated AMPK, a key regulator in mitochondrial energy production pathways in human cardiac cells and cancer cells. Although Herceptin downregulates tumor survival pathways, AMPK fails to be activated in tumor and cardiac cells. When treated in combination with TNFalpha, a known cytokine associated with cardiac toxicity, GW-2974 protected cardiac cells from cell death whereas Herceptin contributed to TNFalpha-induced cellular killing. Since activity of AMPK in cardiac cells is associated with stress induced survival in response to cytokines or energy depletion, cardiac toxicity by Herceptin may be a consequence of failure to induce stress-related survival mechanisms. Thus, the ability to activate AMPK after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be a crucial factor for increased efficacy against the tumor and decreased risk of cardiomyopathy.",

In this study, the responsiveness to tamoxifen in the BT/HerR, Herceptin-resistant BT cell lines established through constant Herceptin exposure, was evaluated. Compared with BT cells, improvement of sensitivity to tamoxifen in BT/HerR was demonstrated by ER functional analysis and cell proliferation assay. Tamoxifen in the resistant cell line was found to inhibit 17beta-estradiol-stimulating estrogen-responsive gene pS2 expression more effectively than in BT cells in real-time PCR assay. Western blot analysis showed that cross-phosphorylation between ER and downstream components of ERBB2 was attenuated in BT/HerR cells. ER redistribution from cytoplasm to nucleus could be found in these cells through immunofluorescence and confocal studies, and importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that tamoxifen induced occupancy of the pS2 promoter by ER and nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR1) instead of coactivator NCOA3 in these cells. Finally, combination of tamoxifen and Herceptin was found to improve the sensitivity of BT/HerR cells to Herceptin. Our results suggest that the ER genomic pathway in the ER-positive and Herceptin-resistant breast cancer cells may be reactivated, allowing tamoxifen therapy to be effective again, and a combination of tamoxifen and Herceptin can be a potential therapeutic strategy for ER-positive and Herceptin-resistant human breast cancer.",

Elevated cycooxygenase-2 levels have been implicated in several malignant properties of colon cancer. We now show for the first time a strong link between hyaluronan-CD44 interaction and cyclooxygenase-2 in colon cancer cells. First, we have shown that increased expression of hyaluronan synthase-2 induces malignant cell properties, including increased proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HIEC6 cells. Second, constitutive hyaluronan-CD44 interaction stimulates a signaling pathway involving ErbB2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, beta-catenin, and cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E(2) in HCA7 colon carcinoma cells. Third, the HA/CD44-activated ErbB2 --> phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT --> beta-catenin pathway stimulates cell survival/cell proliferation through COX-2 induction in hyaluronan-overexpressing HIEC6 cells and in HCA7 cells. Fourth, perturbation of hyaluronan-CD44 interaction by hyaluronan oligomers or CD44-silencing RNA decreases cyclooxygenase-2 expression and enzyme activity, and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 decreases hyaluronan production suggesting the possibility of an amplifying positive feedback loop between hyaluronan and cyclooxygenase-2. We conclude that hyaluronan is an important endogenous regulator of colon cancer cell survival properties and that cyclooxygenase-2 is a major mediator of these hyaluronan-induced effects. Defining hyaluronan-dependent cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E(2)-associated signaling pathways will provide a platform for developing novel therapeutic approaches for colon cancer.",

SCs with targeted mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 possess the same self-renewal properties as cancer SCs, and their number increases progressively in the p53 null premalignant mammary gland. Pharmacological reactivation of p53 correlates with restoration of asymmetric divisions in cancer SCs and tumor growth reduction, without significant effects on additional cancer cells.

Homozygous deletion of TOB1 in mice is reported to be responsible for cancer development in the lung, liver, and lymph node, whereas the ectopic overexpression of TOB1 shows anti-proliferation, and a decrease in the migration and invasion abilities on cancer cells. Biochemical studies revealed that the anti-proliferative activity of TOB1 involves mRNA deadenylation and is associated with the reduction of both cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) expressions and the induction of CDK inhibitors. Moreover, TOB1 interacts with an oncogenic signaling mediator, β-catenin, and inhibits β-catenin-regulated gene transcription. TOB1 antagonizes the v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (AKT) signaling and induces cancer cell apoptosis by activating BCL2-associated X (BAX) protein and inhibiting the BCL-2 and BCL-XL expressions. The tumor-specific overexpression of TOB1 results in the activation of other tumor suppressor proteins, such as mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) and phosphatase and tensin homolog-10 (PTEN), and blocks tumor progression.

G60S mice were cross-bred with ErbB2 overexpressing mice, and spontaneous and 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA)-induced tumor development was evaluated. Mice were killed when tumors reached ∼1 cm(3) or when mice showed signs of critical illness. In both spontaneous and DMBA studies, onset of palpable tumors was delayed in G60S mice compared with mice in control groups. Moreover, while tumors from control mice reached the size threshold, most DMBA-exposed Cx43 mutant mice were killed prematurely because of labored breathing, independent of the presence of a palpable tumor. Reduced Cx43 levels in Cx43 mutant mice were accompanied by extensive mammary gland hyperplasia. Lung histology revealed that all Cx43 mutant mice exhibited mammaglobin-positive mammary gland metastases to the lung, and the number of metastases was increased by threefold in Cx43 mutant mice on treatment with DMBA. Thus, while reduced levels of Cx43 delayed the onset of palpable tumors, normal Cx43 levels inhibited mammary gland tumor metastasis to the lungs. Understanding the mechanisms of how Cx43, which is expressed primarily in myoepithelial cells, inhibits mammary gland tumor metastasis is critical as Cx43 is assessed as a candidate for therapeutic intervention.",

Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists, such as eltrombopag, represent a novel approach for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The TPO-R MPL is expressed on megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte precursors, although little is known about its expression on other tissues.;Breast, lung, and ovarian tumor samples were analyzed for MPL expression by microarray and/or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and for TPO-R protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell line proliferation assays were used to analyze the in vitro effect of eltrombopag on breast, lung, and ovarian tumor cell proliferation. The lung carcinoma cell lines were also analyzed for TPO-R protein expression by Western blot.;MPL mRNA was not detectable in 118 breast tumors and was detectable at only very low levels in 48% of 29 lung tumors studied by microarray analysis. By qRT-PCR, low but detectable levels of MPL mRNA were detectable in some normal (14-43%) and malignant (3-17%) breast, lung, and ovarian tissues. A comparison of MPL to EPOR, ERBB2, and IGF1R mRNA demonstrates that MPL mRNA levels were far lower than those of EPOR and ERBB2 mRNA in the same tissues. IHC analysis showed negligible TPO-R protein expression in tumor tissues, confirming mRNA analysis. Culture of breast, lung, and ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed no increase, and in fact, showed a decrease in proliferation following incubation with eltrombopag. Western blot analyses revealed no detectable TPO-R protein expression in the lung carcinoma cell lines.;Multiple analyses of breast, lung, and ovarian tumor samples and/or cell lines show no evidence of MPL mRNA or TPO-R protein expression.

Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of TOB1 significantly enhances the radiosensitivity of breast and cervical cancer cells. However, the potential mechanisms of TOB1 are still debated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of infrared (IR) radiation on TOB1 expression in the human lung cancer cell lines NCI-H1975 and A549 via western blot analysis. NCI-H1975 cells were transfected with TOB1 recombinant plasmid, and A549 cells were treated with TOB1-small interfering RNA (siRNA) to establish gain-of-function and loss-of‑function cell models. The effects of radiation and TOB1 overexpression and silencing on clonogenic survival, cell cycle distribution and DNA repair were assessed. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the related mechanisms. The expression levels of TOB1 were significantly induced by IR radiation. Overexpression of TOB1 abrogated radiation-induced G2/M arrest, reduced clonogenic cell survival and enhanced γ-H2AX foci in NCI-H1975 cells exposed to irradiation. TOB1-siRNA demonstrated opposite effects in A549 cells. TOB1 regulated the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and modulated the phosphorylation of p53 via activation of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. The findings suggest that TOB1 may be a novel molecular target of irradiation. TOB1 modulated the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.",

We observed a significant positive correlation between the mRNA levels of the triple markers and their protein status (ESR1 vs. ER, Spearman's ρ = 0.527, P = 2.3 × 10(-22); PGR vs. PR, Spearman's ρ = 0.631, P = 5.1 × 10(-34); ERBB2 vs. HER2, Spearman's ρ = 0.439, P = 3.0 × 10(-15)). Furthermore, the subtypes determined by mRNA levels of the triple markers were significantly correlated to the subtypes determined based on their protein status (Spearman's ρ = 0.342, P = 2.0 × 10(-8)). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the subtypes determined by mRNA levels of the triple-marker could predict the disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients. Multivariate analysis showed that the predictive value of DFS could be confirmed for the subtypes determined by mRNA levels of the triple markers (HR = 2.285, P = 0.008) but not for those determined by their protein status.

The prognostic biomarkers chosen for comparison represented surrogate measures of tumor: (i). proliferation, growth and genetic instability (mitotic and apoptotic indices, Ki-67/MIB-1-positivity, nuclear grade, p53-positivity), (ii). endocrine-dependence (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), pS2, Bcl2), (iii). growth factor receptor-dependence (ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB1), and (iv). angiogenic, invasive and proteolytic potential (uPA, PAI-1, Cathepsin D, VEGF). No biomarker reflecting tumor angiogenic, invasive or proteolytic potential showed a significant correlation with patient age at diagnosis. In contrast, significant inverse correlations (|r|>0.1; P< or =0.05) were observed for all measures of tumor growth and genetic instability as well as growth factor receptor overexpression (ErbB2 or EGFR positivity). Only one marker of endocrine-dependence, ER expression, showed a significant positive correlation with patient age at diagnosis. In summary, these findings support the hypothesis that breast cancer biology is significantly affected by patient age. In particular, breast tumors arising in older patients have slower growth rates, are more likely to be ER-positive, and are less likely to be p53-positive, EGFR-positive or ErbB2-positive.",

Expression of ERBB2, phosphorylated ERBB2, EGFR, IGF1R and FOXA1 proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the functional ERBB2 status and identify co-expressions.;First, we identified the ERBB2-C17orf37-GRB7 genomic segment as the minimal common 17q12-q21 amplicon, and CRKRS and IKZF3 as the most frequent centromeric and telomeric amplicon borders, respectively. Second, GISTIC analysis identified 17 other genome regions affected by copy number aberration (CNA) (amplifications, gains, losses). The expression of 37 genes of these regions was deregulated. Third, two types of heterogeneity were observed in ERBB2-amplified BCs. The genomic profiles of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) ERBB2-amplified BCs were different. The WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was involved in ER- ERBB2-amplified BCs, and PVT1 and TRPS1 were candidate oncogenes associated with ER+ ERBB2-amplified BCs. The size of the ERBB2 amplicon was different in inflammatory (IBC) and non-inflammatory BCs. ERBB2-amplified IBCs were characterized by the downregulated and upregulated mRNA expression of ten and two genes in proportion to CNA, respectively. IHC results showed (i) a linear relationship between ERBB2 gene amplification and its gene and protein expressions with a good correlation between ERBB2 expression and phosphorylation status; (ii) a potential signaling cross-talk between EGFR or IGF1R and ERBB2, which could influence response of ERBB2-positive BCs to inhibitors. FOXA1 was frequently coexpressed with ERBB2 but its expression did not impact on the outcome of patients with ERBB2-amplified tumors.;We have shown that ER+ and ER- ERBB2-amplified BCs are different, distinguished ERBB2 amplicons in IBC and non-IBC, and identified genomic features that may be useful in the design of alternative therapeutical strategies.",

In humans, the majority of ErbB2-positive sporadic breast cancers harbor p53 mutations, which correlate with poor prognosis. Also, the extremely high incidence of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in women with p53 germline mutations (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) suggests a key role of mutant p53 specifically in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis. To examine the role of mutant p53 during ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis, a mutant p53 allele (R172H) was introduced into the (MMTV)-ErbB2/Neu mouse model system. Interestingly, we show in heterozygous p53 mice that mutant p53 R172H is a more potent activator of ErbB2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis than simple loss of p53. The more aggressive disease in mutant p53 animals was reflected by earlier tumor onset, increased mammary tumor multiplicity, and shorter survival. These in vivo and in vitro data provide mechanistic evidence that mutant p53 amplifies ErbB2 and EGFR signaling to promote the expansion of mammary stem cells and induce cell proliferation.;This study identifies mutant p53 as an essential player in ErbB2 and EGFR-mediated mammary tumorigenesis and indicates the potential translational importance of targeting mutant p53 in this subset of patients with breast cancer.",

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Herceptin enhances the antitumor effects of Taxol. Because activation of p34(Cdc2) is required for Taxol-induced apoptosis and because overexpression of ErbB2 blocks Taxol-induced apoptosis by inhibiting p34(Cdc2) activation, we studied the effect of Herceptin treatment on p34(Cdc2) kinase activation and apoptosis in Taxol-treated human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-435, SKBr3, MDA-MB-453, and 435.eB, which is an ErbB2 transfectant of MDA-MB-435. Herceptin treatment down-regulated ErbB2, reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr-15, and down-regulated the expression of p21(Cip1), a Cdc2 inhibitor. Herceptin plus Taxol treatment led to higher levels of p34(Cdc2) kinase activity and apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, which is likely attributable to inhibition of Cdc2-Tyr-15 phosphorylation and p21(Cip1) expression. Because significant dephosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr-15 and down-regulation of p21(Cip1) occur at least 24 h after Herceptin treatment, we investigated whether 24 h Herceptin pretreatment will render ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells more sensitive to Taxol-induced apoptosis compared with the simultaneous treatment of Herceptin plus Taxol. Indeed, Herceptin pretreatment increased Taxol-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in vitro and more effectively inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts with enhanced in vivo apoptosis. Thus, Herceptin treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing cells can inhibit ErbB2-mediated Cdc2-Tyr-15 phosphorylation and p21(Cip1) up-regulation, which allows effective p34(Cdc2) activation and induction of apoptosis upon Taxol treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"The ErbB family is well known for its significance in oncogenesis. As bad prognostic markers, overexpressed or mutated ErbB1 and ErbB2 have an important role in the molecular diagnosis of various cancers, but as membrane proteins, expressed often selectively in tumor tissues, they can be targeted with kinase inhibitors or therapeutic antibodies. In addition to trastuzumab, the first humanized antibody that was approved for the therapy of solid tumors by the FDA, now many humanized antibodies are in late clinical trials, or already approved. Conjugation of antibodies with radioactive isotopes, cytotoxic agents or liposomes loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs led to improved therapeutic efficiency over their parent \"unarmed\" antibodies. Novel, engineered antibody derivates with better pharmacodynamic properties are also available and allow the targeting of ErbB1 or ErbB2 positive cancers in a wider patient population. In this review, we discuss the biological and clinical background of ErbB targeting, and describe the most successful antibodies against ErbB1 (cetuximab, panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, ICR62, mAb 528, ch806 and MDX-447) and ErbB2 (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, MDX-H210, 2B1, C6.5xscFv(NM3E2), ertumaxomab and FRP-5 derivates) that are in clinical trials or already approved, along with the various relevant conjugation and engineering strategies. Recent data pertinent to the prevalent problem of clinical resistance to treatment with trastuzumab are also discussed.",

TCGA provides 'Level 3' data, which have been processed using a pipeline specific to that resource. However, we have found using experimentally derived data that this pipeline produces gene-expression values that vary considerably across biological replicates. In addition, some RNA-Sequencing analysis tools require integer-based read counts, which are not provided with the Level 3 data. As an alternative, we have reprocessed the data for 9264 tumor and 741 normal samples across 24 cancer types using the Rsubread package. We have also collated corresponding clinical data for these samples. We provide these data as a community resource.;We compared TCGA samples processed using either pipeline and found that the Rsubread pipeline produced fewer zero-expression genes and more consistent expression levels across replicate samples than the TCGA pipeline. Additionally, we used a genomic-signature approach to estimate HER2 (ERBB2) activation status for 662 breast-tumor samples and found that the Rsubread data resulted in stronger predictions of HER2 pathway activity. Finally, we used data from both pipelines to classify 575 lung cancer samples based on histological type. This analysis identified various non-coding RNA that may influence lung-cancer histology.;The RNA-Sequencing and clinical data can be downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE62944).

Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2alpha inhibits global protein synthesis and activates a stress signaling and growth suppressive program. We have shown that forced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha can suppress head and neck, colorectal carcinoma and multiple myeloma tumor growth and/or survival. Here we explore whether ErbB2 modulates eIF2alpha phosphorylation and whether forced phosphorylation of the latter can antagonize ErbB2 deregulation of mammary acinar morphogenesis.;We tested whether ErbB2 signaling influenced eIF2alpha signaling and whether enhanced phosphorylation of the latter affected ErbB2-deregulated mammary acinar development. We obtained stable MCF10A cells overexpressing wild-type (Wt) Neu/ErbB2 or a constitutively active (CA) variant via retroviral delivery or mammary tumor cells from MMTV-Neu tumors. Western blotting, RT-PCR and confocal microscopy were used to analyze the effects of ErbB2 activation on eIF2alpha signaling and the effect of the GADD34-PP1C inhibitor salubrinal. Wt- and MMTV-Neu cells formed aberrant acini structures resembling DCIS, while CA-ErbB2 overexpression induced invasive lesions. In these structures we found that CA-ErbB2 but not the Wt variant significantly down-regulated the pro-apoptotic gene CHOP. This occurred without apparent modulation of basal phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2alpha or induction of its downstream target ATF4. However, inhibition of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation with salubrinal was sufficient to inhibit Wt- and CA-ErbB2- as well as MMTV-Neu-induced deregulation of acinar growth. This was linked to enhanced CHOP expression, inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and luminal clearing in Wt-ErbB2 and to inhibition of cyclin D1 levels and subsequent proliferation in CA-ErbB2 cells.;Depending on the strength of ErbB2 signaling there is a differential regulation of CHOP and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. ErbB2 uncouples in basal conditions eIF2alpha phosphorylation from CHOP induction. However, this signal was restored by salubrinal treatment in Wt-ErbB2 expressing MCF10A cells as these DCIS-like structures underwent luminal clearing. In CA-ErbB2 structures apoptosis is not induced by salubrinal and instead a state of quiescence with reduced proliferation was achieved. Treatments that stabilize P-eIF2alpha levels may be effective in treating ErbB2 positive cancers without severely disrupting normal tissue function and structure.",

Research has now further differentiated breast cancer into subtypes based on genetic expression patterns. One of these subtypes, basal-like, frequently overlaps with the clinical picture of TNBC.

The enhanced ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling causes tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis. We found here that the ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling is regulated by immunoglobulin-like Necl-2, which is down-regulated in various cancer cells and serves as a tumor suppressor. The extracellular region of ErbB3, but not ErbB2, interacted in cis with that of Necl-2. This interaction reduced the ligand-induced, ErbB2-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and inhibited the consequent ErbB3-mediated activation of Rac and Akt, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell movement and survival. These inhibitory effects of Necl-2 were mediated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13 which interacted with the cytoplasmic tail of Necl-2.

Here, we demonstrate that mir-4728 is a negative regulator of MAPK signaling through directly targeting the ERK upstream kinase MST4 and exerts numerous tumor-suppressive properties in vitro and in animal models. Importantly, our patient sample study shows that mir-4728 was under-expressed in breast tumors compared with normal tissue, and loss of mir-4728 correlated with worse overall patient survival. These results strongly suggest that mir-4728 is a tumor-suppressive miRNA that controls MAPK signaling through targeting MST4, revealing mir-4728's significance as a potential prognostic factor and target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Moreover, this study represents a conceptual advance by providing strong evidence that a tumor-suppressive miRNA can antagonize the canonical signaling of its host oncogene. ",

Previous studies involving European and United States patients have shown that breast tumors can be divided by their gene expression profiles into distinct \"molecular subtypes.\" In this report, we surveyed a series of invasive and preinvasive breast tumors from Asian-Chinese patients to investigate whether similar subtypes could also be observed in this ethnic group.;An analysis of expression profiles generated from 11 nonmalignant breast tissues, 17 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and 98 invasive carcinomas identified three broad molecular subtypes of breast [estrogen receptor (ER)+, ERBB2+ and ER-] in the Asian-Chinese population. These subtypes were highly similar to the \"Luminal,\" \"ERBB2+,\" and \"Basal\" molecular subtypes defined in previous studies, and the subtype-specific expression signatures were also observed in preinvasive DCIS tumors. By comparing the expression profiles of nonmalignant DCIS and invasive breast cancers for two subtypes (ER+ and ERBB2+), we identified several genes that were regulated in both a common and subtype-specific manner during the normal/DCIS and DCIS/invasive carcinoma transitions. Several of these genes were validated by comparison with another recently published similar, but not identical, study.;Our results suggest that molecularly similar subtypes of breast cancer are indeed broadly conserved between Asian and Caucasian patients, and that these subtypes are already present at the preinvasive stage of carcinogenesis.

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression. Combination of honokiol with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin presented synergistic effects on induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, could serve as a new, promising approach for breast cancer treatment.",

Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody directed against an epitope on subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of HER2 is used for therapy of HER2-overexpressing mammary tumors. However, many tumors are either natively resistant or acquire resistance against Trastuzumab. Antibodies directed to different epitopes on the extracellular domain of HER2 are promising candidates for replacement or combinatorial therapy. For example, Pertuzumab that binds to subdomain II of HER2 extracellular domain and inhibits receptor dimerization is under clinical trial. Alternative antibodies directed to novel HER2 epitopes may serve as additional tools for breast cancer therapy. Our aim was to generate novel anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells, either alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).;Mice were immunized against SK-BR-3 cells and recombinant HER2 extracellular domain protein to produce monoclonal antibodies. Anti-HER2 antibodies were characterized with breast cancer cell lines using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, western blot techniques. Antibody epitopes were localized using plasmids encoding recombinant HER2 protein variants. Antibodies, either alone or in combination with TNF-α, were tested for their effects on breast cancer cell proliferation.;We produced five new anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, all directed against conformational epitope or epitopes restricted to the native form of the extracellular domain. When tested alone, some antibodies inhibited modestly but significantly the growth of SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-361 cells displaying ERBB2 amplification. They had no detectable effect on MCF-7 and T47D cells lacking ERBB2 amplification. When tested in combination with TNF-α, antibodies acted synergistically on SK-BR-3 cells, but antagonistically on BT-474 cells. A representative anti-HER2 antibody inhibited Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation leading to cyclin D1 accumulation and growth arrest in SK-BR-3 cells, independently from TNF-α.;Novel antibodies against extracellular domain of HER2 may serve as potent anti-cancer bioactive molecules. Cell-dependent synergy and antagonism between anti-HER2 antibodies and TNF-α provide evidence for a complex interplay between HER2 and TNF-α signaling pathways.

Our previous studies have shown that Muc4 interacts with and potentiates signaling by the ErbB2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase through an epidermal growth factor-like domain in its extracellular region. Here, we show that expression of Muc4 in human A375 melanoma cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells confers resistance to apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents, the absence of serum factors, and the loss of cellular adhesion. Mapping experiments revealed that the O-glycosylation and cytosolic domains of Muc4 are dispensable for its antiapoptotic activity, and are also dispensable for the potentiation of signaling by ErbB2. Knockdown of endogenous Muc4 in JIMT-1 breast cancer cells sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli, and this can be rescued by Muc4 forms lacking the O-glycosylation or cytosolic domains. Surprisingly, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Muc4 antiapoptotic activity vary among cell lines. Although Muc4 in JIMT-1 cells engages ErbB2 to promote cell survival, its antiapoptotic mechanism in MCF7 and A375 cells seems to be independent of ErbB2. However, Muc4 expression in all cell lines culminates in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic protein Bad and the elevation of the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL. Our observations suggest that tumor cells can exploit the versatile antiapoptotic activities of Muc4 to acquire resistance to therapeutic agents, and augment cell survival after the loss of adhesion and microenvironment-derived survival factors.",

We previously reported that five breast cancer cell lines have chromosome translocations that break in the NRG1 gene and that could cause abnormal NRG1 expression. NRG1 encodes the Neuregulins 1 (formerly the Heregulins), ligands for members of the ErbB/epidermal growth factor-receptor family, which includes ErbB2/HER2. We have now screened for breaks at NRG1 in paraffin sections of breast tumors. Tissue microarrays were screened by fluorescence in situ hybridization, with hybridization probes proximal and distal to the expected breakpoints. This screen detects breaks but does not distinguish between translocation or deletion breakpoints. The screen was validated with array-comparative genomic hybridization on a custom 8p12 high-density genomic array to detect a lower copy number of the sequences that were lost distal to the breaks. We also precisely mapped the breaks in five tumors with different hybridization probes. Breaks in NRG1 were detected in 6% (19 of 323) of breast cancers and in some lung and ovarian cancers. In an unselected series of 213 cases with follow-up, breast cancers where the break was detected tended to be high-grade (65% grade III compared with 28% of negative cases). They were, like breast tumors in general, mainly ErbB2 low (11 of 13 were low) and estrogen receptor positive (11 of 13 positive).",

These receptor complexes are formed in a cell-specific manner and can mediate distinctive signalling cascades, sometimes leading to divergent functional outcomes. This is particularly intriguing in cancer, since the same semaphorin has been found to mediate either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing functions, depending on the cancer type and cellular context.

The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of statins on breast cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo, and to begin to determine their mechanism of action. We evaluated the effects of statins on breast cancer cell growth, phosphoprotein signaling intermediates, survival/apoptosis regulators, cell cycle regulators, and activated transcription factors. We also examined the in vivo effect of statin administration in a mouse ErbB2(+) breast cancer model. Only lipophilic statins had direct anticancer activity in vitro. Breast cancer cells with activated Ras or ErbB2 pathways seemed to be more sensitive than those overexpressing estrogen receptor, and this correlated with endogenous levels of activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Key intermediates regulating cell survival by NF-kappaB activation, as well as cell proliferation by the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade, were among the earliest phosphoproteins influenced by statin treatment. These early effects were followed by declines in activator protein-1 and NF-kappaB activation and concordant changes in other mediators of proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo results showed that oral dosing of statins significantly inhibited the growth of a mouse mammary carcinoma. Lipophilic statins can exert direct anticancer activity in vitro by reducing proliferation and survival signals in susceptible breast cancer phenotypes. Tumor growth inhibition in vivo using a clinically relevant statin dose also seems to be associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and survival. These findings provide supporting rationale for future statin trials in breast cancer patients.",

Development of the CPS+EG staging system predated routine administration of trastuzumab in patients with ERBB2-positive disease (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu).;To validate the CPS+EG staging system using the new definition of ER positivity (≥1%) and to develop an updated staging system (Neo-Bioscore) that incorporates ERBB2 status into the previously developed CPS+EG.;Retrospective review of data collected prospectively from January 2005 through December 2012 on patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.;Prognostic scores were computed using 2 versions of the CPS+EG staging system, one with ER considered positive if it measured 10% or higher, the other with ER considered positive if it measured 1% or higher. Fits of the Cox proportional hazards model for the 2 sets of prognostic scores were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Status of ERBB2 was added to the model, and the likelihood ratio test was used to determine improvement in fit.;A total of 2377 patients were included; all were women (median age, 50 years [range, 21-87 years]); ER status was less than 1% in 28.9%, 1% to 9% in 8.3%, and 10% or higher in 62.8%; 591 patients were ERBB2 positive. Median follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.5-11.7 years). Five-year disease-specific survival was 89% (95% CI, 87%-90%). Using 1% or higher as the cutoff for ER positivity, 5-year disease-specific survival estimates determined using the CPS+EG stage ranged from 52% to 98%, thereby validating our previous finding that the CPS+EG score facilitates more refined categorization into prognostic subgroups than clinical or final pathologic stage alone. The AIC value for this model was 3333.06, while for a model using 10% or higher as the cutoff for ER positivity, it was 3333.38, indicating that the model fits were nearly identical. The improvement in fit of the model when ERBB2 status was added was highly significant, with 5-year disease-specific survival estimates ranging from 48% to 99% (P < .001). Incorporating ERBB2 into the staging system defined the Neo-Bioscore, which provided improved stratification of patients with respect to prognosis.;The Neo-Bioscore improves our previously validated staging system and allows its application in ERBB2-positive patients.

Despite the importance of the EphA2/ErbB2 complex in promoting breast tumorigenesis, the mechanism by which these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains poorly understood. Here we report that the PTB adaptor Anks1a is specifically localized to the ER on its own serine phosphorylation. Once there, Anks1a acts as an important regulator of COPII-mediated EphA2 ER export. The Anks1a ankyrin repeat domain binds EphA2 and causes it to accumulate at sites of ER exit. Simultaneously, the Anks1a PTB domain binds Sec23. This induces internalization of EphA2 via COPII vesicles, while Anks1a remains behind on the ER membrane. EphA2 also binds ErbB2 in the ER and seems to load ErbB2 into growing COPII carriers. Together, our study reveals a novel mechanism that regulates the loading of RTKs into COPII vesicles. ",

Aberrant expression or activity of EGFR and HER2 have been strongly linked to the etiology of several human epithelial cancers including but not limited to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer. With this, intense efforts have been made to inhibit the activity of the EGFR and HER2 by designing antibodies against the ligand binding domains (cetuximab, panitumumab and trastuzumab) or small molecules against the tyrosine kinase domains (erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib). Both approaches have shown considerable clinical promise. However, increasing evidence suggests that the majority of patients do not respond to these therapies, and those who show initial response ultimately become refractory to treatment. While mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been extensively studied, resistance to monoclonal antibodies is less well understood, both in the laboratory and in the clinical setting.

These biomarkers were profiled to assess gene copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 32 PDGCX models retained the histological features of the corresponding human tumors. Furthermore, among the 32 models, 78% (25/32) highly expressed ERBB1 (EGFR), 22% (7/32) were ERBB2 (HER2) positive, 78% (25/32) showed ERBB3 (HER3) high expression, 66% (21/32) lost PTEN expression, 3% (1/32) harbored FGFR2 amplification, 41% (13/32) were positive for MET expression and 16% (5/32) were MET gene amplified. Between the PDGCX models and their parental tumors, a high degree of similarity was observed for FGFR2 and MET gene amplification, and also for ERBB2 status (agreement rate = 94~100%; kappa value = 0.81~1). Protein expression of PTEN and MET also showed moderate agreement (agreement rate = 78%; kappa value = 0.46~0.56), while ERBB1 and ERBB3 expression showed slight agreement (agreement rate = 59~75%; kappa value = 0.18~0.19). ERBB2 positivity, FGFR2 or MET gene amplification was all maintained until passage 12 in mice. The stability of the molecular profiles observed across subsequent passages within the individual models provides confidence in the utility and translational significance of these models for in vivo testing of personalized therapies.

An issue is the optimal tissue source (primary tumor or metastasis) for testing. We compared the DNA copy number and mutational profiles of primary breast cancers and paired metastases from 23 patients using whole-genome array-comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing of 365 \"cancer-associated\" genes. Primary tumors and metastases harbored copy number alterations (CNAs) and mutations common in breast cancer and showed concordant profiles. The global concordance regarding CNAs was shown by clustering and correlation matrix, which showed that each metastasis correlated more strongly with its paired tumor than with other samples. Genes with recurrent amplifications in breast cancer showed 100% (ERBB2, FGFR1), 96% (CCND1), and 88% (MYC) concordance for the amplified/non-amplified status. Among all samples, 499 mutations were identified, including 39 recurrent (AKT1, ERBB2, PIK3CA, TP53) and 460 non-recurrent variants. The tumors/metastases concordance of variants was 75%, higher for recurrent (92%) than for non-recurrent (73%) variants. Further mutational discordance came from very different variant allele frequencies for some variants. We showed that the chosen targeted therapy in two clinical trials of personalized medicine would be concordant in all but one patient (96%) when based on the molecular profiling of tumor and paired metastasis. Our results suggest that the genotyping of primary tumor may be acceptable to guide systemic treatment if the metastatic sample is not obtainable. However, given the rare but potentially relevant divergences for some actionable driver genes, the profiling of metastatic sample is recommended. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although very few studies have addressed the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of biliary tract cancer (BTC), several lines of evidence suggest a role for the erbB receptor family. Overexpression and activation of erbB2 has been reported in a significant percentage of human BTC. Further, we previously reported that overexpression of erbB2 basal epithelial cells of the biliary tract (BK5.erbB2 mouse) led to the development of BTC. However, the mechanisms by which erbB2 overexpression led to the spontaneous development of tumors specifically in the biliary tract are not completely understood. The goals of the current study were to (1) determine whether a cooperative relationship between bile acid exposure and erbB2 activation exists during biliary tract carcinogenesis and (2) to characterize the mechanism(s) underlying bile acid-mediated biliary tract carcinogenesis in cells with activated erbB2. In this study, we demonstrated that the secondary conjugated bile acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDC), increased proliferation of primary cultured gallbladder epithelial cells from BK5.erbB2 mice and human BTC cells. TCDC treatment activated EGFR/erbB2 and downstream signaling molecules in both primary cultured cells and human BTC cells. TCDC also increased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and TACE activity in human BTC cells. Inhibition of src activation led to attenuation of bile-induced upregulation of TACE activity as well as signaling through the EGFR/erbB2, suggesting that during the development of BTC erbB2 overexpression/activation accelerates the bile acid-induced signaling cascade: bile acid → src → TACE → EGFR/erbB2 → downstream signaling. We also provide direct evidence that bile acids possess tumor promoting capacity in epithelial cells overexpressing erbB2 using the two-stage skin carcinogenesis model. Collectively these findings suggest cooperative roles for bile acid and erbB2 activation in epithelial cell proliferation; bile acid appears to accelerate erbB2-induced pro-tumorigenic activities in the biliary tract and skin.",

In this study, chromosome alterations that are associated with ERBB2 amplification were defined by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Additionally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to validate gene amplification, and protein expression was detected immunohistochemically. ERBB2-amplified tumors as detected by FISH, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or CGH had twice as many CGH-defined chromosomal alterations (means of 11.8, 11.0, and 12.7, respectively) as the nonamplified tumors (means of 6.8, 7.0, and 5.6, respectively). ERBB2 positivity correlated with the total number of genetic events. A wide spectrum of copy number gains and losses was seen by CGH in all of the tumors. An increased number of losses of 18q and gains of 20q was found in ERBB2-positive tumors. Other common aberrations for all of the tumors were copy number gains of 1q (58%), 8q (52%), 20q (30%), and losses of 18q (39%), 13q (39%), and 3p (33%). A high degree of concordance was observed among the three methods in 33 primary breast cancers. The concurrence for ERBB2 detection between FISH and IHC was 90%, between FISH and CGH was 82%, and between IHC and CGH was 84%. This study shows that breast tumors showing erbB2 overexpression or gene amplification are genetically distinct from erbB2-negative tumors.

The development of targeted therapies to block the survival of erbB2-positive cancer cells revealed that impaired NRG1 signaling through erbB2/erbB4 heterodimers combined with anthracycline chemotherapy may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy in a subpopulation of treated patients. The ventricular-specific deletion of either erbb2 or erbb4 manifested dilated cardiomyopathy, which is aggravated by the administration of doxorubicin. Based on the exacerbated toxicity displayed by the combined treatment, it is expected that the relevant pathways would be affected in a synergistic manner. This review examines the NRG1 activities that were monitored in different model systems, focusing on the emerging pathways and molecular targets, which may aid in understanding the acquired dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs under the conditions of NRG1-deficient signaling.

This provided support for analogous efforts for drugs that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the development of these drugs, such as cetuximab (Erbitux; Bristol-Myers Squibb/Lilly) and gefitinib (Iressa; AstraZeneca), has revealed that EGFR expression is an insufficient and unreliable biomarker to select patients for EGFR-targeted therapies in both lung and colon cancer. Indeed, evidence on patient populations that are likely to respond to such therapies, on the basis of specific mutations in proteins of the targeted pathway, has only recently been clinically validated and incorporated into some of the drug labels.

Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and found that overexpression of p185ErbB2 inhibits Taxol-induced apoptosis. Taxol activates p34Cdc2 kinase in MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and, subsequently, apoptosis. A chemical inhibitor of p34Cdc2 and a dominant-negative mutant of p34Cdc2 blocked Taxol-induced apoptosis in these cells. Overexpression of p185ErbB2 in MDA-MB-435 cells by transfection transcriptionally upregulates p21Cip1, which associates with p34Cdc2, inhibits Taxol-mediated p34Cdc2 activation, delays cell entrance to G2/M phase, and thereby inhibits Taxol-induced apoptosis. In p21Cip1 antisense-transfected MDA-MB-435 cells or in p21-/- MEF cells, p185ErbB2 was unable to inhibit Taxol-induced apoptosis.

Considerable interest has developed in searching for novel FASN inhibitors as therapeutic agents in treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Amentoflavone was found to be effective in suppressing FASN expression in HER2-positive SKBR3 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of FASN by amentoflavone specifically down-regulated HER2 protein and mRNA, and caused an up-regulation of PEA3, a transcriptional repressor of HER2. In addition, pharmacological blockade of FASN by amentoflavone preferentially decreased cell viability and induced cell death in SKBR3 cells. Palmitate reduced the cytotoxic effect of amentoflavone, as the percentage of viable cells was increased after the addition of exogenous palmitate. Amentoflavone-induced FASN inhibition inhibited the translocation of SREBP-1 in SKBR3 cells. Amentoflavone inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and JNK. The use of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that the modulation of AKT, mTOR, and JNK phosphorylation required synergistic amentoflavone-induced FASN inhibition and HER2 activation in SKBR3 cells. These results suggest that amentoflavone modulated FASN expression by regulation of HER2-pathways, and induced cell death to enhance chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic activity in HER2-positive breast cancers.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that primarily repress target mRNAs. Here, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 were selected as representative cardio-miRs that are upregulated in human heart failure. To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B, BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and TP53 are representative miR-125b targets. ACVR2A, BCL2, CCND1, E2F3, GLUT3, MYB, RAF1, VEGF, WEE1, and WNT7A are representative miR-195 targets. BCL2L2, ß-catenin, BIM, CADM1, EZH2, FGFR1, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, and TWIST1 are representative miR-214 targets. miR-125b is a good cardio-miR that protects cardiomyocytes; miR-195 is a bad cardio-miR that elicits cardiomyopathy and heart failure; miR-24 and miR-214 are bi-functional cardio-miRs. By contrast, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 function as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs in a cancer (sub)type-dependent manner. Circulating miR-24 is elevated in diabetes, breast cancer and lung cancer. Circulating miR-195 is elevated in acute myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal adenoma. Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.

One of the common pathological features of many primary ovarian cancers is the amplification/overexpression of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, HER-2 (also known as neu or ErbB2) gene (1). Although there are some discrepancies in the literature (2), HER-2 overexpression in cancer cells correlates well with a greater resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in certain experimental systems (3).

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in cancer has been implicated in growth suppression of early lesions and enhancing tumor cell invasion and metastasis. However, the cellular mechanisms that determine this signaling output in individual tumors are still largely unknown. In endothelial cells, TGF-β signaling is modulated by the TGF-β co-receptor endoglin (CD105). Here we demonstrate that endoglin is expressed in a subset of invasive breast cancers and cell lines and is subject to epigenetic silencing by gene methylation. Endoglin downregulation in non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast cells leads to the formation of abnormal acini in 3D culture, but does not promote cell migration or transformation. In contrast, in the presence of activated ErbB2, endoglin downregulation in MCF10A cells leads to enhanced invasion into a 3D matrix. Consistent with these data, ectopic expression of endoglin in MDA-MB-231 cells blocks TGF-β-enhanced cell motility and invasion and reduces lung colonization in an in vivo metastasis model. Unlike endothelial cells, endoglin does not modulate Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling in breast cells but attenuates the cytoskeletal remodeling to impair cell migration and invasion. Importantly, in a large cohort of invasive breast cancers, lack of endoglin expression in the tumor cell compartment correlates with ENG gene methylation and poor clinical outcome.",

Chemotherapeutic drugs that selectively target cancer-promoting pathways may complement conventional therapeutic approaches. We performed immunohistochemistry (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and CD117), EGFR and ERBB2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and multiplexed SNaPshot® genotyping (testing for recurrent mutations in 15 cancer genes including BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53) on primary tumors and corresponding metastases of 14 metastasizing adnexal carcinomas (three apocrine, six eccrine, two hidradenocarcinomas, two porocarcinomas, and one aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma). Metastasis to regional lymph node was most common, followed by skin and then lungs. Follow-up was available in 12 patients (5 months to 8 years) with 1 died of widespread metastases. Although EGFR overexpression was a prevalent feature in this cohort, seen in 7/11 (64%) primary tumors and 10/14 (71%) metastases; FISH for EGFR gene amplification was negative in 9 tested primary tumors and 12 metastases. FISH of the one primary tumor and three metastases with 2+ HER2 overexpression revealed a low level of ERBB2 gene amplification in one apocrine carcinoma and corresponding metastasis. CD117 expression was seen only in rare cases. PIK3CA (2/12, 17%) and TP53 (3/12, 25%) mutations were detected in two (one hidradenocarcinoma, one porocarcinoma) and three (one eccrine, one hidradenocarcinoma, and one aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma) cases, respectively. The role of EGFR inhibitor therapy in metastasizing adnexal carcinomas with protein overexpression remains unclear. Targeted therapy including PI3K pathway inhibitors might be a potential treatment for rare cases of adnexal carcinomas with metastases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is a genetically and phenotypically complex disease. To understand the role of miRNAs in this molecular complexity, we performed miRNA expression analysis in a cohort of molecularly well-characterized human breast cancer cell lines to identify miRNAs associated with the most common molecular subtypes and the most frequent genetic aberrations.;Using a microarray carrying LNA™ modified oligonucleotide capture probes), expression levels of 725 human miRNAs were measured in 51 breast cancer cell lines. Differential miRNA expression was explored by unsupervised cluster analysis and was then associated with the molecular subtypes and genetic aberrations commonly present in breast cancer.;Unsupervised cluster analysis using the most variably expressed miRNAs divided the 51 breast cancer cell lines into a major and a minor cluster predominantly mirroring the luminal and basal intrinsic subdivision of breast cancer cell lines. One hundred and thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between these two main clusters. Forty miRNAs were differentially expressed between basal-like and normal-like/claudin-low cell lines. Within the luminal-group, 39 miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression and 24 with E-cadherin gene mutations, which are frequent in this subtype of breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, 31 miRNAs were associated with E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation, which, contrary to E-cadherin mutation, is exclusively observed in breast cancer cell lines that are not of luminal origin. Thirty miRNAs were associated with p16INK4 status while only a few miRNAs were associated with BRCA1, PIK3CA/PTEN and TP53 mutation status. Twelve miRNAs were associated with DNA copy number variation of the respective locus.;Luminal-basal and epithelial-mesenchymal associated miRNAs determine the subdivision of miRNA transcriptome of breast cancer cell lines. Specific sets of miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression, p16INK4a or E-cadherin mutation or E-cadherin methylation status, which implies that these miRNAs may contribute to the driver role of these genetic aberrations. Additionally, miRNAs, which are located in a genomic region showing recurrent genetic aberrations, may themselves play a driver role in breast carcinogenesis or contribute to a driver gene in their vicinity. In short, our study provides detailed molecular miRNA portraits of breast cancer cell lines, which can be exploited for functional studies of clinically important miRNAs.",

The burden is increasing in low-income and middle-income countries (LMCs) and threatens the public health of such societies. Introduction of expensive monoclonal antibodies to cancer treatment regimens poses a real challenge in the health systems of LMCs. Despite controversy of cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in breast cancer, some studies indicate gain of patients from this drug. The present study aimed to propose a priority setting model for administration of anti-angiogenic agents in breast cancer via assessment of tumor angiogenesis by the microvessel density (MVD) method and associations with clinicopathological characteristics (including simultaneous mutations of TP53 and HER-2 genes).;Age, axillary lymph nodes status, tumor size, stage and grade, estrogen and progesterone receptors status, HER-2/neu status (by immunohistochemistry and FISH test), TP53 mutation, Ki-67 (for proliferation assay) and CD34 (for angiogenesis assay) were assessed in 111 breast cancer patients. The molecular subtype of each tumor was also determined and correlations of simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes with angiogenesis and other clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated.;There were significant associations between simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes and all other parameters except tumor size. The degree of angiogenesis in the ERBB2 subtype was greater than the others. Younger patients showed a higher angiogenesis rate rather those older than 50 years.;Our results demonstrated that patients with simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes, those with ERBB2 molecular subtype and also younger women (often triple negative) seem more eligible for obtaining anti-angiogenic agents. These results suggest a model for priority setting of patients with breast cancer for treatment with anti-angiogenic drugs in LMCs.",

The TG.NK transgenic mouse line on FVB strain background expresses the c-neu oncogene under the control of a MMTV promoter in mammary tissue and appears to be a useful animal model for evaluation of strategies to delay or prevent mammary cancer. Fiber-rich nonpurified diet (NTP-2000) and some retinoid analogues have delayed mammary cancer in the TG.NK model. Four week old hemizygous TG.NK female mice with MMTV/c-neu (erbB2) activated oncogene were fed NTP-2000 diet containing the retinoid analogue 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR) at 7 mmol/kg or the arotinoid Ro 40-8757 at 1.5 and 2.5 mmol/kg for 26 weeks. The 4-HPR at 7 mmol/kg diet delayed the development of palpable tumors up to 24 weeks, but by 26 weeks, the incidence markedly increased and was closer to the NTP-2000 diet control group. However, the 4-HPR diet markedly decreased the average weight of the tumors at 26 weeks with no decrease in multiplicity. The 4-HPR also caused significant increase in liver weights without an effect on body weight. Arotinoid Ro 40-8757 caused marked decrease in the number and branching of mammary ducts, and inhibited mammary tumor development with significant decrease in the incidence, multiplicity, and tumor weights compared to the NTP-2000 diet control. Arotinoid also caused a significant dose-related increase in liver weights without a significant effect on body weights. At the doses tested, the arotinoid but not 4-HPR decreased the circulating levels of IGF-1. However, there was no association between the IGF-1 levels and the size, incidence, or absence of tumors when evaluated for any treatment group or for all mice in the study irrespective of treatment. The oncogene erbB2 (c-neu) and the growth factor EGF expression were more prominent in the small tumors of the mice treated with arotinoid than in the larger tumors of the control group. PCNA staining was observed in areas where there was high erbB2 and EGF staining. The delay in onset of mammary tumors by the above retinoid analogues may be related to the delay in development of mammary glands.",

Until now and regarding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material (FFPE), this has been a task mostly accomplished by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However the discrepancy rates of IHC for the four breast cancer biomarkers are frequently under debate, especially for Ki-67 which carries the highest degree of inter- and even intra-observer variability. Herein we describe a series of studies in FFPE specimens which aim to fully validate the analytical performance of the MammaTyper assay, including the site to site reproducibility of the individual marker measurements.;Tumor RNA was extracted with the novel RNXtract RNA extraction kit. Synthetic RNA was used to assess the sensitivity of the RNXtract kit. DNA and RNA specific qPCR assays were used so as to determine analyte specificity of RNXtract. For the assessment of limit of blank, limit of detection, analytical measurement range and PCR efficiency of the MammaTyper kit serial dilutions of samples were used. Analytical precision studies of MammaTyper were built around two different real time PCR platforms and involved breast tumor samples belonging to different subtypes analyzed across multiple sites and under various stipulated conditions. The MammaTyper assay robustness was tested against RNA input variations, alternative extraction methods and tumor cell content.;Individual assays were linear up to at least 32.33 and 33.56 Cqs (quantification cycles) for the two qPCR platforms tested. PCR efficiency ranged from 99 to 109 %. In qPCR platform 1, estimates for assay specific inter-site standard deviations (SD) were between 0.14 and 0.20 Cqs accompanied by >94 % concordant single marker assignments for all four markers. In platform 2, the inter-site SD estimates were between 0.40 and 0.66 Cqs while the concordance for single marker assignments was >94 % for all four markers. The agreement reached between the two qPCR systems located in one site was 100 % for ERBB2, 96.9 % for ESR1, 97.2 % for PGR and 98.6 % for MKI67. RT-qPCR for individual markers was stable up to a 64-fold dilution for a typical clinical sample. There was no change in assay performance detected at the level of individual markers or subtypes after using different RNA isolation methods. The presence of up to 80 % of surrounding non-tumor tissue including in situ carcinoma did not affect the assay output. Sixteen out of 20 RNXtract eluates yielded more than 50 ng/μl of RNA (average RNA output: 233 ng/μl), whereas DNA contamination per sample was restricted to less than 15 ng/μl. Median recovery rate of RNA extraction was 91.0 %.;In this study the performance characteristics of MammaTyper were successfully validated. The various sources of analytical perturbations resulted in negligible variations in individual marker assessments. Therefore, MammaTyper may serve as a technical improvement to current standards for decentralized FFPE-based routine assessment of the commonly used breast cancer biomarkers and for molecular subtyping of breast cancer specimens.",

In the present study, to decipher the oncogenic potential of MUC4, we stably expressed the MUC4 mucin in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Stable ectopic expression of MUC4 resulted in increased growth, colony formation, and motility of NIH3T3 cells in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice when cells were injected s.c. Microarray analysis showed increased expression of several growth-associated and mitochondrial energy production-associated genes in MUC4-expressing NIH3T3 cells. In addition, expression of MUC4 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in enhanced levels of oncoprotein ErbB2 and its phosphorylated form (pY(1248)-ErbB2).

The ErbBs are involved in the interaction between cells and cell-matrix adhesion molecules and have proven critical in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial cell environment. Deregulation of these tyrosine receptors has been associated with several human diseases. In particular, the expression or activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 is altered in many epithelial tumors. Epithelial (E)-cadherin is another major molecule expressed by epithelial cells. To create efficient cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin couples its cytoplasmic domain to catenins and the actin cytoskeleton. The loss of intercellular adhesion appears to be a fundamental aspect of the neoplastic phenomena. In addition, EGFR and ErbB2 signaling associated with the E-cadherin-catenin complex has been demonstrated in normal and cancer cells. This signaling is involved in regulating cell adhesion and the invasive growth of cancers.

Hence, it is still not fully settled whether the tumor suppressor function of KLF6 is directly associated with its ability to regulate target genes.;In this study we analyzed KLF6 expression and sub-cellular distribution by immunohistochemistry in several normal and tumor tissues in a microarray format representing fifteen human organs. Results indicate that while both nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of KLF6 is detected in normal breast tissues, breast carcinomas express KLF6 mainly detected in the cytoplasm. Expression of KLF6 was further analyzed in breast cancer tissues overexpressing ERBB2 oncoprotein, which is associated with poor disease prognosis and patient's survival. The analysis of 48 ductal carcinomas revealed a significant population expressing KLF6 predominantly in the nuclear compartment (X(2)p = 0.005; Fisher p = 0.003). Moreover, this expression pattern correlates directly with early stage and small ductal breast tumors and linked to metastatic events in lymph nodes.;Data are consistent with a preferential localization of KLF6 in the nuclear compartment of early stage and small HER2-ERBB2 overexpressing ductal breast tumor cells, also presenting lymph node metastatic events.

        "Doc_abstract":"Identifying markers that have the potential to predict tumor behavior is important in breast cancer because of the variability in clinical disease progression. Genetic alterations in tumors may appear as changes in total DNA content, individual chromosomes, single genes, or gene expression. Alteration in DNA content is an imprecise but accessible measurement of the genome. Diploid tumors have been associated with a better clinical outcome, and increased ploidy correlates with other indicators of poor prognosis. Concurrent analysis of DNA content with markers of genetic expression is feasible (e.g., myc oncogene) and may increase its prognostic power. Chromosomal studies could provide a more precise tool for localizing genetic damage, but there is little cytogenetic information about primary breast cancers, no convincing evidence has emerged to target locations in the karyotype that appear specifically altered, and many primary and cultured breast cancers contain cells that appear chromosomally normal. Attempts to define molecular markers have used probes of different chromosomal sites, some chosen because of logical associations with hormonal activity, known oncogenes, or tumor-suppressor genes, and some by chance. Currently, to the authors' knowledge, none has shown uniform changes by mutation, loss, or overexpression in all breast cancers, although a remarkable number of loci are altered to some extent. These lesions must be associated with particular disease subsets or, retrospectively, with differential survival if they are to have prognostic value.;The authors examined several loci (ERBB2, INT2, MUC1) for gene amplification or loss of heterozygosity by Southern blotting and for gene expression by immunohistochemistry in breast tumors from patient groups selected by survival.;A retrospective series showed gene amplification at the erbB2 locus in 22% of rapidly recurrent (RR) tumors and 13% of tumors from long-term tumor-free survivors (LTS), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.18). The erbB2 product was displayed histochemically with equal frequency between those with RR tumors and LTS patients. Moreover, the correlation was poor between different analytic measures on the same tumors. This result was tested using a prospective study of erbB2 to correlate DNA analysis with western blot findings and frozen and fixed histochemical results. Another oncogene, int2, showed significant correlation between amplification and recurrence; 16% of RR tumors showing genetic amplification (P = 0.02).

Using the intrinsic set of approximately 500 genes derived in the Norway/Stanford breast cancer data, we validated the existence of five molecular subtypes--basal-like, ERBB2, luminal A/B and normal-like--and characterized these subtypes extensively with the use of conventional clinical variables.;We found an overall 77.5% concordance between the centroid prediction of the Swedish cohort by using the Norway/Stanford signature and the k-means clustering performed internally within the Swedish cohort. The highest rate of discordant assignments occurred between the luminal A and luminal B subtypes and between the luminal B and ERBB2 subtypes. The subtypes varied significantly in terms of grade (p < 0.001), p53 mutation (p < 0.001) and genomic instability (p = 0.01), but surprisingly there was little difference in lymph-node metastasis (p = 0.31). Furthermore, current users of hormone-replacement therapy were strikingly over-represented in the normal-like subgroup (p < 0.001). Separate analyses of the patients who received endocrine therapy and those who did not receive any adjuvant therapy supported the previous hypothesis that the basal-like subtype responded to adjuvant treatment, whereas the ERBB2 and luminal B subtypes were poor responders.;We found that the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer are broadly present in a diverse collection of patients from a population-based cohort in Sweden. The intrinsic gene set, originally selected to reveal stable tumor characteristics, was shown to have a strong correlation with progression-related properties such as grade, p53 mutation and genomic instability.",

They are known to repress the transcription of ERBB2 and many other oncogenes, but little is known about this mechanism. Using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to measure nascent transcription, we find that HDACI cause transcriptional repression by blocking RNA polymerase II elongation. Our data show that HDACI preferentially repress the transcription of highly expressed genes as well as high copy number genes in HER2+ breast cancer genomes. In contrast, genes that are activated by HDACI are moderately expressed. We analyzed gene copy number in combination with microarray and GRO-seq analysis of expression level, in normal and breast cancer cells to show that high copy number genes are more likely to be repressed by HDACI than non-amplified genes. The inhibition of transcription of amplified oncogenes, which promote survival and proliferation of cancer cells, might explain the cancer-specific lethality of HDACI, and may represent a general therapeutic strategy for cancer.",

Tumor specimens from patients from the United States and Chile were examined for expression of HER-2/neu, EGFR, and their activated forms (p-erbB2, p-EGFR).;Specimens from 77 gallbladder cancers (GBC), 16 extrahepatic bile duct cancers (EHBDC), 21 intrahepatic bile duct cancers (IHBDC), 11 cases of cholecystitis (CHOLE), and 8 normal gallbladders (NGB) were examined for HER-2/neu, p-erbB2, EGFR, and p-EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), with scores of 2+ or 3+ defined as positive. HER-2/neu gene amplification was analyzed by double color HER-2/neu gene/chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays;HER-2/neu-positive IHC staining was found in 31.2% of GBC, 31.3%, of EHBDC, and 33.3% of IHBDC; 12.5% of CHOLE specimens showed 2+ staining and the remaining CHOLE and NGB were negative.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activation of the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase stimulates breast cancer cell migration. Cell migration is a complex process that requires the synchronized reorganization of numerous subcellular structures including cell-to-matrix adhesions, the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules. How the multiple signaling pathways triggered by ErbB2 coordinate, in time and space, the various processes involved in cell motility, is poorly defined. We investigated the mechanism whereby ErbB2 controls microtubules and chemotaxis. We report that activation of ErbB2 increased both cell velocity and directed migration. Impairment of the Cdc42 and RhoA GTPases, but not of Rac1, prevented the chemotactic response. RhoA is a key component of the Memo/ACF7 pathway whereby ErbB2 controls microtubule capture at the leading edge. Upon Memo or ACF7 depletion, microtubules failed to reach the leading edge and cells lost their ability to follow the chemotactic gradient. Constitutive ACF7 targeting to the membrane in Memo-depleted cells reestablished directed migration. ErbB2-mediated activation of phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ) also contributed to cell guidance. We further showed that PLCγ signaling, via classical protein kinases C, and Memo signaling converged towards a single pathway controlling the microtubule capture complex. Finally, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway did not affect microtubule capture, but disturbed microtubule stability, which also resulted in defective chemotaxis. PI3K/Akt-dependent stabilization of microtubules involved repression of GSK3 activity on the one hand and inhibition of the microtubule destabilizing protein, Stathmin, on the other hand. Thus, ErbB2 triggers distinct and complementary pathways that tightly coordinate microtubule capture and microtubule stability to control chemotaxis.",

The humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody, Trastuzumab (Herceptin™; Genentech), with chemotherapy is the current standard of treatment. Novel agents and strategies continue to be explored, given the challenges posed by Trastuzumab-resistance development in most patients. The HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), which induces ErbB2 degradation and attenuates downstream oncogenic signaling, is one such agent that showed significant promise in early phase I and II clinical trials. Its low water solubility, potential toxicities and undesirable side effects observed in patients, partly due to the Cremophor-based formulation, have been discouraging factors in the advancement of this promising drug into clinical use. Encapsulation of 17-AAG into polymeric nanoparticle formulations, particularly in synergistic combination with conventional chemotherapeutics, represents an alternative approach to overcome these problems. Herein, we report an efficient co-encapsulation of 17-AAG and doxorubicin, a clinically well-established and effective modality in breast cancer treatment, into biodegradable and biocompatible polypeptide-based nanogels. Dual drug-loaded nanogels displayed potent cytotoxicity in a breast cancer cell panel and exerted selective synergistic anticancer activity against ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of ErbB2 degradation confirmed efficient 17-AAG release from nanogels with activity comparable to free 17-AAG. Furthermore, nanogels containing both 17-AAG and doxorubicin exhibited superior antitumor efficacy in vivo in an ErbB2-driven xenograft model compared to the combination of free drugs. These studies demonstrate that polypeptide-based nanogels can serve as novel nanocarriers for encapsulating 17-AAG along with other chemotherapeutics, providing an opportunity to overcome solubility issues and thereby exploit its full potential as an anti-cancer agent.",

Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib).

The cumulative LOD score obtained was -1.86 for D17S588 at theta = 0.001, indicating no linkage with BRCA1. Since the proportion of families linked to BRCA1 is larger in Western early-onset breast cancer families than in late-onset ones, we also summed the LOD scores of five early-onset families.

HJURP mRNA levels were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, age and Ki67 proliferation indices, but not with pathologic stage, ERBB2, tumor size, or lymph node status. Higher HJURP mRNA levels significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival. HJURP mRNA levels predicted the prognosis better than Ki67 proliferation indices. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression, including clinical variables as covariates, HJURP mRNA levels remained an independent prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival. In addition HJURP mRNA levels were an independent prognostic factor over molecular subtypes (normal like, luminal, Erbb2 and basal). Poor clinical outcomes among patients with high HJURP expression were validated in five additional breast cancer cohorts. Furthermore, the patients with high HJURP levels were much more sensitive to radiotherapy. In vitro studies in breast cancer cell lines showed that cells with high HJURP levels were more sensitive to radiation treatment and had a higher rate of apoptosis than those with low levels. Knock down of HJURP in human breast cancer cells using shRNA reduced the sensitivity to radiation treatment. HJURP mRNA levels were significantly correlated with CENPA mRNA levels.;HJURP mRNA level is a prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in patients with breast cancer and is a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to radiotherapy.",

Using a computational pathway-based approach, we interrogated clinical breast cancer genomic data sets for candidate non-oncogenic vulnerabilities in breast cancers that have genomic amplification of ERBB2, which encodes human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancers showed increased expression of genes encoding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ERAD led to irrecoverable ER stress and selectively killed HER2(+) breast cancer cells. Cell death caused by ERAD inhibition partially depended on increased HER2-mTOR signaling, which imposed an increased proteotoxic burden on the ER. Cell death in response to ER stress required the IRE1α-JNK pathway, which was selectively suppressed in HER2(+) breast cancers by phosphatases that inactivate JNK. Accordingly, the cytotoxicity of inhibiting ERAD as well as JNK phosphatases was synergistic in HER2(+) but not in HER2-negative breast cancer cells. Therefore, our study suggests that reactivation of oncogene-induced stress by targeting stress-adaptive pathways may be a beneficial approach for therapy-resistant breast cancers.",

The CAMK2N1 gene, cloned and characterized as an inhibitor of CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), has been shown to affect tumorigenesis and tumor growth. However, it is still unknown whether CAMK2N1 plays a role in prostate cancer development. We first examined the protein and mRNA levels of CAMK2N1 and observed a significant decrease in human prostate cancers comparing to normal prostate tissues. Re-expression of CAMK2N1 in prostate cancer cells reduced cellular proliferation, arrested cells in G0/G1 phases, and induced apoptotic cell death accompanied by down-regulation of IGF-1, ErbB2, and VEGF downstream kinases PI3K/AKT, as well as the MEK/ERK-mediated signaling pathways. Conversely, knockdown of CAMK2N1 had a significant opposite effects on these phenotypes. Our analyses suggest that CAMK2N1 plays a tumor suppressive role in prostate cancer cells. Reduced CAMK2N1 expression correlates to human prostate cancer progression and predicts poor clinical outcome, indicating that CAMK2N1 may serve as a biomarker.

        "Doc_abstract":"We now recognize that all breast cancers are not the same. Different characteristics in gene expression profiles result in differential clinical behavior. With the use of gene microarrays, different subtypes of breast cancer have been characterized. The basal subtype is characterized by high expression of keratins 5 and 17, laminin, and fatty acid-binding protein 7. The ERBB2+ subtype is characterized by high expression of genes in the ERBB2 amplicon. The luminal A subtype is characterized by the highest expression of the ER alpha gene. The luminal B and C subtypes have a lower expression of the ER cluster. The importance of these different subtypes lies in the fact that they differ in clinical outcome, with the basal and ERBB2+ subtypes having the worse prognosis and the luminal A group having the best prognosis. Different strategies for evaluating tumors in a clinical setting have been developed. Two such strategies are the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX; Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA), which is currently in commercial use in the United States, and the 70-gene assay, which has been developed by a group in the Netherlands. These assays have been shown to predict clinical outcome and response to therapy. However, to date these gene assays have not been studied in a prospective manner. Over the next year, prospective clinical trials will be initiated using these predictive tools in the treatment of breast cancer. In the near future, clinical decisions will most likely be dictated by the genetic characteristics of the tumor, with the clinical characteristics becoming less important. Tailoring our treatment based on individual tumor characteristics will help us develop better therapeutic strategies and save many patients from receiving unnecessary toxic therapy.",

These strategies include drugs directly conjugated to monoclonal antibodies through chemical linkers (Antibody-Drug Conjugates, ADCs) or those encapsulated within nanoparticles that in turn are conjugated to targeting antibodies (Antibody-Nanoparticle Conjugates, ANPs). The recent FDA approval of the ADC Trastuzumab-TDM1 (Kadcyla; Genentech; San Francisco) for the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patients has validated the strong potential of these strategies. Even though the activity of ANPs and ADCs is dependent on lysosomal traffic, the roles of the endocytic route traversed by the targeted receptor and of cancer cell-specific alterations in receptor dynamics on the efficiency of drug delivery have not been considered in these new targeted therapies. For example, constitutive association with the molecular chaperone HSP90 is thought to either retard ErbB2 endocytosis or to promote its recycling, traits undesirable for targeted therapy with ANPs and ADCs. HSP90 inhibitors are known to promote ErbB2 ubiquitination, targeting to lysosome and degradation. We therefore hypothesized that ErbB2-targeted drug delivery using Trastuzumab-conjugated nanoparticles could be significantly improved by HSP90 inhibitor-promoted lysosomal traffic of ErbB2. Studies reported here validate this hypothesis and demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, that HSP90 inhibition facilitates the intracellular delivery of Trastuzumab-conjugated ANPs carrying a model chemotherapeutic agent, Doxorubicin, specifically into ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, resulting in improved antitumor activity. These novel findings highlight the need to consider oncogene-specific alterations in receptor traffic in the design of targeted drug delivery strategies. We suggest that combination of agents that enhance receptor endocytosis and lysosomal routing can provide a novel strategy to significantly improve therapy with ANPs and ADCs.",

Gene coexpression modules of three key biological processes in breast cancer (namely, proliferation, estrogen receptor [ER], and HER2 signaling) were used to dissect the role of constituent genes of nine prognostic signatures.;Using a meta-analytical approach, we consolidated the signatures associated with ER signaling, ERBB2 amplification, and proliferation. Previously published expression-based nomenclature of breast cancer 'intrinsic' subtypes can be mapped to the three modules, namely, the ER-/HER2- (basal-like), the HER2+ (HER2-like), and the low- and high-proliferation ER+/HER2- subtypes (luminal A and B). We showed that all nine prognostic signatures exhibited a similar prognostic performance in the entire dataset. Their prognostic abilities are due mostly to the detection of proliferation activity. Although ER- status (basal-like) and ERBB2+ expression status correspond to bad outcome, they seem to act through elevated expression of proliferation genes and thus contain only indirect information about prognosis. Clinical variables measuring the extent of tumor progression, such as tumor size and nodal status, still add independent prognostic information to proliferation genes.;This meta-analysis unifies various results of previous gene expression studies in breast cancer. It reveals connections between traditional prognostic factors, expression-based subtyping, and prognostic signatures, highlighting the important role of proliferation in breast cancer prognosis.",

Hierarchical clustering methods and functional classification of the Curcumin-Gene Expression Response (Cu-GER) showed temporal co-regulation of genes involved in oxidative stress response and growth signaling pathways. Interestingly, C4-2B, androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer cells exhibited attenuated Cu-GER response in comparison to parental androgen dependent and less aggressive LNCaP cells.

HRG can bind to receptor tyrosine kinases erbB3 and erbB4, thereby inducing erbB3 and erbB4 heterodimerization with erbB2, leading to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activating downstream signal transduction. Cell-cell homophilic adhesion (cell aggregation) is important in determining the structural organization and behavior of cells in tissues. In addition, tumor cell homophilic adhesion may affect invasive and metastatic potentials of cells. We report that HRG-beta1 can enhance aggregation of MCF-7 and SKBR3 human breast cancer cells. While investigating the downstream signals involved in HRG-beta1-enhanced cell aggregation, we observed that HRG-beta1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB2 and crbB3 receptor heterodimers and increased the association of the dimerized receptors with the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). HRG-beta also increased the kinase activities of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and PI3K in these cells. By using the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 and PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, we found that blocking the MEK1-ERK pathway had no effect on HRG-pbeta1-enhanced cell aggregation; however, blocking the PI3K pathway greatly inhibited HRG-beta1-mediated cell aggregation. Our study indicated that the HRG-beta1-activated MEK1-ERK pathway has no demonstrable role in the induction of cell aggregation, whereas HRG-beta1-activated PI3K is required for enhancing breast cancer cell aggregation. Because aggregation can contribute to invasion/metastasis phenotype of cancer cells, our results have provided one mechanism by which HRG-beta1-activated signaling of erbB receptors may affect invasive/metastatic properties of MCF-7 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells.",

The PAM50 gene set is often used for gene expression-based subtyping; however, surrogate subtyping using panels of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers are still widely used clinically. Discrepancies between these methods may lead to different treatment decisions.;We used the PAM50 RT-qPCR assay to expression profile 814 tumors from the GEICAM/9906 phase III clinical trial that enrolled women with locally advanced primary invasive breast cancer. All samples were scored at a single site by IHC for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her2/neu (HER2) protein expression. Equivocal HER2 cases were confirmed by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Single gene scores by IHC/CISH were compared with RT-qPCR continuous gene expression values and \"intrinsic\" subtype assignment by the PAM50. High, medium, and low expression for ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, and proliferation were selected using quartile cut-points from the continuous RT-qPCR data across the PAM50 subtype assignments.;ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 gene expression had high agreement with established binary IHC cut-points (area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.9). Estrogen receptor positivity by IHC was strongly associated with Luminal (A and B) subtypes (92%), but only 75% of ER negative tumors were classified into the HER2-E and Basal-like subtypes. Luminal A tumors more frequently expressed PR than Luminal B (94% vs 74%) and Luminal A tumors were less likely to have high proliferation (11% vs 77%). Seventy-seven percent (30/39) of ER-/HER2+ tumors by IHC were classified as the HER2-E subtype. Triple negative tumors were mainly comprised of Basal-like (57%) and HER2-E (30%) subtypes. Single gene scoring for ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 was more prognostic than the corresponding IHC markers as shown in a multivariate analysis.;The standard immunohistochemical panel for breast cancer (ER, PR, and HER2) does not adequately identify the PAM50 gene expression subtypes. Although there is high agreement between biomarker scoring by protein immunohistochemistry and gene expression, the gene expression determinations for ESR1 and ERBB2 status was more prognostic.",

However, there is little knowledge of the mechanisms by which these tumors develop acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition. To investigate this question we sought to characterize cell line models of ERBB2-amplified gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition. We generated lapatinib-resistant (LR) subclones from an initially lapatinib-sensitive ERBB2-amplified esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, OE19. We subsequently performed genomic characterization and functional analyses of resistant subclones with acquired lapatinib resistance. We identified a novel, acquired SrcE527K mutation in a subset of LR OE19 subclones. Cells with this mutant allele harbour increased Src phosphorylation. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Src resensitized these subclones to lapatinib. Biochemically, Src mutations could activate both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase pathways in the lapatinib-treated LR OE19 cells. Ectopic expression of SrcE527K mutation also was sufficient to induce lapatinib resistance in drug-naïve cells. These results indicate that pathologic activation of Src is a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition in ERBB2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer. Although Src mutation has not been described in primary tumor samples, we propose that the Src hyperactivation should be investigated in the settings of acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma.",

In the present study, we have determined the inhibitory effect of a potent Gemini vitamin D analog BXL0124 (1alpha,25-dihydroxy-20R-21(3-hydroxy-3-deuteromethyl-4,4,4-trideuterobutyl)-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-cholecalciferol) on the ErbB2/Her-2/neu overexpressing mammary tumorigenesis. The Gemini BXL0124 inhibits ErbB2-positive mammary tumor growth and down-regulates the phosphorylation of ErbB2, ERK and AKT in tumors of MMTV-ErbB2/neu transgenic mice. These effects of Gemini BXL0124 in vivo were confirmed by using the ErbB2 overexpressing tumor cells derived from the mammary tumors of MMTV-ErbB2/neu mice.

The MDA-MB-453 cells, which have been shown to overexpress ErbB2, were resistant to 5-fluorouracil; 5-fluorouracil exhibited a small dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect, with an IC50 of 90 microM. Interestingly, combined treatment with apigenin significantly decreased the resistance. Cellular proliferation was significantly inhibited in cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil at its IC50 and apigenin (5, 10, 50 and 100 microM), compared with proliferation in cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil alone. This inhibition in turn led to apoptosis, as evidenced by an increased number of apoptotic cells and the activation of caspase-3. To investigate the mechanism by which the combination of 5-fluorouracil and apigenin induces apoptosis, ErbB2 expression was analyzed. The level of ErbB2 was unchanged by 5-fluorouracil alone but was drastically reduced in cells treated with 5-fluorouracil plus apigenin. Moreover, compared with 5-fluorouracil alone, 5-fluorouracil in combination with apigenin at concentrations >10 microM exerted a pro-apoptotic effect via the inhibition of Akt expression. Taken together, our results suggest that 5-fluorouracil acts synergistically with apigenin inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis via the down-regulation of ErbB2 expression and Akt signaling.",

Breast cancer cell lines transfected with genes for growth factor receptors, intracellular signaling molecules or genes that generate luminescent signals are widely used in basic science and preclinical studies. Typically, a target gene of interest is co-transfected with selectable markers that are generally assumed to be innocuous. Perturbations of the cellular genome by transfected sequences may induce subtle and/or unexpected modulations in protein expression, only some of which may be attributable to the target gene of interest. In this study, we show that neomycin resistant MCF7 cells (MCF7 Neo(r)) proliferate twice as rapidly in nude mice as do the untransfected parent cells, but show similar growth rates in vitro. MCF7 transfected with the ErbB2 gene shows minimal alteration in growth rate in vitro, and approximately a threefold increased growth rate in vivo. MCF7 cells that express luciferase and yellow fluorescent protein proliferate slowly in vitro and show essentially no growth in vivo suggesting that overexpression of these tracking proteins adversely affects cellular proliferative capacity. The molecular basis for alterations in proliferative capacity of the transfected sub-lines is poorly understood. We performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to compare relative protein expression among the cell lines. Relative to the parental MCF7, transfected cell lines displayed numerous differentially expressed proteins (69 to 149), relative to parental MCF7. Twenty-one of these differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, and included metabolic, structural, and signaling proteins.

A bone marrow aspirate sampled at the site of progressing metastasis in the right iliac bone was performed, and single cell molecular analysis using array-CGH of Epithelial Specific Antigen (ESA)-positive metastatic cells, and revealed two distinct regions of amplification, 12p12.1 and 17q12-q21.2 amplicons, containing the KRAS (12p) and ERBB2 (HER2/NEU) (17q) oncogenes. Further intrapatient tumor heterogeneity of these highlighted gene copy number changes was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in all available primary and metastatic tumor biopsies, and ErbB2 protein expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry. ERBB2 was heterogeneously amplified by FISH analysis in the primary tumor, as well as liver and bone metastasis, but homogenously amplified in biopsy specimens from a progressing bone metastasis after three initial cycles of chemotherapy, indicating a possible enrichment of erbB2 positive tumor cells in the progressing bone marrow metastasis during chemotherapy. A similar amplification profile was detected for wild-type KRAS, although more heterogeneously expressed in the bone metastasis progressing on chemotherapy. Correspondingly, the erbB2 protein was found heterogeneously expressed by immunohistochemical staining of the primary tumor of the gastroesophageal junction, while negative in liver and bone metastases, but after three initial cycles of palliative chemotherapy with epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecetabine, the representative bone metastasis stained strongly positive for erbB2.;Global analysis of genetic aberrations, as illustrated by performing array-CGH analysis on genomic DNA from only a few selected tumor cells of interest sampled from a progressing bone metastasis, can identify relevant therapeutic targets and genetic aberrations involved in malignant progression, thus emphasizing the importance and feasibility of this powerful tool on the road to more personalized cancer therapies in the future.",

The Syrian golden hamster cheek pouch oral carcinogenesis model is the best known animal system that closely correlates events involved in the development of premalignant and malignant human oral cancers. Therefore, we established an experimental system of chemically induced oral carcinogenesis in hamsters, in order to study different stages of tumour formation: normal mucosa, hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, dysplasia, early invasion, well differentiated OSCC and moderately differentiated OSCC. We investigated the expression of oncogenes EGFR, erbB2, erbB3, FGFR-2, FGFR-3, c-myc, N-ras, ets-1, H-ras, c-fos and c-jun, apoptosis markers Bax and Bcl-2, tumour suppressor genes p53 and p16, and cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in the sequential stages of hamster oral oncogenesis. Here, we describe the findings of the experimental model in regard to the involvement of signal transduction pathways in every stage of cancer development. Increased apoptosis and cell proliferation were observed in early stages of oral oncogenesis. Furthermore, the increased expression of transmembrane receptors (EGFR, erbB2, FGFR-2 and FGFR-3) as well as the increased expression of nuclear transcriptional factors in early stages of oral cancer indicates that these molecules may be used as early prognostic factors for the progression of OSCC. Since the expression of both H-ras and N-ras do not seem to affect signal transduction during oral oncogenesis, it can be assumed that a different signalling pathway, such as the PI3K and/or PLCgamma pathway, may be implicated in the pathogenesis of OSCC.",

Moreover, our studies also showed that knockdown of MUC4 in TNBC cells induced molecular changes suggestive of mesenchymal to epithelial transition. We also demonstrated in this study, for the first time, that knockdown of MUC4 was associated with reduced expression of EGFR and ErbB3 (EGFR family proteins) in TNBC cells, suggesting that MUC4 uses an alternative to ErbB2 mechanism to promote aggressiveness.

Tctp knockdown in primary mammary tumor cells from ErbB2 transgenic mice results in increased P53 expression and a decreased number of stem-like cancer cells. The pharmacological compounds sertraline and thioridazine increase the amount of P53 by neutralizing TCTP's action on the MDM2-P53 axis. This study links TCTP and P53 in a previously unidentified regulatory circuitry that may underlie the relevance of TCTP in cancer.",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

The reduction of p185 resulted primarily from increased degradation of p185; cellular protein synthesis was reduced only 16% in SKBr3 cells treated with herbimycin A, RNA synthesis was inhibited only 10%, and erbB2 mRNA levels were unchanged. Examination of the major cellular glycoproteins indicated that most glycoproteins were unaffected under conditions that substantially depleted p185. Studies with cell lines transfected with erbB2 containing defined deletions indicated that susceptibility to the depletion of p185 by herbimycin and its analogues required the domain encoded by amino acids 751-971.

This subgroup accounts for 15% of all types of breast cancer and for a higher percentage of breast cancer arising in African and African-American women who are premenopausal. Because of the absence of specific treatment guidelines for this subgroup, triple-negative breast cancers are managed with standard treatment; however, such treatment leaves them associated with a high rate of local and systemic relapse. Histologically, such cancers are poorly differentiated, and most fall into the basal subgroup of breast cancers, characterised by staining for basal markers (ie, cytokeratin 5/6). Analyses of microarray gene-expression profiling data show that they form a homogeneous group (or so-called cluster) in transcriptional terms and, increasingly, research studies are identifying basal cancers on the basis of exhibiting this distinctive transcriptional profile. Histologically and transcriptionally, triple-negative breast cancers have many similarities to BRCA1-associated breast cancers, which suggests that dysfunction in BRCA1 or related pathways occurs in this subset of sporadic cancers. In this review, we discuss the molecular features of triple-negative breast cancers and consider how the use of existing cytotoxic agents can be optimised for this patient group. We discuss the implications of a possible underlying BRCA1-pathway dysfunction in this subgroup in terms of treatment and we also investigate the predominant proliferative signals and the on-going research addressing the suitability of these signals as therapeutic targets.",

Epiregulin possesses a range of functions in both normal physiologic states as well as in pathologic conditions. Epiregulin contributes to inflammation, wound healing, tissue repair, and oocyte maturation by regulating angiogenesis and vascular remodeling and by stimulating cell proliferation. Deregulated epiregulin activity appears to contribute to the progression of a number of different malignancies, including cancers of the bladder, stomach, colon, breast, lung, head and neck, and liver.

        "Doc_abstract":"Knowledge about the molecular profile of tumor tissues is crucial to effectively target cancer cells, because cancer is a genetic disease that involves multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations. Prominent aberrations include gene mutation, amplification, loss or deletion, as well as epigenetic alterations of the promoter DNA CpG islands. All of these aberrations can lead to dynamic changes in cancer cells, as demonstrated using resected tumor samples. There are two distinct pathological types of gastric cancer: the diffuse type and the intestinal type of gastric cancer. Diffuse type gastric cancer harbors aberrations in the FGFR2/ErbB3/PI3 kinase pathway, while intestinal type gastric cancer has an activated ErbB2 oncogenic pathway. On the other hand, the prometastatic oncogene PRL-3 is commonly activated in both types of advanced gastric cancer, and might represent a relevant therapeutic target for gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis or peritoneal dissemination. Numerous tumor suppressor genes can inhibit such oncogenic pathways, and DNA methylation in CpG islands of gene promoters is frequently found to suppress the expression of such genes in gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori infection in normal gastric mucosa may cause p53 mutations through activation of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and/or promoter DNA methylation of E-cadherin, an initiator of gastric cancer, and such abnormalities are found even in the precancerous stage of gastric carcinogenesis. In addition, it has been demonstrated that there are highly relevant methylation genes involved in cancer (HRMGs) that exhibit very frequent cancer-specific methylation in gastric cancer. Such genes are potential targets for cancer treatment, and might also serve as biomarkers of gastric cancer for either the diagnosis or for determining the prognosis or the response to treatment.",

Low expression of PER3 mRNA is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in a subset of tumors that are ER positive, and either luminal A or ERBB2-positive tumors. Mice deficient in Per3 showed increased susceptibility to breast cancer induced by carcinogen treatment or by overexpression of Erbb2.;Disruption of PER3 function may serve as an indicator of probability of tumor recurrence in patients with ER-positive tumors.

The pro-metastatic activity of Sema3E is due to its proteolytic fragment p61, capable of transactivating the oncogenic tyrosine kinase ErbB2 that associates with the Sema3E receptor PlexinD1 in cancer cells. Here, we show that a mutated, uncleavable variant of Sema3E (Uncl-Sema3E) binds to PlexinD1 like p61-Sema3E, but does not promote the association of PlexinD1 with ErbB2 nor activates the ensuing signalling cascade leading to metastatic spreading. Furthermore, Uncl-Sema3E competes with endogenous p61-Sema3E produced by tumour cells, thereby hampering their metastatic ability. Uncl-Sema3E also acts independently as a potent anti-angiogenic factor. It activates a PlexinD1-mediated signalling cascade in endothelial cells that leads to the inhibition of adhesion to extracellular matrix, directional migration and cell survival. The putative therapeutic potential of Uncl-Sema3E was validated in multiple orthotopic or spontaneous tumour models in vivo, where either local or systemic delivery of Uncl-Sema3E-reduced angiogenesis, growth and metastasis, even in the case of tumours refractory to treatment with a soluble vascular endothelial growth factor trap. In summary, we conclude that Uncl-Sema3E is a novel inhibitor of tumour angiogenesis and growth that concomitantly hampers metastatic spreading.",

Treatment of NeuYD or NeuYD x VEGF mice with rapamycin dramatically inhibited tumor growth accompanied by a marked decrease in tumor vascularization. Two key events that may underlie the antitumor activity of rapamycin were decreased expression of ErbB3 and inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-dependent responses to hypoxic stress. Rapamycin exposure caused only a modest inhibition of the proliferation of tumor-derived cell lines in standard monolayer cultures, but dramatically inhibited the growth of the same cells in three-dimensional cultures, due in part to the induction of apoptotic cell death.

The fully complementary ODN antisense strand is linked to a second strand constituting a partially double-stranded structure of the ODN.

MiR-125b as well as ODN-Raf showed no effect on the c-raf-1 mRNA level in contrast to small interfering RNA. Unlike miR-125b, ODN-Raf induced a cytopathic effect.

However, on rare occasions, pmucBC pursues an aggressive clinical course. We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) would uncover clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) that could lead to targeted therapy treatment for patients with an advanced and metastatic form of pmucBC.;From a series of 51,238 total cancer samples, which included 5605 cases of clinically advanced BC and 22 cases of stage IV pmucBC, DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed using a hybrid-capture, adaptor ligation-based next generation sequencing assay to a mean coverage depth of 564X. The results were analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (GA) including base substitutions, insertions and deletions, select rearrangements, and copy number changes. Clinically relevant genomic alterations were defined as those indicating possible treatment with anti-cancer drugs on the market or in registered clinical trials.;Samples were obtained from breast (11), lymph nodes (3), chest wall (2), liver (2), soft tissue (2), bone (1), and pleura (1). The median age of the 22 pmucBC patients was 57 years (range 32-79 years). Three pmucBCs were grade 1, 17 were grade 2, and 2 were grade 3. Twenty-one (95 %) pmucBC were ER+, 18 (82 %) were PR+, and 3 (14 %) were HER2+ by IHC and/or FISH. A total of 132 GA were identified (6.0 GA per tumor), including 53 CRGA, for a mean of 2.4 GA per tumor. Amplification of FGFR1 or ZNF703, located within the same amplicon, was found in 8 of 22 cases (36 %). This enrichment of FGFR1 amplification in 36 % of pmucBC versus 11 % of non-mucinous ER+ BC (601 cases) was significant (p < 0.005). Other frequently altered genes of interest in pmucBC were CCND1 and the FGF3/FGF4/FGF19 amplicon (27 %), often co-amplified together. ERBB2/HER2 alterations were identified in 5 pmucBC (23 %): ERBB2 amplification was found in 3 of 3 cases (100 %) that were HER2+ by IHC and/or FISH; 1 pmucBC was negative for HER2 overexpression by IHC, but positive for amplification by CGP; and 2 pmucBC harbored the ERBB2 substitutions D769Y and V777L (one sample also featured ERBB2 amplification). The enrichment of ERBB2 GA in metastatic pmucBC versus non-metastatic primary pmucBC was significant (p = 0.03). CRGA were also found in 20 additional genes including PIK3CA (5), BRCA1 (1), TSC2 (1), STK11 (1), AKT3 (1), and ESR1 (1).;Metastatic pmucBC is a distinct form of breast cancer that features a relatively high frequency of CRGA, including a significant enrichment of FGFR1 alterations and a high frequency of ERBB2 alterations when compared with non-metastatic pmucBC. These findings suggest that CGP can identify a variety of known and emerging therapy targets that have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with clinically advanced and metastatic forms of this disease.",

However, neither the subtypes of breast cancer cells with constitutive NF-kappaB activation nor the molecular mechanisms leading to its constitutive activation have been clearly defined. Here, we quantitatively analyzed basal NF-kappaB activity in 35 human breast cancer cell lines and found that most of the cell lines with high constitutive NF-kappaB activation were categorized in the estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, ERBB2 negative basal-like subtype, which is the most malignant form of breast cancer. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activation by expression of IkappaBalpha super-repressor reduced proliferation of the basal-like subtype cell lines. Expression levels of mRNA encoding NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) were elevated in several breast cancer cell lines, and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NIK reduced NF-kappaB activation in a subset of the basal-like subtype cell lines with upregulated NIK expression. Taken together, these results suggest that constitutive NF-kappaB activation, partially dependent on NIK, is preferentially involved in proliferation of basal-like subtype breast cancer cells and may be a useful therapeutic target for this subtype of cancer.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that these genes act as positive and/or negative modulators in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, in a tissue-specific manner. We have previously reported that HOXB5 is aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Here, we investigated the biological roles and clinical relevance of HOXB5 in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis of HOXB5 on tissue microarray (TMA) including 34 normal and 67 breast cancer specimens revealed that HOXB5 was highly expressed in cancer tissues, particularly from estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients. An online survival analysis confirmed the correlation between HOXB5 expression and poor distant metastasis-free survival in ER-positive, but not in ER-negative, breast cancer. In vitro studies indicated that HOXB5 silencing in ER-positive cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth. In contrast, overexpression of HOXB5 displayed EMT characteristics with a greater invasive ability, higher cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. HOXB5 knockdown or overexpression led to changes in the expression levels of RET, ERBB2, and EGFR, but not of ESR1. In conclusion, we suggest that HOXB5 acts as a positive modulator most likely by promoting cell proliferative response and invasiveness in ER-positive breast cancer. These results would help predict prognosis of breast cancer and identify a new valuable therapeutic target. ",

Further improvements of these therapies may be guided by a quantitative, dynamic integrative systems understanding of the complexities of ErbB dimerisation, trafficking and activation, for it is these complexities that render difficult intuiting how perturbations such as drug intervention will affect ErbB signalling activities. Towards this goal, we have developed a computational model implementing commonly accepted principles governing ErbB receptor interaction, trafficking, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Using this model, we are able to investigate several hypotheses regarding the compartmental localisation of dephosphorylation. Model results applied to experimental data on ErbB 1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylation in H292 human lung carcinoma cells support a hypothesis that key dephosphorylation activity for these receptors occurs largely in an intracellular, endosomal compartment rather than at the cell surface plasma membrane. Thus, the endocytic trafficking-related compartmentalisation of dephosphorylation may define a critical aspect of the ErbB signalling response to ligand.",

Treatment of neonatal mice with diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces an estrogen-independent persistent proliferation and cornification of the vaginal epithelium, which results in cancerous lesions later in life. However, the mechanisms of the estrogen-dependent and -independent pathways essentially remain unknown. We characterized the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors (EGF, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin (BTC), amphiregulin (APR), epiregulin (EPR) and neuregulin (NRG) 1) and erbB receptors (EGF receptor (EGFR), erbB2/neu, erbB3 and erbB4) in the vaginae of mice treated either neonatally (0-4 day) or as adults (55-59 day) with estrogens. EGFR and erbB2 were activated in the vaginal epithelium of mice by estrogen treatment. This activation was also encountered in vaginae from neonatally DES-exposed mice, along with the expression of EGF, TGF-alpha, HB-EGF, BTC, APR, EPR and NRG1. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that erbB2 was primarily expressed in vaginal epithelium. Finally, we found that serine 118 and 167 located in the AF-1 domain of ERalpha were phosphorylated in these vaginae. AG825, AG1478 or ICI 182,780 administration blocked proliferation of vaginal epithelium induced by neonatal DES exposure. Thus, signal transduction via EGFR and erbB2 could be related to the estrogen-induced vaginal changes and persistent erbBs phosphorylation and sustained expression of EGF-like growth factors, leading to ERalpha activation that may result in cancerous lesions in vaginae from neonatally DES-exposed mice later in life.",

Therefore, to understand how ErbB1/ErbB2 signaling contributes to this process, we used the ErbB kinase inhibitor AG1478in ErbB2-dependent BT-474 and SKBR-3 human breast cancer cells. These cells overexpress ErbB2 and also display moderate levels of ErbB1. Treatment with AG1478 resulted in rapid ErbB2 dephosphorylation, reversible G(1) arrest, and interruption of constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Consequently, both MAPK-dependent transcription of cyclin D1 and phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 were inhibited. The inhibition of PI3K/Akt resulted in increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, which phosphorylated cyclin D1, potentially reducing its steady-state levels. The loss of cyclin D1 reduced the amount of cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes that can sequester p27 in the cytosol. This plus the reduced phosphorylation of p27 by MAPK enhanced the stability of p27 that associated with nuclear Cdk2 at high stoichiometry and inhibited its kinase activity. Antisense p27 oligonucleotides decreased p27 levels and abrogated the G(1) arrest induced by AG1478. Similarly, infection with an adenovirus encoding inducible cyclin D1 also counteracted the antiproliferative effect of AG1478. These data imply that: (a) modulation of both p27 and cyclin D1 are required for the growth arrest that results from blockade of the ErbB2 kinase; and (b) ErbB2 overexpressing cells use both MAPK and PI3K/Akt to modulate p27 and cyclin D1 and, hence, subvert the G(1)-to-S transition.",

Three weekly i.v. injections of 20 to 25 mg/kg Ls-LAQ824 in nude mice with ErbB2 overexpressing BT-474 breast tumor xenografts significantly impairs tumor growth, and administration of ErbB2-targeted ILs-LAQ824 may further improve this antitumor activity. Studies of tumor-bearing mice 24 hours after single treatment indicate that: (a) >10% of injected liposomal LAQ824 is still circulating (whereas free LAQ824 is undetectable in the blood after 15 minutes); and (b) tumor uptake of Ls-LAQ824 and ILs-LAQ824 is >3% injected drug per gram of tumor, producing levels of acetylated tumor histones that are 5- to 10-fold increased over those following free LAQ824 or saline treatments and resulting in concordantly reduced levels of tumor ErbB2 mRNA. These preclinical results support the clinical evaluation of HDAC inhibitors against ErbB2-overexpressing malignancies, and further indicate that encapsulation into targeted and nontargeted liposomes substantially improves the in vivo pharmacokinetics, tumor uptake, and antitumor properties of hydroxamate-based HDAC inhibitors.",

Overexpression and high activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) are frequently associated with metastatic breast cancers and serve as a prognostic indicator of clinical outcome. MMP-2 is predominantly expressed in stromal fibroblasts and plays a pivotal role in regulating the invasive behavior of breast tumor cells. We hypothesized that ethanol may enhance the invasion of breast tumor cells by modulating the activity of fibroblastic MMP-2. With in vitro models (HS68 and CCD1056SK human fibroblasts), we showed that ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations (50-200 mg/dl) activated MMP-2; conversely, at a higher concentration (400 mg/dl), it inhibited the MMP-2 activity. Consistently, conditioned medium collected from ethanol (50-200 mg/dl)-exposed fibroblasts markedly enhanced the invasive potential of breast cancer cells and mammary epithelial cells overexpressing ErbB2/HER2 (BT474, SKBR-3 and HB2(ErbB2) cells) but had little effect on cells with low ErbB2 levels (BT20 and HB2 cells). In contrast, conditioned medium obtained from ethanol (400 mg/dl)-treated fibroblasts inhibited cell invasion. Selective inhibitors of MMP-2 (SB-3CT and OA-Hy) eliminated ethanol-stimulated invasion, indicating that the effect of ethanol was mediated by MMP-2. Ethanol activated conventional PKCs and JNKs in fibroblasts; inhibitors of PKC (Go6850 and Go6976) and JNKs (SP600125) significantly inhibited ethanol-mediated MMP-2 activation as well as cell invasion, indicating that PKCs and JNKs play a role in ethanol-induced MMP-2 activation and cell invasion in vitro.

Beside its important role in tumor induction, growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for new therapeutic approaches such as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through the HER-2 receptor. In addition to Herceptin, which is in a wide clinical use for HER-2 amplified breast cancer, a number of various HER-2 directed immunological and genetic strategies, either targeting the HER-2 receptor, its signaling pathways or both HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) simultaneously, have demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity in HER-2 amplified carcinomas. Moreover, the HER-2 amplicon is known to contain more than 30 genes with altered copy numbers that could be therapeutic targets for chemotherapy. The topoisomerase IIalpha gene, TOP2A, is located adjacent to the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome location 17q12-q21 and is either amplified or deleted (with equal frequency) in a great majority of HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors and also in tumors without HER-2 amplification. Recent experimental as well as numerous, large, multi-center trials suggest that amplification (and/or deletion) of TOP2A may account for both sensitivity or resistance to commonly used cytotoxic drugs, i.e. topoII-inhibitors (anthracyclines etc.), depending on the specific genetic defect at the TOP2A locus. The understanding of HER-2 amplification and its role in the pathogenesis of cancer is expanding, and a number of therapeutic strategies targeting either the HER-2 or its signaling pathways in cancer therapy are being investigated. Combining HER-2 targeting therapies with conventional forms of cytotoxic chemotherapy, where additional diagnostic tests such as those ascertaining TOP2A status, may be helpful for the ideal selection of patients for the combination therapy of an HER-2 targeting drug together with a cytotoxic drug such as topoII-inhibitor especially in the case of TOP2A amplification.",

Multiple genomic alterations underlying gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have been identified, but the full spectrum of genomic structural variations and mutations have yet to be uncovered. Here, we report the results of whole-genome sequencing of 30 samples comprising tumor and blood from 15 patients, four of whom presented with ESCC, seven with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and four with gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma. Analyses revealed that an A>C mutation was common in GCA, and in addition to the preferential nucleotide sequence of A located 5 prime to the mutation as noted in previous studies, we found enrichment of T in the 5 prime base. The A>C mutations in GCA suggested that oxidation of guanine may be a potential mechanism underlying cancer mutagenesis. Furthermore, we identified genes with mutations in gastric cancer and ESCC, including well-known cancer genes, TP53, JAK3, BRCA2, FGF2, FBXW7, MSH3, PTCH, NF1, ERBB2, and CHEK2, and potentially novel cancer-associated genes, KISS1R, AMH, MNX1, WNK2, and PRKRIR Finally, we identified recurrent chromosome alterations in at least 30% of tumors in genes, including MACROD2, FHIT, and PARK2 that were often intragenic deletions.

We also conducted standardized pathology reviews and immunohistochemical staining for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, Ki67 antigen, p53, p16, epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ERBB2, HER2/neu oncoprotein), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) on the initial paraffin-embedded DCIS tissue. Competing risk models were used to determine factors associated with risk of subsequent invasive cancer vs DCIS, and cumulative incidence survival functions were used to estimate 8-year risk.;Factors associated with subsequent invasive cancer differed from those associated with subsequent DCIS.

The contribution of Gli1 to the progression of breast cancer is less established. In order to investigate the functional impact of Gli1 in breast cancer, expression of Gli1 and its contribution to cell growth was assessed in breast cancer cell lines. These in vitro results were compared to expression of Gli1, determined by immunohistochemistry, in 171 breast cancers. In these cancers, the association of Gli1 with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and progesterone receptor (PR), ErbB2, p53, the rate of proliferation, and clinicopathologic parameters and outcome was assessed. Expression of Gli1 and ERalpha mRNA was strongly correlated in ERalpha-positive cell lines (r = 0.999). Treatment with estrogen increased expression of Gli1 in 2 of 3 ERalpha-positive cell lines; this increase was prevented by treatment with the ERalpha-specific antagonist MPP. Silencing of Gli1 by shRNA markedly reduced the survival of two ERalpha-negative cell lines, but caused only a modest reduction in ERalpha-positive cell lines. In breast cancer tissues, cancers with nuclear localization of Gli1 had a higher ERalpha (P=0.027) and lower p53 expression (P=0.017) than those without nuclear localization of Gli1. However, nuclear localization of Gli1 was predictive of a poorer cancer-specific survival in ERalpha-negative, including triple negative, cancers (P = 0.005), but not ERalpha-positive cancers. In conclusion, we demonstrate a positive association between expression of Gli1 and ERalpha; however, our data indicate a greater functional effect of Gli1 in ERalpha-negative cancers.",

Tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules was greater in HBECs expressing the mutant EGFRs than in cells expressing WT EGFR or mutant KRAS.

There were also differences in degree of phosphorylation at individual tyrosine sites within a protein; for example, a previously uncharacterized phosphorylation site in the nucleotide-binding loop of the kinase domains of EGFR (Y727), ERBB2 (Y735), or ERBB4 (Y733), is phosphorylated significantly more in HBECs expressing the deletion mutant than in cells expressing the wild type or L858R EGFR.

Currently, the only accepted mechanism linked with endocrine resistance is amplification or overexpression of the ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) proto-oncogene. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, the most frequently mutated pathway in breast cancer, promotes antiestrogen resistance. PI3K is a major signaling hub downstream of HER2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3K activates several molecules involved in cell-cycle progression and survival, and in ER-positive breast cancer cells, it promotes estrogen-dependent and -independent ER transcriptional activity. Preclinical tumor models of antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer often remain sensitive to estrogens and PI3K inhibition, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of the PI3K and ER pathways may be most effective. Herein, we review alterations in the PI3K pathway associated with resistance to endocrine therapy, the state of clinical development of PI3K inhibitors, and strategies for the clinical investigation of such drugs in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

Therefore, alternative additional therapies are required. The etiology of ovarian cancer remains largely unknown, but risk factors point toward an important role for oxidative stress. Both healthy and tumor cells can cope with oxidative stress by activating the transcription factor Nrf2 (also known as Nfe2l2), the master regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Indeed, for most ovarian cancers, aberrant activation of Nrf2 is observed, which is often associated with a copy number loss within the Nrf2-inhibitory complex KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1. A key role for Nrf2 in ovarian carcinogenesis has been validated by siRNA studies. However, to exploit the Nrf2 pathway for therapeutic interventions, potential side-effects should be minimized. In this review, we explore ovarian cancer specific factors with links to aberrant activity of Nrf2, to be exploited in future combination strategies, synergistic with direct Nrf2 inhibitory drugs.

Many underlying molecular events that confer resistance are known, but a unifying theme is yet to be revealed. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such EGFR, ERBB2 and IGF1R are major mediators that can directly alter cellular response to the SERM, tamoxifen, but the mechanisms underlying increased expression of RTKs are not clear. A number of HOX genes and microRNAs and non-coding RNAs residing in the HOX cluster, have been identified as important independent predictors of endocrine resistant breast cancer. Recently, convincing evidence has accumulated that several members belonging to the four different HOX clusters contribute to endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer, but the mechanisms remain obscure. In this article, we have reviewed recent progress in understanding of the functioning of HOX genes and regulation of their expression by hormones. We also discuss, in particular, the contributions of several members of the HOX gene family to endocrine resistant breast cancer. ",

MIF can promote tumor cell survival, and elevated MIF protein correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism facilitating MIF stabilization in tumors is not understood. We show that the tumor-activated HSP90 chaperone complex protects MIF from degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 activity, or siRNA-mediated knockdown of HSP90 or HDAC6, destabilizes MIF in a variety of human cancer cells. The HSP90-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP mediates the ensuing proteasome-dependent MIF degradation. Cancer cells contain constitutive endogenous MIF-HSP90 complexes. siRNA-mediated MIF knockdown inhibits proliferation and triggers apoptosis of cultured human cancer cells, whereas HSP90 inhibitor-induced apoptosis is overridden by ectopic MIF expression. In the ErbB2 transgenic model of human HER2-positive breast cancer, genetic ablation of MIF delays tumor progression and prolongs overall survival of mice. Systemic treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG reduces MIF expression and blocks growth of MIF-expressing, but not MIF-deficient, tumors. Together, these findings identify MIF as a novel HSP90 client and suggest that HSP90 inhibitors inhibit ErbB2-driven breast tumor growth at least in part by destabilizing MIF.",

Loss of ER in recurrent breast cancer is associated with poor response to endocrine therapy. G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is expressed in half of ER-negative breast cancers. Tumor cell-derived heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1) is also found mainly in ER-negative cancer. In SkBr3 breast cancer cells that lack ER but express GPR30, HRG-β1 upregulates mRNA and protein levels of GPR30 by promoting ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization and activating the downstream MAPK-ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, GPR30 boosts HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion of SkBr3 cells after combinative treatment with E2, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen or the specific GPR30 agonist G-1, which are blocked by the specific GPR30 antagonist G-15 or the transfection with the small interfering RNA for GPR30. The ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also partly inhibit the enhanced migration and invasion. Therefore, HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion partly depend on the upregulation of GPR30 expression through activation of the ErbB2-ERK pathway in SkBr3 cells. The results of this study indicate that the crosstalk between GPR30 and HRGs signaling is important for endocrine therapy resistance and may provide a new therapeutic way to treat breast cancer.",

Hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs) enhance SERS signal intensity of individual particles by localizing surface electromagnetic fields through pinholes in the hollow particle structures. This capacity to enhance imaging at the level of single molecules permits the use of HGNs to detect specific biological markers expressed in living cancer cells. In addition, silica encapsulation greatly enhances the stability of nanoparticles. Here we applied a SERS-based imaging technique using SEHGNs in the multiplex imaging of three breast cancer cell phenotypes. Expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), ErbB2, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors were assessed in the MDA-MB-468, KPL4 and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell lines.

Using a cross-species analysis approach, mouse models in which the functions of p53, Rb, and BRCA1 have been disrupted demonstrate molecular features of human, triple-negative (ER-, PR-, and ERBB2-), basal-type breast cancer. Using mouse tumor models based on the targeted abrogation of p53 and Rb function, we identified a large, integrated genetic network that correlates to poor outcome in several human epithelial cancers. This gene signature is highly enriched for genes involved in DNA replication and repair, chromosome maintenance, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis.

The Hedgehog signalling pathway has recently been implicated in prostate cancer development and metastasis. EGFR or ErbB2 expression has been also correlated with androgen independence, shorter survival and metastasis.;We determined that the Hedgehog and ErbB signalling pathways are active in circulating tumour cells isolated from androgen-independent prostate cancer patients and in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP C4-2B. As a basis for synergistic chemotherapy protocols combinations of the Hedgehog specific inhibitor cyclopamine and the ErbB signalling inhibitors gefitinib or lapatinib were tested in this study. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth was inhibited by a SMO inhibitor (cyclopamine) which blocks Hedgehog signalling and by ErbB inhibitors (gefitinib and lapatinib). The isobologram and combination index method of Chou and Talalay was used to evaluate drug interactions. Synergistic antiproliferation effects were observed when the Hedgehog and ErbB inhibitors were combined.;Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation was associated with activity of the Hedgehog and ErbB signalling pathways. Cyclopamine, gefitinib or lapatinib treatment significantly decreased the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.

We examined eleven ErbB2 SNPs that alter the HER2-neu amino acid sequence to determine whether any of these particular polymorphisms were associated with increased trastuzumab cardiotoxicity in a case-control study.;140 subjects were enrolled from a single institution under Weill Cornell Medical College IRB protocol #0804009734.

Cases had either symptomatic CHF or a decline in LVEF of 15% (or if the LVEF <55%, a decline in LVEF of 10%) that resulted in at least temporary discontinuation of trastuzumab, whereas controls had no decline in their LVEF. Eleven ErbB2 single gene SNPs that resulted in an alteration in the HER2-neu protein amino acid sequence were studied. Single gene SNP analysis was carried out using SNP genotyping assays from genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood or buccal swab.;Only two of the ErbB2 SNPs (Ile 655 Val and Pro 1170 Ala) were found to have variation.

Breast cancer arises following the accumulation of a series of somatic changes often including deregulation of key signal transduction pathways. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been shown to be activated in breast cancer and overexpression of PI3K is sufficient to confer a malignant phenotype. Activation of the PI3K pathway serves to repress forkhead box class O (FoxO) transcription factor-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis. In this study, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown PI3K in three breast cancer cell lines representing different stages of cancer development. Transfection of PI3K siRNA in breast cancer cells resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and induction of apoptosis irrespective of their estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) or ErbB2 status. PI3K depletion also resulted in a significant G(1) phase cell cycle arrest in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells. Further, our data showed that PI3K knockdown resulted in a significant activation of FoxO; interestingly, a simultaneous knockdown of FoxO1a rescued the cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, the downstream effects of FoxO activation were found to be inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin-dependent kinase 6, and cyclin D1, and accumulation of p27/Kip1. Thus, we suggest that (a) PI3K plays a critical role in breast cancer development and (b) gene therapeutic approaches aimed at PI3K or the pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K could be developed for the management of breast cancer.",

In this phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent tumor model, ErbB2 is part of a complex containing PyVmT, p85 (PI3K), and ErbB3, that is disrupted by treatment with lapatinib. Thus, full engagement of PI3K/Akt by ErbB2 in this oncogene-induced mouse tumor model may involve its ability to dimerize with and phosphorylate ErbB3, which itself directly binds PI3K. In this article, we report that ErbB3 is critical for PI3K/Akt-driven tumor formation triggered by the PyVmT oncogene. Tissue-specific, Cre-mediated deletion of ErbB3 reduced Akt phosphorylation, primary tumor growth, and pulmonary metastasis. Furthermore, EZN-3920, a chemically stabilized antisense oligonucleotide that targets the ErbB3 mRNA in vivo, produced similar effects while causing no toxicity in the mouse model.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood (PB) was collected from 32 metastatic breast cancer patients and 42 negative controls. The antibodies BM7 and VU1D9 were used for immunomagnetic tumor cell enrichment. A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach for the markers KRT19, SCGB2A2, MUC1, EPCAM, BIRC5 and ERBB2 was used for CTC detection and characterization.  RESULTS: THE POSITIVITY RATES FOR EACH MARKER WERE AS FOLLOWS: 46.9% for KRT19, 25.0% for SCGB2A2, 28.1% for MUC1, 28.1% for EPCAM, 21.9% for BIRC5, and 15.6% for ERBB2. After the creation of individualized cutoffs, the sensitivity and specificity of the combined marker gene panel increased to 56.3% and 100%, respectively.

Whereas standard procedures use retroviral gene transduction to constitutively express immunoreceptors in T cells, we here explored for the first time mRNA electroporation to achieve transient immunoreceptor expression, and thereby minimizing the risk of persistence of potential autoaggression. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were efficiently transfected with immunoreceptors specific for ErbB2 and CEA. The immunoreceptor expression was transient with half-maximal expression at day 2 and no detectable immunoreceptor expression at day 9 after electroporation. Immunoreceptor-transfected T cells were specifically activated upon coincubation with ErbB2(+) and CEA(+) tumor cells, respectively, resulting in secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Furthermore, immunoreceptor-transfected CD8(+) T cells specifically lysed ErbB2(+) and CEA(+) tumor cells, respectively. The RNA-transfected T cells retained their cytotoxic function after 2 days of activation and exhibited cytolytic activities like retrovirally transduced T cells. RNA electroporation of T cells thereby provides a versatile tool for transient immunoreceptor expression, which may be of advantage in avoiding the persistence of unintended autoaggression.",

In the presence of low androgen concentrations, PKI-166 showed profound growth-inhibitory effects on tumor growth, which could be partially reversed by androgen add-back. At physiological androgen concentrations, androgen withdrawal greatly enhanced the ability of PKI-166 to retard tumor growth. The level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation correlated with the response to PKI-166 treatment, whereas the expression levels of ErbB1 and ErbB2 did not.

These ErbB/EGF receptor tyrosine kinases play important physiologic roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, motility, invasion, and angiogenesis. It is, therefore, not surprising that gene amplification, genetic mutation, and altered transcription/translation result in aberrant ErbB/EGF receptor expression and/or signal transduction, contributing to the development of malignant transformation. Clinically, the diagnostic, prognostic, and theragnostic significance of any single ErbB receptor and/or ErbB ligand is controversial, but generally, ErbB receptor overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis and decreased therapeutic responsiveness in ovarian cancer patients. Thus, anticancer agents targeting ErbB/EGF receptors hold great promise for personalized cancer treatment. Yet, challenges remain in designing prospective clinical trials to assess the clinical utility of ErbB receptors and their ligands to diagnose cancer; to predict progression-free and overall survival, therapeutic responsiveness, and disease recurrence; and to monitor treatment responsiveness.

However, the characteristics of these rearrangements at sequence-level resolution have thus far been subject to very limited description. One process that is dependent upon somatic genome rearrangement is gene amplification, a mechanism often exploited by cancer cells to increase copy number and hence expression of dominantly acting cancer genes. The mechanisms underlying gene amplification are complex but must involve chromosome breakage and rejoining. We sequenced 133 different genomic rearrangements identified within four cancer amplicons involving the frequently amplified cancer genes MYC, MYCN, and ERBB2. The observed architectures of rearrangement were diverse and highly distinctive, with evidence for sister chromatid breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, formation and reinsertion of double minutes, and the presence of bizarre clusters of small genomic fragments. There were characteristic features of sequences at the breakage-fusion junctions, indicating roles for nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination-mediated repair mechanisms together with nontemplated DNA synthesis. Evidence was also found for sequence-dependent variation in susceptibility of the genome to somatic rearrangement. The results therefore provide insights into the DNA breakage and repair processes operative in somatic genome rearrangement and illustrate how the evolutionary histories of individual cancers can be reconstructed from large-scale cancer genome sequencing.",

However, reliable methods to identify patients who would benefit most from a combination of treatment modalities targeting the tumor stroma, including new immunotherapy approaches, are still lacking. Therefore, we integrated a mouse model of stromal activation and gastric cancer genomic information to identify gene expression signatures that may inform treatment strategies. We generated a mouse model in which VEGF-A is expressed via adenovirus, enabling a stromal response marked by immune infiltration and angiogenesis at the injection site, and identified distinct stromal gene expression signatures. With these data, we designed multiplexed IHC assays that were applied to human primary gastric tumors and classified each tumor to a dominant stromal phenotype representative of the vascular and immune diversity found in gastric cancer. We also refined the stromal gene signatures and explored their relation to the dominant patient phenotypes identified by recent large-scale studies of gastric cancer genomics (The Cancer Genome Atlas and Asian Cancer Research Group), revealing four distinct stromal phenotypes. Collectively, these findings suggest that a genomics-based systems approach focused on the tumor stroma can be used to discover putative predictive biomarkers of treatment response, especially to antiangiogenesis agents and immunotherapy, thus offering an opportunity to improve patient stratification.

In this study, we screened and identified miRNAs dysregualted in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Our molecular study demonstrated that miR-489 was specifically downregulated by the HER2-downstream signaling, especially through the MAPK pathway. Restoration or overexpression of miR-489 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells significantly inhibited cell growth in vitro and decreased the tumorigenecity and tumor growth in xenograft mice. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of miR-489 led to the decreased levels of HER2 and SHP2 and thus attenuated HER2-downstream signaling. Furthermore, we for the first time demonstrated that HER2 is a direct target of miR-489 and therefore HER2-SHP2-MAPK and miR-489 signaling pathways form a mutually inhibitory loop. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Fluorescent in situ hybridization technique (FISH), we found that miR-489 was expressed at significantly lower level in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Downregulation of miR-489 in breast cancers was associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes.

In this study we have investigated HRG activation of ErbB2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, and their role in regulating hyaluronan synthase (HAS) activity in human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cells). Immunological and biochemical analyses indicate that ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are all expressed in SK-OV-3.ipl cells and that ErbB4 (but not ErbB3) is physically linked to ErbB2 following HRG stimulation. Furthermore, our data indicate that the HRG-induced ErbB2.ErbB4 complexes stimulate ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, which induces both ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated ERK then increases the phosphorylation of HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. Consequently, all three HAS isozymes are activated resulting in hyaluronan (HA) production. Because HRG-mediated HAS isozyme phosphorylation/activation can be effectively blocked by either AG825 (an ErbB2 inhibitor) or thiazolidinedione compound (an ERK blocker), we conclude that ErbB2-ERK signaling and HAS isozyme phosphorylation/HA production are functionally coupled in SK-OV-3.ipl cells. HRG also promotes HA- and CD44-dependent oncogenic events (e.g. CD44-Cdc42 association, p21-activated kinase 1 activation, and p21-activated kinase 1-filamin complex formation) and tumor cell-specific behaviors in an ErbB2-ERK signaling-dependent manner. Finally, we have found that the down-regulation of HAS isozyme expression (by transfecting cells with HAS1/HAS2/HAS3-specific small interfering RNAs) not only inhibits HRG-mediated HAS phosphorylation/activation and HA production but also impairs CD44-specific Cdc42-PAK1/filamin signaling, cytoskeleton activation and tumor cell behaviors. Taken together, these findings clearly indicate that HRG activation of ErbB2-ERK signaling modulates HAS phosphorylation/activation and HA production leading to CD44-mediated oncogenic events and ovarian cancer progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of ErbB2, a receptor-like tyrosine kinase, is shared by several types of human carcinomas. In breast tumors the extent of overexpression has a prognostic value, thus identifying the oncoprotein as a target for therapeutic strategies. Already, antibodies to ErbB2 are used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of metastasizing breast cancer. The mechanisms underlying the oncogenic action of ErbB2 involve a complex network in which ErbB2 acts as a ligand-less signaling subunit of three other receptors that directly bind a large repertoire of stroma-derived growth factors. The major partners of ErbB2 in carcinomas are ErbB1 (also called EGFR) and ErbB3, a kinase-defective receptor whose potent mitogenic action is activated in the context of heterodimeric complexes. Why ErbB2-containing heterodimers are relatively oncopotent is a function of a number of processes. Apparently, these heterodimers evade normal inactivation processes, by decreasing the rate of ligand dissociation, internalizing relatively slowly and avoiding the degradative pathway by returning to the cell surface. On the other hand, the heterodimers strongly recruit survival and mitogenic pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Hyper-activated signaling through the ErbB-signaling network results in dysregulation of the cell cycle homeostatic machinery, with upregulation of active cyclin-D/CDK complexes. Recent data indicate that cell cycle regulators are also linked to chemoresistance in ErbB2-dependent breast carcinoma. Together with D-type cyclins, it seems that the CDK inhibitor p21waf1 plays an important role in evasion from apoptosis. These recent findings herald a preliminary understanding of the output layer which connects elevated ErbB-signaling to oncogenesis and chemoresistance.",

Here we show that trastuzumab significantly reduces the number of circulating and disseminated tumor cells (CTCs and DTCs) in this xenograft model system at a time when the primary tumor is already unresponsive to trastuzumab. This observation suggests that ErbB2 positive CTCs and DTCs might be sensitive to trastuzumab-mediated ADCC even if when the primary tumor is already non-responsive.

In contrast EGF has no effect on T47D cell cycle progression. By comparing these two ligands and the use of specific inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38MAPK, we have identified several molecular mechanisms required for ErbB receptor-mediated proliferation. The PI3K, MAPK and p38MAPK pathways each displayed distinct activation profiles in response to either HRG or EGF, with obvious differences in both the intensity and duration of signal output. Through inhibition of each of these pathways it is apparent that each pathway is necessary, yet insufficient alone, to stimulate proliferation. Each pathway regulates distinct subsets of essential cell cycle regulators and integration of these signal networks is required for the timely expression of these components, which culminates in cell cycle progression. Significantly, the mechanisms controlling ligand-stimulated proliferation through ErbB2 are strikingly similar to the mechanisms through which overexpressed, constitutively activated, ErbB2 orchestrates uncontrolled proliferation in cancer cells. This suggests that downstream effectors of ErbB receptors represent good therapeutic targets for breast cancer.",

Chromosome 17 contains at least four genes implicated in breast cancer (TP53, ERBB2 (Her2/neu), BRCA1, and NM23), as well as other putative tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes implicated in loss of heterozygosity or allelic imbalance studies. Allelic imbalance represents the addition or loss of genetic material in tumor samples, providing circumstantial evidence for the location of cancer related genes. We have analyzed a panel of 85 breast tumor/normal tissue pairs with 21 PCR-based short tandem repeat (STR) markers located at 17q12-qter to more precisely define regions of allelic imbalance and to determine their relation to clinical parameters. Our analysis revealed at least four common regions of allelic imbalance: proximal to BRCA1, including D17S800 (17q12); distal to NM23 around D17S787 (17q22); near the growth hormone (GH) locus, at D17S948 (17q23-24); and between markers D17S937 and D17S802 (17q25). These data also reveal that loss (or gain) of 17q genetic material correlates with poorly differentiated (grade III) tumors (P = < 0.001), high S phase fraction (P = 0.034), and positive TP53 immunohistochemical staining (P = 0.011).

Using them as models of human EACs, we studied tumors arising in F1 and F2 progeny from BDII animals crossed to animals from two other inbred strains, in which EACs were quite rare. In order to identify chromosomal regions exhibiting DNA copy number changes, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was applied in a series corresponding to 27 different solid tumors, most of which were classified as EACs, from these animals. The main findings from the study were that, although many different chromosomes were involved in copy number variation, some of the changes detected were recurrent and quite specific. Among specific changes found were gains in rat chromosome (RNO) regions 4q12 approximately q22, 6q14 approximately q16, and whole chromosome arms in some of the small metacentric chromosomes (e.g., RNO14, 16, and 18). RNO10 was involved in gain in the terminal and proximal regions. Each of these regions contains previously identified cancer-related genes representing possible candidates to be involved in the development of EAC. Furthermore, it was observed that there were clear differences in the pattern of copy number changes between tumors occurring in the two different crosses, and also between solid tumors and cell cultures. Endometrial cancer is the most common human gynecological cancer, but not much is known about specific genetic changes influencing this disease. Two genetic alterations that have been reported from human endometrial cancer are amplification of the ERBB2 gene and mutations in the 12 codon of the KRAS gene. One case of Erbb2 amplification was found but there were no Kras mutations in the rat material studied. We conclude that molecular genetic analysis of the rat BDII model will provide important new information about EAC in mammals.",

The SKBR-3 cells stably expressing t-DARPP developed resistance to trastuzumab compared with their parental cells and empty vector controls (P < 0.01). The trastuzumab-resistant cell lines showed a significant increase in pAKT (Ser(473)) and BCL2 protein levels.

Gastric cancer cells with fibroblastoid morphological changes show increased motility and invasiveness due to decreased cell-cell adhesion, which are reminiscent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during embryonic development. Here, EMT signaling networks in gastric cancer were reviewed. E-cadherin at adherens junction is a key molecular target of EMT. CDH1 gene at human chromosome 16q22.1 encodes E-cadherin. Familial diffuse type gastric cancer occurs due to germ-line mutations of the CDH1 gene. Down-regulation of E-cadherin function due to mutation, deletion, CpG hyper-methylation, and SNAIL (SNAI1)- or SIP1-mediated transcriptional repression of the CDH1 gene leads to EMT in gastric cancer. Amplification of ERBB2, MET, FGFR2, PIK3CA, AKT1 genes, up-regulation of WNT2, WNT2B, WNT8B, and down-regulation of SFRP1 lead to EMT in gastric cancer through GSK3beta inhibition and following SNAIL-mediated CDH1 repression. Claudin (CLDN) and PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex at tight junction are other key molecular targets of EMT. CLDN23 gene is down-regulated in intestinal type gastric cancer. Down-regulation of PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complex also leads to EMT. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) of genes encoding EMT signaling molecules will be identified as novel risk factors of gastric cancer. In addition, antibodies, RNAi compounds, and small molecular inhibitors for EMT signaling molecules will be developed as novel therapeutic agents for gastric cancer. Personalized medicine based on the combination of genetic screening and novel therapeutic agents could dramatically improve the prognosis of gastric cancer patients in the future.",

Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was used to analyze the CD44 mRNA expression level in NSCLC tissue and DNA sequencing was performed to further verify the CD44 expression level. Differentially expressed genes between tumor tissues and controls were determined by DNA sequencing and the Gene_act_net between CD44 and its associated genes was constructed.

We therefore investigated the mechanisms by which p27(Kip1) inhibits mammary tumor onset. Using the common background strain of FVB, p27(Kip1) heterozygosity (p27(+/-)) accelerated ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. We conducted microarray analyses of mammary tumors developing in mice with genetic haploinsufficiency for p27(Kip1) expressing a mammary-targeted ErbB2 oncogene. Global gene expression profiling and Western blot analysis of ErbB2/p27(+/-) tumors showed that the loss of p27(Kip1) induced genes promoting lymphangiogenesis, cellular proliferation, and collaborative oncogenic signaling (Wnt/beta-catenin/Tcf, Cdc25a, Smad7, and Skp2). Skp2 expression was induced by ErbB2 and repressed by p27(Kip1). Degradation of p27(Kip1) involves an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, including Skp2. The Skp2 component of the SCF(SKP2) complex that degrades p27(Kip1) was increased in ErbB2 tumors correlating with earlier tumor onset. In both murine and human ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, p27(Kip1) levels correlated inversely with Skp2. p27(Kip1) haploinsufficiency activated Wnt/beta-catenin/hedgehog signaling. Reintroduction of p27(Kip1) inhibited beta-catenin induction of Tcf-responsive genes (Siamosis, c-Myc, and Smad7). p27(Kip1) is haploinsufficient for ErbB2 mammary tumor suppression in vivo and functions to repress collaborative oncogenic signals including Skp2 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.",

Lapatinib pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in scid(-/-) mice.;The median IC(50) value for lapatinib against the entire PPTP cell line panel was 6.84 microM (range, 2.08 to >10.0 microM). Lapatinib was well tolerated in vivo, with toxicity in only 1.5% of the treated animals. Lapatinib induced significant differences in EFS distribution compared to controls in 1 of 41 xenografts tested. No objective responses were observed in any of the solid tumor panels or in the ALL panel. Lapatinib systemic exposure was consistent with previously observed values.;Lapatinib has little activity against the xenografts of the PPTP's in vivo panel, and its in vitro activity occurs at concentrations above those associated with specific EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition. These results likely reflect lack of ErbB2 overexpression in the models studied and suggest that adult and pediatric cancers may fundamentally differ in the applicability of EGFR family members as therapeutic targets.",

However, the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study.We took advantage of well-established in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in LDL-cholesterol favouring BC growth and invasiveness. We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and stages.Our data show that LDL-cholesterol (but not HDL-cholesterol) promotes BC cells proliferation, migration and loss of adhesion, hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in hypercholesterolemic mice, which also have more frequently lung metastases. Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and ERK pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL, confirmed by WB analyses. Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of ErbB2 signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules (cadherin-related family member3, CD226, Claudin 7 and Ocludin) in the cells exposed to LDL.Together, the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high LDL-cholesterol levels promote BC progression.

The bitransgenic tumours were less organised, had more mitotic figures and fewer apoptotic cells. However, many bitransgenic tumours displayed areas of extensive necrosis compared with tumours from MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice. The two tumour types demonstrate dramatically different expression and activation of EGFR family members, as well as different metabolic profiles. c-ErbB2 tumours demonstrate overexpression of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4, and activation/phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3, underscoring the importance of the entire EGFR family in ErbB2-induced tumourigenesis. Tumours from bitransgenic mice overexpress the myr-Akt1 and ErbB2 transgenes, but there was dramatically less overexpression and phosphorylation of ErbB3, diminished phosphorylation of ErbB2, decreased level of EGFR protein and undetectable ErbB4 protein. There was also an observable attenuation in a subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated secondary signalling molecules in the bitransgenic tumours compared with c-ErbB2 tumours, but Erk was activated/phosphorylated in both tumour types. Finally, the bitransgenic tumours were metabolically more active as indicated by increased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, elevated lactate production and decreased intracellular glucose (suggesting increased glycolysis).;Expression of activated Akt1 in MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice accelerates tumourigenesis with a reduced requirement for signalling through the EGFR family, as well as a reduced requirement for a subset of downstream signaling molecules with a metabolic shift in the tumours from bitransgenic mice.

We have recently shown that peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domains of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and ErbB2 receptors inhibit their corresponding receptor activation in cancer cell lines. We extend this observation to cells transfected with chimeric insulin receptors where the transmembrane domain has been replaced by that of the EGF receptor or a mutated Erb2 domain. Peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and ErbB2 are able to inhibit specifically the autophosphorylation of insulin receptors with the corresponding domain. This inhibitory effect is correlated with the propensity of the different transmembrane domains to self-associate in a genetic reporter assay. Thus, our data strengthen the notion that transmembrane domains are involved in erbB receptor activation, and that these receptors can be modulated by inhibiting protein-protein interactions within the membrane.",

Although the upregulation of ERBB3, a pseudo-kinase member of the EGFR/ERBB family, is known to contribute to EGFR inhibitor resistance in other cancers, its functions in normal and malignant intestinal epithelium have not been defined. We have shown here that the intestinal epithelium of mice with intestine-specific genetic ablation of Erbb3 exhibits no cytological abnormalities but does exhibit loss of expression of ERBB4 and sensitivity to intestinal damage. By contrast, intestine-specific Erbb3 ablation resulted in almost complete absence of intestinal tumors in the ApcMin mouse model of colon cancer. Unlike nontransformed epithelium lacking ERBB3, intestinal tumors lacking ERBB3 had reduced PI3K/AKT signaling, which led to attenuation of tumorigenesis via a tumor-specific increase in caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. Consistent with the mouse data, which suggest that ERBB3-ERBB4 heterodimers contribute to colon cancer survival, experimentally induced loss of ERBB3 in a KRAS mutant human colon cancer cell line was associated with loss of ERBB4 expression, and siRNA knockdown of either ERBB3 or ERBB4 resulted in elevated levels of apoptosis. These results indicate that the ERBB3 pseudo-kinase has essential roles in supporting intestinal tumorigenesis and suggest that ERBB3 may be a promising target for the treatment of colorectal cancers.",

Computational analysis of the promoter composition of the genes within these signatures may provide a powerful method for deducing the regulatory transcriptional networks that mediate their collective function. In this study we have systematically analyzed the promoter composition of gene classes derived from previously established genetic signatures that recently have been shown to reliably and reproducibly distinguish five molecular subtypes of breast cancer associated with distinct clinical outcomes. Inferences made from the trends of transcription factor binding site enrichment in the promoters of these gene groups led to the identification of regulatory pathways that implicate discrete transcriptional networks associated with specific molecular subtypes of breast cancer. One of these inferred pathways predicted a role for nuclear factor-kappaB in a novel feed-forward, self-amplifying, autoregulatory module regulated by the ERBB family of growth factor receptors. The existence of this pathway was verified in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation and shown to be deregulated in breast cancer cells overexpressing ERBB2. This analysis indicates that approaches of this type can provide unique insights into the differential regulatory molecular programs associated with breast cancer and will aid in identifying specific transcriptional networks and pathways as potential targets for tumor subtype-specific therapeutic intervention.",

HER2 amplification and hyperactivation drive the growth and survival of breast cancers through the aberrant activation of proto-oncogenic signaling systems, particularly the Ras/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways. Although HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancer was originally considered to be a highly aggressive form of the disease, the clinical landscape of HER2(+) breast cancers has literally been transformed by the approval of anti-HER2 agents for adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Indeed, pertuzumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that functions as an anti-HER2 agent by targeting the extracellular dimerization domain of the HER2 receptor; it is also the first drug to receive an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in neoadjuvant settings in early-stage HER2(+) breast cancer. Here, we review the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of HER2 in breast cancer, as well as summarize the landmark preclinical and clinical findings underlying the approval and use of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. Finally, the molecular mechanisms operant in mediating resistance to anti-HER2 agents, and perhaps to pertuzumab as well, will be discussed, as will the anticipated clinical impact and future directions of pertuzumab in breast cancer patients.

Nine lncRNAs were identified to be significantly associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the training dataset of 254 patients using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. These nine lncRNAs were then combined to form a single prognostic signature for predicting metastatic risk in breast cancer patients that was able to classify patients in the training dataset into high- and low-risk subgroups with significantly different MFSs (median 2.4 years versus 3.0 years, log-rank test p < 0.001). This nine-lncRNA signature was similarly effective for prognosis in a testing dataset and two independent datasets. Further analysis showed that the predictive ability of the signature was independent of clinical variables, including age, ER status, ESR1 status and ERBB2 status.

A number of molecular approaches have been developed to block these pathways, and studies have already proven the clinical benefit of this concept in PDAC. In the present study, we sought to determine the potential role of heregulins (HRGs), a family of EGF-like growth factors, in PDAC. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that HRGs as well as its signaling ErbB receptors were present in 4 of 4 human pancreatic cancer cell lines (PCCL). HRG-beta1 stimulated the growth of 3 of 4 PCCL, whereas HRG-alpha1 inhibited cell growth in 3 of 4 cell lines. Responses towards HRGs could in part be predicted by ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression levels. HRGs induced phosphorylation of different ErbB receptors as well as activation of MAPK, p38MAPK, JNK and PI3K in a cell- and ligand-specific manner. In vivo, HRG was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and localized predominantly in the cancer cells. High HRG-beta levels but not HRG-alpha levels were associated with decreased patient survival.

We employed phosphoproteomic analysis and functional assays of the response of SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin as a strategy to identify kinases as candidate druggable targets to sensitize cells to platinum. A SILAC-based approach combined with TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment allowed the direct identification of ERK1/2, p90RSK, and ERBB2 as kinases whose phosphorylation is regulated by cisplatin. Bioinformatic analysis revealed enrichment in linear phosphorylation motifs predicted to be targets of p38MAPK, CDK2, and PIM2. All three PIM kinases were found expressed in a panel of 10 ovarian cancer cell lines, with the oncogenic PIM2 being the most commonly induced by cisplatin. Targeting PIM2 kinase by either biochemical inhibitors or RNA interference impaired cell growth, decreased cisplatin-triggered BAD phosphorylation, and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to drug-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of PIM2 triggered anchorage-independent growth and resulted in increased BAD phosphorylation and cell resistance to DNA damaging agents. The data show that the PIM2 kinase plays a role in the response of ovarian cancer cells to platinum drugs and suggest that PIM inhibitors may find clinical application as an adjunct to platinum-based therapies.

On comparison of the CRC primary tumor and matched adjacent normal mucosa (ANM) tissue samples, the mRNA expression levels of ErbB3, but not ErbB1, were significantly increased in CRC tissue samples, compared with those in the ANM tissues. The expression levels of the ligands exhibited opposing trends to their corresponding receptors, including EGF, BTC, AREG, EREG and HB‑EGF, which were increased in the CRC tissues, whereas NRG1 and NGR2 were decreased in thee CRC tissues, compared with those in the AMN tissues. Subsequently, the present study investigated the frequency of K-ras mutations in the patients with CRC. The K‑ras mutations were found to be present in 36.8% (45/122) of the cases, however, no correlation was observed between K‑ras mutations and clinicopathological characteristics. In the CRC tissues, the expression levels of the EGFR family receptors and their ligands were determined in wild-type and mutant K-ras CRC cases. The expression levels of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, BTC, AREG, EREG, NRG1 and NRG2 were significantly decreased in the mutant K‑ras cases, compared with those in the wild‑type K‑ras cases. These results suggested that the tumorigenesis of CRC with wild‑type K‑ras was mediated through, not only ErbB1, but also through the ErbB2 and ErbB3 pathways. Notably, although ErbB2 does not bind any ErbB ligands, ErbB2 may activate tumorigenesis via a heterodimer, rather than a homodimer. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that the most effective strategy to target not only ErbB1, but also ErbB2 and ErbB3, is the use of monoclonal antibody treatment.",

We carried out microarray phosphatome profiling in 41 estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) BC patients, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), containing both ERBB2+ and ERBB2- in order to characterize the differences between these two groups. We characterized and confirmed the distinct phosphatome of the two main ER- BC subgroups (in two independent microarrays series) and that of ER+ BC (in three large independent series). Our findings point to the importance of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in ER- BCs as some of the most differentially expressed phosphatases (like DUSP4 and DUSP6) sharing ERK as substrate, or regulating the PI3K pathway (INPP4B, PTEN). It was possible to identify a selective group of phosphatases upregulated only in the ER- ERBB2+ subgroup and not in ER+ (like DUSP6, DUSP10 and PPAPDC1A among others), suggesting a role of these phosphatases in specific BC subtypes, unlike other differentially expressed phosphatases (DUSP4 and ENPP1) that seemed to have a role in multiple BC subtypes. Significant correlation was found at the protein level by IHC between the expression of DUSP6 and phospho-ERK (p=0.04) but not of phospho-ERK with DUSP4. To show the potential prognostic relevance of phosphatases as a functional group of genes, we derived and validated in two large independent BC microarray series a multiphosphatase signature enriched in differentially expressed phosphatases, to predict distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).

Patients selected had 5-year post-surgery recurrences of breast cancer and had an average of 58.5 years of age. The variables considered in these patients were the quadrants involved, stage of the tumor, type of recurrence, type of exams, type of surgery, the grade of tumor in relation to Broder's classification and pathology of tumor. The results indicated that the superior external right and left quadrants, Stage IIA, loco-regional recurrences, lumpectomies with axillar lymph node removal and after 5 years, Grade II were prevalent in this population. Among the pathologies analyzed, the ductal carcinomas were the most commonly found and were positive for PCNA, beta-catenin, cytokeratin 18 and ErbB2 protein expression. A median follow-up of 60 months of survival was achieved in 95% of patients. However, those cases with a recurrence of breast cancer had only 40% survival.

The loss of 14-3-3sigma is a common event in breast cancer; however, the role of other 14-3-3s in breast cancer is unclear. Recently, we found that 14-3-3zeta overexpression occurs in early stage breast diseases and contributes to transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that 14-3-3zeta overexpression also persisted in invasive ductal carcinoma and contributed to the further progression of breast cancer. To examine the clinical effect of 14-3-3zeta overexpression in advanced stage breast cancer, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 14-3-3zeta expression in primary breast carcinomas. 14-3-3zeta overexpression occurred in 42% of breast tumors and was determined to be an independent prognostic factor for reduced disease-free survival. 14-3-3zeta overexpression combined with ErbB2 overexpression and positive lymph node status identified a subgroup of patients at high risk for developing distant metastasis. To investigate whether 14-3-3zeta overexpression causally promotes breast cancer progression, we overexpressed 14-3-3zeta by stable transfection or reduced 14-3-3zeta expression by siRNA in cancer cell lines. Increased 14-3-3zeta expression enhanced anchorage-independent growth and inhibited stress-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of 14-3-3zeta reduced anchorage-independent growth and sensitized cells to stress-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Transient blockade of 14-3-3zeta expression by siRNA in cancer cells effectively reduced the onset and growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Therefore, 14-3-3zeta overexpression is a novel molecular marker for disease recurrence in breast cancer patients and may serve as an effective therapeutic target in patients whose tumors overexpress 14-3-3zeta.",

Deregulation of autophagy is involved in the progression of cancer. However, the predictive value of autophagy for breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. First, based on gene expression profiling, we found that autophagy genes were implicated in breast cancer. Then, using the Cox proportional hazard regression model, we detected autophagy prognostic signature for breast cancer in a training dataset. We identified a set of eight autophagy genes (BCL2, BIRC5, EIF4EBP1, ERO1L, FOS, GAPDH, ITPR1 and VEGFA) that were significantly associated with overall survival in breast cancer. The eight autophagy genes were assigned as a autophagy-related prognostic signature for breast cancer. Based on the autophagy-related signature, the training dataset GSE21653 could be classified into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with significantly different survival times (HR = 2.72, 95% CI = (1.91, 3.87); P = 1.37 × 10(-5)). Inactivation of autophagy was associated with shortened survival of breast cancer patients. The prognostic value of the autophagy-related signature was confirmed in the testing dataset GSE3494 (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = (1.48, 3.03); P = 1.65 × 10(-3)) and GSE7390 (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = (1.22, 2.54); P = 9.95 × 10(-4)). Further analysis revealed that the prognostic value of the autophagy signature was independent of known clinical prognostic factors, including age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, ERBB2 status, lymph node status and TP53 mutation status. Finally, we demonstrated that the autophagy signature could also predict distant metastasis-free survival for breast cancer.",

We explored the ability of representative phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 Kinase)/mTOR and HSP90 inhibitors to overcome TRAIL resistance by increasing apoptosis in colorectal cancer models. We determined the sensitivity of 27 human colorectal cancer and 2 non-transformed colon epithelial cell lines to TRAIL treatment. A subset of the cancer cell lines with a range of responses to TRAIL was selected from the panel for treatment with TRAIL combined with the PI3 Kinase/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 or the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG (tanespimycin). Two TRAIL-resistant cell lines were selected for in vivo combination studies with TRAIL and 17-AAG. We found that 13 colorectal cancer cell lines and the 2 non-transformed colon epithelial cell lines were resistant to TRAIL. We demonstrated that co-treatment of TRAIL and PI-103 or 17-AAG was synergistic or additive and significantly enhanced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. This was associated with decreased expression or activity of survival protein biomarkers such as ERBB2, AKT, IKKα and XIAP. In contrast, the effect of the combination treatments in non-transformed colon cells was minimal. We show here for the first time that co-treatment in vivo with TRAIL and 17-AAG in two TRAIL-resistant human colorectal cancer xenograft models resulted in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition compared to single treatments. We propose that combining TRAIL with PI3 Kinase/mTOR or HSP90 inhibitors has therapeutic potential in the treatment of TRAIL-resistant colorectal cancers. ",

Hsf1(+/+)Neu(+) mammary epithelial cells exposed to TGFβ show high levels of ERK1/2 activity and EMT; this is associated with reduced expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of Slug and vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. In contrast, Hsf1(-/-)Neu(+) or Hsf1(+/+)Neu(+) cells do not exhibit activated ERK1/2 and show reduced EMT in the presence of TGFβ. The ineffective activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in cells with reduced levels of HSF1 is due to the low levels of HSP90 in complex with RAF1 that are required for RAF1 stability and maturation.

Studies examining the effects of anthracyclines in cardiac myocytes inA vitro have demonstrated several forms of cellular injury. Cell death in response to anthracyclines can be observed by one of several mechanisms including apoptosis and necrosis. Cell death by apoptosis can be inhibited by dexrazoxane, the iron chelator that is known to prevent clinical development of heart failure at high cumulative anthracycline exposure. Together with clinical evidence for myocyte death after anthracycline exposure, in the form of elevations in serum troponin, make myocyte cell death a probable mechanism for anthracycline-induced cardiac injury. Other mechanisms of myocyte injury include the development of cellular \\'sarcopenia\\' characterized by disruption of normal sarcomere structure. Anthracyclines suppress expression of several cardiac transcription factors, and this may play a role in the development of myocyte death as well as sarcopenia. Degradation of the giant myofilament protein titin may represent an important proximal step that leads to accelerated myofilament degradation. Titin is an entropic spring element in the sarcomere that regulates length-dependent calcium sensitivity. Thus titin degradation may lead to impaired diastolic as well as systolic dysfunction, as well as potentiate the effect of suppression of transcription of sarcomere proteins. An interesting interaction has been noted clinically between anthracyclines and newer cancer therapies that target the erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Studies of erbB2 function in viro suggest that signaling through erbB2 by the growth factor neuregulin may regulate cardiac myocyte sarcomere turnover, as well as myocyte-myocyte/myocyte-matrix force coupling. A combination of further in vitro studies, with more careful monitoring of cardiac function after exposure to these cancer therapies, may help to understand to what extent these mechanisms are at work during clinical exposure of the heart to these important pharmaceuticals.",

Anchorage-independent three-dimensional (3D) growth assays are considered to be the gold-standard for chemosensitivity testing, and leads identified with these assays have high probability of clinical success. The Cancer BioChip System (CBCS) allows for the simultaneous, quantitative, and real time evaluation of multitudes of anchorage-independent breast cancer cell growth inhibitors. We employed a Test Cancer BioChip that contains silencing RNAs (siRNAs) targeting cancer-related genes to identify 3D-specific effectors of breast cancer cell growth. We compared the effect of these siRNAs on colony growth of the hormone receptor positive (MCF7) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2/c- Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2/c-erb-b2) positive (SK-BR-3) cells on the Test Cancer BioChip.

Anticancer vaccines have been extensively tested, in this field, both in preclinical cancer models and in the clinic. However, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are often self-tolerated molecules and cancer patients suffer from strong immunosuppressive effects, meaning that the triggering of an effective anti-tumor immune response is difficult. One possible means to overcome immunological tolerance to self-TAAs is of course the use of vaccines that code for xenogeneic proteins. However, a low-affinity antibody response against the self-homologous protein expressed by cancer cells is generally induced by xenovaccination. This issue becomes extremely limiting when working with tumors in which the contribution of the humoral rather than the cellular immune response is required if tumor growth is to be hampered. A possible way to avoid this problem is to use hybrid vaccines which code for chimeric proteins that include both homologous and xenogeneic moieties.

We hypothesized that the targeting of CDC37 using siRNAs would compromise the maturation of these clients and increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors. Here, we show that silencing of CDC37 in human colon cancer cells diminished the association of kinase clients with HSP90 and reduced levels of the clients ERBB2, CRAF, CDK4 and CDK6, as well as phosphorylated AKT. CDC37 silencing promoted the proteasome-mediated degradation of kinase clients, suggesting a degradation pathway independent from HSP90 binding. Decreased cell signalling through kinase clients was also demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates and colon cancer cell proliferation was subsequently reduced by the inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition. Furthermore, combining CDC37 silencing with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG induced more extensive and sustained depletion of kinase clients and potentiated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Interestingly however both antibodies blocked adhesion-independent growth in a panel of breast cancer cell lines.

Various detection technologies and devices have been developed to enumerate and characterize CTCs. Most of those approaches are based on the positive enrichment strategy and immunocytological techniques. However, the sensitivity of these approaches proved to be limited in metastatic tumors and the detection of early tumor cell dissemination was problematic. In the present study, we developed a novel CTC detection method by real-time RT-PCR technique in combination of negative enrichment strategy. The developed enrichment approach could recover more than 75% of spiked breast cancer cells from peripheral blood. The detection limit of duplex real-time RT-PCR assay using KRT19 and ERBB2 as targeted genes was consistently one breast tumor cell. Moreover, CTC detection by duplex real-time RT-PCR assay had higher detection sensitivity than that by immunostaining, especially in early breast cancer. In summary, the results of the present study indicated the potential clinical utilities of CTCs identification on breast cancer by duplex real-time RT-PCR in combination with negative enrichment. ",

Recently, our group described these breast cancer subtypes in 50 non-BRCA1/2 familial tumors using immunohistochemistry assays. We extended this study to the other classes of familial breast cancer (FBC), including 62 tumors (18 BRCA1, 16 BRCA2 and 28 non-BRCA1/2), with the same panel of 25 immunohistochemical (IHC) markers and histological grade obtaining a similar classification. We combined these data with results generated by a 1 Mb BAC array-based CGH study to evaluate the genomic aberrations of each group. We found that BRCA1-related tumors are preferentially basal-like, whereas non-BRCA1/2 familial tumors are mainly luminal A subtype. We described distinct GAPs related to each IHC subtype. Basal tumors had a greater number of gains/losses, while luminal B tumors had more high-level DNA amplifications.

We found that ErbB3 was present at high levels in five of seven human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines examined, along with its ligands, heregulins alpha and beta, whereas ErbB3 was absent from HPL1D, a non- transformed cell line from human pulmonary peripheral epithelium. Interactions and effects of ErbB3 were studied in detail in adenocarcinoma lines H441 and H1373. Complexes containing phosphorylated ErbB2, phosphorylated ErbB3 and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositidyl 3-kinase were detected by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and were present constitutively even in the absence of serum-stimulated cell division. Serum treatment increased the pErbB3/p85 complexes and also stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta, increase in cyclin D1 and cell cycle progression, and these events were blocked by the Akt activation inhibitor LY294002. An ErbB3-specific antisense oligonucleotide reduced amounts of ErbB3 protein and p85 complex in both cell lines, and significantly suppressed cell proliferation. These results together suggest involvement of ErbB3 in growth of lung adenocarcinomas, through activation of phosphoinositidyl 3 kinase and Akt, inactivation of GSK3beta and stabilization of cyclin D1 for cell cycle maintenance.

It is downregulated in most normal cells, except in lipogenic tissues such as liver, lactating breast, fetal lung, and adipose tissue. Conversely, several human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), overexpress FASN, which has been associated with poor prognosis and recently suggested as a metabolic oncoprotein. Orlistat is an irreversible inhibitor of FASN activity with cytotoxic properties on several cancer cell lines that inhibits tumor progression and metastasis in prostate cancer xenografts and experimental melanomas, respectively. To explore whether the inhibition of FASN could impact oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) metastatic spread, an orthotopic model was developed by the implantation of SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells into the tongue of BALB/c nude mice. These cells were isolated through in vivo selection, show a more invasive behavior in vitro than the parental cells, and generate orthotopic tumors that spontaneously metastasize to cervical lymph nodes in 10 to 15 days only. SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells also exhibit enhanced production of MMP-2, ERBB2, and CDH2. The treatment with orlistat reduced proliferation and migration, promoted apoptosis, and stimulated the secretion of VEGFA165b by SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells. In vivo, the drug was able to decrease both the volume and proliferation indexes of the tongue orthotopic tumors and, importantly, reduced the number of metastatic cervical lymph nodes by 43%. These results suggest that FASN is a potential molecular target for the chemotherapy of patients with OTSCC.",

Since heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) stabilizes various oncoproteins including EGFR and c-Met, the inhibition of Hsp90 activity appears as a rational strategy to develop anticancer drugs. Despite preclinical efficacy of geldanamycin-anasamycin (GA)-derivatives containing benzoquinone moiety as Hsp90 inhibitors, the hepatotoxicity of these GA-derivatives restricts their therapeutic benefit. We have prepared WK-88 series of GA-derivatives, which lack the benzoquinone moiety. In this study, we have examined the anticancer effects of WK88-1 in Met-amplified- and gefitinib-resistant (HCC827GR) NSCLC cells and its parental HCC827 cells. Treatment with WK88-1 reduced the cell viability in both HCC827 and HCC827GR cells, which was associated with marked decrease in the constitutive expression of Hsp90 client proteins, such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Met and Akt. Moreover, WK88-1 attenuated phosphorylation of these Hsp90 client proteins and reduced the anchorage-independent growth of HCC827GR cells. Administration of WK88-1 did not cause hepatotoxicity in animals and significantly reduced the growth of HCC827GR cells xenograft tumors in nude mice. Our study provides evidence that ErbB3 might be a client for Hsp90 in Met-amplified NSCLCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of Hsp90 dampens the activation of EGFR- or c-Met-mediated survival of Met-amplified NSCLCs and that WK88-1 as a Hsp90 inhibitor alleviates gefitinib resistance in HCC827GR cells.

Eleven patients suffering from metastatic breast and colorectal cancers and from malignant melanoma were treated on a compassionate-use basis by intratumoral injection of scFv(FRP5)-ETA into cutaneous lesions once daily for 7-10 days. Total daily doses ranged from 60 to 900 microg, and total doses per treatment cycle ranged from 0.6 to 6.0 mg. Treatment caused injected tumors to shrink in six of the 10 cases evaluated (60%). Complete regression of injected tumor nodules was accomplished in four patients (40%) and partial reduction in tumor size in another two patients (20%). Adverse reactions were restricted to local symptoms such as pain and inflammation at injection sites which were fully reversible. Only in one patient treated at the highest daily doses systemic liver toxicity of grade 2 was observed and treatment was discontinued on day 7.

Cellular immortalization is considered a hallmark of malignancy. However, cancerous mammary epithelial cells (CMECs) that are thought to have passed growth barriers in vivo usually cannot be established long-term in vitro. Here we show that CMECs deprived of their natural environment and grown in conventional complete medium behave similar to NMECs, e.g., they stop producing telomerase and become senescent. Like NMECs, CMECs are rescued by SV40 large T (LT) from senescence but not from crisis. The telomere length of both LT-transformed NMEC (N-LT) and CMEC (C-LT) cells first shortens but later partially recovers after telomerase activation. Both cell types upregulate ErbB2 expression, acquire genetic changes, remain long-term dependent on LT and ErbB2 and are nontumorigenic. Despite these similarities, N-LT and C-LT cells cultured in selection medium show different growth characteristics in 3D culture and in vivo tumorigenesis. Thus, CMECs are under a comparable in vitro selective pressure in conventional monolayer culture as NMECs despite their in vivo malignancy. This data demonstrate that most primary breast cancer cells are still unable to overcome the in vitro growth restrictions and suggest that the relationship of in vitro immortalization and in vivo carcinogenesis should be re-evaluated.",

The monoclonal anti-LeY antibody ABL364 and its humanized version IGN311 immunoprecipitated ErbB1 and ErbB2 from detergent lysates of A431 and SKBR-3, respectively. ABL364 and IGN311 blocked EGF- and heregulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK = extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2] in SKBR-3 and A431 cells. The effect was comparable in magnitude with that of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and apparently noncompetitive with respect to EGF. Stimulation of MAPK by ErbB was dynamin dependent and contingent on receptor internalization. ABL364 and IGN311 changed the intracellular localization of fluorescent EGF-containing endosomes and accelerated recycling of intracellular [(125)I]EGF to the plasma membrane.

The role of endogenous mammary epithelial cell NF-kappaB had not previously been determined in immune-competent animals. Furthermore, the role of the NF-kappaB components, p50 and p65, in tumor growth was not known. Herein, the expression of a stabilized form of the NF-kappaB-inhibiting IkappaBalpha protein (IkappaBalphaSR) in breast tumor cell lines that express oncogenic ErbB2 inhibited DNA synthesis and growth in both two- and three-dimensional cultures. Either NF-kappaB inhibition or selective silencing of p50 or p65 led to a loss of contact-independent tumor growth in vitro. IkappaBalphaSR reversed the features of the oncogene-induced phenotype under three-dimensional growth conditions. The NF-kappaB blockade inhibited ErbB2-induced mammary tumor growth in both immune-competent and immune-deficient mice. These findings were associated with both reduced tumor microvascular density and a reduction in the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor. The expression of IkappaBalphaSR in breast cancer tumors inhibited angiogenesis.

Analysis of the data demonstrated that the Grb7-SH2 domain is dimeric with a dissociation constant of approximately 11 muM.

Forty-one patients (48%) had major response with 3-year survival rate (3-YSR) of 57% compared with 44 patients with minor response and 3-YSR of 25% (P = 0.001). Patients with ERCC1-SNP CC (n = 8) and TT (n = 37) had similar rates of minor response of 70% and 75%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 71% [95% confidence interval (CI 56%-84%)]. PPV increased to 89% (95% CI 73%-96%) when ERCC1-SNP was combined with mRNA markers.;ERCC1-SNP in combination with mRNA ERCC1, DPYD, and ERBB2 from pretherapeutic endoscopic biopsies can predict minor response to chemoradiation, as a basis for individualized therapy of advanced esophageal cancer.",

We investigated the contribution of ERBB3 to the initiation, progression, and therapeutic response of EGFR-induced lung adenocarcinomas using tetracycline- and tamoxifen-inducible transgenic mouse models. Deletion of Erbb3 at the time of induction of mutant EGFR had no effect on tumorigenesis, demonstrating that ERBB3 is not required to initiate tumorigenesis. Tumors that developed in the absence of ERBB3 remained sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and retained activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Interestingly, acute loss of Erbb3 suppressed further growth of established EGFR(L858R)-mediated lung tumors. Four weeks after deletion of Erbb3, the tumors exhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, of the adaptor proteins GAB1 and GAB2, and of the downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK, suggesting that alternative signaling pathways could compensate for loss of Erbb3. Similar to our observations with mouse tumors, we found that GAB adaptor proteins play a role in ERBB3-independent activation of the PI3K pathway by mutant EGFR in EGFR-mutant human cell lines. Finally, in such cell lines, increased levels of phosphorylation of ERBB2 or MET were associated with reduced sensitivity to acute loss of ERBB3, suggesting remarkable plasticity in the signaling pathways regulated by mutant EGFR with important therapeutic implications.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Over the past 30 years, a relatively simple growth factor and its cognate receptor have provided seminal insights into the understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, as well as growth factor signalling. The epidermal growth factor (EGF), its cognate receptor (EGFR) and related family members have been shown to be important in normal, as well as the malignant growth of many cell types including: glioblastomata, astrocytomas, medulloblastomata, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and breast cancer. This review summarises the history of the EGFR gene and the v-ErbB oncogene, as well as diverse approaches developed to inhibit EGFR activity. The two most advanced therapies use either small-molecule cell membrane permeable kinase inhibitors or antibodies which prevent receptor activation. Recent clinical trials indicate that certain NSCLC patients have mutations in the EGFR gene which makes them more responsive to kinase inhibitors. These mutations appear to enhance the ability of the ligand to activate EGFR activity and also prolong the binding of the EGFR inhibitor to the kinase domain. Evidence to date suggests that these EGFR mutations in NSCLC occur more frequently in Japan than in the western hemisphere. Although these mutations are correlated with enhanced efficacy to the inhibitors in NSCLC, they can not explain or predict the sensitivity of many other cancer patients to the beneficial effects of the EGFR kinase inhibitors or antibody mediated therapy. As with as other small-molecule kinase inhibitors and susceptible diseases (e.g., imatinib and chronic myeloid leukaemia), resistance to EGFR inhibitors has been reported recently, documenting the requirement for development of multi-pronged therapeutic approaches. EGFR kinase inhibitors are also being evaluated as adjuvants in hormonal therapy of breast cancer - especially those which overexpress EGFR. Genetically engineered antibodies specific for the EGFR family member ErbB2 have been developed which show efficacy in the treatment of primary, and prevent the relapse of, breast cancer. Clearly, the EGF/EGFR signalling cascade has, and continues to play, an important role in the development of novel anticancer targeted therapies.",

Afatinib resistant H1975 tumor clones expressed less PTEN than control clones and in afatinib resistant clones this correlated with increased basal SRC Y416, ERBB3 Y1289, AKT T308 and mTOR S2448 phosphorylation, decreased expression of ERBB1, ERBB2 and ERBB3 and increased total expression of c-MET, c-KIT and PDGFRβ. Afatinib resistant clones were selectively killed by knock down of [ERBB3 + c-MET + c-KIT] but not by the individual or doublet knock down combinations. The combination of the ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor afatinib with the SRC family inhibitor dasatinib killed afatinib resistant H1975 cells in a greater than additive fashion; other drugs used in combination with dasatinib such as sunitinib, crizotinib and amufatinib were less effective.

Overexpression of human EGF receptor HER-2 (erbB2) leads to amplified heregulin (HRG) signaling, promoting more aggressive breast cancer that is nonresponsive to estrogen and the antiestrogenic drug tamoxifen. Herstatin (Hst), a secreted HER-2 gene product, binds to the HER-2 receptor ectodomain blocking receptor activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of this HER-2 inhibitor on HRG-induced signaling, proliferation, and sensitivity to tamoxifen in breast cancer cells with and without HER-2 overexpression. The expression of Hst in MCF7 cells eliminated HRG signaling through both mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt pathways and prevented HRG-mediated proliferation. The loss in signaling corresponded to downregulation of the HRG receptors, HER-3 and HER-4, whereas HER-2 overexpression strongly stimulated the levels of both HRG receptors. Although Hst blocked HRG signaling in both parental and HER-2 transfected cells, it enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen only in the MCF7 cells that overexpressed HER-2. To evaluate further the efficacy of Hst as an anticancer agent, His-tagged Hst was expressed in transfected insect cells, purified, and added to the breast cancer cells. As in the transfected cells, purified Hst inhibited HER-3 levels and suppressed HRG-induced proliferation of MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells. In contrast, the HER-2 monoclonal antibody, herceptin, downregulated HER-2, but not HER-3. These results suggest the potential use of Hst against HRG-mediated growth of breast cancers with high and low levels of HER-2 and against tamoxifen resistance in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer.",

High ErbB4 protein expression levels, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, associated with a favorable outcome in ER-positive cases from a series of 458 breast cancer patients (P = 0.01), whereas no association between ErbB4 expression and survival was found among women with ER-negative cancer (P = 0.86). However, nuclear ErbB4 immunoreactivity was associated with poor survival as compared with women whose cancer had membranous ErbB4 staining (P = 0.04). In vitro, overexpression of a cleavable ErbB4 isoform in ER-positive breast cancer cells resulted in translocation of a proteolytically released intracellular ErbB4 receptor fragment into the nucleus, as well as, enhanced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and estrogen response element-mediated transcriptional activity. These results suggest that the association of ErbB4 expression with clinical outcome is dependent on the subcellular localization of ErbB4 and that a proteinase-cleavable ErbB4 isoform promotes growth of ER-positive breast cancer and enhances ER-mediated gene transcription.",

We analyzed 98 breast cancer whole exome samples that were sorted into three subtypes, two grades and two stages. The sum deleterious effect of all mutations in each gene was scored to identify differentially mutated genes (DMGs) for this case-control study. DMGs were corroborated using extensive published knowledge. Functional consequences of deleterious SNVs on protein structure and function were also investigated.

Treatment with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has revolutionized the outcome of patients with this aggressive breast cancer subtype, but intrinsic and acquired resistance is common. Growing understanding of the biology and complexity of the HER2 signaling network and of potential resistance mechanisms has guided the development of new HER2-targeted agents. Combinations of these drugs to more completely inhibit the HER receptor layer, or combining HER2-targeted agents with agents that target downstream signaling, alternative pathways, or components of the host immune system, are being vigorously investigated in the preclinical and clinical settings. As a result, the list of more effective and well tolerated FDA-approved new regimens for patients with HER2+ tumors is constantly growing. ",

However, lines of evidence suggest that, besides expression of E6 and E7 genes, additional host genetic alterations are required for cancer development. To directly test this hypothesis, we first transduced HPV16 E6 and E7 with or without hTERT into several lines of normal human cervical keratinocytes (HCK) from independent donors and then searched for additional alterations required for carcinogenesis. Oncogenic Hras(G12V) (Hras) provided marked tumor forming ability in nude mice and ErbB2 or c-Myc (Myc) endowed weaker but significant tumor forming ability. Combined transduction of Myc and Hras to HCKs expressing E6 and E7 resulted in the creation of highly potent tumor-initiating cells. These results show that only one or two genetic changes occurring after deregulated expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes might be sufficient for development of cervical cancer.",

In addition, immunoreactive PCNA and ERBB2, markers of proliferation of ovarian carcinoma, were attenuated in their expression in coumestrol-induced death of ES2 cells. Phosphorylation of AKT, p70S6K, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p90RSK was inactivated by coumestrol treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined in western blot analyses. Moreover, PI3K inhibitors enhanced effects of coumestrol to decrease phosphorylation of AKT, p70S6K, S6, and ERK1/2. Furthermore, coumestrol has strong cancer preventive effects as compared to other conventional chemotherapeutics on proliferation of ES2 cells.

Since epigenetic changes like histone modifications are potentially reversible processes, much effort has been directed toward understanding this mechanism with the goal of finding novel therapies as well as more refined diagnostic and prognostic tools in breast cancer. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by removing the methyl groups from methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 and lysine 9 of histone H3. LSD1 is essential for mammalian development and involved in many biological processes. Considering recent evidence that LSD1 is involved in carcinogenesis, we investigated the role of LSD1 in breast cancer. Therefore, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine LSD1 protein levels in tissue specimens of breast cancer and measured very high LSD1 levels in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors. Pharmacological LSD1 inhibition resulted in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Knockdown of LSD1 using small interfering RNA approach induced regulation of several proliferation-associated genes like p21, ERBB2 and CCNA2. Additionally, we found that LSD1 is recruited to the promoters of these genes. In summary, our data indicate that LSD1 may provide a predictive marker for aggressive biology and a novel attractive therapeutic target for treatment of ER-negative breast cancers.",

Many of the cell lines displayed prominent, localized DNA amplifications by CGH. One-third of these loci affected breast cancer oncogenes, whose amplifications were validated with specific probes: 17q12 (two cell lines with ERBB2 amplifications), 11q13 (two with cyclin-D1), 8p11-p12 (two with FGFR1) and 10q25 (one with FGFR2). Gains and amplifications affecting 8q were the most common genetic alterations in these cell lines with the minimal, common region of involvement at 8q22-q23. No high-level MYC (at 8q24) amplifications were found in any of the cell lines. Two-thirds of the amplification sites took place at loci not associated with established oncogenes, such as 1q41-q43, 7q21-q22, 7q31, 8q23, 9p21-p23, 11p12-p14, 15q12-q14, 16q13-q21, 17q23, 20p11-p12 and 20q13.

The ErbB family of protein tyrosine kinases, in particular the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are commonly overexpressed in many solid human tumours and EGFR was the initial target for a drug discovery programme seeking small molecule inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) enzyme activity. The description of the anilinoquinazoline class of potent and selective TK inhibitors led to several candidate drugs from this chemical class, for example gefitinib ('Iressa') and erlotinib ('Tarceva'), which are being evaluated in breast cancer patients. Rapid advances in cancer molecular genetics have identified numerous potential drug targets associated with abnormal control of cell division either downstream of the ErbBs, for example Ras and MEK, or in erbB-associated signalling networks, like Src kinase, which affect the tumour cell motility and invasiveness. Candidate drugs for several of these targets are currently being evaluated; for example, the prenylation inhibitor AZD3409, a mimetic of the CAAX box of K-Ras, inhibits protein farnesyl and geranylgeranyl tranferases and a novel, selective, orally active Src kinase inhibitor AZD0530 have entered Phase I clinical trials and may have utility in breast cancer therapy.",

Because this particular D-type cyclin has been suggested to be a key mediator for ErbB2-associated mammary tumorigenesis, we deleted Jak2 from ErbB2-expressing mammary epithelial cells prior to tumor onset and in neoplastic cells to address whether this tyrosine kinase plays a role in the initiation as well as progression of mammary cancer. Similar to cyclin D1-deficient mice, the functional ablation of Jak2 protects against the onset of mammary tumorigenesis. In contrast, the deletion of Jak2 from neoplastic cells or the acute, ligand-inducible down-regulation of this tyrosine kinase in an orthotopic transplant model did not affect the growth and survival of cancer cells. The constitutive activation of ErbB2 signaling, which is an initial event in the formation of mammary cancer, was able to override the functional role of Jak2 in regulating the expression of Akt1 and cyclin D1.

Cancer has been characterized as the dysregulation of cell signaling pathways through gradual alteration of regulatory proteins and through gene mutation. Curcumin is a highly pleiotropic molecule that modulates several intracellular signaling pathways in cancer. The pleiotropic activities of curcumin have been attributed to its novel molecular structure. Based on its β-diketone moiety, curcumin exists in keto-enol tautomers, and this tautomerism favors interaction and binding with a wide range of enzymes. Several studies have shown modulation of numerous signaling enzymes by curcumin including, LOX, COX-2, XO, proteasomes, Ca(2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, MMPs, HAT, HDAC, DNMT1, DNA polymerase λ, ribonucleases, GloI, protein kinases (PKA, PKB, PKC, v-Src, GSK-3β, ErbB2), protein reductases (TrxR1, AR), GSH, ICDHs, peroxidases (Prx1, Prx2, Prx6) by treatment with curcumin.

Therefore, we developed a method that was based on quantitative real-time PCR applicable for DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Its limit of detection was determined with breast cancer cell lines and validated with 223 breast cancer patient samples. On the basis of comparisons with fluorescent ISH (FISH) and IHC data, the sensitivity of the new method was 94.2% and 95.1%, its specificity was 100% and 99.1%, and overall concordance between results obtained with the quantitative real-time PCR method and FISH/IHC was 97.6% for both methods. The quantitative real-time PCR method was then used to evaluate the HER2 status of 198 of 3696 breast cancer tissues that yielded indeterminate FISH results. The HER2 copy number was successfully determined in 69.2% of these indeterminate samples.

The study was conducted on 40 paraffin-embedded tissue samples originally taken from either hepatitis C virus (HCV)- or HBV-infected patients using the FISH technique. The level of ERBB2, MYC, and TP53 in the malignant group was significantly increased as compared to the control group. Of the 40 patients, 3 (7.5%) had amplification of ERBB2 gene, 4 (10%) different patients had amplification of MYC, and 26 patients (65%) had evidence of deletion of at least one allele on chromosome 17 for the TP53 gene in a high proportion of cells. There was a significant correlation between amplification of MYC oncogene and the number of tumor masses. Moreover, significant correlation was observed between poorly differentiated tumors when compared with moderate or well-differentiated tumors when MYC was analyzed. On the other hand, MYC failed to reveal any significant association between oncogene amplification and other clinicopathologic variables examined. Univariate analysis revealed a strong association between deletion of TP53 and multiple tumor mass (P< 0.001). No statistical correlation could be detected between deletion of TP53 and tumor size, grade, stage, and tumor differentiation. No significant difference could be detected in the mean survival time of patients positive for the alteration of the genes compared to the patients who showed no alterations for the same genes. However, when the stage of the tumor was analyzed, there was a significant difference in the mean survival time between patients who showed gene alterations compared to patients with no changes in the studied genes. When overall survival was analyzed, only patients with MYC amplification had a lower median survival (20.75 months) than patients without MYC amplification (35.82, P = 0.009).

        "Doc_abstract":"Protein kinase C iota (PKCι), a serine/threonine kinase required for cell polarity, proliferation and migration, is commonly up- or downregulated in cancer. PKCι is a human oncogene but whether this is related to its role in cell polarity and what repertoire of oncogenes acts in concert with PKCι is not known. We developed a panel of candidate oncogene expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and demonstrated that H-Ras, ErbB2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase transformation led to non-polar spheroid morphogenesis (dysplasia), whereas MDCK spheroids expressing c-Raf or v-Src were largely polarized. We show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeting PKCι decreased the size of all spheroids tested and partially reversed the aberrant polarity phenotype in H-Ras and ErbB2 spheroids only. This indicates distinct requirements for PKCι and moreover that different thresholds of PKCι activity are required for these phenotypes. By manipulating PKCι function using mutant constructs, siRNA depletion or chemical inhibition, we have demonstrated that PKCι is required for polarization of parental MDCK epithelial cysts in a 3D matrix and that there is a threshold of PKCι activity above and below which, disorganized epithelial morphogenesis results. Furthermore, treatment with a novel PKCι inhibitor, CRT0066854, was able to restore polarized morphogenesis in the dysplastic H-Ras spheroids. These results show that tightly regulated PKCι is required for normal-polarized morphogenesis in mammalian cells and that H-Ras and ErbB2 cooperate with PKCι for loss of polarization and dysplasia. The identification of a PKCι inhibitor that can restore polarized morphogenesis has implications for the treatment of Ras and ErbB2 driven malignancies. ",

Cardiotoxicity has become a significant problem, and the risks of adverse cardiac events induced by systemic drugs need to be seriously considered. Potential cardiovascular toxicities linked to anticancer agents include arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction, hypertension, thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. It has been shown that several anticancer drugs seriously affect the cardiovascular system, such as ErbB2 inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, multitargeted kinase inhibitors, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog inhibitors, and others. Each of these agents has a different mechanism through which it affects the cardiovascular system. ErbB2 inhibitors block the ErbB4/ErbB2 heterodimerization pathway triggered by Neuregulin-1, which is essential for cardiomyocyte survival. VEGF signaling is crucial for vascular growth, but it also has a major impact on myocardial function, and the VEGF pathway is also essential for maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway lead to a net reduction in capillary density and loss of contractile function. Here, we review the mechanisms and pathophysiology of the most significant cardiotoxic effects of ErbB2 inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs. Moreover, we highlight the role of cardioncology in recognizing these toxicities, developing strategies to prevent or minimize cardiovascular toxicity, and reducing long-term cardiotoxic effects.",

Progressively more stringent criteria and predictive models aim at identifying the smallest subset of genes predictive of cytotoxic potency.;Comparing gene expression with drug potency across the NCI-60 yielded genes with negative and positive correlations (p < 0.001), indicative of a role in chemoresistance and chemosensitivity, respectively. Of 17 genes with multiple negative correlations, 8 are known chemoresistance factors, validating the approach. Negatively correlated genes clustered into two main groups with distinct expression profiles and drug correlations, represented by EGFR and ERBB2 (Her-2/Neu). Accordingly, no synergism was observed between EGFR and ERBB2 inhibitors. However, combinations with classical anticacer drugs were not correlated with EGFR and ERBB2 expression in four cell lines tested, suggesting complex interactions in combination treatments. Finally, a subset of only 13 genes was found to be sufficient for near optimal prediction of drug potency against the NCI-60.;Our approach using a small subset of genes reveals known and potential biomarkers in cancer chemotherapy, providing a strategy for genome-wide analysis.",

In an attempt to improve its characterization, we investigated in a large collection of invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) the status of markers known to be involved in the better-studied invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). In the current study we disposed of 80 well-characterized ILC cases. Gene amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and c-erbB2-encoding gene (ERBB2) and expression of their gene products were studied by differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A comprehensive point mutation study of the phosphatase and tensin homolog tumor suppressor gene (PTEN) was pursued by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)/sequencing analysis. The CCND1 gene was rarely amplified in ILC in spite of showing overexpression of the protein in 41% of tumors. Hence, unlike IDC, increase in gene dosage did not account for the protein excess. PTEN mutations were detected in ILC (truncating mutations) in around 2% of the tumors. Unlike IDC, ILC did not display ERBB2 overexpression and expression of the transcription factor E2F1 correlated inversely with tumor grade. The observed discrepancy in the pattern of the human oncogenes CCND1 and ERBB2, which are involved in the process of carcinogenesis of ductal tumors, appears to suggest a different molecular basis for development and progression of ILC.",

Here, we investigate how a truncated, constitutively active ErbB2 receptor (DeltaNErbB2) common in breast cancer impacts on the Na(+)/H(+)-exchanger NHE1 and the Na(+),HCO(3)(-)-cotransporter NBCn1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and address the roles of these transporters in chemotherapy resistance. Upon DeltaNErbB2 expression, mRNA and protein levels of NBCn1, yet not of NHE1, increased several-fold, and the localization of both transporters was altered paralleling extensive morphological changes. The rate of pH(i) recovery after acid loading increased by 50% upon DeltaNErbB2 expression. Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition confirmed the involvement of both NHE1 and NBCn1 in acid extrusion. NHE1 inhibition or knockdown sensitized DeltaNErbB2-expressing cells to cisplatin-induced programmed cell death (PCD) in a caspase-, cathepsin-, and reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. NHE1 inhibition augmented cisplatin-induced caspase activity and lysosomal membrane permeability followed by cysteine cathepsin release. In contrast, NBCn1 inhibition attenuated cathepsin release and had no net effect on viability. These findings warrant studies of NHE1 as a potential target in breast cancer and demonstrate that in spite of their similar transport functions, NHE1 and NBCn1 serve different functions in MCF-7 cells.",

To identify new therapeutic targets in TNBC, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to analyze 63 TNBC samples in terms of their mRNA expression of 26 genes coding for the major proteins currently targeted by drugs used to treat other cancers or undergoing clinical trials in breast cancer. Six of the 26 genes tested (VEGFA, SRC, PARP1, PTK2, RAF1, and FGFR3) were significantly upregulated in 13% to 46% of the TNBCs. None of the 6 genes was specifically upregulated in the TNBCs compared with 3 other classical breast tumor subtypes. No association was observed between overexpression of these 6 genes (except for FGFR3) and PIK3CA mutation status. These results confirm the interest of targeting VEGFA and PARP1 in ongoing clinical trials in TNBC patients and also identify new target genes (SRC, PTK2, RAF1, and FGFR3).

MCF-7, SKBR-3, and MDA-MB-231 display different signaling and gene signatures profiles due to expression of the estrogen receptor, ErbB2, or neither. Cell proliferation was measured following treatment with dasatinib±cytotoxic (paclitaxel, ixabepilone) or molecularly targeted agents (tamoxifen, rapamycin, sorafenib, pan PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126). Dose-responses for single or combination drugs were calculated and analyzed by the Chou-Talalay method. The drugs with the greatest level of synergy with dasatinib were rapamycin, ixabepilone, and sorafenib, for the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SK-BR-3 cell lines respectively. However, dasatinib synergized with both cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents in all three molecularly heterogeneous breast cancer cell lines. These results suggest that effectiveness of rationally designed therapies may not entirely rest on precise identification of gene signatures or molecular profiling.

Heregulin (HRG)-β1, the ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4, upregulates GPR30 expression in MCF-7, T-47D and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines that express ERα. In the present study, recombinant human HRG-β1 was used to investigate the upregulation of GPR30 expression by HRGs in MCF-7 breast cancer cells which were ERα-positive. In MCF-7 cells, the ErbB2 inhibitor, AG825, the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, blocked the HRG-β1-induced GPR30 expression. 17-β-estradiol (E2) boosted the HRG-β1-induced proliferation, migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells. Similar to E2, the specific GPR30 agonist, G-1, promoted HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion, but inhibited growth. Using the specific GPR30 antagonist, G-15, or the small interfering RNA for GPR30, the functions of GPR30 after treatment with HRG-β1 were further investegated.

Terminal end buds were also analyzed for presence of mitotic figures, apoptotic figures, BrdU incorporation, and expression of E-cadherin, P-cadherin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and cleaved caspase-3.;The mammary ductal trees developed from ErbB3-/- buds only partly filled the mammary fat pad.

        "Doc_abstract":"The invasive and metastatic transformation of cancers often results in death. However, the mechanisms that promote this transformation remain unclear. Two closely related receptors, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2, are overexpressed in a significant percentage of breast and prostate carcinomas, among others, with this up-regulated signaling correlating with tumor progression. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that an EGFR-phospholipase C (PLC)gamma-mediated motility-associated signaling pathway is rate-limiting for tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo in one model of prostate carcinoma. Therefore, we investigated whether this PLCgamma signaling pathway also was rate-limiting for invasion in other tumor cell lines and types and whether this EGFR activity is subsumed by the closely related ErbB2. We determined the effects of PLCgamma signal abrogation by pharmacological (U73122) and molecular (expression of the dominant-negative PLCz) means on the in vitro invasiveness of tumor cells. Inhibition of PLCgamma signaling concomitantly decreased invasiveness of de novo-occurring transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) lines and the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-468 and MDA-231; these lines present up-regulated EGFR signaling. Because the prostate and breast cancer lines usually present autocrine stimulatory loops involving EGFR, we also examined transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate C1 and MDA-468 treated with the EGFR-specific kinase inhibitor PD153035 to determine whether invasiveness is dependent on EGFR signaling. PD153035 reduced invasiveness to levels similar to those seen with U73122, suggesting that the autocrine EGFR stimulatory loop is functioning to promote invasiveness. To determine whether this signaling pathway also promotes invasiveness of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors, we examined the human breast carcinoma line MDA-361; again, U73122 inhibition of PLCgamma decreased invasiveness. In all situations, the inhibition of PLCgamma signaling did not decrease mitogenic signaling. Thus, the motility-associated PLCgamma signaling pathway is a generalizable rate-limiting step for tumor cell progression.",

We have generated a recombinant protein containing a humanized, dimeric single-chain anti-fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14-kDa protein (Fn14) antibody fused to recombinant gelonin toxin as a potential therapeutic agent (designated hSGZ). The hSGZ immunotoxin is a highly potent and selective agent that kills Fn14-positive (Fn14(+)) tumor cells in vitro. Treatment of cells expressing the MDR protein MDR1 (ABCB1B) showed no cross-resistance to hSGZ. Induced overexpression of Fn14 levels in MCF7 cells through HER2 (ERBB2) signaling translated to an improved therapeutic index of hSGZ treatment. In combination with trastuzumab, hSGZ showed an additive or synergistic cytotoxic effect on HER2(+)/Fn14(+) breast cancer cell lines. Also, hSGZ treatment inhibited Erb3/Akt signaling in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed that hSGZ exhibited a biexponential clearance from plasma with a rapid initial clearance (t1/2α = 1.26 hours) followed by a seven-fold longer plasma half-life (t1/2β = 7.29 hours). At 24, 48, and 72 hours after injection, uptake of the hSGZ into tumors was 5.1, 4.8, and 4.7%ID/g, with a tumor-to-muscle ratio of 5.6, 6.2, and 9.0, respectively. Therapeutic efficacy studies showed significant tumor inhibition effects using an MDA-MB-231/Luc breast cancer xenograft model. Our findings show that hSGZ is an effective anticancer agent and a potential candidate for clinical studies.",

To assess and compare the ability of these short CUX1 isoforms in driving mammary tumor development, we used site-specific transgenesis into the Hprt locus to generate transgenic mice expressing p75 or p110 CUX1 under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat. We report that mammary tumors developed after a long latency period, and although various histopathologies were observed, the proportion of adenosquamous carcinomas was significantly higher in p75 CUX1 than in p110 CUX1 transgenic mice. Metastasis to the lung was observed in three p75 CUX1 transgenic mice. Comparisons between tumors and adjacent normal mammary glands revealed that transgenes were overexpressed in most but not all tumors, yet in all cases tested, CUX1 DNA binding was increased, suggesting that both higher expression and changes in post-translational modifications can contribute to stimulate transgene activity. Interestingly, higher expression of erbB2 mRNA was seen in most tumors, not only solid carcinomas but also adenosquamous carcinomas, whereas higher expression of various Wnt genes and activation of the beta-catenin pathway was observed primarily in adenosquamous carcinomas. Activation of erbB2 expression appeared to represent a cooperating event that occurred independently of CUX1. In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, and reporter assays established that CUX1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several Wnt genes. Together, these results support the notion that oncogenic activity of CUX1 can facilitate the establishment of a Wnt/beta-catenin autocrine loop.",

BRCA1 mRNA levels (1.317 +/- 0.277, mean +/- S.E.) of responders were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those (0.609 +/- 0.097) of non-responders but there was no significant difference in BRCA2 mRNA levels between responders (1.590 +/- 0.326) and non-responders (1.586 +/- 0.410).

Response rate (65%) of tumors with high BRCA1 mRNA levels was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that (32%) of tumors with low BRCA1 mRNA levels.

Akt1-deficient mammary epithelial tumor cells (MEC) were reduced in size and proliferative capacity, with reduced cyclin D1 and p27(KIP1) abundance. Akt1 deficiency abrogated the oncogene-induced changes in polarization of MEC in three-dimensional culture and reverted oncogene-induced relocalization of the phosphorylated ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins. Akt1 increased MEC migration across an endothelial cell barrier, enhancing the persistence of migratory directionality. An unbiased proteomic analysis demonstrated Akt1 mediated MEC migration through paracrine signaling via induction of expression and secretion of CXCL16 and MIP1gamma.

RNA was extracted from archival breast tumour tissue of 769 women randomly assigned to the FinHer trial. Cancer ESR1, PGR, ERBB2 and MKI67 mRNA content was quantitated with an RT-qPCR assay. Local pathologists assessed ER, PgR and Ki-67 expression using IHC. HER2 amplification was identified with chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) centrally. The results were correlated with distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS). qPCR-based and IHC-based assessments of ER and PgR showed good concordance. Both low tumour MKI67 mRNA (RT-qPCR) and Ki-67 protein (IHC) levels were prognostic for favourable DDFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.42, 95 % CI 0.25-0.71, P = 0.001; and HR 0.56, 0.37-0.84, P = 0.005, respectively] and OS.

Breast cancer subtypes approximated with RT-qPCR and IHC show good concordance, but cancer MKI67 mRNA content correlated slightly better with DDFS than Ki-67 expression.

Recently global sensitivity analysis (GSA) has been recognised as a useful technique, capable of addressing the uncertainty of the model parameters and generating valid predictions on parametric sensitivities. Here we propose a novel implementation of model-based GSA specially designed to explore how multi-parametric network perturbations affect signal propagation through cancer-related networks. We use area-under-the-curve for time course of changes in phosphorylation of proteins as a characteristic for sensitivity analysis and rank network parameters with regard to their impact on the level of key cancer-related outputs, separating strong inhibitory from stimulatory effects. This allows interpretation of the results in terms which can incorporate the effects of potential anti-cancer drugs on targets and the associated biological markers of cancer. To illustrate the method we applied it to an ErbB signalling network model and explored the sensitivity profile of its key model readout, phosphorylated Akt, in the absence and presence of the ErbB2 inhibitor pertuzumab. The method successfully identified the parameters associated with elevation or suppression of Akt phosphorylation in the ErbB2/3 network. From analysis and comparison of the sensitivity profiles of pAkt in the absence and presence of targeted drugs we derived predictions of drug targets, cancer-related biomarkers and generated hypotheses for combinatorial therapy. Several key predictions have been confirmed in experiments using human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We also compared GSA-derived predictions with the results of local sensitivity analysis and discuss the applicability of both methods. We propose that the developed GSA procedure can serve as a refining tool in combinatorial anti-cancer drug discovery.",

Using magnetic twisting cytometry, cytoskeletal stiffness (g') and internal friction (g″) were measured over a wide frequency range. The dependencies of g' and g″ upon frequency were used to determine the power law exponent x which is a direct measure of cytoskeletal fluidity and quantifies where the cytoskeleton resides along the spectrum of solid-like (x = 1) to fluid-like (x = 2) states. Cytoskeletal fluidity x increased following transformation by H-ras oncogene expression in NIH3T3 cells, overexpression of ErbB2 and 14-3-3-ζ in MCF10A cells, and implantation and growth of PC3M and 253J cells in the prostate and bladder, respectively. Each of these perturbations that had previously been shown to enhance cancer cell motility and invasion are shown here to shift the cytoskeleton towards a more fluid-like state. In contrast, strongly metastatic A375SM and SN12PM6 cells that disseminate by lodging in the microcirculation of peripheral organs had smaller x than did their weakly metastatic cell line pairs A375P and SN12C, respectively. Thus, enhanced hematological dissemination was associated with decreased x and a shift towards a more solid-like cytoskeleton. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that adaptations known to enhance metastatic ability in cancer cell lines define a spectrum of fluid-like versus solid-like states, and the position of the cancer cell within this spectrum may be a determinant of cancer progression.",

One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours, but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)--a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)--is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44(high)CD24(low) population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1α (HIF1α) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and indicate that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.",

As well as being closely linked to breast/ovarian cancer cases, this gene may be involved in up to 45% of site-specific breast cancers. The identification and cloning of the BRCA1 gene is imminent, and will facilitate the screening and counselling of families at risk of breast cancer, and in the longer term may open up new therapeutic possibilities. The tumour suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in 25%-40% of cases of sporadic breast cancer, and is associated with an aggressive tumour phenotype and poor prognosis in both node-positive and node-negative cases. The pattern of mutations in this tumour suppressor gene shows a higher than expected frequency of G to T transversions, mostly restricted to the highly conserved domain in exons 5 to 8. In many, but not all cases, point mutation of one allele is accompanied by deletion of the remaining normal allele at chromosome 17p13. Abnormalities of TP53 appear to be relatively early events in tumorigenesis, being present in ductal carcinoma in situ lesions. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 shows a variety of abnormalities in about 20% of breast cancers, and there may be an association with TP53 mutations. Other abnormalities which occur with a particularly high incidence in breast cancer include allele loss at chromosome 1p/1q, 3p, 6q, 11p, 16q and 18q. The ERBB2 oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase whose ligand has recently been claimed to be the heregulin family in man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In this study, we have acquired data supporting previous observations that demonstrate glutamine metabolism affects histone modifications in human breast cancer cell lines. Treatment of non-invasive epithelial (T-47D and MDA-MB-361) and invasive mesenchymal (MDA-MB-231 and Hs-578T) breast cancer cell lines with the glutaminase inhibitor, Compound 968, resulted in cytotoxicity in all cell lines, with the greatest effect being observed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Compound 968-treatment induced significant downregulation of 20 critical cancer-related genes, the majority of which are anti-apoptotic and/or promote metastasis, including AKT, BCL2, BCL2L1, CCND1, CDKN3, ERBB2, ETS1, E2F1, JUN, KITLG, MYB, and MYC. Histone H3K4me3, a mark of transcriptional activation, was reduced at the promoters of all but one of these critical cancer genes. The decrease in histone H3K4me3 at global and gene-specific levels correlated with reduced expression of SETD1 and ASH2L, genes encoding the histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex. Further, the expression of other epigenetic regulatory genes, known to be downregulated during apoptosis (e.g., DNMT1, DNMT3B, SETD1 and SIRT1), was also downregulated by Compound 968. These changes in gene expression and histone modifications were accompanied by the activation of apoptosis, and decreased invasiveness and resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The results of this study provide evidence to a link between cytotoxicity caused by inhibiting glutamine metabolism with alterations of the epigenome of breast cancer cells and suggest that modification of intracellular metabolism may enhance the efficiency of epigenetic therapy.",

The region, mapped to 17q12-q21, was bordered by D17S250 and D17S579 on the centromeric and telomeric sides, respectively. This deletion region overlaps the BRCA1 locus, which predisposes to familial breast and ovarian cancer. The most frequent loss of heterozygosity was observed at the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA1) locus. Southern analysis revealed a rearrangement of THRA1 in the BT474 breast cancer cell line. This rearrangement represented a deletion of exons 8-10 of one THRA1 allele that was also coamplified with ERBB2. Northern blots showed two mutant transcripts in BT474 cells. Analysis of the mutant transcripts revealed fusion of the THRA1 exon 7 by splicing to a novel sequence designated BTR for \"BT474 transcribed rearrangement.\" BTR was found to be highly conserved and mapped to 17q. The deletion in BT474 cells spans the entire BRCA1 region. To search for additional mutations in the THRA1 gene, all nine protein-encoding exons of THRA1 were examined for point mutations via single strand conformation analysis in a series of primary breast tumors, breast cancer cell lines, and lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the youngest affected members of several German breast cancer families. No point mutations were detected, including the unrearranged THRA1 allele in BT474. We have thus excluded THRA1 as a commonly mutated sporadic breast cancer tumor suppressor gene and as the BRCA1 gene.",

In this study, we investigated genetic effect modification of HT associated breast cancer risk in 3,149 postmenopausal breast cancer patients and 5,489 controls from the two German population-based case-control studies MARIE and GENICA. Twenty-eight polymorphisms of 14 candidate genes including two drug and hormone transporter genes (ABCB1/MDR1 and SHBG), four genes involved in cell cycle regulation (BRCA1, P21/CDKN1A, STK15/AURKA and TP53), six cytokine genes (IGFBP3, IL6, TGFB1, TNF, LTA and IGF1), and two cytokine receptor genes (EGFR and ERBB2) were genotyped using validated methods. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess multiplicative statistical interaction between polymorphisms and duration of estrogen-progestagen therapy and estrogen monotherapy use with regard to breast cancer risk assuming log-additive and co-dominant modes of inheritance. Women homozygous for the major ABCB1_rs2214102_G allele were found to be at a significantly increased breast cancer risk associated with combined estrogen-progestagen therapy [odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-1.23, P (interaction) = 0.022]. Additionally, risk associated with estrogen monotherapy was modified by BRCA1_rs799917. We observed a trend with increasing minor T alleles leading to the highest risk in homozygous carriers of the minor allele [OR (95% CI) = 1.17 (0.98-1.39), 1.06 (0.98-1.14), and 1.02 (0.94-1.11) for homozygous minor, heterozygous, and homozygous major allele carriers, respectively; P (interaction) = 0.032].

To investigate molecular mechanisms of resistance, we used two xenograft models of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, one with and one without HER2 overexpression (MCF7/HER2-18 and MCF7 wt, respectively). Mice with established tumors were assigned to the following treatment groups: estrogen supplementation (E2), estrogen deprivation (ED), ED plus tamoxifen (Tam), all with or without the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (G). Another group received ED plus the antiestrogen fulvestrant (MCF7 wt only). Tumors with acquired or de novo resistance to these endocrine therapies were profiled for gene expression and compared with tumors in the E2 control group. One class of genes underexpressed in endocrine-resistant tumors (relative to E2-treated tumors) were estrogen inducible in vitro and associated with ER+ human breast cancers (luminal subtype). Another class of genes overexpressed in tumors with acquired resistance in both models represented transcriptional targets of HER2 signaling and was associated with ER-/HER2+ human cancers (ERBB2+ subtype). A third class of genes overexpressed in MCF7/HER2-18 tumors exhibiting de novo resistance to tamoxifen was associated with ER+ human cancers but not with estrogen-regulated genes. Thus, in response to various endocrine therapy regimens, these xenograft breast tumors shut down classic estrogen signaling and activate alternative pathways such as HER2 that contribute to treatment resistance. Over time, the molecular phenotype of breast cancer can change.",

Although many CNAs have been reported in gastric cancer, their genome-wide transcriptional consequences are poorly understood. In this study, to reveal the impact of CNAs on genome-wide expression in gastric cancer, we analysed 30 cases of gastric cancers for their CNAs by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and 24 of these 30 cases for their expression profiles by oligonucleotide-expression microarray. We found that with the application of laser microdissection, most CNAs were detected at higher frequency than in previous studies. Notably, gain at 20q13 was detected in almost all cases (97%), suggesting that this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. By comparing the array CGH data with expression profiles of the same samples, we showed that both genomic amplification and deletion strongly influence the expression of genes in altered genomic regions. Furthermore, we identified 125 candidate genes, consisting of 114 up-regulated genes located in recurrent regions (>10%) of amplification and 11 down-regulated genes located in recurrent regions of deletion. Up-regulation of several candidate genes, such as CDC6, SEC61G, ANP32E, BYSL and FDFT1, was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, some candidate genes were localized at genomic loci adjacent to well-known genes such as EGFR, ERBB2 and SMAD4, and concordantly deregulated by genomic alterations. Based on these results, we propose that our list of candidate genes may contain novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of advanced gastric cancer.",

Characterization of H2NTF shows that it is devoid of the tyrosine kinase domain but it readily interacts with full-length HER2 and other HER receptors. As a consequence, H2NTF acts as a dominant-negative, attenuating the signaling triggered by full-length HER receptors. Expression of H2NTF results in resistance to the treatment with low concentrations of trastuzumab in vitro.

Therefore, there has been a clear need for alternative treatments in this advanced setting. The small molecule lapatinib is a dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both ErbBl and ErbB2. In the pivotal phase III trial, lapatinib combined with capecitabine has demonstrated superior efficacy over capecitabine alone in this group of patients, with a median time to tumor progression of 8.4 months in the combination therapy group versus 4.4 months in the monotherapy arm. This improvement was achieved without an increase in serious toxic effects or symptomatic cardiac events. In addition, with the advent of Lapatinib, the empirically adopted practice of continuing trastuzumab beyond progression has to be seen in a different light. This is especially true since an exploratory analysis has suggested that the earlier use of the combination lapatinib plus capecitabine is associated with a benefit in time to progression and overall survival.",

We have investigated this pathway in paired transformed/nontransformed cell lines from murine peripheral lung epithelium, E9/E10 and A5/C10. The E9 and A5 carcinoma lines expressed ErbB3 and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and responded to TGF-alpha stimulation with protein complex formation including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, activation of Akt, phosphorylation of GSK3-beta, and increased cyclin D1 protein and the cell cycle. ErbB3 and TGF-alpha were not detected in the nontransformed E10 and C10 cell lines. Nevertheless, exposure of E10 or C10 cells to TGF-alpha activated PI3K and Akt and increased cyclin D1 and cell growth.

The absence of known histological features for breast cancer arising in a PTEN-mutant background prompted us to explore them for potential new markers.;We first performed a microarray study of three tumors from patients with Cowden disease in the context of a transcriptomic study of 74 familial breast cancers. A subsequent histological and immunohistochemical study including 12 additional cases of Cowden disease breast carcinomas was performed to confirm the microarray data.;Unsupervised clustering of the 74 familial tumors followed the intrinsic gene classification of breast cancer except for a group of five tumors that included the three Cowden tumors. The gene expression profile of the Cowden tumors shows considerable overlap with that of a breast cancer subgroup known as molecular apocrine breast carcinoma, which is suspected to have increased androgenic signaling and shows frequent ERBB2 amplification in sporadic tumors. The histological and immunohistochemical study showed that several cases had apocrine histological features and expressed GGT1, which is a potential new marker for apocrine breast carcinoma.;These data suggest that activation of the ERBB2-PI3K-AKT pathway by loss of PTEN at early stages of tumorigenesis promotes the formation of breast tumors with apocrine features.",

The high aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance of estrogen-independent breast tumors have motivated the development of new strategies for prevention and/or treatment. Combinations of two or more chemopreventive agents are currently being used to achieve greater inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells. This study reveals that both aspirin and lunasin inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, human estrogen-independent breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. These compounds arrest the cell cycle in the S- and G1-phases, respectively, acting synergistically to induce apoptosis. To begin elucidating the mechanism(s) of action of these compounds, different molecular targets involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis and signal transduction have been evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) array. The cell growth inhibitory effect of a lunasin/aspirin combination is achieved, at least partially, by modulating the expression of genes encoding G1 and S-phase regulatory proteins. Lunasin/aspirin therapy exerts its potent pro-apoptotic effect is at least partially achieved through modulating the extrinsic-apoptosis dependent pathway. Synergistic down-regulatory effects were observed for ERBB2, AKT1, PIK3R1, FOS and JUN signaling genes, whose amplification has been reported as being responsible for breast cancer cell growth and resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, our results suggest that a combination of these two compounds is a promising strategy to prevent/treat breast cancer.",

Progress toward a more personalized medicine in cancer patients requires taking into account the underlying heterogeneity at different molecular levels.;Here, we present a model in which there are complex interactions at different cellular and systemic levels that account for the heterogeneity of susceptibility to and evolution of ERBB2-positive breast cancers. Our model is based on our analyses of a cohort of mice that are characterized by heterogeneous susceptibility to ERBB2-positive breast cancers. Our analysis reveals that there are similarities between ERBB2 tumors in humans and those of backcross mice at clinical, genomic, expression, and signaling levels. We also show that mice that have tumors with intrinsically high levels of active AKT and ERK are more resistant to tumor metastasis. Our findings suggest for the first time that a site-specific phosphorylation at the serine 473 residue of AKT1 modifies the capacity for tumors to disseminate. Finally, we present two predictive models that can explain the heterogeneous behavior of the disease in the mouse population when we consider simultaneously certain genetic markers, liver cell signaling and serum biomarkers that are identified before the onset of the disease.;Considering simultaneously tumor pathophenotypes and several molecular levels, we show the heterogeneous behavior of ERBB2-positive breast cancer in terms of disease progression.

Several molecular classifications of breast cancers based on expression profiling have been proposed as alternatives. However, their reliability and clinical utility have been repeatedly questioned, notably because most of them were derived from relatively small initial patient populations. We analyzed the transcriptomes of 537 breast tumors using three unsupervised classification methods. A core subset of 355 tumors was assigned to six clusters by all three methods. These six subgroups overlapped with previously defined molecular classes of breast cancer, but also showed important differences, notably the absence of an ERBB2 subgroup and the division of the large luminal ER+ group into four subgroups, two of them being highly proliferative. Of the six subgroups, four were ER+/PR+/AR+, one was ER-/PR-/AR+ and one was triple negative (AR-/ER-/PR-). ERBB2-amplified tumors were split between the ER-/PR-/AR+ subgroup and the highly proliferative ER+ LumC subgroup. Importantly, each of these six molecular subgroups showed specific copy-number alterations. Gene expression changes were correlated to specific signaling pathways. Each of these six subgroups showed very significant differences in tumor grade, metastatic sites, relapse-free survival or response to chemotherapy. All these findings were validated on large external datasets including more than 3000 tumors. Our data thus indicate that these six molecular subgroups represent well-defined clinico-biological entities of breast cancer.

Multiple mechanisms of resistance have been proposed and, thus, may require the development of more personalized therapies. In this study, we report the establishment of a mouse mammary cancer cell line, designated MT104T, obtained from spontaneous tumors in genetically engineered FVB/N-ErbB2/Neu-positive-PTEN-deficient mice. The critical molecular phenotype of MT104T cells was confirmed by genotyping and western blot analysis. This cell line was tumorigenic in immunologically intact syngeneic mice, forming tumors of generally similar histology as its origin. PTEN loss led to hyperactivation of Akt and conferred resistance to anti-ErbB2/Neu antibody treatment in MT104T cells. Addition of the Akt inhibitor triciribine (TCN) inhibited the viability of MT104T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as evaluated by MTT assay. ErbB2/Neu antibody and TCN combination treatment greatly induced apoptosis of MT104T cells as indicated by Annexin V-FITC staining. Moreover, this combination treatment also significantly reduced both Akt and Erk activities, which are responsible for the inhibitory effect on MT104T cells. Therefore, MT104T cells could represent an alternative model system to investigate the nature of ErbB2‑positive breast cancer and for the experimental therapeutics studies of this disease. Our findings also suggest that combination of TCN may be a potential strategy for the treatment of trastu-zumab-resistant breast cancer mediated by PTEN loss or PI3K hyperactivation, which may facilitate the development of more personalized therapies for breast cancer patients.

Using intraductal injection of a lentivirus to deliver both an oncogene (ErbB2) and a floxed green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PR(Cre/+)mice, whose Cre gene is under the control of the PR promoter, we were able to trace the PR status of the infected cells as they progressed to cancer. We found that the resulting early lesions stained negative for PR in most of the cells and usually retained GFP. The resulting tumors lacked ER and PR, and 75% (15/20) of them retained the GFP signal in all tumor cells, suggesting PR was never expressed throughout the evolution of a majority of these tumors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ErbB2-initiated ER/PR-negative mammary tumors primarily originate from the subset of the mammary epithelium that is negative for PR and probably ER as well.

Synergistic interaction was observed in 2D and in 3D cultures conditions, both in fully epithelial cells expressing all ErbB receptors, and in cells that had undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition and expressed low levels of ErbB3. We provided evidences suggesting that differential modulation of ErbB receptors by vorinostat or VPA, also at low doses corresponding to plasma levels easily reached in treated patients, is responsible for the observed synergism. In details, we showed in epithelial cells that both vorinostat and VPA induced time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of all three ErbB receptors and of downstream signaling. On the contrary, in A3-resistant mesenchymal cells, we observed time- and dose-dependent increase of mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of ErbB3, paralleled by down-regulation of EGFR and ErbB2.

        "Doc_abstract":"Heregulins are a family of ligands for the ErbB3/ErbB4 receptors that play important roles in breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Limited information is available on the contribution of Rho GTPases to heregulin-mediated signaling. In breast cancer cells, heregulin beta1 (HRG) causes a strong activation of Rac; however, it does so with striking differences in kinetics compared to epidermal growth factor, which signals through ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]). Using specific ErbB receptor inhibitors and depletion of receptors by RNA interference (RNAi), we established that, surprisingly, activation of Rac by HRG is mediated not only by ErbB3 and ErbB2 but also by transactivation of EGFR, and it is independent of ErbB4. Similar receptor requirements are observed for HRG-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and mitogenic activity via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). HRG-induced Rac activation was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent and Src independent. Furthermore, inactivation of Rac by expression of the Rac GTPase-activating protein beta2-chimerin inhibited HRG-induced ERK activation, mitogenicity, and migration in breast cancer cells. HRG mitogenic activity was also impaired by depletion of Rac1 using RNAi. Our studies established that Rac is a critical mediator of HRG mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cells and highlight additional levels of complexity for ErbB receptor coupling to downstream effectors that control aberrant proliferation and transformation.",

In previous studies, AKT2, which codes for a serine-threonine protein kinase, was shown to be amplified and overexpressed in some human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and amplified in primary tumors of the ovary. To confirm and extend these findings, we conducted a large-scale, multicenter study of AKT2 alterations in ovarian and breast cancer. Southern-blot analysis demonstrated AKT2 amplification in 16 of 132 (12.1%) ovarian carcinomas and in 3 of 106 (2.8%) breast carcinomas. No AKT2 alteration was detected in 24 benign or borderline tumors. Northern-blot analysis revealed overexpression of AKT2 in 3 of 25 fresh ovarian carcinomas which were negative for AKT2 amplification. The difference in the incidence of AKT2 alterations in ovarian and breast cancer suggests a specific role for this gene in ovarian oncogenesis. No significant association was found between AKT2 amplification and amplification of the proto-oncogenes MYC and ERBB2, suggesting that amplification of AKT2 defines an independent subset of breast and ovarian cancers. Ovarian cancer patients with AKT2 alterations appear to have a poor prognosis. Amplification of AKT2 was especially frequent in undifferentiated tumors (4 of 8, p = 0.019), suggesting that AKT2 alterations may be associated with tumor aggressiveness.",

Two of the antibodies bound the ErbB2 oncogene while 6 bound the tumor marker transferrin receptor (TfR). By developing a scFv immunoprecipitation method, we were able to use LC-MS/MS to identify the antigen bound by one of the antibodies (3GA5) as FPRP (prostaglandin F2alpha receptor-regulatory protein)/EWI-F/CD9P-1 (CD9 partner 1) an Ig superfamily member that has been described to interact directly with CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins and to be overexpressed in adherent cancer cell lines. Although the 3GA5 scFv had no direct anti-proliferative effect, intracellular expression of the scFv was able to knockdown CD9P-1 expression and could be used to further define the role of the tetraspanin system in proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, the 3GA5 scFv was rapidly internalized into breast tumor cells and could have potential for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to breast cancers.

Multiplex inversion probe (MIP) analysis, a recently developed genomic technique, was used to study 80 urothelial carcinomas to identify mutations and copy number changes. Selected amplification events were then analyzed in a validation cohort of 84 bladder cancers by multiplex ligation-dependent probe assay (MLPA). In the MIP analysis, 44 regions of significant copy number change were identified using GISTIC. Nine gene-containing regions of amplification were selected for validation in the second cohort by MLPA. Amplification events at these 9 genomic regions were found to correlate strongly with stage, being seen in only 2 of 23 (9%) Ta grade 1 or 1-2 cancers, in contrast to 31 of 61 (51%) Ta grade 3 and T2 grade 2 cancers, p<0.001. These observations suggest that analysis of genomic amplification of these 9 regions might help distinguish non-invasive from invasive urothelial carcinoma, although further study is required.

        "Doc_abstract":"The antibody trastuzumab is approved for treatment of patients with HER2 (ERBB2)-overexpressing breast cancer. A significant fraction of these tumors are either intrinsically resistant or acquire resistance rendering the drug ineffective. The development of resistance has been attributed to failure of the antibody to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated by the HER2 network. Herein, we examined the effects of PI3K blockade in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147 and trastuzumab reduced proliferation and pAKT levels, triggering apoptosis of trastuzumab-resistant cells. Compared with XL147 alone, the combination exhibited a superior antitumor effect against trastuzumab-resistant tumor xenografts. Furthermore, treatment with XL147 and trastuzumab reduced the cancer stem-cell (CSC) fraction within trastuzumab-resistant cells both in vitro and in vivo. These effects were associated with FoxO-mediated inhibition of transcription of the antiapoptosis gene survivin (BIRC5) and the CSC-associated cytokine interleukin-8. RNA interference-mediated or pharmacologic inhibition of survivin restored sensitivity to trastuzumab in resistant cells. In a cohort of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, higher pretreatment tumor levels of survivin RNA correlated with poor response to therapy. Together, our results suggest that survivin blockade is required for therapeutic responses to trastuzumab and that by combining trastuzumab and PI3K inhibitors, CSCs can be reduced within HER2(+) tumors, potentially preventing acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapy.",

Herein, we have addressed tumor suppression by RALT/MIG-6, a transcriptionally controlled feedback inhibitor of ErbB RTKs, in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of RALT expression by RNAi enhanced the EGF-dependent proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells, indicating that loss of RALT signalling in breast epithelium may represent an advantageous condition during ErbB-driven tumorigenesis. Although mutational inactivation of the RALT gene was not detected in human breast carcinomas, RALT mRNA and protein expression was strongly and selectively reduced in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cell lines. Reconstitution of RALT expression in ERBB2-amplified SKBr-3 and BT474 cells inhibited ErbB-2-dependent mitogenic signalling and counteracted the ability of ErbB ligands to promote resistance to the ErbB-2-targeting drug Herceptin. Thus, loss of RALT expression cooperates with ERBB2 gene amplification to drive full oncogenic signalling by the ErbB-2 receptor. Moreover, loss of RALT signalling may adversely affect tumor responses to ErbB-2-targeting agents.",

We previously reported activation of NF-kappaB in ER-negative breast cancer cells and breast tumor specimens, but the consequence of inhibiting NF-kappaB activation in this subclass of breast cancer has not been shown. In this study, we investigated the role of NF-kappaB activation by studying the tumorigenic potential of cells expressing genetically manipulated, inducible, dominant-negative inhibitory kappaB kinase (IKK) beta in xenograft tumor model. Conditional inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by the inducible expression of dominant-negative IKKbeta simultaneously blocked cell proliferation, reinstated apoptosis, and dramatically blocked xenograft tumor formation. Secondly, the humanized anti-erbB2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) and the specific IKK inhibitor NF-kappaB essential modifier-binding domain peptide both blocked NF-kappaB activation and cell proliferation and reinstated apoptosis in two ER-negative and erbB2-positive human breast cancer cell lines that are used as representative model systems. Combinations of these two target-specific inhibitors synergistically blocked cell proliferation at concentrations that were singly ineffective. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation with two other low molecular weight compounds, PS1145 and PS341, which inhibited IKK activity and proteasome-mediated phosphorylated inhibitory kappaB protein degradation, respectively, blocked erbB2-mediated cell growth and reversed antiapoptotic machinery. These results implicate NF-kappaB activation in the tumorigenesis and progression of ER-negative breast cancer. It is postulated that this transcription factor and its activation cascade offer therapeutic targets for erbB2-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer is a significant problem with relapse being associated with local and/or regional recurrence and frequent distant metastases. Breast cancer cell models reveal that endocrine resistance is accompanied by a gain in aggressive behaviour driven in part through altered growth factor receptor signalling, particularly involving erbB family receptors. Recently we identified that CD44, a transmembrane cell adhesion receptor known to interact with growth factor receptors, is upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) MCF7 breast cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to explore the consequences of CD44 upregulation in an MCF7 cell model of acquired tamoxifen resistance, specifically with respect to the hypothesis that CD44 may influence erbB activity to promote an adverse phenotype.;CD44 expression in MCF7 and TamR cells was assessed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies revealed CD44-erbB associations. TamR cells (± siRNA-mediated CD44 suppression) or MCF7 cells (± transfection with the CD44 gene) were treated with the CD44 ligand, hyaluronon (HA), or heregulin and their in vitro growth (MTT), migration (Boyden chamber and wound healing) and invasion (Matrigel transwell migration) determined. erbB signalling was assessed using Western blotting. The effect of HA on erbB family dimerisation in TamR cells was determined by immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of CD44 siRNA.;TamR cells overexpressed CD44 where it was seen to associate with erbB2 at the cell surface. siRNA-mediated suppression of CD44 in TamR cells significantly attenuated their response to heregulin, inhibiting heregulin-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, TamR cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to HA, with HA treatment resulting in modulation of erbB dimerisation, ligand-independent activation of erbB2 and EGFR and induction of cell migration. Overexpression of CD44 in MCF7 cells, which lack endogenous CD44, generated an HA-sensitive phenotype, with HA-stimulation promoting erbB/EGFR activation and migration.;These data suggest an important role for CD44 in the context of tamoxifen-resistance where it may augment cellular response to erbB ligands and HA, factors that are reported to be present within the tumour microenvironment in vivo. Thus CD44 may present an important determinant of breast cancer progression in the setting of endocrine resistance.",

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor are over expressed in pancreatic cancer, and expression correlates with invasion and metastasis. We hypothesized that EGF receptor and integrin signalling pathways interact in mediating cellular adhesion and invasion in pancreatic cancer, and that invasiveness correlates temporally with detachment from extracellular matrix.;We tested this hypothesis by investigating the role of EGF in mediating adhesion to and invasion through collagen I and Matrigel in the metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Capan-1. Adhesion and invasion were measured using in vitro assays of fluorescently-labeled cells. Adhesion and invasion assays were also performed in the primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2.;EGF inhibited adhesion to collagen I and Matrigel in Capan-1 cells. The loss of adhesion was reversed by AG825, an inhibitor of erbB2 receptor signalling and by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, but not by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. EGF stimulated invasion through collagen I and Matrigel at concentrations and time courses similar to those mediating detachment from these extracellular matrix components. Adhesion to collagen I was different in MIA PaCa-2 cells, with no significant change elicited following EGF treatment, whereas treatment with the EGF family member heregulin-alpha elicited a marked increase in adhesion. Invasion through Matrigel in response to EGF, however, was similar to that observed in Capan-1 cells.;An inverse relationship exists between adhesion and invasion capabilities in Capan-1 cells but not in MIA PaCa-2 cells.

Our knowledge of PCA growth regulation lags behind that of other cancers, such as breast and colon carcinomas. Among receptor tyrosine kinases, the ErbB family is most frequently implicated in neoplasia. We report here the expression of ErbB family kinases and their ligands in PCA cell lines and a xenograft. While ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2/NEU, and ErbB3 were always observed in a distinct pattern, ErbB4 was not observed. Interestingly, while TGF-alpha was expressed in the majority of PCA lines, the ligand Neu Differentiation Factor/Heregulin (NDF) was expressed only in an immortalized, non-transformed prostate epithelial line. Concomitantly, there was a significant difference in biological response to these ligands. NDF inhibited LNCaP growth and induced an epithelial-like morphological change, in contrast to TGF-alpha, which accelerated cell growth. We also performed the first comprehensive analysis of NDF signaling in a prostate line. LNCaP stimulated with NDF demonstrated crosstalk between ErbB3 and ErbB2 which did not involve ErbB1. NDF also turned on several cascades, including those of PI3-K, ERK/MAPK, mHOG/p38 and JNK/SAPK, but not those of PLCgamma or the STAT family. This signaling pattern is distinct from that of TGF-alpha. The activation of mHOG by ErbB2 or ErbB3 has not been reported, and may contribute to the unusual phenotype. PI3-K activation is characterized by the formation of a striking 'activation complex' with multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated species, including ErbB3.

Disease response was assessed by Union International Contre Cancer (UICC) criteria and by CA125 measurement.

We analyzed copy number alterations of 163 primary gastric cancers using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and simultaneously performed a genome-wide integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression using microarray data for 58 tumors. We showed that chromosome 6p21 amplification frequently occurred secondary to ERBB2 amplification, was associated with poorer prognosis and caused overexpression of half of the genes mapped. A comprehensive small interfering RNA knockdown of 58 genes overexpressed in tumors identified 32 genes that reduced gastric cancer cell growth. Enforced expression of 16 of these genes promoted cell growth in vitro, and six genes showing more than two-fold activity conferred tumor-forming ability in vivo. Among these six candidates, GLO1, encoding a detoxifying enzyme glyoxalase I (GLO1), exhibited the strongest tumor-forming activity. Coexpression of other genes with GLO1 enhanced growth-stimulating activity. A GLO1 inhibitor, S-p-bromobenzyl glutathione cyclopentyl diester, inhibited the growth of two-thirds of 24 gastric cancer cell lines examined. The efficacy was found to be associated with the mRNA expression ratio of GLO1 to GLO2, encoding glyoxalase II (GLO2), another constituent of the glyoxalase system. GLO1 downregulation affected cell growth through inactivating central carbon metabolism and reduced the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B and activator protein-1. Our study demonstrates that GLO1 is a novel metabolic oncogene of the 6p21 amplicon, which promotes tumor growth and aberrant transcriptional signals via regulating cellular metabolic activities for energy production and could be a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chromosome rearrangement, a hallmark of cancer, has profound effects on carcinogenesis and tumor phenotype. We used a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) as a model system to identify relationships among DNA copy number, mRNA expression level, and drug sensitivity. For each of 64 cancer-relevant genes, we calculated all 4,096 possible Pearson's correlation coefficients relating DNA copy number (assessed by comparative genomic hybridization using bacterial artificial chromosome microarrays) and mRNA expression level (determined using both cDNA and Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays). The analysis identified an association of ERBB2 overexpression with 3p copy number, a finding supported by data from human tumors and a mouse model of ERBB2-induced carcinogenesis. When we examined the correlation between DNA copy number for all 353 unique loci on the bacterial artificial chromosome microarray and drug sensitivity for 118 drugs with putatively known mechanisms of action, we found a striking negative correlation (-0.983; 95% bootstrap confidence interval, -0.999 to -0.899) between activity of the enzyme drug L-asparaginase and DNA copy number of genes near asparagine synthetase in the ovarian cancer cells. Previous analysis of drug sensitivity and mRNA expression had suggested an inverse relationship between mRNA levels of asparagine synthetase and L-asparaginase sensitivity in the NCI-60. The concordance of pharmacogenomic findings at the DNA and mRNA levels strongly suggests further study of L-asparaginase for possible treatment of a low-synthetase subset of clinical ovarian cancers. The DNA copy number database presented here will enable other investigators to explore DNA transcript-drug relationships in their own domains of research focus.",

To further improve the effectiveness of breast cancer prevention, we have now investigated the effects of a combinatorial therapy consisting of two cancer preventive drugs. On the basis of the hypothesis, rexinoid LG100268 plus tamoxifen would more effectively prevent the development of both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. We treated p53-null mammary gland mice with tamoxifen and LG100268, individually and in combination. By 60 weeks of age, vehicle-treated mice developed tumors in 52% of transplanted mammary glands, whereas mice treated with tamoxifen and LG100268 developed tumors in only 13% of transplanted mammary glands. To further define the mechanistic effects of this combinatorial treatment, we investigated the effects of tamoxifen and LG100268 on mammary tissue biomarkers. In mammary tissue harvested before tumor development, the proliferation markers Ki67 and cyclin D1 were significantly reduced in mice treated with the combination therapy. In addition, the rexinoid target genes ABCA1 and ABCG1 were induced in both the rexinoid and combination treatment groups, whereas expression remained constant in tamoxifen group. These results show that tamoxifen-LG100268 combinatorial treatment is more effective in preventing mammary tumors than either agent alone. In addition, these studies have identified relevant tissue biomarkers that can be used to show the effect of these agents on mammary tissue. These results support the development of clinical trials of antiestrogen and rexinoid combinatorial therapy for the prevention of patients with high-risk breast cancer.",

The state of gene switches plays pivotal roles in cell fate decision, but identifying switches has been difficult. Therefore a challenge confronting the field is to be able to systematically identify gene switches.;We propose a top-down mining approach to exploring gene switches on a genome-scale level. Theoretical analysis, proof-of-concept examples, and experimental studies demonstrate the ability of our mining approach to identify bistable genes by sampling across a variety of different conditions. Applying the approach to human breast cancer data identified genes that show bimodality within the cancer samples, such as estrogen receptor (ER) and ERBB2, as well as genes that show bimodality between cancer and non-cancer samples, where tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2) is uncovered. We further suggest a likely transcription factor that regulates TACSTD2.;Our mining approach demonstrates that one can capitalize on genome-wide expression profiling to capture dynamic properties of a complex network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in applying mining approaches to explore gene switches on a genome-scale, and the identification of TACSTD2 demonstrates that single cell-level bistability can be predicted from microarray data. Experimental confirmation of the computational results suggest TACSTD2 could be a potential biomarker and attractive candidate for drug therapy against both ER+ and ER- subtypes of breast cancer, including the triple negative subtype.",

A combinatorial approach was used to identify miRs that promote prostate cancer progression in a unique set of prostate cancer cell lines, which originate from the parental p69 cell line and extend to a highly tumorigenic/metastatic M12 subline. Together, these cell lines are thought to mimic prostate cancer progression in vivo. Previous network analysis and miR arrays suggested that the loss of hsa-miR-125b together with the overexpression of hsa-miR-22 could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. The dysregulation of these two miRs was confirmed in human prostate tumor samples as compared to adjacent benign glandular epithelium collected through laser capture microdissection from radical prostatectomies. In fact, alterations in hsa-miR-125b expression appeared to be an early event in tumorigenesis. Reverse phase microarray proteomic analysis revealed ErbB2/3 and downstream members of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways as well as PTEN to be protein targets differentially expressed in the M12 tumor cell compared to its parental p69 cell. Relevant luciferase+3'-UTR expression studies confirmed a direct interaction between hsa-miR-125b and ErbB2 and between hsa-miR-22 and PTEN. Restoration of hsa-miR-125b or inhibition of hsa-miR-22 expression via an antagomiR resulted in an alteration of M12 tumor cell behavior in vitro. Thus, the dual action of hsa-miR-125b as a tumor suppressor and hsa-miR-22 as an oncomiR contributed to prostate tumorigenesis by modulations in PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, key pathways known to influence prostate cancer progression.

Our recent findings have shown that NR1D1 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-binding protein (PBP) act through a common pathway in upregulating several genes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis network, which is highly active in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. NR1D1 and PBP are functionally related to PPARγ, a well-established positive regulator of adipogenesis and lipid storage. Here, we report that inhibition of the PPARγ pathway reduces the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive population in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. Results from in vitro tumorsphere formation assays demonstrate that the PPARγ antagonists GW9662 and T0070907 decrease tumorsphere formation in ERBB2-positive cells, but not other breast cells. We show that the mechanism by which GW9662 treatment causes a reduction in ALDH-positive population cells is partially due to ROS, as it can be rescued by treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine. Furthermore, global gene expression analyses show that GW9662 treatment suppresses the expression of several lipogenic genes, including ACLY, MIG12, FASN and NR1D1, and the stem-cell related genes KLF4 and ALDH in BT474 cells. Antagonist treatment also decreases the level of acetylation in histone 3 and histone 4 in BT474 cells, compared with MCF7 cells. In vivo, GW9662 pre-treatment inhibits the tumor-seeding ability of BT474 cells. Together, these results show that the PPARγ pathway is critical for the cancer stem cell properties of ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. ",

Hsp90 is overexpressed in many malignancies, very likely as a result of the stress that is induced both by the hostile cancer microenvironment and also by the mutation and abberant expression of oncoproteins. A particularly attractive feature of Hsp90 as a cancer drug target is that it is required for the conformational stability and function of a wide range of oncogenic 'client' proteins, including c-Raf-1, Cdk4, ErbB2, mutant p53, c-Met, Polo-1 and telomerase hTERT. Inhibition of Hsp90 should therefore block multiple mission critical oncogenic pathways in the cancer cell, leading to inhibition of all the hallmark traits of malignancy. This combinatorial blockade of oncogenic targets should give rise to board spectrum antitumour activity across multiple cancer types. The 'druggability' of Hsp90 was confirmed by the discovery that the natural products geldanamycin and radicicol, which have anticancer activity, exert their biological effects by inhibiting the essential ATPase activity associated with the N-terminal domain of the protein. The first-in-class Hsp90 inhibitor has entered clinical trial and provided proof of concept that Hsp90 can be inhibited and clinical benefit seen at non-toxic doses. Further development is underway and a related analogue 17DMAG also shows promise in preclinical models. In addition, novel Hsp90 inhibitors have been identified using methods such as high throughput screening and x-ray crystallography.

We then evaluated the spatial expression patterns of EphA2 protein using immunohistochemistry in both the small intestine and colon and found that in normal tissues EphA2 was robustly expressed in highly differentiated cells, such as cells of the villi, but that EphA2 expression was largely absent from the stem cell niche and proliferative zones of intestinal crypts. In contrast, in tumors EphA2 was broadly expressed. Finally, we created a strain of Apc(Min/+) mice carrying a genetic knockout of the EphA2 gene. These mice developed significantly fewer and smaller tumors in both the small and large intestine.

Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) are two bioinformatic infrastructures for studying functional genomics. The goal of this study is to explore the feasibility of incorporating the Internet-available bioinformatic databases to discover human breast cancer-related genes. Several tools including the Gene Finder, Virtual Northern (vNorthern) and SAGE digital gene expression displayer (DGED) were used to analyze differential gene expression between benign and malignant breast tissues. A pilot study was performed using both EST and SAGE vNorthern to analyze the expression of a panel of known genes, including high abundance genes beta-actin and G3PDH, low abundance genes BRCA1 and p53, tissue-specific genes CEA and PSA and two breast cancer-related genes Her2/neu and MUC1. We found a high expression of beta-actin and G3PDH and a low expression of BRCA1 and p53 across different types of tissues as well as a tissue-specific expression of CEA in colon and PSA in prostate. A further analysis of 30 known breast cancer-related genes in breast cancer tissues by vNorthern demonstrated a high expression of oncogenes and low expression of tumor suppressor genes. An open-end analysis of two pools of breast cancer and benign breast tissue libraries by SAGE DGED produced 53 differentially expressed genes according to the screening criteria of a >five-fold difference and p<0.01. Further analysis by EST vNorthern and virtual microarray analysis reduced the candidate genes to six, with four down-regulated genes, ANXA1, CAV1, KRT5 and MMP7, and two up-regulated genes, ERBB2 and G1P3 in breast cancer. These findings were validated by a real-time RT-PCR analysis in eight paired human breast cancer tissue samples. We conclude that the combined multiple high throughput analyses is an effective data mining strategy in cancer gene identification.

Basically, patients with tumors that showed good CRT response and were amenable to segmental resection underwent partial cystectomy (PC) with pelvic lymph node dissection for bladder preservation; otherwise, radical cystectomy (RC) was recommended.

Tumors were defined as CRT-resistant when patients did not achieve complete response after CRT. Associations of ERBB 2 overexpression with CRT resistance and CSS were evaluated.;CRT resistance was observed clinically in 56% (67 of 119 patients) and pathologically (in cystectomy specimens) in 55% (52 of 95 patients). ERBB 2 overexpression was observed in 45 patients (38%). On multivariate analysis, ERBB 2 overexpression was an independent predictor for CRT resistance clinically (odds ratio, 3.6; P=.002) and pathologically (odds ratio, 2.9; P=.031). ERBB 2 overexpression was associated with shorter CSS (5-year CSS rates, 56% vs 87% for the ERBB 2 overexpression group vs the others; P=.001). ERBB 2 overexpression was also an independent risk factor for bladder cancer death at all time points of our bladder-sparing protocol (pre-CRT, post-CRT, and post-cystectomy).;ERBB 2 overexpression appears relevant to CRT resistance and unfavorable CSS in MIBC patients treated with the CRT-based bladder-sparing protocol. ERBB 2-targeting treatment may improve the outcomes of such patients.",

The interaction of anticancer agents with specific molecular targets can be identified by correlating target expression patterns with cytotoxicity patterns. We sought to identify new agents that target and inhibit the activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and of c-erbB2 (also called HER2 or neu), by correlating EGF receptor, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha (a ligand for EGF receptor), and c-erbB2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels with the results of cytotoxicity assays of the 49000 compounds in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug screen database.;The levels of mRNAs were measured and used to generate a molecular target database for the 60 cell lines of the NCI anticancer drug screen. The computer analysis program, COMPARE, was used to search for cytotoxicity patterns in the NCI drug screen database that were highly correlated with EGF receptor, TGF-alpha, or c-erbB2 mRNA expression patterns. The putative EGF receptor-inhibiting compounds were tested for effects on basal tyrosine phosphorylation, in vitro EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and EGF-dependent growth. Putative ErbB2-inhibiting compounds were tested for effects on antibody-induced ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity.;EGF receptor mRNA and TGF-alpha mRNA levels were highest in cell lines derived from renal cancers, and c-erbB2 mRNA levels were highest in cells derived from breast, ovarian, and colon cancers. Twenty-five compounds with high correlation coefficients (for cytotoxicity and levels of the measured mRNAs) were tested as inhibitors of the EGF receptor or c-erbB2 signaling pathways; 14 compounds were identified as inhibitors of these pathways. The most potent compound, B4, inhibited autophosphorylation (which occurs following activation) of ErbB2 by 50% in whole cells at 7.7 microM.;Novel EGF receptor or c-erbB2 pathway inhibitors can be identified in the NCI drug screen by correlation of cytotoxicity patterns with EGF receptor or c-erbB2 mRNA expression levels.",

However, the relationship between the ER and its ligand, oestradiol, and the enzymes that synthesise it are not well understood. The expression of mRNA transcripts of members of the oestradiol metabolic and signalling pathways including the ER was studied in detail.;mRNA transcripts for aromatase (CYP19), 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase I, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II, ERalpha, ERbeta, steroid sulfatase (STS), oestradiol sulfotransferase (EST), cyclin D1 (CYCLD1) and ERBB2 were fluorometrically quantified by competitive RT-PCR using an internal standard in 155 breast carcinomas. In addition, the transcripts of CYP19 were analysed for alternative splicing/usage of exon 1 and an alternative poly A tail.;A great variability of expression was observed, ranging from 0 to 2376 amol/mg RNA. The highest levels were observed for STS and EST, and the lowest levels (close to zero) were observed for the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzymes. The levels of mRNA expression were analysed with respect to clinical and histopathological parameters as well as for disease-free survival. High correlation of the mRNA expression of STS, EST and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the tumours suggested a common regulation, possibly by their common metabolite (oestradiol). Hierarchical clustering analysis in the 155 patients resulted in two main clusters, representing the ERalpha-negative and ERalpha-positive breast cancer cases. The mRNA expression of the oestradiol metabolising enzymes did not follow the expression of the ERalpha in all cases, leading to the formation of several subclasses of tumours. Patients with no expression of CYP19 and patients with high levels of expression of STS had significantly shorter disease-free survival time (P > 0.0005 and P < 0.03, respectively). Expression of ERbeta mRNA was a better prognostic factor than that of ERalpha in this material.;Our results indicate the importance of CYP19 and the enzymes regulating the oestrone sulfate metabolism as factors of disease-free survival in breast cancer, in addition to the well-known factors ER and ERBB2.",

The efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies can be influenced by the presence of heregulins (HRGs), which can bind erbB3/4 receptors and can activate alternative signalling pathways. In the present study we have examined whether HRG signalling can circumvent EGFR blockade in an EGFR-positive tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (Tam-R) breast cancer cell line.;Tam-R cells, incubated with the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib ('Iressa', ZD1839), were exposed to HRGbeta1 and the effects on erbB receptor dimerization profiles and on activation of associated downstream signalling components were assessed by immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The effects of HRGbeta1 on gefitinib-treated Tam-R cell growth and invasion were also examined, and HRGbeta1 expression levels were assessed in breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry to address the potential clinical relevance of such a resistance mechanism.;In Tam-R cells, HRGbeta1 promoted erbB3/erbB2 and erbB3/EGFR heterodimerization, promoted ERK1/2 and AKT pathway activation and increased cell proliferation and invasion. Gefitinib prevented HRGbeta1-driven erbB3/EGFR heterodimerization, ERK1/2 activation and Tam-R cell proliferation, but HRGbeta1-driven erbB3/erbB2 heterodimerization, AKT activation and Tam-R cell invasion were maintained. A combination of gefitinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 effectively blocked HRGbeta1-mediated intracellular signalling activity, growth and invasion in Tam-R cells. Similarly, targeting erbB2 with trastuzumab in combination with gefitinib in Tam-R cells reduced HRGbeta1-induced erbB2 and ERK1/2 activity; however, HRGbeta1-driven AKT activity and cell growth were maintained while cell invasion was significantly enhanced with this combination. In clinical tissue all samples demonstrated cytoplasmic tumour epithelial HRGbeta1 protein staining, with expression correlating with EGFR positivity and activation of both AKT and ERK1/2.;HRGbeta1 can overcome the inhibitory effects of gefitinib on cell growth and invasion in Tam-R cells through promotion of erbB3/erbB2 heterodimerization and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signalling pathway. This may have implications for the effectiveness of anti-EGFR therapies in breast cancer as HRGbeta1 is enriched in many EGFR-positive breast tumours.",

Human PBLs expressing the 4D5 CAR demonstrated Ag-specific activities against ErbB2(+) tumors. However, a gradual loss of transgene expression was noted for PBLs transduced with this 4D5 CAR. When the CD3zeta signaling domain of the CAR was truncated or mutated, loss of CAR expression was not observed, suggesting that the CD3zeta signaling caused the transgene decrease, which was supported by the finding that T cells expressing 4D5 CARs with CD3zeta ITAM mutations were less prone to apoptosis. By adding 4-1BB cytoplasmic domains to the CD28-CD3zeta signaling moieties, we found increased transgene persistence in 4D5 CAR-transduced PBLs. Furthermore, constructs with 4-1BB sequences demonstrated increased cytokine secretion and lytic activity in 4D5 CAR-transduced T cells. More importantly, PBLs expressing this new version of the 4D5 CAR could not only efficiently lyse the autologous fresh tumor digests, but they could strongly suppress tumor growth in a xenogenic mouse model.",

Using the RCAS retrovirus to deliver the ErbB2 oncogene into the mammary epithelium of our previously reported MMTV-tva transgenic mice, we detected high-grade, poorly differentiated, stroma-rich and ER-negative tumors during pregnancy and lactation. These high-grade and stroma-rich tumors were less frequent in involuted mice or in age-matched nulliparous mice. More importantly, by generating a WAP-tva transgenic line for expression of ErbB2 selectively in WAP(+) mammary alveolar cells, we found that tumors had similar morphological phenotypes (high grade, poorly differentiated, stroma-rich and ER-negative), irrespective of the time since pregnancy and even in the absence of pregnancy. These data suggest that PABCs arise preferentially from an alveolar cell population that expands during pregnancy and lactation. This somatic mouse model may also be useful for preclinical testing of new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against PABC. ",

To extend the use of aptamers into the biochemical analysis of protein interactions on the surface of live cells, we converted an enzymatically generated RNA aptamer into a photo-cross-linkable affinity tag through the replacement of all uracils with 4-thiouracil. Specifically, we converted a previously selected, inhibitory aptamer that binds the soluble extracellular domains of the ERBB3 receptor into a targeted and highly specific cross-linking reagent in a live cell setting. Since the photo-cross-linkable aptamer has two functionalities, targeted and highly selective as well as unspecific cross-linking capability, the attachment of this inhibitory aptamer converts ERBB3 into a passive and signaling incompetent probe of its immediate receptor environment. This approach detects receptor clustering of endogenous ERBB3 in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 at levels as low as 25000 receptors per cell and at aptamer concentrations as low as 20 nM. Our analysis also indicates that ERBB3 receptors are apparently segregated from ERBB2 receptors in their resting state, and both ligand-activated ERBB3 and ERBB2 do not share the same microenvironment as inactive ERBB3.",

Moreover, the novel immunoRNase is endowed with an effective and selective in vitro antiproliferative action for ErbB2-positive tumor cells, which is more potent than that of the parental immunoRNase on tumor cells expressing low levels of ErbB2, due to its resistance to the RNase inhibitor.

This study was designed to evaluate the changes of Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation during breast cancer progression from normal to pre-invasive lesions and invasive breast cancer (IBC), and their relationship with characteristics of IBC. We analyzed the methylation status of Alu and LINE-1 in 145 cases of breast samples including normal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia/flat epithelial atypia (ADH/FEA), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC, and another set of 129 cases of IBC by pyrosequencing. Alu methylation showed no significant changes during multistep progression of breast cancer, although it tended to decrease during the transition from DCIS to IBC. In contrast, LINE-1 methylation significantly decreased from normal to ADH/FEA, while it was similar in ADH/FEA, DCIS and IBC. In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, and LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with negative ER status, ERBB2 (HER2) amplification and p53 overexpression. Alu and LINE-1 methylation status was significantly different between breast cancer subtypes, and the HER2 enriched subtype had lowest methylation levels. In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients. Our findings suggest that LINE-1 hypomethylation is an early event and Alu hypomethylation is probably a late event during breast cancer progression, and prominent hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 in HER2 enriched subtype may be related to chromosomal instability of this specific subtype.

In the present study, we have investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of flotillins in breast cancer.;Human adenocarcinoma MCF7 breast cancer cells were stably depleted of flotillins by means of lentivirus mediated short hairpin RNAs. Western blotting, immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze the expression of proteins of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Western blotting was used to investigate the effect of EGFR stimulation or inhibition as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition on mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Rescue experiments were performed by stable transfection of RNA intereference resistant flotillin proteins.;We here show that stable knockdown of flotillin-1 in MCF7 cells resulted in upregulation of EGFR mRNA and protein expression and hyperactivation of MAPK signaling, whereas ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression were not affected. Treatment of the flotillin knockdown cells with an EGFR inhibitor reduced the MAPK signaling, demonstrating that the increased EGFR expression and activity is the cause of the increased signaling. Stable ectopic expression of flotillins in the knockdown cells reduced the increased EGFR expression, demonstrating a direct causal relationship between flotillin-1 expression and EGFR amount. Furthermore, the upregulation of EGFR was dependent on the PI3K signaling pathway which is constitutively active in MCF7 cells, and PI3K inhibition resulted in reduced EGFR expression.;This study demonstrates that flotillins may not be suitable as cancer therapy targets in cells that carry certain other oncogenic mutations such as PI3K activating mutations, as unexpected effects are prone to emerge upon flotillin knockdown which may even facilitate cancer cell growth and proliferation.",

In this work we have studied the potential molecular mechanism by which the VRK1 protein can contribute to a poorer prognosis in this disease. For this aim it was first analyzed by immunohistochemistry the VRK1 protein level in normal breast and in one hundred and thirty six cases of human breast cancer. The effect of VRK1 to protect against DNA damage was determined by studying the effect of its knockdown on the formation of DNA repair foci assembled on 53BP1 in response to treatment with ionizing radiation or doxorubicin in two breast cancer cell lines. VRK1 protein was detected in normal breast and in breast carcinomas at high levels in ER and PR positive tumors. VRK1 protein level was significantly lower in ERBB2 positive cases. Next, to identify a mechanism that can link VRK1 to poorer prognosis, VRK1 was knocked-down in two breast cancer cell lines that were treated with ionizing radiation or doxorubicin, both inducing DNA damage. Loss of VRK1 resulted in reduced formation of DNA-damage repair foci complexes assembled on the 53BP1 scaffold protein, and this effect was independent of damaging agent or cell type. This observation is consistent with detection of high VRK1 protein levels in ER and PR positive breast cancers. We conclude that VRK1 can contribute to make these tumors more resistant to DNA damage-based therapies, such as ionizing radiation or doxorubicin, which is consistent with its association to a poor prognosis in ER positive breast cancer. VRK1 is potential target kinase for development of new specific inhibitors which can facilitate sensitization to other treatments in combination therapies; or alternatively be used as a new cancer drugs.

Immunohistochemical analysis using tissue microarray (TMA) showed a significant difference in MUC4 expression between normal adjacent (n = 45) and gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 83; P < 0.001). MUC4 expression was not associated with tumour type, stage or with the degree of differentiation. To gain further insight into the significance of MUC4 expression in gastric non-SRCC cells, MUC4 was ectopically expressed in AGS, a poorly differentiated gastric non-signet ring cell line. The MUC4 overexpressing cells (AGS-MUC4) showed a significant increase (P < 0.005) in cell motility and a decrease in cellular aggregation as compared with the vector-transfected cells. Furthermore, in vivo tumorigenicity analysis revealed that animals transplanted with the MUC4 overexpressing cells (AGS-MUC4) had a greater incidence of tumours (83%) in comparison to empty vector control (17%). In addition, the expression of MUC4 resulted in enhanced expression of total cellular ErbB2 and phosphorylated ErbB2. In conclusion, our results showed that MUC4 is overexpressed in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, and that it has a role in promoting aggressive properties in poorly differentiated gastric non-SRCC cells through the activation of the ErbB2 oncoprotein.",

However, little information is available about the prostatic reaction to bacterial compounds in vivo. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the early effects of bacterial infection on rat ventral prostate compartments.;Using a rat model of acute bacterial prostatitis by Escherichia coli, we analyzed the histological and ultrastructural changes in the prostate at 24, 48, and 72 hr postinfection. Prostatic tissues were immunostained for prostatic binding protein (PBP), ACTA2, ErbB1, and ErbB2 receptors, TUNEL, and markers of cell proliferation. Dot and Western blots for PBP, ACTA2, ErbB1, ErbB2, and TGFbeta1 were also performed.;The prostatic epithelium became hypertrophied, with increases in PBP and ErbB1 expression at 24 hr postinfection. Moreover, inflammation induced the expression of ErbB2, a receptor strongly involved in carcinogenesis. These alterations were more pronounced at 48 hr, but the epithelium also showed apoptosis and finally atrophy at 72 hr postinfection, with a decrease in PBP and ErbB receptors. Interestingly, the epithelial cells exhibited a high level of proliferation in response to the bacteria. The stromal reaction to acute inflammation was initially characterized by smooth muscle hypertrophy. Afterwards, muscle cells acquired a secretory phenotype, with a reduction in ACTA2 at 72 hr postinfection.;Prostatic inflammation, even at the early stages, promotes atrophic and proliferative changes, and the upregulation of ErbB receptors together with dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells. These data suggest that repetitive reinfections could lead to uncontrolled growth in the prostate gland.",

The longer the cells are maintained, they become more responsive to EGF and the lag phase shortens. Maximal EGF-mediated stimulation of DNA synthesis requires the induction of ErbB2, which is not normally expressed in adult hepatocytes. We used immunological methods to demonstrate increased expression during culture of two gene families required for EGF to stimulate hepatocyte DNA synthesis: Akt and ERK 1/2. Both families showed hyperexpression in culture particularly when cells were exposed to insulin and EGF. Unlike CDK-2 and cyclin D1, integral mediators of the G1/S phase transition, ERK 1/2 and Akt appeared in the absence of EGF, particularly when insulin was present. This hyperexpression, which high concentrations of dexamethasone reversed, increased basal and growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK 1/2. Pharmacological blockade of phosphatidylinositol kinase suppressed the Akt increase whereas pharmacological blockade or small interfering RNA downregulation of ErbB2 inhibited both Akt and ERK 1/2 expression. All three Akt isoforms contributed to the increase in total Akt. EGF but not insulin specifically upregulated Akt 2 and 3. Since Akt and ERK 1/2 are also hyperexpressed in poorly differentiated hepatomas, their dysregulation in cancer may involve transcriptional mechanisms normally operative in cultured hepatocytes. We hypothesize that the induction and activation of ErbB2 increases the expression of these kinases, enhancing the responsiveness of hepatocytes to EGF as they adapt to culture.",

This results in a non-random distribution of receptors even in the resting state, which can be visualized as \"clusters\" by high resolution imaging methods. Here, we explore how spatial in-homogeneities in the plasma membrane might influence the dimerization and phosphorylation status of ErbB2 and ErbB3, two receptor tyrosine kinases that preferentially heterodimerize and are often co-expressed in cancer. This theoretical study is based upon spatial stochastic simulations of the two-dimensional membrane landscape, where variables include differential distributions and overlap of transient confinement zones (\"domains\") for the two receptor species. The in silico model is parameterized and validated using data from single particle tracking experiments. We report key differences in signaling output based on the degree of overlap between domains and the relative retention of receptors in such domains, expressed as escape probability. Results predict that a high overlap of domains, which favors transient co-confinement of both receptor species, will enhance the rate of hetero-interactions. Where domains do not overlap, simulations confirm expectations that homo-interactions are favored. Since ErbB3 is uniquely dependent on ErbB2 interactions for activation of its catalytic activity, variations in domain overlap or escape probability markedly alter the predicted patterns and time course of ErbB3 and ErbB2 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results implicate membrane domain organization as an important modulator of signal initiation, motivating the design of novel experimental approaches to measure these important parameters across a wider range of receptor systems.

Hsp90 inhibitors, by interacting specifically with a single molecular target, cause the destabilization and eventual degradation of Hsp90 client proteins, and they have also shown promising anti-tumor activity in preclinical model systems.

Hsp90 inhibitors are unique in that, although they are directed towards a specific molecular target, they simultaneously inhibit multiple signaling pathways on which cancer cells depend for growth and survival. Benzoquinone ansamycin binding to Hsp90 led to the identification of radicicol as an additional Hsp90 inhibitor. Additional target-based screening uncovered novobiocin as a third structurally distinct small molecule with Hsp90 inhibitory properties. Use of novobiocin, in turn, led to identification of a previously uncharacterized C-terminal ATP binding site in the chaperone.

We show that constitutive expression of transforming growth factor-alpha and its subsequent constitutive activation of EGFR allows for cancer cell survival in response to environmental stress in vitro and in vivo as well. The reversal of constitutive EGFR activation results in the loss of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt activation, and a reduction in xenograft size that is associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. We used CI-1033, a small molecule antagonist of EGFR, to dissect an activation pathway that shows the ability of ERBb2 to activate Akt, but not Erk in the face of EGFR antagonism.

We revealed a preponderance of chromosome breakpoints at sites of copy number variants (CNVs) in the CRC cell lines, a novel mechanism of DNA breakage in cancer. The integration of gene expression and aCGH led to the identification of 157 genes localized within high-level copy number changes whose transcriptional deregulation was significantly affected across all of the samples, thereby suggesting that these genes play a functional role in CRC. Genomic amplification at 8q24 was the most recurrent event and led to the overexpression of MYC and FAM84B. Copy number dependent gene expression resulted in deregulation of known cancer genes such as APC, FGFR2, and ERBB2.

We studied the effects of the HER3-HER2 ligand, heregulin (neuregulin-1, broadly expressed in the brain), on luminal breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Treatment of SKBr3 (ERBB2-amplified), MDA-MB-361 (ERBB2-amplified, metastatic brain tumor-derived) and MCF7 (HER2-positive, not ERBB2-amplified) cells with exogenous heregulin increased proliferation and adhesive potential, concomitant with induction of cyclin D1 and ICAM-1, and suppression of p27. All three cell lines invaded through matrigel toward a heregulin chemotactic signal in transwell experiments, associated with activation of extracellular cathepsin B and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, heregulin induced breast cancer cell transmigration across a tight barrier of primary human brain microvascular endothelia. This was dependent on the activity of HER2, HER3 and MMPs, and was completely abrogated by combination HER2-HER3 blockade using Herceptin® and the humanized HER3 monoclonal antibody, EV20.

Despite encouraging clinical results, some cancers are primarily resistant to trastuzumab, and a majority of those initially responding become resistant during prolonged treatment. The mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance have not been fully understood. We examined the role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) using JIMT-1 cells that are ErbB2 positive but intrinsically resistant to trastuzumab in vitro. Unexpectedly, in experiments mimicking adjuvant therapy of submacroscopic disease in vivo (JIMT-1 cells inoculated s.c. in severe combined immunodeficiency mice), trastuzumab was able to inhibit the outgrowth of macroscopically detectable xenograft tumors for up to 5-7 weeks. The effect is likely to be mediated via ADCC because trastuzumab-F(ab')(2) was ineffective in this model. Moreover, in vitro ADCC reaction of human leukocytes was equally strong against breast cancer cells intrinsically sensitive (SKBR-3) or resistant (JIMT-1) to trastuzumab or even against a subline of JIMT-1 that was established from xenograft tumors growing despite trastuzumab treatment. These results suggest that ADCC may be the predominant mechanism of trastuzumab action on submacroscopic tumor spread. Thus, measuring the ADCC activity of patient's leukocytes against the tumor cells may be a relevant predictor of clinical trastuzumab responsiveness in vivo.",

Contrary to expectations, oligonucleotides designed to be complementary to certain transcripts have sometimes been found moderately effective in cell-free extracts, more effective in cell culture and most effective in animal models. If greater potency against standard endpoints is reported in mouse models than was observed in cell culture, critical examination must consider alternate modes of action in animals that may not apply in cell culture.

Recent studies have shown an interaction between HER-2 (ERBB2) and cyclin E, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Interestingly, cyclin E over-expression has been associated with trastuzumab resistance. We studied cyclin E over-expression, CCNE1 amplification, and relapse-free survival in HER-2-positive primary breast cancers treated with and without trastuzumab therapy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 202 HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were studied. Expression levels of cyclin E and proliferation marker Ki-67 were determined using immunohistochemistry. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) with a gene-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe was used to analyze presence of CCNE1 amplification. Majority of HER-2-positive breast carcinomas exhibited nuclear staining for cyclin E protein. Cyclin E was highly expressed (≥50 % cells) in 37 % of cases. Incidence of CCNE1 amplification (≥6 gene copies/cell or clusters) was 8 %. Cyclin E amplification and over-expression were strongly associated with each other, grade, hormone receptors, and Ki-67. Neither high cyclin E expression nor CCNE1 amplification was associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) irrespective of short-term (9-week regimen) adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. These results confirm cyclin E and HER-2 gene co-amplification in a fraction of HER-2-positive breast cancers. Cyclin E is frequently over-expressed but appears to have limited value as a prognostic or predictive factor in HER-2-positive breast cancer regardless of trastuzumab therapy. ",

Instead, we observed a linear rather than piecewise relationship. After multivariate adjustment, the linear relationship was still present. Moreover, the interaction between age and LN involvement was not modified by tumor size. The odds of LN involvement decreased by 1.5% for each year increase in age (OR 0.985, 95% CI 0.979-0.991, P<0.001). Breast cancer subtypes were also associated with LN status. Proportions of basal-like and ERBB2+ subtypes decreased with increasing age.

These objections have limited the translation of published preclinical data to the clinical setting. The present study aimed to investigate direct anticancer effects of metformin on different molecular subtypes of breast cancer with pharmacological concentrations and under normoglycemic conditions in vitro.;Breast cancer cell lines from luminal A, luminal B, ErbB2 and triple-negative molecular subtypes were treated with a pharmacological concentration of metformin (2mM) at a glucose concentration of 5.5mM. Time-dependant cell viability was assessed by dye exclusion assay. MTT- based cytotoxicity assays were also performed with metformin alone or in combination with paclitaxel.;Metformin did not show any growth inhibitory effects or time-dependant cytotoxicity on breast cancer cell lines in the presence of normal glucose concentrations at the therapeutic plasma level. No augmentation of the anti- neoplastic properties of paclitaxel was apparent under the tested conditions.;Metformin is probably unable to exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects on breast cancer subtypes at pharmacological concentrations and normal plasma glucose levels.

Such genomic alterations mediate phenotypic changes through their impact on expression. Both cis- and transacting alterations are important since they may help to elucidate putative cancer genes. However, amidst numerous passenger genes, trans-effects are less well studied due to the computational difficulty in detecting weak and sparse signals in the data, and yet may influence multiple genes on a global scale. We propose an integrative approach to learn a sparse interaction network of DNA copy-number regions with their downstream transcriptional targets in breast cancer. With respect to goodness of fit on both simulated and real data, the performance of sparse network inference is no worse than other state-of-the-art models but with the advantage of simultaneous feature selection and efficiency. The DNA-RNA interaction network helps to distinguish copy-number driven expression alterations from those that are copy-number independent. Further, our approach yields a quantitative copy-number dependency score, which distinguishes cis- versus trans-effects. When applied to a breast cancer data set, numerous expression profiles were impacted by cis-acting copy-number alterations, including several known oncogenes such as GRB7, ERBB2, and LSM1. Several trans-acting alterations were also identified, impacting genes such as ADAM2 and BAGE, which warrant further investigation.;An R package named lol is available from www.markowetzlab.org/software/lol.html.",

This study highlights few rare somatic mutations, which possess the attributes of a potential CRC biomarker yet are often neglected. Next-generation sequencing was performed over 112 tumor samples to detect genetic alterations in 31 rare genes in colorectal cancer. Mutations were detected in 26/31 (83.9 %) uncommon genes, which together contributed toward 149 gene mutations in 67/112 (59.8 %) colorectal cancer patients. The most frequent mutations include KDR (19.6 %), PTEN (17 %), FBXW7 (10.7 %), SMAD4 (10.7 %), VHL (8 %), KIT (8 %), MET (7.1 %), ATM (6.3 %), CTNNB1 (4.5 %) and CDKN2A (4.5 %). RB1, ERBB4 and ERBB2 mutations were persistent in 3.6 % patients. GNAS, FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations were persistent in 1.8 % patients. Ten genes (EGFR, NOTCH1, SMARCB1, ABL1, STK11, SMO, RET, GNAQ, CSF1R and FLT3) were found mutated in 0.9 % patients. Lastly, no mutations were observed in AKT, HRAS, MAP2K1, PDGFR and JAK2. Significant associations were observed between VHL with tumor site, ERBB4 and SMARCB1 with tumor invasion, CTNNB1 with lack of lymph node involvement and CTNNB1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 with TNM stage.

It is an attractive target for receptor-directed antitumor therapy using mAbs. Unlike other epidermal growth factor receptor family members, HER-2/neu does not bind a high-affinity ligand, but rather functions as the preferred dimerization partner. Pertuzumab (Omnitarg) is a humanized mAb directed against the HER-2/neu dimerization domain that inhibits receptor signaling. The recent definition of the crystal structure of the HER-2/neu-pertuzumab complex demonstrated that the receptor dimerization region encompassed residues 266-333. Based on the three-dimensional structure of the complex, we have designed three conformational peptide constructs (sequences 266-296, 298-333, and 315-333) to mimic regions of the dimerization loop of the receptor and to characterize their in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy. All the constructs elicited high-affinity peptide Abs that inhibited multiple signaling pathways including HER-2/neu-specific inhibition of cellular proliferation and cytoplasmic receptor domain phosphorylation. All the peptide Abs showed Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to varying degrees with the 266-296 constructs being equally effective as compared with Herceptin. The 266-296 peptide vaccine had statistically reduced tumor onset in both transplantable tumor models (FVB/n and BALB/c) and significant reduction in tumor development in two transgenic mouse tumor models (BALB-neuT and VEGF(+/-)Neu2-5(+/-)). The 266-296 construct represents the most promising candidate for antitumor vaccination and could also be used to treat a variety of cancers with either normal or elevated expression of HER-2 including breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate.",

This is consistent with reports showing that Asians eating a diet high in soy have reduced incidence of clinically manifested prostate cancer. In order to understand the mechanism of action of genistein, we have investigated the expression of androgen and estrogen receptors, four growth factor receptors that signal via tyrosine protein kinases, and specific growth factor proteins in the dorsolateral prostates of TRAMP mice fed 250 mg genistein/kg diet, starting at 5 weeks of age. These analyses were carried out at 12 weeks, prior to the development of solid tumors, allowing us to readily investigate cell proliferation and biomarkers in premalignant tissue. Cell proliferation, AR, ER-alpha, EGFR, ErbB2, EGF, IGF-1R, IGF-1, VEGFR2, ERKs-1 and 2 proteins and TGF-alpha mRNA, but not ER-beta and VEGF, were significantly increased in prostates of TRAMP compared to C57BL/6 mice. Genistein in the diet significantly down-regulated cell proliferation, EGFR, IGF-1R, ERK-1 and ERK-2, but not AR, ER-alpha, ER-beta, ErbB2, EGF, TGF-alpha, IGF-1, VEGF and VEGFR in prostates of TRAMP mice. Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations were not significantly different in C57BL/6 or TRAMP male mice fed control or genistein-containing diets. The up-regulation of sex steroid receptors and multiple growth signaling pathways in TRAMP mice supports the concept of multiple dysregulation contributing to carcinogenesis. Down-regulation of the tyrosine kinase regulated proteins, EGFR and IGF-1R, and of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK-1 and 2, with genistein in the diet provides a possible mechanism for prostate cancer chemoprevention.",

Nevertheless, only a few of them are validated as relevant targets in clinical studies. Estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 expressions could be associated with a level I evidence. Beyond ER and HER2, BRCA and PIK3CA mutations (when targeted with alpha-specific PI3K inhibitors) could be considered as promising targets in breast cancer since they have been associated with objective responses in phase I/II trials. In addition to these four molecular alterations, several others have shown promising results in preclinical studies and are being investigated in clinical trials. These genomic alterations include AKT1, ERBB2, and ESR1 mutations. These considerations highlight the lack of evidence for using multiplex technologies to individualize therapy in metastatic breast cancer. Sequencing multiple genes to treat metastatic breast cancer is very promising but should be done in the context of clinical trials, either to enrich phase I/II trials in patients with genomic alterations or to show medical usefulness of new biotechnologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS). Although most current approaches of precision medicine are aiming at targeting drivers, additional applications could be developed in the future. This includes the identification of DNA repair deficiencies, mechanisms of immune suppression, and identification of minority lethal subclones. Finally, one of the very promising applications of genomics for metastatic breast cancer is the identification of pathway activation or defects at the individual level. For example, gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) signatures are being developed to detect kinase (such as mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]/CDK4) activations or DNA repair deficiencies.

A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase ε (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2.

However, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond, and the prognosis is particularly poor for patients with oestrogen-receptor (ER)/progesterone-receptor (PR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2)-negative (triple-negative) disease who do not achieve a pCR. Reliable identification of such patients is the first step in determining who might benefit from alternative treatment regimens in clinical trials. We previously identified genes involved in mitosis or ceramide metabolism that influenced sensitivity to paclitaxel, with an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in three cancer cell lines, including a triple-negative breast-cancer cell line. Here, we assess these genes as a predictor of pCR to paclitaxel combination chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.;We derived a paclitaxel response metagene based on mitotic and ceramide genes identified by functional genomics studies. We used area under the curve (AUC) analysis and multivariate logistic regression to retrospectively assess the metagene in six cohorts of patients with triple-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy; two cohorts treated with paclitaxel (n=27, 30) and four treated without paclitaxel (n=88, 28, 48, 39).;The metagene was associated with pCR in paclitaxel-treated cohorts (AUC 0.79 [95% CI 0.53-0.93], 0.72 [0.48-0.90]) but not in non-paclitaxel treated cohorts (0.53 [0.31-0.77], 0.59 [0.22-0.82], 0.53 [0.36-0.71], 0.64 [0.43-0.81]). In multivariate logistic regression, the metagene was associated with pCR (OR 19.92, 2.62-151.57; p=0.0039) with paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy.;The paclitaxel response metagene shows promise as a paclitaxel-specific predictor of pCR in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The metagene is suitable for development into a reverse transcription-PCR assay, for which clinically relevant thresholds could be established in randomised clinical trials.

A decade of research has revealed that the NRG1-ErbB signaling is essential for the cardiac development and pivotal for maintaining the physiological function of the adult heart. The first evidence regarding the protective effect of the ErbB2 signaling in the adult heart came from clinical trials in breast cancer patients using Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the ErbB2 receptor. The incidence of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure increased five-fold in patients treated concurrently with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin and Trastuzumab compared to those treated with doxorubicin alone. Subsequent studies further show that stimulation of the ErbB2 signaling by NRG1s improves cardiomyocyte survival, growth and proliferation, maintains cardiac myofibril structure, counterbalances excessive β-adrenergic signaling and promotes angiogenesis in the heart. Injections of recombinant NRG1s improve cardiac function in animal models with myocardial infarction, doxorubicin, viral infection or pacing-induced heart failure. Recent clinical trials show that NRG1s are effective for improving the cardiac function in heart failure patients. These results suggest that NRG1s may become a new drug for the treatment of heart failure. NRG1s stimulate RTKs. This is different from Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) and Angiotensin II receptor blockers which inhibit the excessive activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A clear understanding of how NRG1-ErbB signaling regulates cardiac function is essential for successful use of NRG1s for heart failure. Here, we review the current knowledge of the NRG1-ErbB signaling in the heart and discuss the potential use of NRG1s as novel therapy for heart failure.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a membrane spanning glycoprotein, which frequently has been implicated in various cancer types. The mechanisms by which EGFR becomes oncogenic are numerous and are often specific for each cancer type. In some tumors, EGFR is activated by autocrine/paracrine growth factor loops, whereas in others activating mutations promote EGFR signaling. Overexpression and/or amplification of the EGFR gene are prevalent in many cancer types leading to aberrant EGFR signaling. In addition, failure to attenuate receptor signaling by receptor downregulation can also lead to cellular transformation. Heterodimerization of EGFR with ErbB2 inhibits downregulation of EGFR and thereby prolongs growth factor signaling. This also indicates that cross-talk between EGFR and heterologous receptor systems serves as another mechanism for oncogenic activation of EGFR. Because of its role in tumor promotion, the EGFR has been intensely studied as a therapeutic target. There are currently two major mechanisms by which the EGFR is targeted: antibodies binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR and small-molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. However, tumorigenesis is a multi-step process involving several mutations, which might explain why EGFR therapeutics has only been partially successful. This highlights the importance of pinpointing the mechanisms by which EGFR becomes oncogenic in a particular cancer. In this review, each of the above mentioned mechanisms will be discussed, as a detailed molecular and genetic understanding of how EGFR contributes to the malignant phenotype might offer new promise for the design, development and clinical evaluation of future tumor-specific anticancer approaches.",

They therefore block several mission critical cancer-causing pathways and have the potential to modulate all of the hallmark biological features of malignancy. Consistent with this combinatorial anti-oncogenic profile, 17AAG exhibits broad-spectrum antitumour activity against cultured cancer cell lines and in vivo animal models. However, there are clear differences in sensitivity between various cancer cell lines and it is quite possible that some tumour types or individual patients will be more responsive in the clinic than others. We describe the methods used to investigate the genes and proteins involved in the mechanism of action of HSP90 inhibitors and discuss the significance of these for cellular sensitivity. Methods used involve the conventional cell and molecular biology techniques, together with the more recent application of high throughput global technologies such as gene expression microarrays and proteomics. Selected examples that seem to play a role in sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors are highlighted and the potential relevance to the response of cancer patients is discussed. Important determinants of response include: 1) Dependence upon key HSP90 client proteins such as ERBB2, steroid hormone receptors and AKT/PKB; 2) Levels of HSP90 family members and co-chaperones, such as HSP70 and AHA1; and 3) expression of various cell cycle and apoptotic regulators.

The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test was used to identify genes with a significant difference in expression between CAW and AAW. To determine if the differentially expressed genes could segregate between the CAW and AAW, we performed semi-supervised principal component analysis (SSPCA).;Twenty genes were differentially expressed between AAW and CAW. SSPCA incorporating these 20 genes segregated AAW and CAW into two distinct groups. AAW were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to display aberrations in G(1)/S cell-cycle regulatory genes, decreased expression of cell-adhesion genes, and low to no expression of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2 and estrogen pathway targets.;The gene expression differences identified between AAW and CAW may contribute to more aggressive disease, resistance to therapy, enhanced metastatic potential and poor clinical outcome.

We validate these findings on a second independent gene expression profile data set generated by whole transcriptome sequencing. Measurements of protein expression by immunohistochemistry on an independent set of early neoplasias confirms that ER pathway regulators FOXA1 and GATA3, as well as ER itself, are consistently upregulated at this early stage.

However, tumor response to multimodal treatment has varied greatly, ranging from complete resistance to complete pathologic regression. The prediction of the response is, therefore, an important clinical need.;To establish in vitro models for studying the molecular basis of this heterogeneous tumor response, we exposed 12 colorectal cancer cell lines to 3 μM of 5-fluorouracil and 2 Gy of radiation. The differences in treatment sensitivity were then correlated with the pretherapeutic gene expression profiles of these cell lines.;We observed a heterogeneous response, with surviving fractions ranging from 0.28 to 0.81, closely recapitulating clinical reality. Using a linear model analysis, we identified 4,796 features whose expression levels correlated significantly with the sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy (Q <.05), including many genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway or cell cycle genes. These data have suggested a potential relevance of the insulin and Wnt signaling pathways for treatment response, and we identified STAT3, RASSF1, DOK3, and ERBB2 as potential therapeutic targets. The microarray measurements were independently validated for a subset of these genes using real-time polymerase chain reactions.;We are the first to report a gene expression signature for the in vitro chemoradiosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells. We anticipate that this analysis will unveil molecular biomarkers predictive of the response of rectal cancers to chemoradiotherapy and enable the identification of genes that could serve as targets to sensitize a priori resistant primary tumors.",

The important issue of TNBC is poorer clinical outcome and absence of effective targeted therapy. In this study, we sought to identify DNA copy number alterations and expression of relevant genes characteristic of TNBC to discover potential therapeutic targets. Frozen tissues from 114 breast cancers were analyzed using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. The classification into subtype was determined by estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, and by the presence or absence of gain on the ERBB2 containing clone. The ACE algorithm was used for calling gain and loss of clones. Twenty-eight cases (25%) were classified as TNBC. Recurrent gains (> or =25%) unique to TNBC were 9p24-p21, 10p15-p13, 12p13, 13q31-q34, 18q12, 18q21-q23, and 21q22. Two published gene expression array data sets comparing basal subtype versus other subtype breast cancers were used for searching candidate genes. Of the genes upregulated in the basal subtype, 45 of 686 genes in one data set and 59 of 1,428 in the second data set were found to be located in the gained regions. Of these candidate genes, gain of NFIB (9p24.1) was specific for TNBC in a validation set by real-time PCR. In conclusion, we have identified recurrently gained regions characteristic of TNBC, and found that NFIB copy number and expression is increased in TNBC across the data sets.

Accordingly, determination of both expression and activation (dimerization/heterodimerization and phosphorylation) of ErbB proteins is critical in defining their functional role in cancer. Efficient and comprehensive methods to study molecular functions of ErbB family of RTKs are needed not only for improvements in diagnostics but also for early screening of targeted drugs (eg, small molecule inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies). We report development of 3 multiplex microbead immunoassays for simultaneous detection of expression, protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation of these RTKs. These novel multiplex immunoassays were used to study ErbB RTKs under different cell activation conditions in 2 breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468) and an epidermoid cancer cell line (A431). The results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation/western blot. Importantly, the multiplex immunoassay facilitated time-course studies in these cell lines after cell activation with EGF and neuregulin, revealing the kinetics of phosphorylation of the ErbB family RTKs. This study demonstrates the utility of the Luminex(R) multiplex system as an efficient and comprehensive approach to study different aspects of molecular roles of these RTKs. Importantly, the study provides proof-of-concept for the utility of the multiplex microbead immunoassay approach for potential use in efficient, robust, and rapid screening of drugs, particularly those targeting functional aspects of these potent signaling molecules. In addition, the assays described here may be useful for cancer diagnostics and monitoring efficacy of therapy targeting the ErbB family of RTKs.",

While the therapeutic targeting of single receptors has proven efficacious, optimal targeting of this receptor family should target all oncogenic members simultaneously. The juxtamembrane domains of ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB3 are highly conserved and control various aspects of ERBB-dependent biology. In an effort to block those functions, we have targeted this domain with decoy peptides synthesized in tandem with a cell-penetrating peptide, termed EJ1. Treatment with EJ1 induces cell death, promotes the formation of inactive ERBB multimers, and results in simultaneous reduction of ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB3 activation. Treatment also results in the activation of myosin light chain-dependent cell blebbing while inactivating CaMKII signaling, coincident with the induction of cell death. EJ1 also directly translocates to mitochondria, correlating with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species. Finally, treatment of a mouse model of breast cancer with EJ1 results in the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without associated toxicities in normal cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that a portion of the ERBB jxm domain, when used as an intracellular decoy, can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, representing a novel anticancer therapeutic.",

This chemotherapy is usually adapted to the response to the neo-adjuvant therapy after surgery. The current and unique marker of chemoresponsiveness is the percentage of viable residual cells in the surgical resection. This late patient management marker has to be evaluated earlier in the therapeutic history of the patients on initial biopsy. Therefore, new biomarkers, especially those involved in the topoisomerase IIα inhibitor response might be good candidates. Therefore, our study was designed to target TOP1, TOP2A and TOP2B genes in 105 fresh-frozen diagnostic biopsies by allelotyping and real-time quantitative PCR. Our analyses in those pediatric osteosarcomas, homogeneously treated, highlighted the frequent involvement of topo-isomerase genes. The main and most important observation was the statistical link between the presence of TOP2A amplification and the good response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Compared to adult cancers, the 17q21 amplicon, including TOP2A and ERBB2 genes, seems to be differentially implicated in the osteosarcoma chemoresponsiveness. Surprisingly, there is no ERBB2 gene co-amplification and the patients harboring TOP2A amplification tend to show a worse survival, so TOP2A analyses remain a preliminary, but a good molecular approach for the evaluation at diagnosis of pediatric osteosarcoma chemoresponsiveness.

Like other receptor tyrosine kinases, the ErbBs are bi-topic membrane proteins, whose extracellular and intracellular domains are connected by single transmembrane span. In recent years the crystal structures of the extracellular and intracellular domains of some ErbBs have been determined. We integrated the available structural information with phylogenetic, biochemical, biophysical, genetic, and computational data into a suggested model for the regulation and activation of these receptors. According to the model, regulation is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states in various conformations. Along this dynamic equilibrium, variations in the points of interactions within the dimers alter the activation state and ligand-binding affinities. The active state was recently shown to be associated with an asymmetric dimer of the kinase domains. That finding enabled us to elucidate, in molecular terms, the directionality observed in the activation process of ErbB heterodimers; it can explain, for example, the preferential activation of ErbB2 by ErbB1 over activation of ErbB1 by ErbB2. Sequence alterations that reverse this directionality lead to aberrant signaling and cancer. Our model also offers molecular interpretations of the effects of various oncogenic alterations that interfere with the regulatory mechanism.",

Previous studies have shown that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates cell motility by inducing RhoA degradation. Therefore, we examined the role of SMURF1 in EGF-induced cell migration and invasion using MDA-MB-231 cells, a human breast cancer cell line. EGF increased SMURF1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. All ErbB family members were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific for the EGF receptor (EGFR) or ErbB2 blocked the EGF-mediated induction of SMURF1 expression. Within the signaling pathways examined, ERK1/2 and protein kinase C activity were required for EGF-induced SMURF1 expression. The overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 increased the SMURF1 to levels similar to those induced by EGF. SMURF1 induction by EGF treatment or by the overexpression of MEK1 or SMURF1 resulted in enhanced cell migration and invasion, whereas SMURF1 knockdown suppressed EGF- or MEK1-induced cell migration and invasion. EGF treatment or SMURF1 overexpression decreased the endogenous RhoA protein levels. The overexpression of constitutively active RhoA prevented EGF- or SMURF1-induced cell migration and invasion.

Using low-input FFPE DNA, the array detects genome-wide CNAs with a special focus on 900 cancer-related genes. A cohort of 76 solid tumors of various types and tumor cellularity (20% to 100%), and four cancer cell lines were used. These harbored CNAs in clinically important genes (ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, KRAS, MYC) as detected by orthogonal techniques like next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results of the MIP array were concordant with results from orthogonal techniques, and also provided additional information regarding the allelic nature of the CNAs. Limit-of-detection and assay reproducibility studies showed a high degree of sensitivity and reproducibility of detection, respectively.

Eight cases of each breast cancer subtype were included in the study. For each subtype, two pools of four cases each were constructed. CESH was used to compare both pools within the same morphological subtype, followed by a comparison of pools belonging to different subtypes. This revealed three chromosomal regions that were differentially expressed in ductal and lobular carcinomas, including relative overexpression at 8q13-q23 and 16q22, and relative underexpression at 8p21-p22. In addition, an expression signature characterized by relative overexpression at 3q24-q26.3, 14q23-31, 17q12, and 20q12-13 was identified for ERBB2-positive IDC-NOS. In summary, CESH analysis highlights chromosomal regions of differential gene expression that are associated with morphologically defined breast cancer subtypes and suggests that regions on chromosome 8 are of interest in the discrimination between ductal and lobular carcinomas. In addition, using CESH, it was possible to identify an ERBB2 expression signature, comprising four chromosomal regions with potential significance in the aggressive behaviour of ERBB2-positive IDC-NOS.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The potential for cardiac toxicity in association with targeted biologic agents was first observed with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the ErbB2/HER2 receptor. In the pivotal trial of trastuzumab in ErbB2-positive metastatic cancer, an increased incidence of serious cardiac events was observed, particularly when trastuzumab was administered in combination with anthracyclines. The ErbB2 receptor is expressed on cardiomyocytes, in addition to tumor tissue, where it exerts a protective effect on cardiac function; thus, interference with ErbB2-signaling may block this protective effect. However, in contrast to anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity, trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction does not appear to increase with cumulative dose or to be associated with ultrastructural changes in the myocardium and is generally reversible. When used in adjuvant regimens for the treatment of ErbB2-positive early-stage breast cancer, trastuzumab has been shown to significantly improve disease-free and overall survival. The incidence of class III/IV congestive heart failure (CHF) ranged from 0.4%-3.8% in the major adjuvant trastuzumab trials. More recently, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib have been investigated for the treatment of ErbB2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In a comprehensive analysis of cardiac safety data from all lapatinib trials completed to date, which included 3558 healthy volunteers and patients with a variety of solid cancers on 43 trials, the overall incidence of left ventricular ejection fraction declines was 1.6%, with 0.2% of patients experiencing symptomatic CHF. Risk factors that might predict for cardiac dysfunction with ErbB2-targeted therapy are actively under investigation and will aid in the identification of at-risk populations and in the development of strategies for risk minimization in the future. It is important to note that, while careful cardiac monitoring is required for all patients receiving ErbB2-targeted therapy in any disease setting, the overall impact of these agents on the outcomes of patients with ErbB2-positive breast cancer has been dramatic and positive.",

These molecules interfere with the homeostasis of the body, usually through mimicking natural hormones leading to activation or blocking of their receptors. Many of these compounds have been associated with a broad range of diseases including the development or increased susceptibility to breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Thus, this article presents a virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) to evaluate the affinity of proteins related to breast cancer, such as ESR1, ERBB2, PGR, BCRA1, and SHBG, among others, with EDCs from urban sources. A blind docking strategy was employed to screen each protein-ligand pair in triplicate in AutoDock Vina 2.0, using the computed binding affinities as ranking criteria. The three-dimensional structures were previously obtained from EDCs DataBank and Protein Data Bank, prepared and optimized by SYBYL X-2.0. Some of the chemicals that exhibited the best affinity scores for breast cancer proteins in each category were 1,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, bisphenol A derivatives, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, and benzo(a)pyrene, for catalase, several proteins, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cytochrome P450 1A2, respectively. An experimental validation of this approach was performed with a complex that gave a moderate binding affinity in silico, the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and bisphenol A (BPA) complex. The protein was obtained using DNA recombinant technology and the physical interaction with BPA assessed through spectroscopic techniques. BPA binds on the recombinant SHBG, and this results in an increase of its α helix content. In short, this work shows the potential of several EDCs to bind breast cancer associated proteins as a tool to prioritize compounds to perform in vitro analysis to benefit the regulation or exposure prevention by the general population.

While it has delivered important insights, including a typology of breast cancer subtypes, it suffers from instability in the face of gene or sample selection, and an inability to detect small sets that may be dominated by larger sets such as the estrogen-related genes in breast cancer. The rank-based partitioning algorithm introduced in this paper addresses several of these limitations. It delivers results comparable to two-way hierarchical clustering, and much more. Applied systematically across a range of parameter settings, it enumerates all the partition-inducing gene sets in a matrix of expression values.;Applied to four large breast cancer datasets, this alternative exploratory method detects more than thirty sets of co-regulated genes, many of which are conserved across experiments and across platforms. Many of these sets are readily identified in biological terms, e.g., \"estrogen\", \"erbb2\", and 8p11-12, and several are clinically significant as prognostic of either increased survival (\"adipose\", \"stromal\"...) or diminished survival (\"proliferation\", \"immune/interferon\", \"histone\",...). Of special interest are the sets that effectively factor \"immune response\" and \"stromal signalling\".;The gene sets induced by the enumeration include many of the sets reported in the literature. In this regard these inventories confirm and consolidate findings from microarray-based work on breast cancer over the last decade. But, the enumerations also identify gene sets that have not been studied as of yet, some of which are prognostic of survival. The sets induced are robust, biologically meaningful, and serve to reveal a finer structure in existing breast cancer microarrays.",

Mesoporous zinc oxide nanofibers (ZnOnFs) are synthesized by electrospinning technique with a fiber diameter in the range of 50-150 nm. Fragments of ZnOnFs are electrophoretically deposited on an indium tin oxide glass substrate and conjugated via covalent or electrostatic interactions with a biomarker (anti-ErbB2; epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Oxygen plasma treatment of the carbon doped ZnOnFs generates functional groups (-COOH, -OH, etc.) that are effective for the conjugation of anti-ErbB2. ZnOnFs without plasma treatment that conjugate via electrostatic interactions were also tested for comparison. Label-free detection of the breast cancer biomarker by this point-of-care device is achieved by an electrochemical impedance technique that has high sensitivity (7.76 kΩ μM(-1)) and can detect 1 fM (4.34 × 10(-5) ng mL(-1)) concentration. The excellent impedimetric response of this immunosensor provides a fast detection (128 s) in a wide detection test range (1.0 fM-0.5 μM). The oxy-plasma treated ZnOnF immunoelectrode shows a higher association constant (404.8 kM(-1) s(-1)) indicating a higher affinity towards the ErbB2 antigen compared to the untreated ZnOnF immunoelectrode (165.6 kM(-1) s(-1)). This sensor is about an order of magnitude more sensitive than the best demonstrated in the literature based on different nanomaterials and about three orders of magnitude better than the ELISA standard for breast cancer biomarker detection. This proposed point-of-care cancer diagnostic offers several advantages, such as higher stability, rapid monitoring, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, etc., and should prove to be useful for the detection of other bio- and cancer markers.",

The purpose of the present pilot study was to look for additional markers of biochemical response to aromatase inhibitors on mRNA expression level. Whole genome expression was studied using microarray analysis of breast cancer tissue from 12 patients with locally advanced tumors, both before and following 15 weeks of treatment with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex). Intratumoral mRNA levels for a subset of genes coding for steroid metabolizing enzymes, hormone receptors and some growth mediators involved in cell cycle control were analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. There was a correlation between the two methods for some but not all genes. The mRNA expression levels of the different genes were correlated to each other and to the intratumoral levels of E1, E2 and E1S, before and after the treatment. Notably, a correlation of the E1/E2 metabolic ratio to the mRNA levels of CYP19A1 was observed before treatment (r=0.745, p<0.005). Whole genome expression analysis of these 12 breast cancer patients revealed similar tumor classification to previously published larger studies. Tumors with no or low expression of ESR1 (oestrogen receptor) clustered together and were characterized by a strong basal-like signature highly expressing keratins 5/17, cadherin 3, frizzled and apolipoprotein D, among others. The luminal epithelial tumor cluster, on the other hand, highly expressed ESR1, GATA binding protein 3 and N-acetyl transferase.

Salivary gland carcinomas overexpress ErbB2. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to ErbB2, was proposed for salivary gland tumors treatment. We explored the effectiveness of intratumoral vaccination with the recombinant vaccinia virus ErbB2/Neu (rV-neuT) vaccine in hampering the growth of transplanted Neu-overexpressing BALB-neuT salivary gland cancer cells (SALTO) in BALB-neuT mice.;BALB-neuT male mice were subcutaneously injected with SALTO tumor cells and intratumorally vaccinated twice with different doses of either rV-neuT or V-wt (wild-type). Tumors were measured weekly. The presence of anti-ErbB2/Neu antibodies was assayed by ELISA, immunoprecipitation or indirect immunofluorescence. Biological activity of immune sera was investigated by analyzing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), SALTO cells proliferation and apoptosis, ErbB2/Neu receptor down regulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Anti-Neu T cell immunity was investigated by determining the release of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in T cells supernatant. Survival curves were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Differences in tumor volumes, number of apoptotic cells, titer of the serum, percentage of ADCC were evaluated through a two-tailed Student's t-test.;rV-neuT intratumoral vaccination was able to inhibit the growth of SALTO cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-Neu serum titer paralleled in vivo antitumor activity of rV-neuT vaccinated mice. rV-neuT immune serum was able to mediate ADCC, inhibition of SALTO cells proliferation, down regulation of the ErbB2/Neu receptor, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis, thus suggesting potential mechanisms of in vivo tumor growth interference. In addition, spleen T cells of rV-neuT vaccinated mice released IFN-gamma and IL-2 upon in vitro stimulation with several Neu-specific peptides located in the extracellular domain of Neu sequence.;rV-neuT intratumoral vaccination could be employed to induce an efficient antitumor response and reject transplanted salivary gland tumors.

Grb7 is frequently overexpressed in invasive and metastatic human cancers and is implicated in cancer progression via its interaction with the ErbB2 receptor and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that play critical roles in cell proliferation and migration. It is thus a prime target for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. Recently, an inhibitory peptide (G7-18NATE) has been developed which binds specifically to the Grb7 SH2 domain and is able to attenuate cancer cell proliferation and migration in various cancer cell lines.;As a first step towards understanding how Grb7 may be inhibited by G7-18NATE, we solved the crystal structure of the Grb7 SH2 domain to 2.1 A resolution. We describe the details of the peptide binding site underlying target specificity, as well as the dimer interface of Grb 7 SH2. Dimer formation of Grb7 was determined to be in the muM range using analytical ultracentrifugation for both full-length Grb7 and the SH2 domain alone, suggesting the SH2 domain forms the basis of a physiological dimer. ITC measurements of the interaction of the G7-18NATE peptide with the Grb7 SH2 domain revealed that it binds with a binding affinity of Kd = approximately 35.7 microM and NMR spectroscopy titration experiments revealed that peptide binding causes perturbations to both the ligand binding surface of the Grb7 SH2 domain as well as to the dimer interface, suggesting that dimerisation of Grb7 is impacted on by peptide binding.;Together the data allow us to propose a model of the Grb7 SH2 domain/G7-18NATE interaction and to rationalize the basis for the observed binding specificity and affinity. We propose that the current study will assist with the development of second generation Grb7 SH2 domain inhibitors, potentially leading to novel inhibitors of cancer cell migration and invasion.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinases, in particular the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, have received great attention in recent years as putative tumour markers for clinical applications. The main reason for the observed interest is their easy detection in body fluids. Moreover, recent evidence has shown multiple functions of MMPs, rather than simply degrading ECM, which include the mobilisation of growth factors and processing of surface molecules. Several authors have reported increased levels of MMPs in a number of cancers, but clinical correlations in breast cancer are still fragmentary. Thus, the aim of the present research was to investigate the activity levels of circulating gelatinases in the sera of breast cancer patients by means of zymographic analysis, and correlate data with clinicopathological parameters. In all, 80 patients and 22 healthy volunteers were involved in this study. Sera were obtained prior to surgery. The clinical variables were: grading of tumours, tumour size, lymph node involvement, tumour staging, oestrogen and progesterone receptor levels (76 out of 80 cases), and c-erbB-2 levels (46 cases). The densitometric measures of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity levels indicated that the average values of both gelatinase activities were significantly higher in breast cancers than in control sera (P<0.0001). In addition, our analysis showed for the first time that elevated activity levels of both gelatinases correlated only with c-erbB-2 overexpression (P=0.0273 for MMP-2 and P=0.0075 for MMP-9). An inverse correlation was observed with regard to oestrogen receptor expression (P=0.0075 for MMP-2 and P=0.0273 for MMP-9). Moreover, a borderline inverse correlation was observed between the activity levels of both enzymes and nuclear grade (P=0.0511 for MMP-2 and P=0.0794 for MMP-9). In conclusion, the present data suggest that serum measures of MMP's activity may have diagnostic value for discriminating subgroups of breast cancer patients and support the hypothesis that ERBB2 amplification and/or overexpression enhance signalling pathways that may lead to increased production of gelatinases in c-erbB-2 positive breast cancers with higher metastatic potentialities.",

In recent years advances achieved in understanding the molecular biology of cancer have afforded clinicians and scientists the opportunity to develop a range of novel genetic therapies for this disease.;We performed a detailed review of published reports of gene therapy for prostate cancer. Particular emphasis was placed on recent developments in the arena of nonviral (plasmid DNA, DNA coated gold particles, liposomes and polymer DNA complexes) and viral (adenovirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, herpes virus and pox virus) vectors. Therapeutic strategies were categorized as corrective, cytoreductive and immunomodulatory gene therapy for the purpose of data analysis and comparison.;Locoregional administration of nonviral and viral vectors can yield impressive local gene expression and therapeutic effects but to our knowledge no efficient systemically delivered vector is available to date. Corrective gene therapy to restore normal patterns of tumor suppressor gene (p53, Rb, p21 and p16) expression or negate the effect of mutated tumor promoting oncogenes (ras, myc, erbB2 and bcl-2) have efficacy in animal models but this approach suffers from the fact that each cancer cell must be targeted. A wide variety of cytoreductive strategies are under development, including suicide, anti-angiogenic, radioisotopic and pro-apoptotic gene therapies. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses, and may best be suited for use in combination. Immunomodulatory gene therapy seeks to generate an effective local immune response that translates to systemic antitumor activity. Currently most studies involve immunostimulatory cytokine genes, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or interleukin-2 or 12.;Various therapeutic genes have proved activity against prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. However, the chief challenge facing clinical gene therapy strategies is the lack of efficient gene delivery by local and systemic routes. For the foreseeable future vector development may remain a major focus of ongoing research. Despite this caveat it is anticipated that gene therapy approaches may significantly contribute to the management of prostate cancer in the future.",

We profiled the temporal molecular changes during DCIS transition to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) using in vivo DCIS progression models. These studies identified B cell lymphoma-9 (BCL9) as a potential molecular driver of early invasion. BCL9 is a newly found co-activator of Wnt-stimulated β-catenin-mediated transcription. BCL9 has been shown to promote progression of multiple myeloma and colon carcinoma. However BCL9 role in breast cancer had not been previously recognized.;Microarray and RNA sequencing were utilized to characterize the sequential changes in mRNA expression during DCIS invasive transition. BCL9-shRNA knockdown was performed to assess the role of BCL9 in in vivo invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and canonical Wnt-signaling. Immunofluorescence of 28 patient samples was used to assess a correlation between the expression of BCL9 and biomarkers of high risk DCIS. The cancer genome atlas data were analyzed to assess the status of BCL9 gene alterations in breast cancers.;Analysis of BCL9, by RNA and protein showed BCL9 up-regulation to be associated with DCIS transition to IDC. Analysis of patient DCIS revealed a significant correlation between high nuclear BCL9 and pathologic characteristics associated with DCIS recurrence: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative, high nuclear grade, and high human epidermal growth factor receptor2 (HER2). In vivo silencing of BCL9 resulted in the inhibition of DCIS invasion and reversal of EMT. Analysis of the TCGA data showed BCL9 to be altered in 26 % of breast cancers. This is a significant alteration when compared to HER2 (ERBB2) gene (19 %) and estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene (8 %). A significantly higher proportion of basal like invasive breast cancers compared to luminal breast cancers showed BCL9 amplification.;BCL9 is a molecular driver of DCIS invasive progression and may predispose to the development of basal like invasive breast cancers. As such, BCL9 has the potential to serve as a biomarker of high risk DCIS and as a therapeutic target for prevention of IDC.",

Randomized clinical trials of neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer may help resolve this dilemma.;To assess the utility of pathologic complete response (pCR) for neoadjuvant drug development in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 [also referred to as ERBB2])-positive breast cancer.;We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL (Wiley), and Northern Light Life Sciences Conference Abstracts (Ovid) in December 2014. Searches combined terms for \"breast cancer\" and \"neoadjuvant therapy,\" with no limit on publication date.;Cohort studies and RCTs were selected that met following criteria: stages I to III HER2-positive breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy, and reports of both pCR and an event-free survival (EFS)-type outcome. The initial search identified 2614 publications, of which 38 studies met the selection criteria.;Two authors independently screened each study for inclusion and extracted the data. Data were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models.;Event-free survival and overall survival (OS) hazard ratios (HRs) for pCR vs non-pCR. For RCTs, main outcome measures were treatment benefits in pCR and the corresponding treatment HRs for EFS and OS.;A total of 36 studies with EFS by pCR status representing 5768 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were included in the patient-level analysis. Overall, the improvement in EFS for pCR vs non-pCR was substantial: HR, 0.37 (95% probability interval [PI], 0.32-0.43). This association was greater for patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (HR, 0.29 [95% PI, 0.24-0.36]) than hormone receptor-positive disease (HR, 0.52 [95% PI, 0.40-0.66]). In RCTs, the R2 correlations between odds ratios for pCR and HRs were 0.63 for EFS and 0.29 for OS. Based on absolute treatment improvements in pCR rate, predicted HRs for EFS for RCTs were concordant with observed HRs.;Pathologic complete response in HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with substantially longer times to recurrence and death. This relationship is maintained in RCTs. For any particular new therapy the relationship between pCR and survival may differ. Quantifying the importance of pCR is necessary for designing efficient clinical trials, which should adapt to the relationship between pCR and survival for the therapy under investigation.",

Molecularly targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and tamoxifen have enhanced prognosis of patients with cancers expressing ERBB2 and the estrogen receptor, respectively. One obstacle to targeted therapy is the development of resistance. A targeted peptide that could distinguish resistance-susceptible cancer would aid in treatment. BT-474 human breast cancer cells can be resistant to both tamoxifen and trastuzumab, and may serve as a model for malignancies in which targeted therapy may not work. Bacteriophage (phage) display is a combinatorial technology that has been used to isolate peptides that target a specific cancer subtype. It was hypothesized that in vivo phage display could be used to select a peptide for SPECT imaging of BT-474 human breast cancer xenografts. A phage library displaying random 15 amino acid peptides was subjected to four rounds of selection, after which 14 clones were analyzed for BT-474 binding and specificity. One phage clone, 51, demonstrated superior binding and specificity, and the displayed peptide was synthesized for in vitro characterization. Peptide 51 bound specifically to BT-474 cells with an EC50 = 2.33 µM and was synthesized as a DOTA-conjugated peptide and radiolabeled with (111)In for in vitro and in vivo analysis. The radiolabeled peptide exhibited an IC50 = 16.1 nM to BT-474 cells and its biodistribution and SPECT imaging in BT-474 xenografted mice was analyzed. Although tumor uptake was moderate at 0.11% ID/g, SPECT imaging revealed a distinct tumor vasculature binding pattern. It was discovered that peptide 51 had an identical 5 amino acid N-terminal sequence to a peptide, V1, which bound to Nrp1, a tumor vasculature protein. Peptide 51 and V1 were examined for binding to target cells, and 51 bound both target and endothelial cells, while V1 only bound endothelial cells. Truncated versions of 51 did not bind BT-474 cells, demonstrating that the targeting ability of 51 was independent of the homologous V1 sequence. These results demonstrate that in vivo phage display can effectively identify a peptide that specifically targets a breast cancer cell line that is susceptible to targeted therapy resistance. ",

Modern molecular technology facilitates identification of virus-related biochemical effects that could assist in early diagnosis and disease management.;In this study, RNA expression profiling was performed on 326 macrodissected paraffin-embedded tissues including 204 cancers and, when available, adjacent non-malignant mucosa. Nanostring nCounter probes targeted 96 RNAs (20 viral, 73 human, and 3 spiked RNAs).;In 182 tissues with adequate housekeeper RNAs, distinct profiles were found in infected versus uninfected cancers, and in malignant versus adjacent benign mucosa. EBV-infected gastric cancers expressed nearly all of the 18 latent and lytic EBV RNAs in the test panel. Levels of EBER1 and EBER2 RNA were highest and were proportional to the quantity of EBV genomes as measured by Q-PCR. Among protein coding EBV RNAs, EBNA1 from the Q promoter and BRLF1 were highly expressed while EBNA2 levels were low positive in only 6/14 infected cancers. Concomitant upregulation of cellular factors implies that virus is not an innocent bystander but rather is linked to NFKB signaling (FCER2, TRAF1) and immune response (TNFSF9, CXCL11, IFITM1, FCRL3, MS4A1 and PLUNC), with PPARG expression implicating altered cellular metabolism.

Tissue-sample ex vivo assays are potentially valuable, but their procurement through biopsies is invasive and might be biased by tumor heterogeneity. We studied the feasibility of using PET to quantify changes in ErbB2 (HER2/neu) expression and to predict the response to trastuzumab in BT474 breast cancer xenografts with N-[2-(4-(18)F-fluorobenzamido)ethyl]maleimide ((18)F-FBEM)-HER(2:342) Affibody.;Mice bearing BT474 tumors were given trastuzumab (50 mg/kg loading dose, 25 mg/kg maintenance dose, administered intraperitoneally twice a week) or saline (control) for a total of 5 doses. Tumor size was monitored twice a week. Animals were scanned before the treatment, at 48 h, and 2 wk after the beginning of therapy. After the final scan, PET results were correlated with tumor response and immunohistochemical assessment of ErbB2 level, as well as with vasculature in the treated tumors.;Analysis of PET images indicated that tracer uptake was significantly reduced after 1 dose of trastuzumab, compared with baseline, suggesting applicability as an early indicator of changes in ErbB2 expression. After 5 doses of trastuzumab, the overall decrease in (18)F-FBEM-HER(2:342) Affibody uptake also correlated with tumor response and downregulation of ErbB2 expression by immunohistochemical assessment. However, individual animals had different responses. There was a correlation between bigger PET changes and a higher vessel count in the tumors, suggesting that an increased number of vessels could lead to better trastuzumab delivery. We confirmed that the difference in average vessel count in the tumors was not related to the size of the tumors and therefore was not due to the selection of more vascular tumors. This finding is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that the number of vessels in a tumor could be a useful prognostic marker for treatment response.;Our data suggest that Affibody-based PET can noninvasively provide specific information on changes in receptor expression and could be a valuable strategy for predicting tumor response to trastuzumab.",

As proof of concept, we analyzed mouse breast cancer cells (4T1 cells) in a 384-well plate format following exposure to a diverse set of compounds at different concentrations. The result showed concentration dependent phenotypic trajectories for different biologically active compounds that could be used to classify compounds based on their biological target. To demonstrate the wider applicability of our method, we analyzed the phenotypes of a collection of 44 human breast cancer cell lines cultured in 3D and showed that our method correctly distinguished basal-A, basal-B, luminal and ERBB2+ cell lines in a supervised nearest neighbor classification method.

Clims act within the basal cell compartment to promote branching morphogenesis by maintaining the number and proliferative potential of basal mammary epithelial stem cells. Clim2, in a complex with LMO4, supports mammary stem cells by directly targeting the Fgfr2 promoter in basal cells to increase its expression. Strikingly, Clims also coordinate basal-specific transcriptional programs to preserve luminal cell identity. These basal-derived cues inhibit epidermis-like differentiation of the luminal cell compartment and enhance the expression of luminal cell-specific oncogenes ErbB2 and ErbB3. Consistently, basal-expressed Clims promote the initiation and progression of breast cancer in the MMTV-PyMT tumor model, and the Clim-regulated branching morphogenesis gene network is a prognostic indicator of poor breast cancer outcome in humans.

The large sizes of the HSRs, which each corresponded to several percent of the haploid genome, were hardly compatible with the low rate of amplification, except for FES and then only if a large adjacent segment was co-amplified. This incomplete correlation was demonstrated by in situ hybridization, using biotinylated probes, which showed fluorescent spots on only one HSR for FES in one tumor and for INT2 in another one.

Inhibiting oncokinases, such as EGFR, ALK, ERBB2, and BRAF, is a mainstay of current cancer therapy but is hindered by innate drug resistance mediated by up-regulation of the HGF receptor, MET. The mechanisms mediating such genomic responses to targeted therapy are unknown. Here, we identify lineage-specific enhancers at the MET locus for multiple common tumor types, including a melanoma lineage-specific enhancer 63 kb downstream from the MET TSS. This enhancer displays inducible chromatin looping with the MET promoter to up-regulate MET expression upon BRAF inhibition. Epigenomic analysis demonstrated that the melanocyte-specific transcription factor, MITF, mediates this enhancer function. Targeted genomic deletion (<7 bp) of the MITF motif within the MET enhancer suppressed inducible chromatin looping and innate drug resistance, while maintaining MITF-dependent, inhibitor-induced melanoma cell differentiation. Epigenomic analysis can thus guide functional disruption of regulatory DNA to decouple pro- and anti-oncogenic functions of a dominant transcription factor and block innate resistance to oncokinase therapy.

The authors identified recurrent mutations in tumor protein p53 (TP53), KRAS, catenin (cadherin-associated protein) β-1 (CTNNB1), AT-rich interactive domain 2 (ARID2), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), ARID1A, cadherin-related family member 1 (CDHR1), NRAS, Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (BOK), radial spoke head 14 homolog (chlamydomonas) (RTDR1), cell division cycle 27 (CDC27), catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PIK3CA), and SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4). Pathway scan indicated that the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, and the pathway of focal adhesion were the most extensively affected pathways.;This genomic characterization of duodenal adenocarcinoma provides researchers with insight into its somatic landscape and highlights the vital role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The study data also indicate that duodenal adenocarcinomas have a genetic resemblance to gastric and colorectal cancers. These discoveries may benefit the future development of molecular diagnosis and personalized therapies. Cancer 2016;122:1689-96. © 2016 American Cancer Society.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in many industrialized countries. Approximately one fourth of all women diagnosed with early breast cancer present with tumors that are characterized by erbB2 amplification. While the associated Her-2/neu receptor overexpression results in a high risk of relapse and poor prognosis, these tumors also represent a target for a selective monoclonal antibody therapy with trastuzumab (Herceptin). The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy has led to a considerable reduction of recurrences and to a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. Unfortunately, despite Her-2/neu overexpression, not all patients equally benefit from trastuzumab treatment, and almost all women with metastatic breast cancer eventually progress during antibody therapy. Moreover, trastuzumab is burdened with cardiotoxicity, thus increasing the risk of symptomatic congestive heart failure. In addition, the marginal costs for a 1 year therapy of trastuzumab-based therapy, which is currently considered to be the most effective treatment regimen in the adjuvant setting, may amount for up to US$ 40.000. Testing for erbB2 oncogene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), respectively, and staining for Her-2/neu receptor overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) represent the current standard for determining patient eligibility for trastuzumab-based therapy. However, while the negative predictive value of these assays for predicting the absence of benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy is sufficiently high, their positive predictive value remains insufficient, i.e. only a proportion of patients selected by these tests substantially benefit from trastuzumab-containing regimen. Accordingly, over the last years a number of biomarkers have been evaluated in their potential to predict response to trastuzumab-based therapies. These include markers auf activation of Her-2/neu (e.g., tyrosine phosphorylated Her-2/neu in tissue and cleaved Her-2/neu extracellular domain in serum) and its dimerization partners (e.g., EGFR), respectively, but also components of Her-2/neu-induced downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab (e.g., PTEN and PI3K). Other parameters, such as topoisomerase-II alpha and c-myc co-amplifications, have also been identified as potentially useful predictors of response to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen. While the benefit of these predictive biomarkers in the metastatic setting is currently explored, their usefulness in the adjuvant setting is still largely unknown. It is, however, undisputable that, within the group of Her-2/neu overexpressing tumors, further response predictors are needed in order to minimize trastuzumab-associated side effects, and to reduce the considerable societal costs that are associated with trastuzumab-based treatment regimen.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite advances in treatment, long-term outcome of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is no better today than reported in 1975. A recent study applying DNA microarray technology revealed that patients whose cancer related to patterns of genes expressed in germinal center lymphocytes responded more favorably to chemotherapy than patients whose cancer related to patterns of genes expressed in activated lymphocytes. cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays are described, and their applications in cancer research are reviewed. In addition to DLBCL, microarray technology has been used to study several types of cancer. The applications of microarray technology are numerous and include profiling gene expression patterns in order to facilitate diagnosis and predict response to therapy; correlating patterns of gene expression with prognosis; and identifying genes and gene products that are associated with tumorigenic phenotype or with drug resistance, among other applications. Microarraytechnology has also been used in cell lines to correlate gene expression and chemotherapy response. Furthermore, microarray technology may provide a useful tool to examine the development of drug resistance in cancer and has recently been used to study changes in gene expression caused by activated c-Myc in primary human fibroblasts. Tissue microarrays are described. In addition to the amplification of limited tissue re sources, tissue microarrays have the advantages of limiting the variability associated with tissue processing and limiting the necessary amount of reagent. Tissue microarrays have been used to determine the frequencies of amplication of 3 major breast cancer genes and identify overexpression of ERBB2 mRNA; assess and compare gene amplification in benign prostatic hyperplasia, primary prostate carcinoma, recurrent prostate tumors, and metastatic tumors; compare aggressiveness of prostate carcinoma in 2 patient populations; and study gene amplification across various tumor types. Furthermore, DNA microarray and tissue microarray techniques can be combined to provide convergent evidence of findings and to examine different aspects of gene expression. DNA array technology may also be used to identify critical molecular targets or to identify the critical rate-limiting step in a cascade of genes under the influence of a mutated gene. The historical progression of goals of the National Cancer Institute is reviewed, as well as the economic impact of reduction in cancer-associated mortality. Future efforts should continue the investment in basic research and more effectively integrate it with clinical trials and with approaches to prevention and treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB2 is frequently activated in tumors, and influences a wide array of cellular functions, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility and adhesion. HKI-272 (neratinib) is a small molecule pan-kinase inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and shows strong antiproliferative activity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We undertook a genome-wide pooled lentiviral RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal or enhancer (synthetic modulator screen) genes that interact with neratinib in a human breast cancer cell line (SKBR-3). These genes upon knockdown would modulate cell viability in the presence of subeffective concentrations of neratinib. We discovered a diverse set of genes whose depletion selectively impaired or enhanced the viability of SKBR-3 cells in the presence of neratinib. We observed diverse pathways including EGFR, hypoxia, cAMP, and protein ubiquitination that, when co-treated with RNAi and neratinib, resulted in arrest of cell proliferation. Examining the changes of these genes and their protein products also led to a rationale for clinically relevant drug combination treatments. Treatment of cells with either paclitaxel or cytarabine in combination with neratinib resulted in a strong antiproliferative effect. The identification of novel mediators of cellular response to neratinib and the development of potential drug combination treatments have expanded our understanding of neratinib's mode-of-action for the development of more effective therapeutic regimens. Notably, our findings support a paclitaxel and neratinib phase III clinical trial in breast cancer patients.",

To confirm mRNA expression levels on protein level, we studied ERBB4 and HCK using immunohistochemistry.;A total of 12 TK were significantly upregulated in ccRCC (ABL2, FLT1, BTK, HCK, JAK3, CSF1R, MET, JAK1, MATK, PTPRC, FYN and CSK), coherently 7 TK demonstrated a down-regulation (ERBB4, PDGFRA, NRTK3, SYK, ERBB2, FGFR3 and PTK7). These findings were validated by the utilization of RT-PCR for ABL2, FLT1 BTK, HCK, JAK3, CSF1R, MET, JAK1, MATK and vice versa for ERBB4 and PDGFRA.

Frequencies of losses of heterozygosity ranged from a low of 3.5% (chromosome 13q) to a high of 27% (chromosome 3p). The number of sites involved in breast cancer added to the frequent occurrence of concomitant losses at several chromosomal arms within the same tumor suggest cooperative effects of these LOHs. We were therefore interested in assessing the existence of preferential associations between sets of LOHs in our panel of tumors. Statistically significant associations were found between LOHs at chromosomes 1p and 17p, and between LOHs at chromosomes 11p and 17p. Furthermore, since all the tumors presently studied had previously been analyzed for proto-oncogene amplification at 5 distinct chromosomal sites, we tested for associations between LOH and DNA amplification. Such associations were indeed observed as exemplified by the correlations observed between the LOH at 11p and amplification of the erbB2 gene and LOH at 17p and the amplification of the flg gene. The only correlation with clinico-pathological parameters that could be observed linked the occurrence of LOHs on 11p with recurrent breast cancer (p = 0.015). Sets of several LOHs or LOHs and gene amplifications could not be significantly related to any marker of tumor aggressiveness.",

We have studied genes encoding important breast cancer-related proteins using a model for survival-type data that is based on natural splines and the Cox proportional hazard model, thereby removing the linearity assumption. Expression data of 16 genes were studied in relation to metastasis-free probability in a cohort of 295 consecutive breast cancer patients treated at The Netherlands Cancer Institute. The independent predictive power for disease outcome of the 16 individual genes was tested in a multivariable model with known clinical and pathological risk factors. There is a linear relationship between increasing expression and a higher or lower hazard for distant metastasis for ESR1, ERBB4, VEGF, CCNE2, EZH2, and UPA; for ERBB2, ERBB3, CCND1, CCNE1, EED, CXCR4, CCR7, SDF1, and PAI1 there is no clear increase or decrease; and for EGFR there seems to be a non-linear relation. Multivariable analysis showed that the 70-gene prognosis profile outperforms all the other variables in the model (hazard-rate 5.4, 95% CI 2.5-11.7; P = 0.000018).

Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36% of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.",

Adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (ARVM) were isolated and treated for 18-48 h. SERCA protein was analyzed by Western blot, EC coupling parameters by fura-2 and video edge detection, gene expression by RT-PCR, and ROS by DCF-fluorescence microscopy. At clinically relevant doses Doxo reduced cardiomyocytes contractility, SERCA protein and SR calcium content. NRG, similarly as the antioxidant N-acetylcystein (NAC), did not affect EC coupling alone, but protected against Doxo-induced damage. NRG and Doxo showed an opposite modulation of glutathione reductase gene expression. NRG, similarly as NAC, reduced peroxide- or Doxo-induced oxidative stress. Specific inhibitors showed, that the antioxidant action of NRG depended on signaling via the ErbB2 receptor and on the Akt- and not on the MAPK-pathway. Therefore, NRG attenuates Doxo-induced alterations of EC coupling and reduces oxidative stress in ARVM. Inhibition of the ErbB2/NRG signaling pathway by trastuzumab in patients concomitantly treated with Doxo might prevent beneficial effects of NRG in the myocardium.",
