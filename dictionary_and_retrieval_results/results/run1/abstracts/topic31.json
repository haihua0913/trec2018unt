Different biomarkers have been suggested to yield additional prognostic information, but no single marker has thus far been introduced in the clinic. The objective of the present study was to analyze the copy number of the frequently amplified oncogenes CCND1 and c-MYC in relation to the commonly deleted tumor suppressor gene cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)N2A (p16) to enhance the clinical significance.;Extracted DNA from diagnostic biopsies of 78 untreated patients were analyzed by real-time PCR with specific primers for c-MYC, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Gene copy number ratios were calculated by dividing the copy number of c-MYC or CCND1 with CDKN2A. Ratios > 2 were defined as enhanced. These data were related to disease-free interval and disease-specific survival.;Enhanced gene ratio of c-MYC:CDKN2A was detected in 35 of 78 (45%) and enhanced ratio of CCND1:CDKN2A in 36 of 78 (46%) of the cases. The c-MYC:CDKN2A and CCND1:CDKN2A ratios correlated with disease-specific survival with respect to death (P = 0.042 and 0.049, respectively; Log-rank test). Furthermore, enhancement of c-MYC:CDKN2A was associated with a shorter disease-free interval as marked by the development of recurrences or metastases (P = 0.014; Log-rank test).;We conclude that CCND1 and/or c-MYC amplification, when combined with CDKN2A deletion, yield additional prognostic information as compared with analysis of single genetic aberrations. These gene ratios, as analyzed by a sensitive method like real-time PCR on diagnostic biopsies, might help clinicians to individualize the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck as they reflect the biological properties of the tumors.

We investigated the frequency of different potential mechanisms of CDKN2A inactivation in oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCC) and their impact on patient outcome. From a cohort of 153 OTSCC patients, 131 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks of pre-treatment primary tumours were suitable for further molecular analysis. We assessed CDKN2A (p16) levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and correlated these with patient outcome. We found that the majority of OTSCC did not overexpress p16 (110/116, 95%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A mutations was 20% (21/103), homozygous loss was 7% (7/97), hemizygous loss 31% (30/97), and promoter methylation was 18% (20/113). We found no evidence of these mechanisms in 24/106 (23%) p16 IHC negative tumours. No significant correlation was identified between any potential mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation and clinical features, including smoking status and age. There was a non-significant trend for worse overall survival for p16 IHC negative patients versus positive patients (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 0.44-7.47, p = 0.40). No relationship was found between mechanisms of CDKN2A disruption and patient outcome. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CDKN2A alteration is a frequent event in OTSCC tumourigenesis. However, no correlation was identified between different potential mechanisms of CDKN2A disruption and clinical characteristics or patient outcome. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer in the US. Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications.",

By contrast, DNA studies showed a much lower frequency of loss of the CDKN2A gene. Point mutations and promoter methylation of CDKN2A were seen in 7% and 23%, respectively, of primary tumors. Loss of heterozygosity analysis using a dense set of 9p markers showed allelic imbalance that included CDKN2A in only 31% of samples, but a further 47% showed loss at loci near CDKN2A with apparent retention of CDKN2A. No tumor with any allelic imbalance expressed CDKN2A, whether or not the imbalance appeared to involve the CDKN2A locus. We interpret these data as showing partially overlapping deletions on the two 9p homologues, with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A masked by amplification of contaminating stromal material. Our data show that inactivation of the CDKN2A gene products is a near-universal step in the development of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and we suggest that homozygous deletion is the most common mechanism of inactivation. The CDKN2A locus may be particularly prone to deletion because it encodes two unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, CDKN2A (p16INK4a) and p19ARF, and deletion, but not point mutation or methylation, would inactivate both gene products. However, our results also suggest that complex patterns of allelic imbalance in primary squamous carcinomas in general may not provide reliable evidence for the existence of multiple tumor suppressor genes within a single chromosomal region.",

PCR-RFLP analysis was used to investigate the p16 (CDKN2A) gene in 96 patients with HNSCC and in 100 individuals without HNSCC. A case group was categorized by age in younger (<60 years) and older (≥ 60 years) patients. Differences between the case and control groups were determined using Fisher and chi-squared tests. Time of survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up visit or to the date of death using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and comparing this to the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. In the present study, no association was established between HNSCC and rs11515 polymorphism, as indicated in a previous study. We found that HNSCC individuals with large-sized tumors and with metastatic disease presented worse overall survival, consistent with fundamental concepts that establish the effects of tumor size and lymph node metastasis to HNSCC outcomes.

Other distinct subgroups contained loss-of-function alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, WNT pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumours. Therapeutic candidate alterations were identified in most HNSCCs. ",

To systematically identify homozygous deletions in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and to unravel novel putative tumor suppressor genes we screened three laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (LSCC) using array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). Out of 31 candidate regions for homozygous deletions identified by array-CGH, 5 were verified further by PCR. Among others, these homozygous deletions affected the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A and the apoptosis-inducing STK17A gene. To assess the frequency of the identified deletions we investigated the affected sites in 9 additional LSCC cell lines. In 5 of the 9 cell lines the CDKN2A gene was homozygously lost. Thus, CDKN2A was homozygously deleted in 7 of the 12 cell lines. No other recurrent homozygous deletions were found. Homozygous deletions was a frequent mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation. Moreover, we identified several other genes, including the putative tumor suppressor gene STK17A, which may be inactivated by homozygous deletions and thus are potentially implicated in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma development.",

Several studies have shown that human SCCs harbour unique mutations in the p53 gene as well as inactivation of the CDKN2A gene. While mutations in the p53 gene are induced by UV radiation and represent tumor initiating events, the majority of alterations detected in the CDKN2A gene do not appear to be UV-dependent.

In addition to known genetic changes in HNSCC, molecular cytogenetic investigations have identified chromosomal regions of gains and losses, but many of the responsible candidate genes have yet to be identified. Furthermore, recent results indicate the importance of epigenetic modifications in HNSCC, such as DNA methylation. Several genes, including the tumor suppressor CDKN2A and other candidates such as DAPK1, MGMT, TIMP3, TCF21, and C/EBPalpha, have been found to harbor hypermethylated regulatory sequences that lead to reduced expression or gene silencing. Hypermethylation in such genes could be used not only as biomarkers for the early detection of HNSCC but also to improve prevention strategies and therapy outcomes.",

Additional metastasis-associated genes were included from the literature. Thus genes were selected that influence the development of nodal metastases and might be regulated by methylation. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) primers were designed and tested on 8 head-neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and technically validated on 10 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) OOSCC cases. Predictive value was assessed in a clinical series of 70 FFPE OOSCC with pathologically determined nodal status. Five out of 28 methylation markers (OCLN, CDKN2A, MGMT, MLH1 and DAPK1) were frequently differentially methylated in OOSCC. Of these, MGMT methylation was associated with pN0 status (P = 0.02) and with lower immunoexpression (P = 0.02). DAPK1 methylation was associated with pN+ status (P = 0.008) but did not associate with protein expression. In conclusion, out of 28 candidate genes, two (7%) showed a predictive value for the pN status. Both genes, DAPK1 and MGMT, have predictive value for nodal metastasis in a clinical group of OOSCC. Therefore DNA methylation markers are capable of contributing to diagnosis and treatment selection in OOSCC.

To enhance molecular knowledge of HNSCC and define a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) landscape of the disease, we profiled the transcriptome-wide dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) using RNA-sequencing data from 422 HNSCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 307 non-coding transcripts differentially expressed in HNSCC were significantly correlated with patient survival, and associated with mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, CASP8, PRDM9, and FBXW7 and copy number variations in chromosomes 3, 5, 7, and 18. We also observed widespread ncRNA correlation to concurrent TP53 and chromosome 3p loss, a compelling predictor of poor prognosis in HNSCCs. Three selected ncRNAs were additionally associated with tumor stage, HPV status, and other clinical characteristics, and modulation of their expression in vitro reveals differential regulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptotic response. This comprehensive characterization of the HNSCC non-coding transcriptome introduces new layers of understanding for the disease, and nominates a novel panel of transcripts with potential utility as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets.",

However, atypical verruciform proliferations are also associated with these malignancies and their pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study compared 11 atypical verruciform lesions, including atypical verruciform hyperplasia, vulvar acanthosis with altered differentiation, and verruciform lichen simplex chronicus, with 14 human papillomavirus-negative keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Extracted tissue DNA was subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing of the exonic regions of 300 genes. Eight (73%) and six (55%) of eleven atypical verruciform lesions contained mutations in PIK3CA and ARID2, respectively. No TP53 mutations were identified. Eleven (79%) and five (36%) of fourteen keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas tested contained TP53 and CDKN2A mutations, respectively. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas displayed the majority of copy number variations with some variations (7p gain and 8p loss) shared by some cases in both groups. One patient developed atypical verruciform lesions with PIK3CA mutations followed by a keratinizing carcinoma with mutations in both PIK3CA and TP53. This study, for the first time segregates atypical verruciform lesions by virtue of a unique genotype (PIK3CA mutant/TP53 wild type) illustrating an example of progression to a TP53-mutated keratinizing carcinoma. The findings indicate that although PIK3CA mutations are found in <10% of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, they may be specific for a particular pathway involving atypical verruciform lesions, which could function as either a direct precursor or a risk factor for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Given the presence of a molecular signature, we propose the term 'differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesion' for this group. Whether they function as direct precursors to a less common form of squamous cell carcinoma will require further study, but carcinomas associated with these lesions might warrant testing for PIK3CA mutations to address this question.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 11 November 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.187.",

To this end we set-up primary skin cell co-cultures from siblings of melanoma prone-families that were later analyzed using the expression array approach. As a result, we found that 1535 transcripts were deregulated in CDKN2A mutated cells, with over-expression of immunity-related genes (HLA-DPB1, CLEC2B, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, SP110 and IFNK) and down-regulation of genes playing a role in the Notch signaling pathway. 3570 transcripts were deregulated in MC1R variant carriers. In particular, genes related to oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways were up-regulated as well as genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer and Huntington. Finally, we observed that the expression signatures indentified in phenotypically normal cells carrying CDKN2A mutations or MC1R variants are maintained in skin cancer tumors (melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma).

To avoid overlooking genetic alterations due to contamination of noncancerous cells, we examined 32 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and 16 cell small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines. (CDKN2A was mutated or homozygously deleted in 20 (63%) of 32 NSCLC cell lines, and methylation of the CpG island in the CDKN2A gene was detected in six of the 12 cell lines carrying the wild-type CDKN2A gene. Although homozygous deletions of the CDKN2B gene were also detected in NSCLC cell lines with CDKN2A deletions, mutation and methylation in the CDKN2B gene were infrequent. Thus, it was indicated that the CDKN2A gene rather than the CDKN2B gene plays a critical role as a tumor suppressor gene in NSCLC. Homozygous deletions on 9p were detected in 14 (44%) NSCLC cell lines. It is of note that two common regions of homozygous deletions were mapped proximal to the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci, suggesting that tumor suppressor genes other than CDKN2A are present on 9p. In contrast to NSCLC, homozygous deletions on 9p as well as CDKN2A and CDKN2B alterations were infrequent in SCLC. Therefore, the pathogenetic significance of 9p alterations is likely to differ between SCLC and NSCLC.",

Furthermore, recent studies in cancer have suggested the importance of identifying transcriptionally altered loci as biomarkers for improved prognosis and therapy. While many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying novel transcriptional events with RNA-seq, nearly all rely on contrasting known classes of samples, such as tumor and normal. Few tools exist for the unsupervised discovery of such events without class labels. In this paper, we present SigFuge for identifying genomic loci exhibiting differential transcription patterns across many RNA-seq samples. SigFuge combines clustering with hypothesis testing to identify genes exhibiting alternative splicing, or differences in isoform expression. We apply SigFuge to RNA-seq cohorts of 177 lung and 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and identify several cases of differential isoform usage including CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene known to be inactivated in a majority of lung squamous cell tumors. By not restricting attention to known sample stratifications, SigFuge offers a novel approach to unsupervised screening of genetic loci across RNA-seq cohorts.

To better understand the importance of RB1 activity in HPV-negative SCCHN, we investigated the prognostic value of inhibitory CDK4/6 phosphorylation of RB1 on threonine 356 (T356) in archival HPV-negative tumor specimens from patients who underwent surgical resection and adjuvant radiation. We benchmarked pT356RB1 to total RB1, Ki67, pT202/Y204ERK1/2, and TP53, as quantified by automatic quantitative analysis (AQUA), and correlated protein expression with tumor stage and grade. High expression of pT356RB1 but not total RB1 predicted reduced overall survival (OS; P = 0.0295), indicating the potential relevance of post-translational phosphorylation. Paired analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data for regulators of this RB1 phosphorylation identified loss or truncating mutation of negative regulator CDKN2A (p16) and elevated expression of the CDK4/6 activator CCND1 (cyclin D) as also predicting poor survival. Given that CDK4/6 inhibitors have been most effective in the context of functional RB1 and low expression or deletion of p16 in other tumor types, these data suggest such agents may merit evaluation in HPV-negative SCCHN, specifically in cases associated with high pT356RB1.

The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in p.Arg112dup carriers and their first degree relatives (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRs).;In this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in carriers (n=120), non-carriers (n=111), carriers' FDRs (n=275) and SDRs (n=321) and controls (n=3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RRs) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for all RRs.;In carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI 13.8 to 139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI 6.3 to 46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4 to 46.0). In FDRs and SDRs RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues.

Methylation of DAPK1 (P = 0.043), CCNA1 (P = 0.016) and TCF21 (P = 0.0005) was significantly more present in HNSCC than in controls. The genes TIMP3 (P = 0.018) and CCNA1 (P = 0.015) showed higher methylation frequency in HPV16 positive HNSCC compared to HPV16 negative tumors.

Inactivation of p16 is a common finding in many cancers; however, there is little data on CDKN2A gene abnormalities in oral precancer. In this longitudinal study, we examined changes in the CDKN2A gene locus in sequential epithelial dysplasias and oral carcinomas from 11 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from laser-microdissected lesional tissue, and exons 1alpha, 1beta, and 2 were analyzed by duplex PCR. Immunohistochemistry was done to identify p16 and p14ARF protein expression. Two adjacent polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for allelotyping. Homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha was identified in 2 of 17 (12%) precancerous lesions. Loss of either exon 1alpha, exon 2, or both was seen in seven of nine (78%) carcinomas. In five of these carcinomas, there was loss of only exon 1alpha. No case showed deletion of exon 1beta. In 5 of 11 patients, microsatellite markers showed differing patterns of allelic imbalance in the precancerous lesions and the subsequent carcinoma, suggesting a complex genetic pattern of progression from dysplasia to carcinoma. We conclude that during oral carcinogenesis homozygous deletion of exon 1alpha of the CDKN2A gene is common but that deletion of exon 2 and 1beta is less frequent. Moreover, our results suggest that the progression from oral precancer to cancer, in some cases, is more complex genetically than predicted by linear models of carcinogenesis.",

Their inactivation may contribute to uncontrolled growth in human cancer. We previously described CDKN2A exon 2 mutations in a pilot study of 43 esophageal cancers. In order to determine whether CDKN2A and CDKN2B are frequent targets of 9p21 deletion in esophageal carcinogenesis, we have now analyzed 60 primary esophageal cancers for mutations in both exons 1 and 2 of CDKN2A and CDKN2B by direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomic DNAs. In conjunction with our previously published data, we have identified a total of eight nucleic acid substitutions among 60 esophageal carcinomas; here, we describe one new CDKN2B nonsense mutation and one new silent CDKN2B mutation that occurred somatically. Taken together, these results suggest that intragenic mutations in CDKN2A and CDKN2B occur in esophageal cancer, but that they are infrequent events. In view of the known high frequency of loss of heterozygosity at the chromosome 9p21 locus in esophageal cancers, the current data suggest that intragenic mutation is not the predominant mode of inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B or that other genes are targets of deletion at this locus in these cancers.",

Approximately 70% of global oesophageal cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases (>90%). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting in a 10% five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes, of which six are well known tumour-associated genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, NFE2L2), and two have not previously been described in ESCC (ADAM29 and FAM135B). Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene, and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes (MLL2 (also called KMT2D), ASH1L, MLL3 (KMT2C), SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300) are frequently altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms, and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic strategies for ESCC. ",

Quantitative MSP of the margins of 24 hypermethylation informative tumours revealed that 11 patients had molecularly positive margins, of which, five developed disease-specific events (DSEs, three local recurrences and two metastases), compared to none in patients with molecularly negative margins, after a median follow-up of 48 months. Log-rank analyses showed that molecularly positive margins were associated with shorter time to local recurrences and disease-specific deaths (P=0.03 and 0.01, respectively).

We studied 288 bladder carcinomas: 177 non-muscle-invasive (123 Ta, 54 T1) and 111 muscle-invasive (T2-4) tumours. CDKN2A copy number was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and FGFR3 mutations by SNaPshot analysis.

CDKN2A homozygous deletion was significantly more frequent in FGFR3-mutated tumours than in wild-type FGFR3 tumours (p = 0.0015). This event was associated with muscle-invasive tumours within the FGFR3-mutated subgroup (p < 0.0001) but not in wild-type FGFR3 tumours. Similar findings were obtained for an independent series of 101 bladder carcinomas. The impact of CDKN2A deletions on recurrence-free and progression-free survival was then analysed in 89 patients with non-muscle-invasive FGFR3-mutated tumours. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that CDKN2A losses (hemizygous and homozygous) were associated with progression (p = 0.0002), but not with recurrence, in these tumours. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified CDKN2A loss as a predictor of progression independent of stage and grade. These findings highlight the crucial role of CDKN2A loss in the progression of non-muscle-invasive FGFR3-mutated bladder carcinomas and provide a potentially useful clinical marker for adapting the treatment of such tumours, which account for about 50% of cases at initial clinical presentation.",

HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have distinct risk profiles and appreciate a prognostic advantage compared to HPV-negative HNSCC. Promoter hypermethylation is widely recognized as a mechanism in the progression of HNSCC, but the extent to which this mechanism is consistent between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors is unknown. To investigate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HPV-induced and carcinogen-induced cancers, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression in HPV(+) and HPV(-) SCC cell lines. We used two platforms: the Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadArray and tiling arrays, and confirmed illustrative examples with pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. These analyses indicate that HPV(+) cell lines have higher DNA methylation in genic and LINE-1 regions than HPV(-) cell lines. Differentially methylated loci between HPV(+) and HPV(-) cell lines significantly correlated with HPV-typed HNSCC primary tumor DNA methylation levels. Novel findings include higher promoter methylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes in HPV(+) cells compared to HPV(-) cells and increased expression of DNMT3A in HPV(+) cells. Additionally, CDKN2A and KRT8 were identified as interaction hubs among genes with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(-) cells. Conversely, RUNX2, IRS-1 and CCNA1 were major hubs with higher methylation and lower expression in HPV(+) cells. Distinct HPV(+) and HPV(-) epigenetic profiles should provide clues to novel targets for development of individualized therapeutic strategies.",

DNA hypermethylation profiles differ significantly by HPV status suggesting that a specific subset of methylated CpG loci could give mechanistic insight into HPV-driven OPSCC. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation of primary tumor samples and adjacent normal mucosa from 46 OPSCC patients undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M value). From these analyses, we identified a 22 CpG loci panel for HPV+ OPSCC that included four CDKN2A loci downstream of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) transcription start sites. This panel was significantly associated with overall HPV detection (P < 0.05; ROC area under the curve = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.0) similar to the subset of four CDKN2A-specific CpG loci (0.90, 95% CI: 0.82-0.99) with equivalence to the full 22 CpG panel. DNA hypermethylation correlated with a significant increase in alternative open reading frame (ARF) expression in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors, but not to the other transcript variant encoded by the CDKN2A locus. Overall, this study provides evidence of epigenetic changes to the downstream region of the CDKN2A locus in HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer that are associated with changes in expression of the coded protein products.",

In addition, we screened the CDKN2B (p15 INK4b), CDKN2C (p18 INK4c), CDK4 and p53R2 genes for mutations in the tumour tissues. Besides concomitant alterations in the CDKN2A and p53 loci in more than half of the cases, our results showed that in 18 OSCC (86%) the CDKN2A (p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) ) gene was affected through mutations, homozygous/hemizygous deletions and promoter hypermethylation. Eight out of 10 tumours with mutations or promoter hypermethylation specific to the CDKN2A/p16 INK4a gene showed loss of the wild-type allele. One tumour with a single base deletion in the N-terminus (codon 8) of the CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) gene carried a novel germ-line mutation or a rare polymorphism (Ile51Met) in exon 2 of the CDK4 gene. Promoter hypermethylation in the CDKN2A/p14 ARF gene was detected in 11 tumours. In the p53 gene 15 mutations were detected in 14 tumours. We detected an inverse relationship between CDKN2A/p16 INK4a inactivation and frequency of loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.98; Fisher exact test, P-value approximately 0.03). Screening of nine exons of the p53R2 [Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) official name RRM2B] gene resulted in identification of a novel polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region, which was detected in four cases.

This study analyzed the presence and genotype of high risk HPVs, viral DNA load and transcription of the E6/E7 mRNAs, in 231 consecutive HNSCC. Twelve out of 30 HPV16 DNA-positive tumors displayed high E6/E7 mRNAs levels and were localized in the oropharyngeal region. While HPV-free and non-transcriptionally active HPV-related patients showed similar 5-years survival rates, E6/E7 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This emphasizes the importance of considering the transcriptional status of HPV-positive tumors for patient stratification. A gene expression profiling analysis of these different types of tumors was carried out. The most significant differentially expressed gene was CDKN2A, a known biomarker for HPV-related cancer. Assessing both the expression level of the E6/E7 mRNAs and of CDKN2A in HNSCC is required to detect active HPV infection. Chromosomic alterations were investigated by Comparative Genomic Hybridation (CGH) analysis of tumors with transcriptionally active HPV and HPV-negative tumors. The loss of the chromosomal region 16q was found to be a major genetic event in HPV-positive lesions. A cluster of genes located in 16q21-24 displayed decreased expression levels, notably APP-BP1 that is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of p53. In conclusion, this study highlights important criteria required to predict clinically active HPV infection, identifies new biological pathways implicated in HPV tumorigenesis and increases the understanding of HPV-HNSCC physiopathology that is required to develop new targets for therapy.",

In all histological types, except papillary carcinomas, we observed a statistically significant relationship between p14ARF and E2F1 (r=0.64 to 1, P<0.05).

Whether the PV infection influenced neoplasm development cannot be definitively determined in this case.

Our recent investigations revealed that FOXA1 as a forkhead transcription factor mediates CDKN2A activation in cellular senescence. However, the contribution of this axis in carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, using a comprehensive collection of cancer microarray data, we found FOXA1 is down-regulated in many cancers compared to their normal counterparts and the positive correlation between FOXA1 and CDKN2A could be observed in prostate and breast cancers with lower EZH2 (epigenetic repressor for CDKN2A) expression. Experimentally, epistasis analysis in prostate and breast cancer cells indicated that higher expression of FOXA1 opposes EZH2-mediated CDKN2A repression, as further depletion of FOXA1 reverts the de-silencing of CDKN2A caused by EZH2 inhibition. Concomitantly, EZH2-depletion suppresses cancer cell cycle progression and this regulation is optimized in the presence of FOXA1 and CDKN2A. A further oncogenic transformation assay suggested that overexpression of EZH2 is insufficient to block RAS-induced CDKN2A activation and loss of FOXA1 is mandatory to potentiate EZH2-mediated CDKN2A silencing and to bypass the senescence barrier. Importantly, using an in vitro histone methyltransferase (HMTase) system, we found FOXA1 directly inhibits EZH2's histone methyltransferase activity through its C-terminal histone binding motif. These data support that positive regulation of CDKN2A by FOXA1 counteracts its tumorigenic repression of by EZH2 in cancers. ",

Together, these cancers represent over 1.5 million cases and are the cause of about 1.25 million deaths annually. This group of cancers encompasses diseases with marked disparities in etiology, geographic distribution, histopathological features and frequency. Based on histological origin, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC), which arises through a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence within the squamous mucosa, is a completely different cancer than junction, stomach and duodenal cancers, which develop within glandular epithelia through cascades involving inflammation, metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma. At the frontline between these two histological domains, cancers of the esophago-gastric junction constitute a mixed group of glandular tumors including distal esophageal adenocarcinomas and cancers arising within the most proximal part of the stomach - the cardia. Most of UGIT cancers are sporadic, although familial susceptibility genes have been identified for stomach and rare cases of ESCC. We have used the COSMIC database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) to identify genes commonly mutated in UGIT cancers. Regardless of etiology and histopathology, three genes are mutated in at least 5% of UGIT cancers: TP53, CDKN2a and PIK3CA. Another three genes, NFE2L2, PTCH1 and NOTCH1, are mutated in ESCC only. Conversely, genes of the RAS family and of the CDH1/APC/CTNNB1 pathway are mutated only in non-squamous cancers, with differences in mutated genes according to topography.

An analysis of an independent validation set and functional studies with BRAF inhibitors in the presence of the prevalent RAS mutation was also performed.;Among 21 tumor samples, 13 had RAS mutations (12 in HRAS). In a validation set of 14 samples, 8 had RAS mutations (4 in HRAS). Thus, 60% (21 of 35) of the specimens harbored RAS mutations, the most prevalent being HRAS Q61L. Increased proliferation of HRAS Q61L-mutant cell lines exposed to vemurafenib was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway signaling and activation of ERK-mediated transcription. In a mouse model of HRAS Q61L-mediated skin carcinogenesis, the vemurafenib analogue PLX4720 was not an initiator or a promoter of carcinogenesis but accelerated growth of the lesions harboring HRAS mutations, and this growth was blocked by concomitant treatment with a MEK inhibitor.;Mutations in RAS, particularly HRAS, are frequent in cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas that develop in patients treated with vemurafenib. The molecular mechanism is consistent with the paradoxical activation of MAPK signaling and leads to accelerated growth of these lesions.

Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with defined CDKN2A status were analyzed by MTS assay to determine the effect of zebularine or zebularine combined with depsipeptide on tumor cell growth. We observed that zebularine treatment resulted in inhibition of cell growth in 11 out of 12 lung cancer cell lines with silenced CDKN2A, but no cell growth inhibition was detected in the 7 lung cancer cell lines tested with deleted CDKN2A (p>0.001). In addition, we found that the combination of 30 microM zebularine and 6 or 7 nM depsipeptide resulted in a synergistic inhibition of cell growth in tumor cells with silenced CDKN2A (p<0.001, CI=0.70 and 0.57, respectively) but not in tumor cells with deleted CDKN2A. In conclusion, tumor cells with methylated CDKN2A are more sensitive to zebularine than cell lines with deleted CDKN2A and the combination of zebularine/depsipeptide results in a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition that is also linked with the presence of silenced CDKN2A. Thus, combination of DNA methyltransferase and HDAC inhibitors may be a potential treatment for lung cancer patients, but careful selection of patients will be needed to optimize the benefit of this regimen.",

We investigated the clinical, demographic, histological, and survival differences between MPMs and single melanoma occurring in the head and neck region. A retrospective analysis of medical and histologic records from 217 melanomas of the head and neck region was carried out. Malignant neoplasms affecting MPMs patients were also reported. Mutational analysis of specific genes was carried out when clinical data and family history were suggestive for a familial/hereditary setting. Two hundred and five out of 217 (94.5%) patients were affected by single primary melanoma and 12 (5.5%) by MPMs of the head and neck region. Individuals affected by MPMs were distinguished by a significantly higher mutation frequency and a higher prevalence of malignant neoplasms such as renal cancer. Genetic testing showed germline mutations affecting MITF E318K, CDKN2A genes. Our data highlight the importance of strict cancer surveillance in individuals with MPMs and the role of appropriate genetic counseling and testing in selected patients. Finally, personalized clinical and instrumental screening and follow-up strategies should also be based on mutational status.

It is only rarely associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. Previous studies from Asian countries, have suggested that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays a role in the pathogenesis and overexpression of p16(INK4a), a surrogate marker of HPV infection, have also been reported. However, data from western countries seem contradictory. In order to clarify and explore the molecular and epigenetic basis of HPV, CDKN2A status and role of microsatellite instability in the development of periocular sebaceous carcinoma, 24 cases of periocular sebaceous carcinoma were analyzed for the expression of p16(INK4a) and mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) via immunohistochemistry. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genechip HPV typing were used to detect HPV infection and decide its genotype when present. PCR amplification using a consensus primer pair was also performed to detect β-HPV. The methylation status of CDKN2A promoter region was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. HPV-positivity was demonstrated in only one of our cases (HPV 16), while another case showed p16(INK4a) overexpression. All cases showed preserved expression of mismatch repair proteins. CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation was noted in nearly half of our cases (11/24) and was associated with younger patient age (P = .013). Our results showed that periocular sebaceous carcinoma is rarely associated with HPV and microsatellite instability. Higher frequency of CDKN2A promoter hypermethylation in younger patients implies a significant epigenetic role in tumor development in this age group. ",

To determine the early molecular alterations induced by (S)-NNN in the oral and esophageal mucosa, we administered the carcinogen to rats in the drinking water for 10 wk and global gene expression alterations were analyzed by RNA sequencing. At a false discovery rate P-value < 0.05 and fold-change ≥2, we found alterations in the level of 39 genes in the oral cavity and 69 genes in the esophagus. Validation of RNA sequencing results by qRT-PCR assays revealed a high cross-platform concordance. The most significant impact of exposure to (S)-NNN was alteration of genes involved in immune regulation (Aire, Ctla4, and CD80), inflammation (Ephx2 and Inpp5d) and cancer (Cdkn2a, Dhh, Fetub B, Inpp5d, Ly6E, Nr1d1, and Wnt6). Consistent with the findings in rat tissues, most of the genes were deregulated, albeit to different degrees, in immortalized oral keratinocytes treated with (S)-NNN and in non-treated premalignant oral cells and malignant oral and head and neck squamous cells. Furthermore, interrogation of TCGA data sets showed that genes deregulated by (S)-NNN in rat tissues (Fetub, Ly6e, Nr1d1, Cacna1c, Cd80, and Dgkg) are also altered in esophageal and head and neck tumors. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into early molecular changes induced by (S)-NNN and, therefore, could contribute to the development of biomarkers for the early detection and prevention of (S)-NNN-associated oral and esophageal cancers. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, these agents are associated with the development of other nonmelanoma skin lesions, in particular squamoproliferative lesions such as keratoacanthomas (KAs), squamous cell carcinomas, and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses. The molecular pathogenesis of these lesions is of interest, not only for therapeutic reasons, but also for the insight it might provide into the development of similar lesions in a sporadic setting. We used next-generation sequencing to compare the mutational profiles of lesions after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, with similar lesions arising sporadically. HRAS mutations were common among the BRAF inhibitor-induced lesions, being identified in 56%, compared with 14% of lesions in the sporadic group (P = 0.002). Thus, despite similar histomorphological appearances, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be different. In addition, within the BRAF inhibitor-associated group, the lesions designated as KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses had a similar mutational profile (mutations in PIK3CA, APC, and HRAS), which was distinct to that seen in squamous cell carcinomas (FGFR3, CDKN2A, and STK11). We have previously noted histological overlap between KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses, and this finding supports the notion that they may represent morphological or temporal variants of a single lesion type.

Twenty-nine MCC specimens from 23 patients were examined for deletions at 10 loci on 9p and 1 on 9q. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was seen in 9 patients including 2 for which tumour and cell line DNAs were examined. Four patients had LOH for all informative loci on 9p. Ten tumours showed more limited regions of loss on 9p, and from these 2 common regions of deletion were determined. Half of all informative cases had LOH at D9S168, the most telomeric marker examined, and 3 specimens showed loss of only D9S168. A second region (IFNA-D9S126) showed LOH in 10 (44%) cases, and case MCC26 showed LOH for only D9S126, implicating genes centromeric of the CDKN2A locus.

Here, we present an analysis of 86 transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for inactivation of this locus. Multiplex quantitative PCR analysis for five microsatellites around the locus showed that 34 tumors (39%) had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) generally encompassing the entire region. Of these, 17 tumors (20%) carried homozygous deletions of at least one CDKN2A exon and of flanking microsatellites, as detected by quantitative PCR. Analysis by restriction enzyme PCR and methylation-specific PCR showed that only three specimens, each with LOH across 9p21, had bona fide hypermethylation of the CDKN2A exon 1alpha CpG-island in the remaining allele. Like most other specimens, these three specimens displayed substantial genome-wide hypomethylation of DNA as reflected in the methylation status of LINE L1 sequences. The extent of DNA hypomethylation was significantly more pronounced in TCC with LOH and/or homozygous deletions at 9p21 than in those without (26% and 28%, respectively, on average, versus 11%, p < 0.0015). No association of LOH or homozygous deletions at 9p21 with tumor stage or grade was found. The data indicate that DNA hypermethylation may be rare in TCC and that deletions are the most important mechanism for inactivation of the CDKN2A locus. The predominance of allelic loss may be explained by its correlation with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, which is thought to favor chromosomal instability and illegitimate recombination.",

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was performed using eight polymorphic markers immediately surrounding CDKN2A, and showed a contiguous region of loss, with the two most commonly deleted markers being D9S1604, located between the p16 and p15 genes, at which 7 of 13 informative tumors (54%) showed loss, and D9S171, with 4 of 14 LOH (29%). Exons 1, 2, and 3 of CDKN2A were amplified by polymerase chain reaction to detect homozygous deletions, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed to screen for mutations. No homozygous deletions were detected in any sample. SSCP and sequence analysis showed the same nucleotide change at codon 148 in four tumors. This has been reported elsewhere as a polymorphism. One of these four tumors also contained a mutation at codon 119, resulting in the substitution of an acidic amino acid for a basic one. It is concluded that CDKN2A is infrequently deleted or mutated in HCC. The region of allelic loss upstream from CDKN2A might result in inactivation of regulatory sequences important in the expression of this gene; alternatively, a second tumor suppressor gene may be present in the region 9p21-22, proximal to CDKN2A.

We found that the CDKN2A gene was more frequently methylated in fresh tumor cells isolated from patients with acute ATL (47%) or lymphoma-type ATL (73%) than in those with less malignant chronic (17%) and smoldering (17%) ATL. In addition, deletions of the CDKN2A gene were found in 24% of acute ATL patients; thus, abnormalities of the CDKN2A gene totaled 71% in acute ATL patients. In contrast, no CDKN2A gene methylation was found in asymptomatic carriers or uninfected individuals. Methylation of the p15 gene was not found in any samples from 36 ATL patients. Direct sequencing of the CDKN2A gene after sodium bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA revealed that the methylation of CpG sites had occurred in 24 of 32 ATL cases (75%) including chronic and smoldering ATL, even when MSPCR and the Southern blot had failed to detect CDKN2A gene methylation. Among fresh ATL samples with methylation, methylation was detected in the promoter region and exon in 17 of 24 cases, and methylation in the exon without promoter region was detected in 7 of 24 cases. In one case, the pattern of methylation proved to be different between peripheral blood cells and lymph node cells, suggesting the presence of multiple subclones with regard to methylation patterns, despite the same HTLV-I integration site. Quantitative PCR showed a marked decrease in CDKN2A mRNA expression in the cells with a methylated CDKN2A gene, especially if the promoter region was methylated.

        "Doc_abstract":"Physical interaction between CDKN2A/p16 and CDK4 proteins regulates the cell cycle progression through the G1 phase and dysfunction of these proteins by gene mutation is implicated in genetic predisposition to melanoma. We analysed 15 Italian melanoma families for germ line mutations in the coding region of the CDKN2A gene and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene. One novel disease-associated mutation (P48T), 3 known pathological mutations (R24P, G101W and N71S) and 2 common polymorphisms (A148T and Nt500 G>C) were identified in the CDKN2A gene. In a family harbouring the R24P mutation, an intronic variant (IVS1, +37 G>C) of uncertain significance was detected in a non-carrier melanoma case. The overall incidence of CDKN2A mutations was 33.3%, but this percentage was higher in families with 3 or more melanoma cases (50%) than in those with only 2 affected relatives (25%). Noteworthy, functional analysis established that the novel mutated protein, while being impaired in cell growth and inhibition assays, retains some in vitro binding to CDK4/6. No variant in the p16-binding region of CDK4 was identified in our families. Our results, obtained in a heterogeneous group of families, support the view that inactivating mutations of CDKN2A contribute to melanoma susceptibility more than activating mutations of CDK4 and that other genetic factors must be responsible for melanoma clustering in a high proportion of families. In addition, they indicate the need for a combination of functional assays to determine the pathogenetic nature of new CDKN2A mutations.",

Disruption of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus occurs in most cases of T-ALL and is thought to contribute to leukemic transformation. To determine whether loss of function of CDKN2A cooperates with HMGA1 in T-ALL, we crossed HMGA1a transgenics onto a Cdkn2a null background. We discovered that T-ALL is markedly accelerated in HMGA1a transgenic Cdkn2a null mice. In addition, these mice recapitulate salient clinical and pathologic features of human T-ALL.

Therefore, detection of CDKN2A deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was evaluated as an ancillary test in the cytologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma.;Dual-color FISH for CDKN2A and chromosome 9 centromere was performed on cytolyt-fixed Thinprep slides from 6 cytologically suspicious and 7 cytologically positive effusions (all with histologically confirmed mesothelioma) and in 19 cytologically benign effusions (14 pleural effusions, 3 pericardial effusions, and 2 abdominal fluid specimens).

Based on recent reports, BRAF mutations provide an alternative route for activation of the RAS signalling pathway. The CDKN2A (p16) tumour suppressor gene is also altered in several tumour types. We therefore wanted to assess the pattern and prognostic impact of BRAF mutations and p16 alterations in endometrial carcinomas. Only 1 of 48 tumours (2%) was found to have a BRAF mutation in exon 15, whereas 8 of 45 tumours (18%) had a K-ras mutation. Homozygous deletion, amplification, promoter region methylation or mutation of the p16 gene was seen in 6 cases (13%), and 18 cases (38%) carried polymorphisms in the p16 gene. All tumours with presence of p16 methylation, non-sense mutation, deletion or amplification exhibited loss of p16 expression as evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Presence of a p16 hit was significantly correlated with high FIGO stage (p = 0.04), high histologic grade (p = 0.02), estrogen receptor negativity (p = 0.05), pathologic expression of p53 (p = 0.02), pathologic expression of p16 (p = 0.05) and poor survival (p = 0.02). There was also a significant correlation between loss of p16 expression and K-ras mutations, pathologic p53 expression and serous papillary/clear cell histologic types (p = 0.05/p = 0.001/p = 0.002). In conclusion, BRAF mutation is an infrequent finding in endometrial carcinomas. Loss of p16 expression is seen in all cases with alterations of the p16 gene. The presence of a p16 hit might be important in a subset of endometrial carcinomas with aggressive clinical behaviour. However, the mechanism of p16 inactivation remains unclear for the majority of cases exhibiting loss of expression, but the interactions with K-ras and p53 should be further studied.",

Exhaustive genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic and pathological characterization was performed on the excised primary tumor and a derived cell line. Whole-exome analysis of genomic DNA from both the tumor and blood indicated no somatic, non-synonymous coding mutations within the tumor, but a heterozygous, unique germline, loss of function mutation in CDKN2A (p16(INK4A), D74A). SNP-array CGH on DNA samples revealed the tumor to be euploid, with no detectable gene copy number variants. Multiple chromosomal translocations were identified by RNA-Seq, and fusion genes included RPLP1-C19MC, potentially deregulating the C19MC cluster, an imprinted locus containing microRNA genes reactivated by gene fusion in embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes. Since the presumed cell of origin of MNTI is from the neural crest, we also compared gene expression with a dataset from human neural crest cells and identified 185 genes with significantly different expression. Consistent with the melanotic phenotype of the tumor, elevated expression of tyrosinase was observed. Other highly expressed genes encoded muscle proteins and modulators of the extracellular matrix. A derived MNTI cell line was sensitive to inhibitors of lysine demethylase, but not to compounds targeting other epigenetic regulators.;In the absence of somatic copy number variations or mutations, the fully transformed phenotype of the MNTI may have arisen in infancy because of the combined effects of a germline CDKN2A mutation, tumor promoting somatic fusion genes and epigenetic deregulation.

Where melanoma CDKN2A mutations have been characterized, C --> T and CC --> TT transitions were found, indicating a direct role for ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced pyrimidine dimers in the formation of some tumors. The South American opossum, Monodelphis domestica, has been shown by our group and others to be susceptible to the induction of melanoma on chronic exposure to UVR alone. The CDKN2A gene and its exon 1beta alternate transcript p19ARF were cloned and sequenced from M. domestica to investigate the role of these genes in the development of UVR-induced melanoma and non-melanoma tumors. Both genes were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using cDNA from an opossum corneal-tumor cell-line library and degenerate primers based on human, mouse, and rat CDKN2A gene sequences. To verify these as normal sequences, both genes were then RT-PCR amplified from cultured normal opossum melanocyte mRNA. When comparing the tumor and melanocyte sequences, we found a UVR signature point mutation, a C --> T transition, within exon 2 in the corneal tumor cell line. The same mutation at this site in other tumors has been shown to alter the CDKN2A protein's ability to bind CDK4 kinase, which may lead to uncontrolled cell cycling. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of opossum CDKN2A showed identities relative to human, mouse, and rat between 57% and 63%, and when conserved amino acid substitutions are considered (similarity), the range is 63% to 67%.

Identification of the downstream genes of PcG proteins is essential for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal.

We found that the PcG protein, Ring1B, which regulates expression of various genes through monoubiquitination of histone H2AK119, is essential for expansion of hepatic stem/progenitor cells. In mouse embryos with a conditional knockout of Ring1B, we found that the lack of Ring1B inhibited proliferation and differentiation of hepatic stem/progenitor cells and thereby inhibited hepatic organogenesis. These events were characterized by derepression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, known negative regulators of cell proliferation. We conducted clonal culture experiments with hepatic stem/progenitor cells to investigate the individual genetic functions of Ring1B, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn2a. The data showed that the cell-cycle inhibition caused by Ring1B depletion was reversed when Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a were suppressed simultaneously, but not when they were suppressed individually.;Our results show that expansion of hepatic stem/progenitor cells requires Ring1B-mediated epigenetic silencing of Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, demonstrating that Ring1B simultaneously regulates multiple CDKIs in tissue stem/progenitor cells.",

Type 1 tumors were associated with MET alterations, whereas type 2 tumors were characterized by CDKN2A silencing, SETD2 mutations, TFE3 fusions, and increased expression of the NRF2-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. A CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was observed in a distinct subgroup of type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinomas that was characterized by poor survival and mutation of the gene encoding fumarate hydratase (FH).;Type 1 and type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinomas were shown to be clinically and biologically distinct. Alterations in the MET pathway were associated with type 1, and activation of the NRF2-ARE pathway was associated with type 2; CDKN2A loss and CIMP in type 2 conveyed a poor prognosis. Furthermore, type 2 papillary renal-cell carcinoma consisted of at least three subtypes based on molecular and phenotypic features. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",

Monodelphis CDKN2A and alternated reading frame (ARF) cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, and the expression patterns of these genes were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in normal tissues, 39 primary melanocytic skin lesions, and two tumor-derived cell lines, one nonmetastatic and one metastatic. Primary melanocytic lesions, including hyperplasias, benign melanomas, melanomas metastatic to lymph nodes, and melanomas metastatic to nodes and additional visceral organs, were categorized accordingly as types I-IV. Levels of CDKN2A transcripts were most abundant in type III tumor samples and the metastatic cell line but absent in the nonmetastatic cell line. ARF transcripts were expressed in all tumors and cell lines. A UV-signature mutation was detected with the wild-type allele at the CDKN2A locus in type II and III primary tumor samples and in the nonmetastatic cell line. Interestingly, in the metastatic cell line, only the mutant allele was present and expressed.

The etiology, classification, genetic changes, and malignant progression of these lesions are reviewed. Tobacco remains the principal etiological factor with gastroesophageal reflux disease recently considered as a possible factor. In contrast, there is little evidence that microbiological agents, especially human papillomavirus infection, are frequently involved in laryngeal carcinogenesis and probably <10% of SILs are driven by biologically active human papillomavirus infection. Light microscopy, despite a degree of subjectivity, remains the mainstay of accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and guidance for a patient's treatment. The currently used classifications, the dysplasia system, squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, and the Ljubljana classification, reflect different standpoints on this important topic. The modified Ljubljana classification, with good interobserver agreement, could be considered as a proposal for a unified classification of laryngeal SILs. This review also briefly discusses recently discovered genetic changes, such as CDKN2A and CTNNB1 genes, and chromosome instability of chromosomes 1 and 7; however, none of these can at present improve histologic diagnosis. Malignant progression of precursor lesions varies from 2% to 74%, according to different studies. Cold-steel microinstruments, CO2 laser, and radiotherapy are used to treat the different grades of precursor lesions. There is as yet no worldwide agreement on the treatment of high-grade lesions and carcinoma in situ. ",

One glioblastoma with hemizygous deletion of CDKN2A showed a missense mutation in exon 2 (codon 83) that would result in the substitution of tyrosine for histidine in the protein. None of the tumours retaining alleles of CDKN2B showed mutations of this gene.

In contrast, 7/13 glioblastomas with hemizygous deletions of CDKN2A and 8/11 glioblastomas with hemizygous deletions of CDKN2B showed no or weak expression. Anaplastic astrocytomas and astrocytomas showed a considerable variation in the expression of both genes, regardless of whether they retained one or two copies of the genes. The methylation status of the 5' CpG island of the CDKN2A gene was studied in all 15 tumours retaining only one allele of CDKN2A as well as in the six tumours showing no significant expression of transcript despite their retaining both CDKN2A alleles. Three tumours (one of each malignancy grade studied) were found to have partially methylated the 5' CpG island of CDKN2A. It appears that in human astrocytic gliomas point mutations of the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes are uncommon and hypermethylation of the 5' CpG region of CDKN2A does not appear to be a major mechanism for inhibiting transcription of this gene.",

We set out to investigate the effect of reintroducing CDKN2A into MM96L, a melanoma cell line that does not express p16, by electroporation of wt CDKN2A cDNA. Our results show that transfection of the CDKN2A cDNA has a dramatic effect on cell morphology, inducing a more dendritic phenotype resembling that of adult melanocytes. This effect on cell morphology was not cell line specific because it was reproduced in another melanoma line (SK-MEL-13), which has a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. It was abolished by mutations that abrogate p16 function, as shown by transfection of a Pro81Leu p16 variant. Reintroduction of levels of p16 protein similar to those of cultured neonatal foreskin melanocytes decreased the growth rate of the transfected clones. Surprisingly, we did not see any effect on anchorage-independent growth or on the following melanoma markers tested by western blotting: p21/WAF1, tyrosinase-related antigen 1, HMB45, and intermediate filament antigen.

A quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the functional importance of the CDKN2A variants.;Of 33 patients with multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 27 percent) had germ-line CDKN2A mutations.

The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of homozygous deletion of CDKN2A alone or in combination with MTAP in a large series of pleural mesothelioma.;We used a fluorescent in situ hybridization assay for CDKN2A and MTAP on interphase nuclei in imprints of frozen tissue from 95 cases of pleural mesothelioma. Histologically, the cases were classified as epithelial (71), biphasic (19) and sarcomatous (5). In each experiment, a 9p21 locus specific probe and a chromosome 9 centromeric probe were used and fluorescent in situ hybridization signals for both probes were simultaneously recorded in at least 100 nuclei. Cases were considered homozygously deleted if both 9p21 signals were lost in at least 20% of nuclei.;Overall, 70 cases (74%) had homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. MTAP was codeleted in 64 of these cases (91%). No case with MTAP deletion without CDKN2A deletion was identified. Homozygous loss of CDKN2A was seen in 49 of 71 epithelial (70%), 16 of 19 biphasic (89%), and 5 of 5 sarcomatous (100%) mesotheliomas.;Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A is seen in the majority of pleural mesotheliomas, and MTAP is codeleted in most of these cases. Previous cell line studies have shown that loss of MTAP renders cells dependent on de novo synthesis of purine derivatives. Thus, the particularly high prevalence of MTAP codeletion in mesothelioma makes it an ideal candidate for trials of targeted therapy using inhibitors of de novo AMP synthesis (e.g., L-alanosine).",

        "Doc_abstract":"Germline mutations within the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene and one of its targets, the cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene, have been identified in a proportion of melanoma kindreds. In the case of CDK4, only one specific mutation, resulting in the substitution of a cysteine for an arginine at codon 24 (R24C), has been found to be associated with melanoma. We have previously reported the identification of germline CDKN2A mutations in 7/18 Australian melanoma kindreds and the absence of the R24C CDK4 mutation in 21 families lacking evidence of a CDKN2A mutation. The current study represents an expansion of these efforts and includes a total of 48 melanoma families from Australia. All of these families have now been screened for mutations within CDKN2A and CDK4, as well as for mutations within the CDKN2A homolog and 9p21 neighbor, the CDKN2B gene, and the alternative exon 1 (E1beta) of CDKN2A. Families lacking CDKN2A mutations, but positive for a polymorphism(s) within this gene, were further evaluated to determine if their disease was associated with transcriptional silencing of one CDKN2A allele. Overall, CDKN2A mutations were detected in 3/30 (10%) of the new kindreds. Two of these mutations have been observed previously: a 24 bp duplication at the 5' end of the gene and a G to C transversion in exon 2 resulting in an M531 substitution. A novel G to A transition in exon 2, resulting in a D108N substitution was also detected. Combined with our previous findings, we have now detected germline CDKN2A mutations in 10/48 (21%) of our melanoma kindreds. In none of the 'CDKN2A-negative' families was melanoma found to segregate with either an untranscribed CDKN2A allele, an R24C CDK4 mutation, a CDKN2B mutation, or an E1beta mutation. The last three observations suggest that these other cell cycle control genes (or alternative gene products) are either not involved at all, or to any great extent, in melanoma predisposition.",

No recurrent somatic SNVs were observed except for MLL, which was found to be mutated (p.V297I and p.F407C) in 2 samples. We identified somatic SNVs in 14 other cancer census genes including: ATM, CREBBP, PRDM1, CBFB, FBXW7, IKZF1, KDR, KRAS, NACA, NF2, NUP98, SS18, TP53, and ZNF521. SNP array data identified a CDKN2A homozygous deletion in 3 samples and SNV analysis showed a non-sense mutation of the CDKN2A gene with unknown somatic status. To estimate the recurrent rate of CDKN2A abnormalities, we performed FISH screening of additional samples and confirmed the frequent loss (62.5%) of CDKN2A expression. Since cisplatin based therapy is the common treatment option for CDC, we investigated the expression of solute carrier (SLC) family transporters and found 45% alteration. In addition, SLC7A11 (cystine transporter, xCT), a cisplatin resistance associated gene, was found to be overexpressed in 4 out of 5 (80%) cases of CDC tumors tested, as compared to matched non-tumor tissue. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive genomic analysis of CDC and identifies potential pathways suitable for targeted therapies. ",

Both CDKN2A (at 9p21) and Rb1 gene (at 13q14.2) are regarded as tumor suppressors involved in the development of ESCC. Therefore, the present study aimed to verify the RBN's ability to induce ESCC and assess the involvement of CDKN2A and Rb1 genes.;A panel of dinucelotide polymorphic markers were chosen for loss of heterozygosity studies in 93 samples of which 34 were collected from patients with only RBN-chewing habit. Promoter hypermethylation was also investigated.;Loss in microsatellite markers D9S1748 and D9S1749, located close to exon 1β of CDKN2A/ARF gene at 9p21, was noted in 40% ESCC samples with the habit of RBN-chewing alone. Involvement of a novel site in the 9p23 region was also observed. Promoter hypermethylation of CDKN2A gene in the samples with the habit of only RBN-chewing alone was significantly higher (p=0.01) than Rb1 gene, also from the samples having the habit of use both RBN and tobacco (p=0.047).;The data indicate that the disruption of 9p21 where CDKN2A gene resides, is the most frequent critical genetic event in RBN-associated carcinogenesis.

Data analysis using stringent criteria showed specific upregulation of 70 genes and downregulation of 86 genes in cell lines with homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene. A comparison with previous expression data showed overlapping of upregulation and downregulation of seven and 23 genes, respectively, in melanoma cell lines with homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus or mutations in the B-RAF and N-RAS genes. Microarray data for eight selected genes were validated with an extended number of cell lines using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Structural and functional evidence has suggested that homozygous deletion involving CDKN2A (the genetic locus encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(NK4a)) is a mechanism of inactivation of this gene and that it can be a growth suppressor in human gliomas. However, the presence of other potential suppressor genes in the 9p21 region and the relatively large sizes of the deletions has made it difficult to be certain that the CDKN2A gene is their actual target. Here, we tested this hypothesis by determining the growth suppressive effects, cell cycle inhibitions, and the activities of seven naturally occurring glioma-derived CDKN2A alleles carrying point mutations and found that two of them were functionally compromised. To resolve discrepancies among the different existing functional assays, we developed an assay for p16(INK4a) function that allowed us to demonstrate that the expression of wild-type CDKN2A, but not alleles with inactivating mutations, prevents pRB phosphorylation in vivo in human glioma cells.

We investigated whether loss of the CDKN2A gene is associated with overall survival across pathologically and genetically defined glioma subtypes. After adjustment for IDH mutation, sex, and age, CDKN2A deletion was strongly associated with poorer overall survival in astrocytomas but not in oligodendrogliomas or oligoastrocytomas. Molecular classification of astrocytomas by IDH mutation, TP53 mutation, and /or ATRX loss of expression revealed that CDKN2A loss in IDH/TP53 mutated tumors was strongly associated with worse overall survival. CDKN2A loss in IDH mutated tumors with ATRX loss was only weakly associated with worse overall survival. These findings suggest that CDKN2A testing may provide further clinical aid in lower-grade glioma substratification beyond IDH mutation and 1p19q codeletion status, particularly in IDH/TP53 mutated astrocytomas.

When equal to or more than two data types could be evaluated with this method, 22 of 25 FM-associated variants and 8 of 15 variants of uncertain significance were classified as likely pathogenic with >95% probability.

We looked for homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B (p15INK4B), and CDKN2C (p18) in 12 primary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) specimens and in five cell lines established from this cancer type. By means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), we analyzed the presence of biallelic gene deletion or point mutation causing gene function loss. All the examined tumor cell lines (100%) and three of 12 (25%) primary tumors showed homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. Furthermore, no aberrant bands in primary tumors were detected via SSCP, suggesting the absence of mutations in the coding region. In all cases the deleted area at 9p21 also involved the CDKN2B gene. Conversely, no homozygous deletion or point mutations were detected when CDKN2C was analyzed. Our results strongly indicate that the p16INK4A (and/or p15INK4B) protein plays a key role in the development and/or progression of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and suggest that this CDK-inhibitor protein might control proliferation and/or differentiation of human muscle cells.

CN results showed that OVC lacked any of the classical OSCC patterns such as gain of 3q and loss of 3p and demonstrated considerably fewer genomic rearrangements compared to the OSCC cohort. OVC and OSCC samples could be clearly differentiated. Exome sequencing showed that OVC samples lacked mutations in genes commonly associated with OSCC (TP53, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, CDKN2A and FAT1). RNA sequencing identified genes that were differentially expressed between the groups. In silico functional analysis showed that the mutated and differentially expressed genes in OVC samples were involved in cell adhesion and keratinocyte proliferation, while those in the OSCC cohort were enriched for cell death and apoptosis pathways. This is the largest and most detailed genomic and transcriptomic analysis yet performed on this tumour type, which, as an example of non-metastatic cancer, may shed light on the nature of metastases.

Two fast-growing melanomas were detected among 2 MITF p.E318K carriers during dermatologic digital follow-up.;In addition to melanoma risk, MITF p.E318K is associated with a high nevi count and could play a role in fast-growing melanomas. Testing for MITF p.E318K should not exclude patients with known mutations in p16INK4A. Strict dermatologic surveillance, periodic self-examination, and renal cell carcinoma surveillance should be encouraged in this context.",

Inherited susceptibility to this type of skin cancer could therefore result from constitutively impaired capacity to repair ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA lesions. While a proportion of familial melanoma kindreds exhibit germline mutations in the cell cycle regulatory gene CDKN2A (p16INK4a) or its protein target, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), the biochemical basis of most familial melanoma is unknown. We have examined lymphoblastoid cell lines from melanoma-affected and unaffected individuals from large hereditary melanoma kindreds which are not attributable to CDKN2A or CDK4 gene mutation. These lines were tested for sensitivity of clonogenic growth to UV radiation and for their ability to repair transfected UV-damaged plasmid templates (host cell reactivation). Two of seven affected-unaffected pairs differed in colony survival after exposure to UVB radiation; however, no significant differences were observed in the host-cell reactivation assays. These results indicate that melanoma susceptibility genes other than CDKN2A and CDK4 do not impair net capacity to repair UV-induced DNA damage.",

We analyzed families with two or more cases of melanoma for germline mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 to elucidate the contribution of these gene defects to familial malignant melanoma and to the occurrence of other cancer types.;: The entire CDKN2A coding region and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene of an affected member of each of 52 families from southern Sweden with at least two cases of melanoma in first- or second-degree relatives were screened for mutations by use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided.;: CDKN2A mutations were found in 10 (19%) of the 52 families. Nine families carried an identical alteration consisting of the insertion of arginine at position 113 of p16(INK4a), and one carried a missense mutation, in which the valine at position 115 was replaced with a glycine. The 113insArg mutant p16(INK4a) was unable to bind cdk4 and cdk6 in an in vitro binding assay. Six of the 113insArg families had at least one member with multiple primary melanomas; the 113insArg families also had a high frequency of other malignancies-in particular, breast cancer (a total of eight cases compared with the expected 2.1; P =.0014) and pancreatic cancer (a total of six cases compared with the expected 0.16; P<.0001). Families with breast cancer also had a propensity for multiple melanomas in females, suggesting that a sex-dependent factor may modify the phenotypic expression of CDKN2A alterations.;: Our findings confirm that the majority of CDKN2A-associated melanoma families in Sweden are due to a single founder mutation. They also show that families with the CDKN2A 113insArg mutation have an increased risk not only of multiple melanomas and pancreatic carcinoma but also of breast cancer.",

Alternative splicing of the CDKN2A gene results in the expression of p14(ARF). Interestingly, not only p16 and p15, but also the structurally unrelated p14(ARF) appear to function as negative cell cycle regulators. Concerted inactivation of p16, p15 and p14(ARF) could be demonstrated in seven of nine glioblastoma cell lines. Strong suppression of tumorigenicity after transfection with p16 and p15 alone or in combination was seen in cell lines containing neither endogenous p16 nor p15 but functional pRB. Significantly weaker growth suppression was observed in tumors either retaining expression of both p16 and p15 or p15 only. p14(ARF) proved to be a potent tumor suppressor in the presence of wild-type p53, while mutant p53 substantially reduced growth inhibition by p14(ARF). No differences between p16 and p15 effects could be observed, suggesting a largely overlapping function of p16 and p15. To facilitate further research into p16/p15 effects, three cell lines with conditional, tetracycline-controlled p16 expression were established. Reversible growth suppression mediated by p16 was observed in these models. Combined inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, i.e., loss of both p16 and p15 as well as p14(ARF), results in disruption of two major growth control pathways involving pRB and p53 in malignant gliomas. Therefore, homozygous co-deletions of CDKN2A and CDKN2B rather than mutations targeting individual transcripts are frequently selected for in these tumors.",

High concentration of growth factors, increased melanin biosynthesis, and the rapid cell cycle progression may lead to the genetic material damage and the initiation of melanocyte malignant transformation in cell culture conditions. Mutations of genes of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and CDKN2A gene are often found in the early stages of melanoma development. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is considered to be an oncogenic factor, but there is no evidence that it is responsible for melanomagenesis initiation.

Previous studies have shown the existence of allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability) in BCC on several human chromosomes. Chromosome region 9p21-p22 harbors the CDKN2a/p16INK4a, p19ARF, and p15INK4b tumor suppressor genes. To determine the contribution of these genes to the development of basal cell carcinomas we looked for evidence of allelic imbalance in 67 sporadic basal cell carcinoma specimens from Greek patients and screened 28 of them presenting loss of heterozygosity at 9p21-p22 for germline mutations in p16INK4a and p19ARF genes. Chromosome regions 17q21 and 17p13 were also screened for allelic imbalance in all the 67 basal cell carcinoma specimens. Overall, 69% (46 of 67) of the specimens displayed loss of heterozygosity in at least one microsatellite marker, whereas only six of the 67 (9%) exhibited microsatellite instability. For the 9p21-p22 locus the overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity reached 55% (37 of 67) and is the highest reported. The overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity for the 17q21 locus is 34% (22 of 64) and for the 17p13 locus is 11% (seven of 65). Two of the 28 loss of heterozygosity positive cases were heterozygous for a previously described polymorphism, Ala148Thr, in exon 2 of the CDKN2a gene. This is the first demonstration of polymorphism in the CDKN2a gene in human basal cell carcinomas. No sequence variation in exon 1beta of the p19ARF gene was found. Our results provide evidence of a significantly high occurrence of loss of heterozygosity for the 9p21-p22 locus; however, lack of p16INK4a/p19ARF mutation suggests that these genes seem not to be implicated by mutational inactivation in the development of basal cell carcinoma.

We primarily used a unique Utah genealogical resource to identify independent melanoma prone families whom we tested for mutations in CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and alternate reading frame. We sampled 60 families which met the inclusion criteria of two or more affected first-degree relatives.

Among 120 glioblastomas, 40% had no wild-type CDKN2A gene, 12% amplified the CDK4 gene, and 14% had no wild-type RBI gene. With two exceptions, each tumour had only one of these abnormalities. Thus the majority of the glioblastomas (64%) had distinct genetic aberrations which would obviously disrupt the control of transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. A further 30% had loss of one allele of the CDKN2A and/or RBI genes. Only seven (6%) glioblastomas had no abnormalities of these genes. Anaplastic astrocytomas showed similar changes to the glioblastomas but at lower frequencies-34% showing no aberrations of the genes analysed. The astrocytomas showed solely loss of one allele of the RBI gene in 28% of tumours, with retention of one wild-type copy. In the glioblastomas with no alterations of CDKN2A, CDK4 or RB1, several other genes (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK6, E2F, CDK7, MYC and MYCN) whose products take part in cell cycle regulation were examined. No abnormalities were detected. Thus some aberration of the CDKN2A, CDK4 and RB1 genes appears to be almost obligatory in glioblastomas.",

Although efficient expansion of hepatoblasts in vitro has been difficult without genetic modification, we have previously demonstrated that the interaction with mesenchymal cells is important for expansion of hepatoblasts in vitro. In this study, we show cell signaling pathways regulating the long-term proliferative ability of hepatoblasts. Individual primary hepatoblasts derived from mouse fetal livers formed large colonies when cocultured with mesenchymal feeder cells; however, secondary colony formation was unsuccessful, indicating that in vitro culture could induce short-term, but not long-term, proliferation. When the MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, was added to these cultures, hepatoblasts formed large colonies containing many Ki-67-positive cells. Expression of p16/19(cdkn2a), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, was induced after 3-6 days culture of hepatoblasts, whereas PD0325901 significantly suppressed this expression. Consistent with these observations, fetal hepatoblasts derived from p16/19(cdkn2a) knockout mice showed long-term proliferation without PD0325901, suggesting that MEK activity induced cell cycle arrest through accumulation of p16/19(cdkn2a). In transplantation assays, we could demonstrate that in vitro expanded hepatoblasts could proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytic and cholangiocytic cells in injured livers. It should also be noted that ERK in primary hepatoblasts was not highly activated during fetal liver development. Collectively, all these findings suggest that the MEK/ERK-independent pathway in the fetal liver is involved in hepatoblast proliferation to avoid accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

However, coding mutations of CDKN2A have not been detected in a significant proportion of those affected. The identification of a disease-associated intronic mutation of CDKN2A in UK families, which has proved to be the most common CDKN2A mutation as yet identified in this population, has highlighted the possibility that additional causal mutations may lie within the intronic sequence of the gene. In this article, we describe the comprehensive screening of 109 English and 26 Australian melanoma pedigrees for intronic mutations of CDKN2A. In total, 24 sequence variants were identified across the two introns of the gene. We show evidence that two of the CDKN2A intronic variants (IVS1 + 1104 C > A and IVS1 - 1104 C > G) predispose to melanoma. IVS1 + 1104 was shown to result in the aberrant splicing of both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) mRNA. Overall, however, the proportion of English melanoma families with these variants is small.",

The product of the alpha transcript, p16(INK4a), is a recognized tumour suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by the cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6. In contrast, the product of the human CDKN2A beta transcript, p14(ARF), activates a p53 response manifest in elevated levels of MDM2 and p21(CIP1) and cell cycle arrest in both G1 and G2/M. As a consequence, p14(ARF)-induced cell cycle arrest is p53 dependent and can be abrogated by the co-expression of human papilloma virus E6 protein. p14(ARF) acts by binding directly to MDM2, resulting in the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2. Conversely, p53 negatively regulates p14(ARF) expression and there is an inverse correlation between p14(ARF) expression and p53 function in human tumour cell lines. However, p14(ARF) expression is not involved in the response to DNA damage. These results place p14(ARF) in an independent pathway upstream of p53 and imply that CDKN2A encodes two proteins that are involved in tumour suppression.",

Thirty-nine archival, paraffin-embedded, sporadic, primary cutaneous malignant melanomas (20 >3-mm-thick and 19 <0.75-mm-thick cases) were examined for mutations of the CDKN2A gene using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing.

The finding of loss of heterozygosity for the 9p21 microsatellite D9S942 in thick but not thin primary melanoma suggests that deletion or inactivation of CDKN2A or other tumor suppressor gene(s) at this locus is involved in the progression rather than initiation of sporadic malignant melanoma.",

In many types of cancer, alterations of Cdkn2a abrogate the functions of both suppressors, implying that both are integral to the genesis of certain cancer types. While this has been observed in mouse lung adenocarcinogenesis, recent observations also suggested that naturally occurring variation at the Cdkn2a locus is probably operative in the development of these tumors. Firstly, two common haplotypes of mouse Cdkn2a have been identified, each of which encodes cosegregating variants of p16INK4a and p19ARF. The p16INK4a variants differ at amino acids 18 (histidine or proline) and 51 (valine or isoleucine), whereas the p19ARF variants differ only at amino acid 72 (histidine or arginine). Secondly, genetic resistance to lung tumor formation appears to segregate with one particular haplotype, which also is deleted preferentially in lung adenocarcinomas of Cdkn2a heterozygous mice. Here we attempt to explain these observations and to characterize further the roles of p16INK4 and p19ARF in mouse lung tumorigenesis by examining the function and expression of each of the variants of Cdkn2a. Functional analysis showed that the proline 18/isoleucine 51 p16INK4a variant was diminished in cdk6 binding, cdk6 inhibition and NIH/3T3 fibroblast growth suppression compared with the histidine 18/valine 51 variant, whereas both of the p19ARF variants suppressed growth with similar potencies. Also, the different alleles for p16INK4a and p19ARF were transcribed equally in the normal lungs of Cdkn2a heterozygotes, as determined by comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis. These results indicate that strain-specific variation in p16INK4a function is exploited in mouse lung tumorigenesis and strongly implicate a role for p16INK4a in lung cancer predisposition and development.",

A chromosome 9p21 locus has been linked to this disease in 50-80% of affected families.

Although germline CDKN2A coding mutations cosegregate with melanoma in 25-60% of families predisposed to the disease, there remains a number of mutation-negative families that demonstrate linkage of inherited melanoma to 9p21 markers. We show here that a subset of these kindreds possess a G-->T transversion at base -34 of CDKN2A, designated G-34T. This mutation gives rise to a novel AUG translation initiation codon that decreases translation from the wild-type AUG. The G-34T mutation is not seen in controls, segregates with melanoma in families and, on the basis of haplotyping studies, probably arose from a common founder in the United Kingdom.

Our findings suggest that stringent inclusion criteria led to a substantially increased rate of CDKN2A mutation detection. This consideration should be taken into account when referring patients for genetic screening in a setting of limited budget, such as in developing countries.",

In the present study, we found that SCIN is highly expressed in human prostate cancer specimens. However, the functions of SCIN in human prostate carcinoma cells are largely unknown. To address the function of SCIN in prostate carcinoma cells, we used lentivirus-mediated RNAi to knock down SCIN expression in PC3 cells, a prostate carcinoma cell line. We found that in vitro silencing of SCIN could inhibit the proliferation and colony formation ability of PC3 cells. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis showed that reduced SCIN expression lead to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through the regulation of cell cycle-related genes, such as p21Waf1/Cip1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A, p16Ink4A) and cyclin A2. These results suggest that SCIN plays an important role in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and lentivirus-mediated inhibition of SCIN expression may be a potential therapeutic method for the treatment of prostate cancer.",

Expression of genes at 11q13.3 was analyzed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Integrated analysis was conducted to identify genes or miRNAs with copy number-expression correlations.;Array CGH identified 11 amplifications and eight homozygous deletions in ESCC. Integrated analysis of array CGH data with matched gene expression microarray data showed that 90 overexpressed genes and 24 underexpressed genes were consistent with DNA copy number changes, including 12 copy number-driving miRNAs. In esophageal dysplasia, six gains, four losses, 12 amplifications, and four homozygous deletions were detected. Amplifications of 7p11.2 and 11q13.2-11q13.3 (CCND1) and homozygous deletion at 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) were consistent genomic changes in both dysplasia and carcinoma. ANO1 at 11q13.3 was overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in tumors, and higher mRNA expression was correlated with the copy number increase. In particular, ANO1 expression was elevated in moderate dysplasia compared with normal esophageal epithelium. IHC revealed that ANO1 overexpression was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Knockdown of ANO1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of KYSE30 and KYSE510 cells.;Copy number aberrations in both esophageal dysplasia and ESCC may be useful as potential biomarkers for early detection.

Our detailed examination of 40 cutaneous SCC revealed loss of heterozygosity of 9p21 markers in 32.5% of cases. Mutational analysis confirmed five point mutations in four of 40 SCCs. These mutations changed the amino acid sequence of p16(INK4a) in four tumors and p14(ARF) in three tumors.

Overall, the frequency of 9p21 alterations was 76% and for both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), promoter methylation is the commonest mechanism of gene inactivation.

Inactivation of p16 has previously been associated with the prognostically unfavourable primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCLBCL, LT). In this work, we analysed 22 tumors [nine primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphomas (PCFCL), seven primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (PCMZL) and six PCLBCL, LT] not only for alterations of the p16 gene but also for p14, p53 and Rb by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. In most PCLBCL, LT (4/6) alterations of CDKN2A (two biallelic deletions, one monoallelic deletion and one trisomy 9) and in addition the highest frequency of deletions of p53 (3/6) and Rb (3/6) were detected. p16 was not expressed but very high levels of phosphorylated Rb, indicating a functional effect of genomic CDKN2A alterations on the protein level in PCLBCL, LT. Regarding the p14/p53 axis, PCLBCL, LT showed a variable expression. Neither PCFCL nor PCMZL showed alterations of CDKN2A and also deletions of p53 or Rb were extremely rare in these subtypes. Exclusively in PCMZL, p53 protein was consistently lacking. In conclusion, only PCLBCL, LT is characterized by a high frequency of aberrations of the CDKN2A network components in both important tumor suppressor pathways regulated by the CDKN2A gene.

A deletion of CDKN2A would therefore disturb both pathways. To explore the p53 pathway genes as a functional unit in diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (DLCL), we wanted to see whether there exists mutually exclusiveness of aberrations of CDKN2A, MDM2 and p53, since this has not been analysed previously. We investigated 37 DLCL for aberrations of p15, p16, p19ARF, MDM2, and p53 at the epigenetic, genetic and/or protein levels. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was detected in seven (19%) of 37 tumours, and another three cases were hypermethylated at the 5' CpG island of p16. No point mutations were found in CDKN2B or CDKN2A. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for p16 confirmed these results, as all tumours with alterations of CDKN2A were p16 immunonegative. We found p53 mutations in eight (22%) cases and MDM2 overexpression in 16 (43%) tumours. Twenty-three (62%) tumours had alterations of one or more p53 pathway components (p53, p19ARF and MDM2). Furthermore, 7/9 (78%) p16-immunonegative tumours showed co-aberration of p53 and/or MDM2. The lack of correlation between these aberrations suggests that DLCL acquire additional growth advantage by inactivating both of these critical regulatory pathways.",

Despite these results, there are significant perioperative risks associated with this aggressive procedure that necessitate consideration of prognostic markers during patient selection. The molecular pathogenesis of peritoneal mesothelioma remains relatively unknown, but extrapolation of findings from their pleural counterpart would suggest frequent alterations in CDKN2A, NF2, and BAP1. Homozygous deletions in CDKN2A portend a worse overall survival in peritoneal mesothelioma. However, the prevalence and prognostic significance of NF2 and BAP1 abnormalities has not been studied. Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using CDKN2A and NF2 locus-specific probes and BAP1 immunohistochemistry identified homozygous CDKN2A deletions (n=25, 29%), hemizygous NF2 loss (n=30, 35%), and/or loss of BAP1 protein expression (n=49, 57%) in 68 of 86 (79%) peritoneal mesotheliomas. Homozygous CDKN2A deletions or hemizygous NF2 loss correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P<0.02) and poor overall survival (P<0.03). Moreover, the significance of these findings was cumulative. Patients harboring both homozygous CDKN2A deletions and hemizygous NF2 loss had a 2-year progression-free survival rate of 9% with a median of 6 months (P<0.01) and overall survival rate of 18% with a median of 8 months (P<0.01). By multivariate analysis, combined homozygous CDKN2A deletions and hemizygous NF2 loss was a negative prognostic factor for both progression-free survival and overall survival, independent of patient age, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, and extent of invasion. In contrast, loss of BAP1 was not associated with clinical outcome. In summary, homozygous deletions in CDKN2A and hemizygous loss of NF2 as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization would confer a poor clinical outcome and may guide future treatment decisions for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma.

In nine patients, CDKN2A alterations that may contribute to melanoma predisposition were detected. In six individuals with a family history of melanoma, the 113insR founder mutation was present. One patient, who also had a family history of melanoma, had a 24-bp deletion that included codons 62-69. An in vitro binding assay established that the resulting mutant p16 protein was unable to bind cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Two patients without a family history of melanoma had CDKN2A alterations: (a) one had a mutation in the 5' noncoding sequence (-14C/T); and (b) the other had an insertion of an extra T in codon 28, which results in a stop signal in codon 43. The median age at diagnosis of the first melanoma was significantly lower, the number of primary melanomas was significantly higher, and the presence of a family history of melanoma was significantly more common in patients with CDKN2A mutations than in those without germ-line mutations. The proportion of CDKN2A mutation carriers was significantly higher among patients treated for three or more primary melanomas compared with those with two tumors only.

Although other mechanisms that decrease gene expression have been reported, such as promoter methylation, the prognostic value of these mechanisms is still unclear. We studied the deletion and methylation status of these genes in 171 patients and correlated the genomic results with their mRNA expression level and clinical outcome. CDKN2A, P14ARF, and CDKN2B deletions were significantly correlated with decreased mRNA expression (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, and P=0.0148, respectively). P14ARF was methylated in only two patients (1.3%), whereas CDKN2A and CDKN2B were methylated in 36.7 and 31.4% of patients, respectively. Methylation levels greater than 25% were associated with decreased expression of CDKN2A (P=0.0169).

A combination of TP53, PTEN, and CDKN2A had a sensitivity of 93.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 84%-98%] and specificity of 87.8% (95% CI, 75%-95%) for ESC versus EC3. A combination of NAPSA and ESR1 had a sensitivity of 97.9% (95% CI, 89%-99%) and specificity of 72.2% (95% CI, 46%-90%) for ESC versus clear cell carcinoma. Absence of WT1 alone had a sensitivity of 66.0% (95% CI, 51%-79%) and specificity of 98.0% (95% CI, 94%-99%) for ESC versus ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. Among all 52 ESCs, ERBB2 amplification was present in 23%, FBXW7 expression was absent in 10%, and CCNE1 was overexpressed in 59%, however, none were associated with prognosis.

Heterologous leiomyosarcoma is the rarest variant, in which the tumor contains liposarcomatous, osteosarcomatous, or rhabdomyosarcomatous components. We have investigated the largest series of uterine leiomyosarcoma with a rhabdomyosarcomatous component and we have disclosed a molecular finding, which coincides to the process of transdifferentiation from smooth muscle into striated muscle phenotype. The surgical specimens of 5 rare cases of uterine leiomyosarcoma with a rhabdomyosarcomatous component were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. In addition to hematoxylin/eosin stains, phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin staining, immunohistochemistry, and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction the CDKN2A promoter region were performed. Leiomyosarcomatous cells were found to be strongly immunoreactive for both desmin and α-smooth muscle actin. Rhabdomyosarcomatous cells were immunoreactive for sarcomeric actin, desmin, vimentin, CD10, and p16. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of a methylated allele and an unmethylated allele in the microdissected samples, coming from leiomyosarcomatous cells. On the contrary, 2 unmethylated alleles, molecular expression of a loss of heterozygosity, were detected in all the microdissected samples in the rhabdomyosarcomatous cells. The loss of heterozygosity methylation in the promoter region of the CDKN2A gene, occurred only in the rhabdomyosarcomatous cells with increases in both p16 and p14 expression. This event may result in an inhibition of cdk4/cdk6 activity, stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53, and coincides with the transdifferentiation from smooth muscle into striated muscle. ",

Individuals from eight melanoma-prone families, with index patients carrying the CDKN2A mutation, were offered skin examinations and genotyping (CDKN2A and MC1R). Ninety-three individuals above 18 years of age participated; 29 invasive melanomas in 16 patients were recorded, all in the 38 verified CDKN2A mutation carriers. Median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Several MC1R variants were observed. A significant correlation to CAN (P=0.01) and red hair colour (P=0.02) could be confirmed in melanoma patients. A positive mutation status (CDKN2A) was correlated to one or more CAN (P=0.007) but neither to blue eyes, red hair colour, heavy freckling nor high number of nevi. For mutation carriers, median total naevus count was 24 and interquartile range was 12-47 (mean 31); whereas for the whole cohort, median total naevus count was 12 and interquartile range was 5-25 (mean 22). No participant fulfilled the atypical mole syndrome phenotype criteria. Melanomas were diagnosed only in mutation carriers, and melanoma diagnosis was statistically correlated to the presence of one or more CAN and red hair colour, supporting the possible synergistic effect of a MC1R mutation on increased risk of melanoma in patients with a CDKN2A mutation. Family history, with verified tumour diagnoses, remains an important clinical tool for finding mutation carriers for referral to clinical geneticists and simultaneous presence of CAN in probable mutation carriers might strengthen this indication.

However, evidence of linkage to 9p21 has been demonstrated in a significant proportion of kindreds with no detectable mutations in CDKN2A. It is possible that mutations in noncoding regions may be responsible for predisposition to melanoma in these families. We have analyzed approximately 1 kb of the CDKN2A promoter upstream of the start codon in an attempt to identify causal mutations in 107 melanoma families. Four sequence variants were detected. Two of these (A-191G and A-493T) did not segregate with disease and were present in a control population at a comparable frequency, indicating that they are unlikely to predispose to melanoma. The A-493T variant appeared to be in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described CDKN2A polymorphism Ala148Thr. The variant G-735A was detected in the control population, but segregation of this variant with melanoma within families could not be discounted. The fourth variant (G-34T), located in the 5' UTR, creates an aberrant initiation codon. This variant appeared to segregate with melanoma and was not detected in a control population. G-34T has recently been identified in a subset of Canadian melanoma families and was concluded to be associated with predisposition to melanoma. The creation of an aberrant initiation site in the 5' UTR may have an important role in carcinogenesis in a small percentage of families; however, mutations in the CDKN2A promoter appear to have a limited role in predisposition to melanoma.",

RT-PCR experiments verified that these three variants, including an AGgt to ATgt mutation that demonstrates a founder effect, do affect splicing. While an exon 1alpha splice donor site mutation incompletely abolishes splicing, the correctly spliced mRNA yields a protein (Q50P) that cannot effectively interact with CDK4. We also performed RT-PCR on mRNA from 16 melanoma-prone kindreds to search for cryptic splice sites deep within introns, but identified no splice variants. Meanwhile, we screened 139 affected families using allele-specific PCR for the recently discovered IVS2-105A>G mutation, but found only one family that possesses this alteration. We conclude that splice site mutations do predispose to disease in a subset of melanoma-prone kindreds.

Frequencies of mutations that alter the coding of p16INK4 or p14ARF were quantified overall and in subgroups. Penetrance and likelihood of carrying mutations by family history were estimated. Among 1537 cases, 9 (0.6%) carried germline mutations in CDKN2A, including three previously unreported mutations. CDKN2A mutation carriers were more likely to have a family history of pancreatic cancer (P=0.003) or melanoma (P=0.03), and a personal history of melanoma (P=0.01). Among cases who reported having a first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer or melanoma, the carrier proportions were 3.3 and 5.3%, respectively. Penetrance for mutation carriers by age 80 was calculated to be 58% for pancreatic cancer (95% confidence interval (CI) 8-86%), and 39% for melanoma (95% CI 0-80). Among cases who ever smoked cigarettes, the risk for pancreatic cancer was higher for carriers compared with non-carriers (HR 25.8, P=2.1 × 10⁻¹³), but among nonsmokers, this comparison did not reach statistical significance. Germline mutations in CDKN2A among unselected pancreatic cancer patients are uncommon, although notably penetrant, especially among smokers.

Mutational analysis on exons 1a, 1b and 2 of the CDKN2A locus and exon 1 of the CDKN2B locus as well as allelic imbalance was performed in 26 AK specimens. Expression levels of the genes p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a) and p53 were examined in 16 AKs and 12 SCCs by real-time RT-PCR. A previously described polymorphism of p16(INK4a) (Ala148Thr) was detected at an allelic frequency of 12%. Six samples carried novel mutations at codon 71 of the CDKN2A locus and one sample presented an additional mutation at codon 65. Two AK samples carried a not-previously described non-UV type missense mutation at codon 184 (Val184Glu) of exon 1b in the p14(ARF) gene. Regarding the CDKN2B locus a new mutation at codon 50 (Ala50Thr) and another at codon 24 (Arg24Arg), were detected. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was found in 15% of AKs in at least one marker, indicating that genetic instability has some implication in the development of AK. Down-regulation of p16(INK4a) and p53 mRNA levels was noted in SCC compared to AK. TSGs expression levels in sun-exposed morphologically normal-appearing skin, suggests that abnormal growth stimuli might exist in these tissues as well. Furthermore, we suggest a possible role of p15(INK4b), independently from the intracellular pathway mediated by p16(INK4a), and of p14(ARF) in AK development, as well as in the progression of AK to SCC.

Frequencies of CDKN2A mutations in materials of sporadic MPM cases from pigmented lesion clinics vary between 8 and 15%. Patients with MPM have therefore been regarded as good candidates for CDKN2A mutational screening. We describe a population-based study where all persons in Norway diagnosed with MPM between 1953 and 2004 (n = 738 alive per April 2004) were invited to participate. Three-hundred-and-ninety patients (52.8%) responded confidentially. Mutations in CDKN2A were found in 6.9% of the respondents. Eighty-one MPM patients (20.8%) reported that they belonged to melanoma families, and 17 (21.0%) of these harboured a CDKN2A mutation, compared to 3.2% of the nonfamilial cases. The probability of finding a CDKN2A mutation increased when the patients had three or more melanomas, or a young age of onset of first melanoma. We identified five novel CDKN2A variants (Ala57Gly, Pro81Arg, Ala118Val, Leu130Val, and Arg131Pro) and four that previously have been reported in melanoma families (Glu27X, Met53Ile, Arg87Trp, and Ala127Pro). A large deletion (g.13623_23772del10150) encompassing exon 1alpha and the 5' part of exon 2 was detected in six patients with a family history of melanoma. Three patients, belonging to the same family, had the CDK4 Arg24His mutation. The frequency of CDKN2A mutations was lower than previously reported in other studies, an observation which probably is due to the population-based design of our study.",

In 68 families with increased hereditary susceptibility to malignant melanoma, we previously reported a low frequency of alterations in the CDKN2A gene, which is regarded as the major melanoma predisposition gene. Among these alterations, we identified a novel mutation in 3 families (Asp108Tyr). In the present study, we focused on the possible role of heritable epimutations as a cause of the silencing of the CDKN2A gene. We used two different technical approaches to detect changes in CpG methylation in the promoter region of the CDKN2A gene; methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis of bisulfite-converted DNA and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). From families who tested negative for germ-line CDKN2A mutations, 64 unrelated patients with hereditary melanoma were included in the study. We showed a consistent lack of hypermethylation in the promoter region of CDKN2A in patients with HMM in our western Swedish population. A putative germ-line methylation of the CDKN2A, if any, is therefore likely to be a rare event in hereditary melanoma. This study demonstrates that there are probably additional and as yet unknown genetic factors present in western Swedish HMM families.",

Additionally, a high hypermethylation frequency of the promoter regions of ADAM23 and CDKN2A in GCTB was observed. The expression of the MAP2K3, MMP14, TIMP2 and VIM genes was significantly higher in GCTB than in normal bone tissue, a fact that was confirmed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying their different tumor growth remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the gene expression profile of cell cycle regulators and cell growth-related transcription factors in CD, SCA, and non-functioning adenomas (NFA).;Tumor tissue specimens resected from 43 pituitary tumors were studied: CD (n=10), SCA (n=11), and NFA (n=22). The absolute transcript numbers of the following genes were quantified with real-time quantitative PCR assays: CDKN2A (or p16(INK4a)), cyclin family (A1, B1, D1, and E1), E2F1, RB1, BUB1, BUBR1, ETS1, and ETS2. Protein expressions of p16 and cyclin D1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical study.;CDKN2A gene expression was about fourfold greater in CD than in SCA and NFA. The gene expressions of cyclins D1, E1, and B1, but not of A1, in CD were significantly suppressed than those in NFA. Cyclin D1 gene expression positively correlated with cyclins B1 and E1. The gene expressions of E2F1, RB1, BUB1, BUBR1, ETS1, and ETS2 did not differ between each group. Positive immunostaining for p16 and negative immunostaining for cyclin D1 were more frequent in CD than in NFA; there were positive correlations between mRNA and protein expressions of p16 and cyclin D1. Thus, it is suggested that upregulated CDKN2A with the concomitant downregulated cyclin gene family is partly involved in the small size of ACTH-secreting adenoma.",

Detailed molecular analyses indicated the absence of homozygous deletions and point mutations involving these genes in all investigated tumor samples. However, when loss of heterozygostity for chromosome 9p21 (the region where CDKN2A and CDKN2B are localized) was investigated, 16% of cases showed abnormalities in an area telomeric to the CDKN2A locus. To study transcriptional silencing of the CDKN2A gene, the methylation status of exon 1 was examined. In about 35% of cases, a partial methylation was evidenced. Analysis of the CDKN2A mRNA expression, however, did not show any relationship between methylation status and gene transcription. Finally, expression of the CDKN2B gene was demonstrated in all stage IV neuroblastomas, whereas none of stage I tumors expressed this gene.

Molecular analysis showed CDKN2A deletions but wild-type PIK3CA. BC61 contained a G372C FGFR3 mutation. TP53 was not mutated in either cell line and BC61 expressed normal full-length protein. In contrast, BC44 exclusively expressed cytoplasmic and nuclear p53Δ40 and 133 isoforms from the alternative promoter P2 as revealed by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and PCR. The only discernible difference in TP53 in BC44 was homozygosity for the deletion allele of the rs17878362 polymorphism in the P2 promoter.

The relationships between familial melanoma, pancreatic cancer and germline CDKN2A mutations were examined using published data. There were 67 different CDKN2A mutations in 189 melanoma-prone families. Forty-two families (18 mutations) had pancreatic cancer reported. For families without reported pancreatic cancer, the most common types of mutations were missense (56%), frameshift (12%), and deletions (12%). For families with pancreatic cancer, missense (56%), splicing (17%), and frameshift (11%) mutations were most common. Seventy percent of the mutations were observed only once, while the remainder recurred in different families. Comparison of 147 melanoma-prone families without pancreatic cancer to the 42 families that had pancreatic cancer reported showed no significant differences in the types or locations of mutations. However, there was a significant difference (p=0.002) in the distribution of families across the four ankyrin repeats.

DBC1 expression was divided into two categories: high DBC1 expression was observed in 32/104 cases (30.8%) and low expression in 72/104 cases (69.2%). High DBC1 expression correlated significantly with favorable clinicopathologic variables. Furthermore, in survival analysis, the high-DBC1 expression group showed a better survival rate compared to the low-DBC1 expression group.

        "Doc_abstract":"The UVB component of the solar spectrum induces DNA lesions that, in the absence of error-free DNA repair, may give rise during DNA replication to mutations in caretaker and gatekeeper genes. The DNA repair genes are the best candidates for caretaker genes as exemplified by the human hereditary xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) syndrome. Cultured XP cells are hypermutable after UVB irradiation. This increased mutation frequency is also found in gatekeeper genes, which govern signalling pathways implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival of human epidermal keratinocytes. We describe and discuss the role of mutated gatekeeper genes in five specific signalling pathways which have been implicated in skin carcinogenesis. The pathways we focus on in this review are: (i) P16(INK4A)-CDK4/6-RB; (ii) P14(ARF)-HDM2-P53; (iii) Sonic hedgehog (SHH)/GLI; (iv) WNT/beta-catenin; and (v) Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/SMAD. 70-80% of XP skin cancers exhibit one or several mutations in the P53, PTCH-1, SMO or CDKN2A genes, the type and frequency of mutated genes being different between squamous cell (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). In XP cancers, the typically UVB-induced CC to TT tandem transitions represent approximately 60% of total mutations compared to 10-15% in skin tumours from DNA repair-proficient patients. Acquired activation of the pathways described herein can alter proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, allowing a damaged cell to replicate and give rise to mutated daughter cells, then eventually to the development of the carcinogenic process following clonal selection.",

Germline CDKN2A and CDK4 status on the familial melanoma cases and clinical features associated with mutational status were then used to build a multiple logistic regression model to predict carrier probability and performance of model on external validation.;From the 116 kindreds prone to melanoma in the Boston area, 13 CDKN2A mutation carriers were identified and 12 were subsequently used in the modeling. Proband age at diagnosis, number of proband primaries, and number of additional family primaries were most closely associated with germline mutations. The estimated probability of the proband being a mutation carrier based on the logistic regression model (MELPREDICT) is given by e(L)/(1 + e(L) where L = 1.99+[0.92x(no. of proband primaries)]+[0.74x(no. of additional family primaries)]-[2.11xln(age)]. The mean estimated probabilities for subjects in the Boston dataset were 55.4% and 5.1% for the mutation carriers and non-carriers respectively. In a receiver operator characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 0.881 (95% confidence interval 0.739 to 1.000) for the Boston model set (n = 116) and 0.803 (0.729 to 0.877) for an external Toronto hereditary melanoma cohort (n = 143).;These results represent the first-iteration logistic regression model to approximate CDKN2A carrier probability.

Using array CGH and a quantitative multiplex PCR method, we have previously identified such deletions in 36% of cases at diagnosis. Using a walking strategy to approach the breakpoints of these deletions we could identify the breakpoints junction of thirteen deletions in 11 patients and of two unbalanced translocation leading to a loss of these genes. A minimal common deleted region of 22.4 kb containing exon 1β of CDKN2A encoding P14ARF and exon 2 of CDKN2B encoding CDKN2B was present in all cases but one. Analysis by quantitative RT PCR showed that the expression level of these genes was decreased in these patients as compared with non deleted cases and that this level was correlated with the deletion status of P14ARF, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B. Analysis of the breakpoint sequences showed that some of them were clustered within a few hundred base-pairs suggesting, even if we failed to identify any clear recombination prone sequences, that in these deletions the rearrangement results from non-random mechanisms.",

In this study, we have investigated if the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) expresses BMI-1 and whether it functions as an oncogene in this highly aggressive group of bone and soft tissue tumors. Our data show that BMI-1 is highly expressed by ESFT cells and that, although it does not significantly affect proliferation or survival, BMI-1 actively promotes anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Moreover, we find that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of both p16 wild-type and p16-null cell lines, demonstrating that the mechanism of BMI-1 oncogenic function in ESFT is, at least in part, independent of CDKN2A repression. Expression profiling studies of ESFT cells following BMI-1 knockdown reveal that BMI-1 regulates the expression of hundreds of downstream target genes including, in particular, genes involved in both differentiation and development as well as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Gain and loss of function assays confirm that BMI-1 represses the expression of the adhesion-associated basement membrane protein nidogen 1. In addition, although BMI-1 promotes ESFT adhesion, nidogen 1 inhibits cellular adhesion in vitro. Together, these data support a pivotal role for BMI-1 ESFT pathogenesis and suggest that its oncogenic function in these tumors is in part mediated through modulation of adhesion pathways.",

The incidences of translocations and deletions were 2.5% and 10.0% in children, and 0.0% and 18.2% in adults, respectively. The incidence of PAX5 deletion was higher than those of BCR-ABL1 (8.9%) or MLL rearrangements (5.1%) in children and than that of MLL rearrangement (3.1%) in adults. Most patients with PAX5 deletion (83.3% of children and 100.0% of adults with PAX5 deletion) had concurrent CDKN2A deletion. PAX5 deletions were detected both in patients with positive and negative PAX5 expression. In this study, we found that PAX5 is a common target in leukemogenesis of B-ALL along with CDKN2A.

However, there is still a significant demand for better biomarkers to identify neoplastic cervical glandular and squamous epithelial cells precisely. The CDKN2A gene, located on chromosome 9p21, encodes the tumour suppressor protein, p16INK4A, which decelerates the cell cycle by inactivating CDK4 and CDK6. The aim of this study was to compare and contrast the expression pattern of p16INK4A in benign and neoplastic glandular lesions and tubo-endometrioid metaplasia. All cases in each category displayed some p16INK4A expression. Adenocarcinoma and in situ cases showed a combination of intense nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. It was observed that all cases of tubo-endometrioid metaplasia showed occasional nuclear positivity and definite cytoplasmic staining. These findings may have important implications for the potential utility of p16INK4A as a biomarker for glandular dysplastic lesions. While p16INK4A has been demonstrated to be an excellent marker of cervical dysplasia in squamous neoplastic lesions of the cervix, it has potential pitfalls in cervical glandular lesions that may limit the utility of this biomarker in resolving the nature of suspicious glandular lesions, particularly in cytopathology.",

The Val59Gly mutation, one of the three different alterations identified among these families, was also detected independently in two kindreds from France and one from Spain. The impact of the Val59Gly substitution on the function of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a), a product of the CDKN2A gene, was assessed by protein-protein interaction and cell proliferation assays and related to potential structural alterations predicted by molecular modeling. Seven microsatellite markers in the vicinity of the CDKN2A gene were used to determine whether the mutation in these families is identical by descent, or represents a mutational hotspot in the CDKN2A gene. Our results show that the Val59Gly substitution impairs p16(INK4a) function, and this dysfunction is consistent with structural predictions. All melanoma-affected individuals tested in the families under study harbor this mutation. Interestingly, the Israeli pedigree includes an affected individual who is homozygous for the Val59Gly mutation. A common haplotype of microsatellite markers has been demonstrated for mutation carriers in all four pedigrees. The Israeli pedigree and one of the French melanoma families are of Moroccan and Tunisian Jewish descent, respectively, and the other families originate from regions of France and Spain close to the Pyrenees.

Fifty-six FPC families with at least two-first-degree relatives with confirmed pancreatic cancer that did not fulfill the criteria of other tumor predisposition syndromes, were analyzed for BRCA2 and CDKN2a germline mutations by DHPLC and/or direct sequencing. No deleterious CDKN2a mutations were identified in our families suggesting that CDKN2a mutations are unlikely to predispose PC in FPC families without melanoma. No deleterious BRCA2 mutations, but 6 unclassified variants, were detected in our FPC collection. Combining the prevalence of deleterious BRCA2 germline mutations from our previous separate study with the data from this study we were able to much more accurately estimate the BRCA2 carrier frequency for FPC families in the German population.

We also performed single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based copy number profile and germline genotype analyses of polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2. Polymorphisms in CYP2A6, which increase harmful effects of smoking, were analyzed. Functions of TET2 mutants were evaluated in KYSE410 and HEK293FT cells.;A high proportion of mutations in the 144 tumor samples were C to T substitution in CpG dinucleotides (called the CpG signature) and C to G/T substitutions with a flanking 5' thymine (called the APOBEC signature). Based on mutational signatures, patients were assigned to 3 groups, which associated with environmental (drinking and smoking) and genetic (polymorphisms in ALDH2 and CYP2A6) factors. Many tumors contained mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle (TP53, CCND1, CDKN2A, FBXW7); epigenetic processes (MLL2, EP300, CREBBP, TET2); and the NOTCH (NOTCH1, NOTCH3), WNT (FAT1, YAP1, AJUBA) and receptor-tyrosine kinase-phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2). Mutations in EP300 and TET2 correlated with shorter survival times, and mutations in ZNF750 associated with an increased number of mutations of the APOBEC signature. Expression of mutant forms of TET2 did not increase cellular levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in HEK293FT cells, whereas knockdown of TET2 increased the invasive activity of KYSE410 ESCC cells. Computational analyses associated the mutations in NFE2L2 we identified with transcriptional activation of its target genes.;We associated environmental and genetic factors with base substitution patterns of somatic mutations and provide a registry of genes and pathways that are disrupted in ESCCs.

In cats, papillomaviruses (PVs) cause viral plaques and Bowenoid in situ carcinomas (BISCs). As both may progress to SCC, it was hypothesized that SCCs in UV-protected skin may represent neoplastic transformation of a PV-induced lesion. To investigate this hypothesis, PCR was used to amplify PV DNA from 25 UV-protected and 45 UV-exposed SCCs. Oncogenic human PVs cause neoplasia by mechanisms that also increase p16(CDKN2A) protein (p16). As increased p16 is present in feline viral plaques and BISCs, immunohistochemistry was used to detect p16 within the SCCs. Papillomaviral DNA was amplified from 76% of UV-protected SCCs, but only 42% of UV-exposed SCCs. Increased p16 was present in 84% of UV-protected SCCs, but only 40% of UV-exposed SCCs. The more frequent detection of PV DNA and increased p16 within UV-protected SCCs supports the hypothesis that some develop from a PV-induced plaque or BISC. Felis domesticus PV-2 is thought to cause viral plaques and BISCs. This PV was detected most frequently within the UV-protected SCCs, supporting development from a PV-induced lesion. Increased p16 and PV DNA were less frequent within UV-exposed SCCs, presumably because these developed from actinic keratosis rather than a PV-induced lesion.

A pooled odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated to evaluate the association between methylated CDKN2A and the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. Specificity, sensitivity, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the diagnostic odds ratio were computed to assess the effect of methylated CDKN2A in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.;Our results indicated an upward trend in the methylation frequency of CDKN2A in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer (cancer vs control: OR =23.67, 95% CI =15.54-36.06; cancer vs CIN: OR =2.53, 95% CI =1.79-3.5; CIN vs control: OR =9.68, 95% CI =5.82-16.02). The specificity, sensitivity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99), 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28-0.45), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95), and 43 (95% CI: 19-98), respectively.;Our findings indicate that abnormal CDKN2A methylation may be strongly correlated with the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Our results also demonstrate that CDKN2A methylation might serve as an early detector of cervical cancer. These findings require further confirmation.",

However, most studies examining the risks of other cancers classified individuals according to the family's CDKN2A mutation rather than determining individual mutation status. For non-population-based studies, risks could also be biased because of cancer occurrence prior to family ascertainment.;We examined the risk of non-melanoma cancer in 117 mutation-positive and 136 mutation-negative members from 15 families that had at least two first degree relatives with melanoma and CDKN2A mutations restricting the analysis to the period after the families were ascertained (that is, the prospective period) and using individual mutation data. The families have been followed prospectively for 4-26 years starting in the 1970s.;Overall, there was no significant association for mutation-negative subjects (Obs/Exp = 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0 to 1.2) although this group had only two observed cancers. In contrast, mutation-positive subjects had a significantly increased risk for all cancers combined (Obs/Exp = 12/5.5 = 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.8) primarily because of digestive system tumours, particularly pancreatic cancer. No other organ systems or individual tumour sites showed significantly increased risks.;Differences in CDKN2A-non-melanoma cancer associations across studies may result from variation in genetic backgrounds, insufficient follow up, misclassification of mutation carriers, or the presence of other genetic and/or environmental risk factors in both CDKN2A mutation carriers and non-carriers.

Penetrance of CDKN2A gene was found to be significantly influenced by host factors (nevus phenotypes and sunburn) on one hand and by variants of MC1R gene (RHC variants consistently associated with red hair and fair skin) on the other hand. Our goal was to examine the joint effects of MC1R variants and other potential risk factors [total nevi, dysplastic nevi, pigmentary traits (skin, hair and eye color), skin reactions to sunlight, and degree of sun exposure] on CDKN2A penetrance. Clinical, genetic, and covariate data were recorded in 20 French melanoma-prone families with cosegregating CDKN2A mutations. Analysis of the cotransmission of melanoma and CDKN2A mutations was conducted by likelihood-based methods using the regressive logistic models, which can account for a variation of disease risk with age and can include the aforementioned risk factors as covariates. RHC variants, considered either alone or in the presence of pigmentation and nevus phenotypes, were found to increase significantly CDKN2A penetrance. Multivariate analysis, using a stepwise selection procedure, showed significant effects of two factors on melanoma risk in CDKN2A mutations carriers: RHC variants [odds ratio of hazard function (OR), 2.21; P = 0.03] and dysplastic nevi (OR, 2.93; P < 0.01).

In total, 700 individuals (136 patients with a positive family history and 164 with at least two primary melanomas as the high-risk groups; 200 with single primary melanomas; and 200 healthy individuals as the control groups) were Sanger sequenced for CDKN2A exon 1α, 1β, and 2.

We found the disease-associated mutations p.R24P (8×), p.N71T (1×), p.G101W (1×), and p.V126D (1×) in the group with affected relatives and p.R24P (2×) in the group with several primary melanomas. Furthermore, we discovered four mutations of unknown significance, two of which were novel: p.A34V and c.151-4 G>C, respectively. Computational effect prediction suggested p.A34V as conferring a high risk for melanoma, whereas c.151-4 G>C, although being predicted as a splice site mutation by MutationTaster, could not functionally be confirmed to alter splicing. Moreover, computational effect prediction confirmed accumulation of high-penetrance mutations in high-risk groups, whereas mutations of unknown significance were distributed across all groups. p.R24P is the most common high-risk mutation in Austria.

DNA was also extracted from 10 biopsy samples from patients with sporadic melanomas. NRAS was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequence analysis. Differences in NRAS mutation frequency between hereditary and sporadic melanomas were analyzed by the chi-square test. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Activating mutations in NRAS codon 61, all of which were either CAA(Gln)-AAA(Lys) or CAA(Gln)-CGA(Arg) mutations, were found in 95% (20/21) of primary hereditary melanomas but in only 10% (1/10) of sporadic melanomas (P<.001). Multiple activating NRAS mutations were detected in tumor cells from different regions of individual primary melanomas in nine patients. Activating mutations that were detected in the primary melanomas of these patients were also retained in their metastases. NRAS mutations at sites other than codon 61 were also present in the primary melanomas, indicating genetic instability of this locus. NRAS codon 61 mutations were also detected in dysplastic nevi and in an in situ melanoma, suggesting a role for such mutations during early melanoma development.;The high frequency of NRAS codon 61 mutations detected in these hereditary melanomas may be the result of a hypermutability phenotype associated with a hereditary predisposition for melanoma development in patients with germline CDKN2A mutations.",

This study examines the genetic alterations in peritoneal mesotheliomas, which may have a different pathogenesis than their pleural counterparts. Twenty-six cases of peritoneal mesotheliomas in a triplicate tissue microarray were studied. Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed with CDKN2A and MTAP locus-specific probes. Nine of 26 (35%) peritoneal mesotheliomas had homozygous deletion of CDKN2A; MTAP was co-deleted in every case. All cases with CDKN2A deletions had loss of p16 protein expression; five cases had loss of p16 protein without evidence of CDKN2A deletions. All patients with CDKN2A deletions were men (P, NS) and were significantly older (mean, 63 years) than the patients with no deletions (mean, 52 years) (P=0.033, t-test). An association with asbestos exposure could not be proved in this study. Similar to pleural mesotheliomas, patients with CDKN2A deletions and loss of p16 protein expression had worse overall and disease-specific survival (P=0.010 and 0.006, respectively; Kaplan-Meier log rank). Detection of CDKN2A-MTAP co-deletion in peritoneal mesotheliomas, coupled with a p16 immunohistochemical stain as an inexpensive screening tool, can help identify those patients who may have an unfavorable outcome after aggressive cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and those who may respond to targeted therapy of the MTAP pathway.",

Frequencies of deletions at the 18 regions were evaluated by genomic polymerase chain reaction in 78 lung cancer cell lines. Seven regions, 2q24, 3p14, 5q11, 9p21, 9p23, 11q14, and 21q21, were homozygously deleted in two or more cell lines.

The PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D) locus at 9p23 was the second-most frequently deleted (8/78, 10%), and the deletions were detected in both small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and NSCLC. In addition, the 9p24 region was deleted in a NSCLC.

Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications.

The chromosome region 9p21 and markers on chromosomes 1p and 6p have been linked to melanoma susceptibility. The tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B have been mapped to the 9p21 region, and genetic analyses have revealed the presence of germline CDKN2A alterations in melanoma families. The reported frequencies of such alterations, however, vary among these families.;The present investigation was carried out to determine the frequencies of CDKN2A and CDKN2B germline gene mutations among members in a population-based cohort of Swedish melanoma families (i.e., melanoma kindreds).;DNA was prepared from blood samples obtained from 181 individuals belonging to 100 melanoma kindreds. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and nucleotide sequence analyses, were used to identify the types and frequencies of mutations in exons 1, 1beta, 2, and 3 of the CDKN2A gene and in exons 1 and 2 of the CDKN2B gene.;CDKN2A gene aberrations were independently identified by both SSCP and nucleotide-sequence analyses. Nucleotide-sequence analysis identified a single point mutation leading to a substitution of leucine for proline in codon 48 of exon 1 in a family with a history of melanoma and several other cancers. A second abnormality, leading to an insertion of an extra arginine residue at codon number 113 of exon 2, was seen in four separate families. The CDKN2A exon-3 coding region had the wild-type sequence in all samples. No germline mutations were found in the alternative exon 1beta of the CDKN2A gene or in exons 1 and 2 of the CDKN2B gene.;The present investigation demonstrates that CDKN2A germline gene mutations were observed in 7.8% of the 64 Swedish melanoma kindreds that each included at least two first-degree relatives with melanoma and dysplastic nevus syndrome.

Assessing pathogenicity of nonsynonymous mutations is critical to evaluate melanoma risk in carriers. In the current study, we investigate 20 CDKN2A germline mutations whose effects on p16(INK4A) structure and function have not been previously documented (Thr18_Ala19dup, Gly23Asp, Arg24Gln, Gly35Ala, Gly35Val, Ala57Val, Ala60Val, Ala60Arg, Leu65dup, Gly67Arg, Gly67_Asn71del, Glu69Gly, Asp74Tyr, Thr77Pro, Arg80Pro, Pro81Thr, Arg87Trp, Leu97Arg, Arg99Pro, and [Leu113Leu;Pro114Ser]). By considering genetic information, the predicted impact of each variant on the protein structure, its ability to interact with CDK4 and impede cell proliferation in experimental settings, we conclude that 18 of the 20 CDKN2A variants can be classed as loss of function mutations, whereas the results for two remain ambiguous.

        "Doc_abstract":"Underrepresentation of chromosome 9 is a common finding in bladder cancer. Frequent loss of the whole chromosome suggests the presence of at least one relevant tumor suppressor gene on each arm. Candidate regions identified by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis include a region at 9p21 containing CDKN2A, which encodes p16 and p14(ARF), a large region at 9q12-31 including PTCH and many other genes, a small region at 9q32-33, which includes the DBCCR1 gene, and a region at 9q34 including the TSC1 gene. Experimental replacement of genes or chromosomes into tumor cells with appropriate deletions or mutations represents an important approach to test the functional significance of candidate tumor suppressor genes. Loss of an entire copy of chromosome 9 in many bladder tumor cell lines provides no indication of which gene or genes are affected, and selection of appropriate recipient cells for gene replacement is difficult. We have investigated three candidate tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, DBCCR1, and TSC1), at the DNA level and by expression analysis in a panel of bladder tumor cell lines, many of which have probable LOH along the length of the chromosome, as indicated by homozygosity for multiple polymorphic markers. Cytogenetically, we found no reduction in the numbers of chromosomes 9 relative to total chromosome count. Homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus was frequent but homozygous deletion of TSC1 was not found. A new cell line, DSH1, derived from a pT1G2 transitional cell carcinoma with known homozygous deletion of DBCCR1, is described. This study identifies suitable cell lines for future functional analysis of both CDKN2A and DBCCR1.",

Herein we report the prevalence of childhood tumors (diagnosed<or=18 years of age) in families identified with mutation in the BRCA1/2, MMR and CDKN2A genes. Using pedigrees at the Regional Oncogenetic Clinic at Lund University Hospital, the prevalence of childhood cancer was estimated in families with mutations in the BRCA1 (n=98), BRCA2 (n=43) MMR (MLH1, MSH2 MSH6) (n=31) and CDKN2A (n=15) genes in comparison with population based control families (n=854). Compared with the control group, a significantly higher prevalence of childhood cancer was found in families with mutations in BRCA2 (9.3% vs. 0.8% P=0.001), MMR genes (19.4% vs. 0.8% P<0.001) and CDKN2A (20.0% vs. 0.8% P<0.001), but not in families with BRCA1 mutations (1.0% vs. 0.8% P=0.6).

DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic alteration, occurring through a methyl radical addition to the cytosine base adjacent to guanine. Many tumor genes are inactivated by DNA methylation in gastric cancer. We evaluated the DNA methylation status of ANAPC1, CDKN2A and TP53 by methylation-specific PCR in 20 diffuse- and 26 intestinal-type gastric cancer samples and 20 normal gastric mucosa in individuals from Northern Brazil. All gastric cancer samples were advanced stage adenocarcinomas. Gastric samples were surgically obtained at the João de Barros Barreto University Hospital, State of Pará, and were stored at -80 degrees C before DNA extraction. Patients had never been submitted to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, nor did they have any other diagnosed cancer. None of the gastric cancer samples presented methylated DNA sequences for ANAPC1 and TP53. CDKN2A methylation was not detected in any normal gastric mucosa; however, the CDKN2A promoter was methylated in 30.4% of gastric cancer samples, with 35% methylation in diffuse-type and 26.9% in intestinal-type cancers. CDKN2A methylation was associated with the carcinogenesis process for ~30% diffuse-type and intestinal-type compared to non-neoplastic samples. Thus, ANAPC1 and TP53 methylation was probably not implicated in gastric carcinogenesis in our samples. CDKN2A can be implicated in the carcinogenesis process of only a subset of gastric neoplasias.",

Outside the familial context, multiple primary tumors could be related either to germline de novo mutations or to low-penetrance mutations, in predisposing genes. We selected 100 patients who displayed multiple primary melanoma (MPM) without any known melanoma cases recorded within their families and looked for germline mutations in the two melanoma-predisposing genes identified to date, CDKN2A and CDK4 exon 2. Nine patients (9%) had germline mutations in CDKN2A, whereas none carried germline mutations in exon 2 of CDK4. Seven cases displayed a recurrent missense mutation, G101W, already described in more than 20 melanoma-prone families; one case carried a missense mutation never reported to date (P114S), and the last case was a carrier of a 6 bp insertion at nucleotide 57 resulting in a duplication of codons 18 and 19. To ascertain whether the G101W was a mutational hot spot for de novo mutations or a common founder mutation, we genotyped eight microsatellite markers flanking the CDKN2A gene. After allowing for recombination over time, haplotype sharing provided evidence for an original G101W mutation common to 6 out of 7 sporadic MPM cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that de novo germline CDKN2A mutations associated with MPM are rare.",

It is the major risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Methylation of CpG dinucleotides of normally unmethylated genes is associated with silencing of their expression, and is common in EAC. This study was designed to determine at what stage, in the progression from BE to EAC, methylation of key genes occurs.;We examined nine genes (APC, CDKN2A, ID4, MGMT, RBP1, RUNX3, SFRP1, TIMP3, and TMEFF2), frequently methylated in multiple cancer types, in a panel of squamous (19 biopsies from patients without BE or EAC, 16 from patients with BE, 21 from patients with EAC), BE (40 metaplastic, seven high grade dysplastic) and 37 EAC tissues. The methylation frequency, the percentage of samples that had any extent of methylation, for each of the nine genes in the EAC (95%, 59%, 76%, 57%, 70%, 73%, 95%, 74% and 83% respectively) was significantly higher than in any of the squamous groups. The methylation frequency for each of the nine genes in the metaplastic BE (95%, 28%, 78%, 48%, 58%, 48%, 93%, 88% and 75% respectively) was significantly higher than in the squamous samples except for CDKN2A and RBP1. The methylation frequency did not differ between BE and EAC samples, except for CDKN2A and RUNX3 which were significantly higher in EAC. The methylation extent was an estimate of both the number of methylated alleles and the density of methylation on these alleles. This was significantly greater in EAC than in metaplastic BE for all genes except APC, MGMT and TIMP3. There was no significant difference in methylation extent for any gene between high grade dysplastic BE and EAC.;We found significant methylation in metaplastic BE, which for seven of the nine genes studied did not differ in frequency from that found in EAC. This is also the first report of gene silencing by methylation of ID4 in BE or EAC. This study suggests that metaplastic BE is a highly abnormal tissue, more similar to cancer tissue than to normal epithelium.",

To date, there have been few published estimations of the prevalence of such mutations in sporadic melanoma patients. In this study, we investigated CDKN2A and CDK4 exon 2 for germline mutations in 125 consecutive cutaneous malignant melanoma patients recruited through the Latvian Oncological Center, using amplicon melting analysis and sequencing. No disease-related CDKN2A germline mutations were identified in any of the melanoma patients analysed but the previously described CDK4 mutation, Arg24His, was found in one patient with a family history of melanoma. CDKN2A polymorphisms were studied as putative low penetrance susceptibility genes. The proportion of cases with polymorphisms in this Latvian melanoma population was Ala148Thr (c.442G>A) (6%), 500 C/G (c.*29C>G) (18%), and 540 C/T (c.*69C>T) (20%); however, only the frequency of the Ala148Thr polymorphism was higher in melanoma patients than in 203 controls (6 versus 1%, P=0.03). Ala148Thr has also been reported in association with melanoma in a Polish series but not in an English series. We therefore examined the Ala148Thr carrier's haplotype in 10 Latvian and 39 Polish samples. No significant difference was seen between these populations and the predominant haplotype observed in English samples, giving no indication that the discrepancy could be explained by population differences in linkage disequilibrium. In summary, our results show that germline mutations at the CDKN2A locus are rare in sporadic melanoma in Latvia. The study does, however, provide some additional evidence for a role for the CDKN2A polymorphism Ala148Thr as a low penetrance susceptibility gene. The detected CDK4 exon 2 mutation was found in only the seventh family identified worldwide with a germline CDK4 mutation.",

Previous studies of lapatinib, a selective dual-kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 tyrosine kinases, have shown predictable relationships between the activity of these target genes and response. Under the hypothesis that additional genes may play a role in drug sensitivity, a predictive model for lapatinib response was constructed from genome-wide DNA copy number data from 24 cancer cell lines. An optimal predictive model which consists of aberrations at nine distinct genetic loci, includes gains of HER2, EGFR, and loss of CDKN2A. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of approximately 0.85 (80% confidence interval, 0.70-0.98; P < 0.01), and correctly classified the sensitivity status of 8 of 10 head and neck cancer cell lines.

We assessed the principal mode of inactivation in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and frequency in biologically relevant subgroups. Mutation or methylation was rare, whereas genomic deletion occurred in 21% of B-cell precursor ALL and 50% of T-ALL patients. Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays revealed copy number neutral (CNN) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 8% of patients. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated that the mean size of deletions was 14.8 Mb and biallelic deletions composed a large and small deletion (mean sizes, 23.3 Mb and 1.4 Mb). Among 86 patients, only 2 small deletions were below the resolution of detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Patients with high hyperdiploidy, ETV6-RUNX1, or 11q23/MLL rearrangements had low rates of deletion (11%, 15%, 13%), whereas patients with t(9;22), t(1;19), TLX3, or TLX1 rearrangements had higher frequencies (61%, 42%, 78%, and 89%). In conclusion, CDKN2A deletion is a significant secondary abnormality in childhood ALL strongly correlated with phenotype and genotype. The variation in the incidence of CDKN2A deletions by cytogenetic subgroup may explain its inconsistent association with outcome. CNN LOH without apparent CDKN2A inactivation suggests the presence of other relevant genes in this region.",

While p16 loss is predictive of poor prognosis, there is controversy as to whether BAP1 loss is predictive of a more favorable prognosis; how these results interact with one another has not been explored. We performed CDKN2A FISH on a previously published tissue microarray on which we had performed BAP1 IHC, revealing combined BAP1/p16 status for 93 MPM cases. As expected, BAP1 IHC in combination with CDKN2A FISH resulted in high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (100%) for MPM, and p16 loss was an independent predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio (HR)=2.2553, P=.0135). There was no association between BAP1 loss and p16 loss, as 26%, 28%, 30%, and 16% of overall cases demonstrated loss of BAP1 alone, loss of p16 alone, loss of both BAP1 and p16, or neither abnormality, respectively. Though multivariate analysis demonstrated that BAP1 IHC is not an independent predictor of prognosis, when viewed in combination with homozygous CDKN2A deletion, risk stratification was evident. More specifically, patients with CDKN2A disomy and loss of BAP1 expression had improved outcomes compared to those with CDKN2A disomy and retained BAP1 expression (HR=0.2286, P=.0017), and this finding was notably evident among epithelioid cases.

Recently, the use of salispheres, which consist of salivary gland stem cells (SGSCs), has been suggested as therapy for these problems. However, an insufficient number of cells can be obtained and cultured for cell transplantation. In the present study, salispheres were propagated and passaged by suspension culture to acquire a sufficient number of SGSCs for cell therapy.;The relationship between sphere formation and the degree of cellular senescence was investigated by analysing senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the expression of senescence-related markers such as CDKN2A (p16) and p21. Because the sphere formation potential of SGSCs was decreased and the senescence of the cells was increased after passaging subculture, Y-27632, a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor, was used to treat the passaging subculture to aid the proliferation of the cells in culture.;The number of spheres was higher in the Y-27632 treatment group than in the control group, and the expression of c-Kit, a proliferation marker, was also increased. In addition, the expression of p16 and p21 proteins tended to be lower in the Y-27632 group.;Y-27632 suppresses the expression of senescence-related proteins and enhances cellular proliferation.

The cells responsible for Barrett's epithelium self-renewal are frequently mutated during neoplastic progression. If NSE arises from the same cells that self-renew the Barrett's epithelium, the two tissues should be clonally related and share genetic alterations; if NSE does not originate in the self-renewing Barrett's, NSE and Barrett's esophagus should be genetically independent.;We isolated islands of NSE and the surrounding Barrett's epithelium from 20 patients by microdissection and evaluated each tissue for genetic alterations in exon 2 of CDKN2A or exons 5 to 9 of the TP53 gene.

Folate has been suggested to play a role in the homeostasis of DNA methylation and has also been implicated in cancer chemotherapy. We investigated a possible role for folate in DNA methylation by measuring folate concentrations in tumors and adjacent normal tissues from 72 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. These were compared to DNA methylation levels and to clinicopathological features. Folate concentrations were determined as the sum of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. The MethyLight assay was used to quantitate methylation in promoter regions of P16(CDKN2A), APC, CDH13, RARB, RASSF1, RUNX3, and MYOD1. Methylation of LINE-1 repeats was used as a surrogate for global methylation. Folate levels in tumors correlated positively with LINE-1, CDH13, and RUNX3 methylation. Folate concentrations and methylation of LINE-1, RASSF1, and RUNX3 were significantly higher in adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Two sets of array-based data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus consistently showed that expression of FOLR1, a folate transport enzyme, and GGH, an enzyme that prevents folate retention, were higher and lower, respectively, in adenocarcinomas compared to SCC. This was independently validated by quantitative RT-PCR in 26 adenocarcinomas and 13 SCC. Our results suggest that folate metabolism plays a role in aberrant DNA methylation in NSCLC. The histological subtype differences in folate concentration and DNA methylation observed here were associated with distinct expression patterns for folate metabolizing enzymes. These findings may have clinical applications for histology-directed chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and anti-folates in NSCLC.",

We present 2 RCCs exhibiting a hitherto not reported biphasic neoplastic cell population exhibiting a predominantly alveolar architecture where squamoid differentiation was identified in one of the neoplastic cell populations. None of the tumors showed chromophobe features or any evidence of sarcomatoid transformation. The tumors arose in 2 adult patients and were characterized by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructure, array comparative genomic hybridization, confirmatory fluorescent in situ hybridization, and loss of heterozygosity analysis. Tumors measured 3 and 4 cm and were located within the renal parenchyma and had no pelvicalyceal connection. Both tumors were composed of a distinctly dual-cell population. The larger tumor cells displayed squamoid features and formed round well-demarcated solid alveolated islands that, in large parts, were surrounded by a smaller neoplastic cell component. The squamoid cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratins (CKs) (AE1-AE3, Cam 5.2, CK5/6, CK7, and CK20), epithelial membrane antigen, racemase/AMACR, and carboanhydrase IX (in 1 case focally). The small cell population was positive for CK7, epithelial membrane antigen, and racemase/AMACR, whereas CK20, AE1-3, and carboanhydrase IX were negative. CD10 was focally positive in the large squamoid cells in 1 case. Cathepsin K, E-cadherin, and CD117 displayed focal positivity in 1 case. Vimentin, RCC marker, parvalbumin, S100 protein, S100 A1, p63, p53, CDX2, uroplakin III, HMB45, TFE3, WT1, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, thyroglobulin, and TTF1 were negative. The proliferative activity (Ki-67) was low (1%) in the small cell component in both cases, whereas the large neoplastic tumor cells displayed a significantly higher proliferation (20%-35%). Ultrastructurally, desmosomes and tonofilaments were identified in the large tumor cells, confirming squamoid differentiation in a subset of tumor cells. Array comparative genomic hybridization of 1 analyzable case (confirmed with fluorescent in situ hybridization and loss of heterozygosity analysis) revealed partial or complete losses of chromosomes 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 22, (including biallelic loss of CDKN2A locus) and partial gains of chromosomes 1, 5, 11, 12 and 13.

Here we report that BRAF(V600E) expression in neural progenitors (NPs) is insufficient for tumorigenesis and increases NP cellular differentiation as well as apoptosis. In contrast, astrocytomas are readily generated from NPs with additional Ink4a-Arf deletion. The BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 significantly increased survival of mice after intracranial transplant of genetically relevant murine or human astrocytoma cells. Moreover, combination therapy using PLX4720 plus the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-specific inhibitor PD0332991 further extended survival relative to either monotherapy. Our findings indicate a rational therapeutic strategy for treating a subset of pediatric astrocytomas with BRAF(V600E) mutation and CDKN2A deficiency.",

Evaluation for loss of the tumor suppressor p16, encoded by CDKN2A gene on chromosome 9p21.3, has been proposed to be useful for evaluation of spitzoid melanocytic lesions. However, reports on the utility of p16 immunohistochemistry for spitzoid lesions have been conflicting, and few studies have directly compared p16 immunohistochemistry with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for CDKN2A genomic status. We analyzed a spectrum of benign (n=24), borderline (n=27), and malignant (n=19) spitzoid lesions for p16 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and CDKN2A copy number by FISH. Immunohistochemistry was evaluated by 2 scoring methods: H score and 2-tiered score (positive or negative for p16 loss). By immunohistochemistry, loss of p16 expression was not observed in Spitz nevi (0/24) but was seen in ASTs (7/27; 26%) and spitzoid melanomas (3/19; 16%). By H score, p16 expression was significantly higher in Spitz nevi relative to ASTs or spitzoid melanomas. Similarly, copy number aberrations of CDKN2A by FISH were absent in Spitz nevi but were found in 2 (9.5%) of 21 ASTs and 4 (33%) of 12 spitzoid melanomas. Our findings from this large cohort suggest that p16 aberrations are highly specific for borderline and malignant spitzoid neoplasms relative to Spitz nevi. Similar to ASTs, p16 loss in spitzoid melanomas may occur in the presence or absence of genomic CDKN2A loss.",

Aberrant methylation was detected in nine of 40 tumours analysed: The imprinted SNRPN and D15S63 loci were hypermethylated in three tumours, all of which retained both copies of chromosome 3. Methylated RARB alleles were detected in three tumours, whereas in three other tumours CDKN2A was found to be methylated.

Genetic variants in DNA repair genes may be particularly important since their altered function in response to sun exposure-related DNA damage maybe related to risk for CMM. However, systematic evaluations of genetic variants in DNA repair genes are limited, particularly in high-risk families. We comprehensively analyzed DNA repair gene polymorphisms and CMM risk in melanoma-prone families with/without CDKN2A mutations. A total of 586 individuals (183 CMM) from 53 families (23 CDKN2A (+), 30 CDKN2A (-)) were genotyped for 2964 tagSNPs in 131 DNA repair genes. Conditional logistic regression, conditioning on families, was used to estimate trend p-values, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between CMM and each SNP separately, adjusted for age and sex. p-Values for SNPs in the same gene were combined to yield gene specific p-values. Two genes, POLN and PRKDC, were significantly associated with melanoma after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p = 0.0003 and 0.00035, respectively). DCLRE1B showed suggestive association (p = 0.0006). 28 ∼ 56% of genotyped SNPs in these genes had single SNP p < 0.05. The most significant SNPs in POLN and PRKDC had similar effects in CDKN2A (+) and CDKN2A (-) families.

In a series of 11 microsatellite stable (MSS) and 9 microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancer cell lines and primary colon carcinomas (25 MSS and 28 MSI) with known ploidy stem line and APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutation status, we analyzed the promoter methylation of the following genes: hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a (CDKN2A alpha-transcript), p14ARF (CDKN2A beta-transcript), APC, and E-cadherin (CDH1). We compared the DNA methylation profiles of the cell lines with those of the primary tumors. Finally, we examined if the epigenetic changes were associated with known genetic markers and/or clinicopathological variables.;The cell lines and primary tumors generally showed similar overall distribution and frequencies of gene methylation. Among the cell lines, 15%, 50%, 75%, 65%, 20% and 15% showed promoter methylation for hMLH1, MGMT, p16INK4a, p14ARF, APC, and E-cadherin, respectively, whereas 21%, 40%, 32%, 38%, 32%, and 40% of the primary tumors were methylated for the same genes. hMLH1 and p14ARF were significantly more often methylated in MSI than in MSS primary tumors, whereas the remaining four genes showed similar methylation frequencies in the two groups. Methylation of p14ARF, which indirectly inactivates TP53, was seen more frequently in tumors with normal TP53 than in mutated samples, but the difference was not statistically significant. Methylation of p14ARF and p16INK4a was often present in the same primary tumors, but association to diploidy, MSI, right-sided location and female gender was only significant for p14ARF. E-cadherin was methylated in 14/34 tumors with altered APC further stimulating WNT signaling.;The present study shows that colon cancer cell lines are in general relevant in vitro models, comparable with the in vivo situation, as the cell lines display many of the same molecular alterations as do the primary carcinomas. The combined pattern of epigenetic and genetic aberrations in the primary carcinomas reveals associations between them as well as to clinicopathological variables, and may aid in the future molecular assisted classification of clinically distinct stages.",

In one family, we identified two fourth-degree relatives homozygous for the Ser56Ile mutation, indicating a possible consanguinity. Furthermore, we observed that a carrier of the founder CDKN2A [p.Leu113Leu;p.Pro114Ser] mutation as well as two MC1R moderate-risk variants, [p.Arg151Cys(+)p.Arg163Gln] developed 22 primary melanomas in the three years that followed initiation of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Inclusion of 221 pairs of MZ twins enabled separation of shared environmental and polygenic influences, so placing an upper limit to estimates of QTL variance. Maximum likelihood multipoint variance component methods were used to assess linkage of naevus count. Sex, age, body surface area, skin colour, hair colour, sunburn and facial freckles were included as covariates. Peak linkage of flat mole count was to regions on chromosomes 2, 9, 8 and 17 with lod scores 2.95, 2.95, 2.50 and 2.15, respectively. The support for linkage to the CDKN2A gene region (9p21) increased to 3.42 when additional fine mapping markers were added. For raised mole count, there was suggestive evidence of linkage in our sample to chromosome 16 (lod=1.87), and for atypical mole count on chromosomes 1, 6 and X with lod scores of 2.20, 2.00 and 2.00, respectively. The multivariate linkage peaks generally match those from individual trait analyses, with the exception of a new peak on chromosome 4 (point-wise empirical P-value=0.001).

However, the potential therapeutic effects of targeting these anti-apoptotic mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we tested both in vitro and in vivo effects of the combination of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and proteasome inhibitors on the apoptosis of six endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines of different latency patterns (types I and III and Wp-restricted) and three lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We found that the combination of HDAC and proteasome inhibitors (e.g. SAHA/bortezomib) synergistically induced the killing of Wp-restricted and latency III BL and LCLs but not latency I BL cells. The synergistic killing was due to apoptosis, as evidenced by the high percentage of annexin V positivity and strong cleavage of PARP1 (PARP) and CASP3 (caspase-3). Concomitantly, SAHA/bortezomib up-regulated the expression of CDKN2A and CDKN1A but did not affect the level of BCL2L11 or BHRF1 (viral homologue of BCL2). The apoptotic effects were dependent on reactive oxygen species generation. Furthermore, SAHA/bortezomib suppressed the growth of Wp-restricted BL xenografts in nude mice. This study provides the rationale to test the novel application of SAHA/bortezomib on the treatment of EBV-associated Wp-restricted BL and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. ",

We studied 395 subjects from 16 American CDKN2A families. Major melanoma risk factors were assessed by clinical examination or questionnaire; MC1R was sequenced. Odds ratios were estimated by unconditional and conditional logistic regression models. We examined the distribution of MC1R variants and median ages at melanoma diagnosis in multiple primary melanoma (MPM) and single primary melanoma (SPM) patients. Presence of multiple MC1R variants was significantly associated with melanoma, even after adjustment for major melanoma risk factors. All 40 MPM patients had at least one MC1R variant; 65% of MPM patients versus only 17% of SPM patients had at least two MC1R variants (P < 0.0001). For all 69 melanoma patients combined, as well as the 40 MPM patients, there was a statistically significant decrease in median age at diagnosis as numbers of MC1R variants increased (P = 0.010 and P = 0.008, respectively). In contrast, no significant reduction in age at melanoma diagnosis was observed for SPM patients (P = 0.91). The current study suggests that the presence of multiple MC1R variants is associated with the development of multiple melanoma tumors in patients with CDKN2A mutations.

Its product, p16, binds specifically to CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting their kinase activity. CDKN2A is homozygously deleted or mutated in a large proportion of tumor cell lines and some primary tumors, including melanomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of CDKN2A and elucidate the mechanisms of p16 inactivation in a panel of 60 cell lines derived from sporadic melanomas. Twenty-six (43%) of the melanoma lines were homozygously deleted for CDKN2A, and an additional 15 (25%) lines carried missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. All but one of the latter group were shown by microsatellite analysis to be hemizygous for the region of 9p surrounding CDKN2A. p16 was detected by Western blotting in only five of the cell lines carrying mutations. Immunoprecipitation of p16 in these lines, followed by Western blotting to detect the coprecipitation of CDK4 and CDK6, revealed that p16 was functionally compromised in all cell lines but the one that carried a heterozygous CDKN2A mutation. In the remaining 19 lines that carried wild-type CDKN2A alleles, Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation indicated that 11 cell lines expressed a wild-type protein. Northern blotting was performed on the remaining eight cell lines and revealed that one cell line carried an aberrantly sized RNA transcript, and two other cell lines failed to express RNA. The promoter was found to be methylated in five cell lines that expressed CDKN2A transcript but not p16. Presumably, the message seen by Northern blotting in these cell lines is the result of cross-hybridization of the total cDNA probe with the exon 1beta transcript. Microsatellite analysis revealed that the majority of these cell lines were hemi/homozygous for the region surrounding CDKN2A, indicating that the wild-type allele had been lost. In the 11 cell lines that expressed functional p16, microsatellite analysis revealed loss of heterozygosity at the markers immediately surrounding CDKN2A in five cases, and the previously characterized R24C mutation of CDK4 was identified in one of the remaining 6 lines. These data indicate that 55 of 60 (92%) melanoma cell lines demonstrated some aberration of CDKN2A or CDK4, thus suggesting that this pathway is a primary genetic target in melanoma development.",

Molecular markers such as gene methylation, microsatellite instability and KRAS mutations, are becoming increasingly important in guiding treatment decisions in colorectal cancer. However, their association with clinicopathologic variables and utility in the management of rectal cancer is still poorly understood. We analyzed CDKN2A gene methylation, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability and KRAS/BRAF mutations in a cohort of 381 rectal cancers with extensive clinical follow-up data. BRAF mutations (2%), CIMP-high (4%) and microsatellite instability-high (2%) were rare, whereas KRAS mutations (39%), CDKN2A methylation (20%) and CIMP-low (25%) were more common. Only CDKN2A methylation and KRAS mutations showed an association with poor overall survival but these did not remain significant when analyzed with other clinicopathologic factors. In contrast, this prognostic effect was strengthened by the joint presence of CDKN2A methylation and KRAS mutations, which independently predicted recurrence of cancer and was associated with poor overall and cancer-specific survival. This study has identified a subgroup of more aggressive rectal cancers that may arise through the KRAS-p16 pathway. It has been previously shown that an interaction of p16 deficiency and oncogenic KRAS promotes carcinogenesis in the mouse and is characterized by loss of oncogene-induced senescence.

We examined a total of 34 tumours from 30 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for deletion, mutation and DNA methylation of these two genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, sequence analysis and Southern blot.

Automated sequencing analysis of p16 exon 1 and 2 and p15 exon 1 and 2 failed to demonstrate mutations in either p16 or p15 in any of these specimens.

Most benign tumours showed no p16 expression in the tumour cells, whereas only 11% of malignant cancers were p16 negative. A high proportion of p16-positive tumour cells was associated with advanced stage and grade, and with poor prognosis in cancer patients. For FIGO stage I tumours, a high proportion of p16-positive tumour cells was associated with poorer survival, suggesting that accumulation of p16 is an early event of ovarian tumorigenesis. In contrast to tumour cells, high expression of p16 in the surrounding stromal cells was not associated with the stage and grade, but was associated with longer survival. When all parameters were combined in a multivariate analysis, high p16 expression in stromal cells was not an independent predictor for survival, indicating that low p16 expression in stromal cells is associated with other markers of tumour progression. High expression of p16 in the stromal cells of tumours from long-term survivors suggests that tumour growth is limited to some extent by factors associated with p16 expression in the matrix.",

A detailed literature search was made to identify the related research publications. Analysis of pooled data was performed. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated and summarized. Final analysis of 638 EC patients from 12 eligible studies was performed. The results showed that CDKN2A hypermethylation was significantly higher in EC than in normal control tissue, the pooled OR from 8 studies including 400 EC patients and 131 controls, OR = 8.39 with 95% CI 4.03-17.45, test for overall effect, Z = 5.69, P < 0.00001. Further analysis showed that CDKN2A hypermethylation was not significantly associated with tumor differentiation and clinical stage status in EC patients. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CDKN2A hypermethylation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of EC.

We demonstrate that germline knockout of one allele of each of these genes causes accelerated onset and progression of asbestos-induced malignant mesothelioma compared with asbestos-exposed Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice. Ascites from some Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung, suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). Malignant mesothelioma cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type mice. Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC population. Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of c-Met. These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.",

To examine whether a correlation between TSG inactivation and viral infection can be found in MCC, we investigated the promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A, TP73, PTPRG, FHIT, and CDKN2A and the presence of MCPyV and SV40 in 98 MCC by PCR. Hypermethylation of RASSF1A was frequently found in 42 of 83 (51%) of MCC. Methylation of CDKN2A was present in 9 of 41 (22%) of MCC.

In Australian families, > or =2 patients with MPM, median age at melanoma diagnosis < or =40 years and > or =6 patients with melanoma in a family jointly predicted the mutation risk. In European families, all four factors concurrently predicted the risk, but with less stringent criteria than in Australia. In North American families, only > or =1 patient with MPM and age at diagnosis < or =40 years simultaneously predicted the mutation risk.;The variation in CDKN2A mutations for the four features across continents is consistent with the lower melanoma incidence rates in Europe and higher rates of sporadic melanoma in Australia.

Alterations of its product have been observed in various malignancies, including non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We earlier investigated the mechanisms underlying p16(INK4A) inactivation. In the present study, we examined, in a series of 87 NSCLCs, its relationship with the kinetic parameters [proliferation index (PI) and apoptotic index (Al)] and the ploidy status of the tumors. In addition, we extended our previous LOH analysis of the 9p21-23 region by examining flanking areas of p16(INK4A). Aberrant p16 expression was observed in 41.4% of the carcinomas. A significant association was found with increased PI (p = 0.037), but not with apoptosis. Aneuploid tumors were more frequently correlated with abnormal p16 staining (p = 0. 05). A high frequency of allelic imbalance (Alm) was noticed at the D9S161 (51.3%) and D9S157 (64.5%) loci, which lie approximately 4cM centromeric and 7cM telomeric, respectively, to CDKN2A. Abnormal p16(INK4A) expression was strongly correlated with Alm at D9S161 (p = 0.004). Allelic losses at D9S157 occurred more frequently in early stages (p = 0.018) and were significantly associated with deletions at D9S161 (p = 0.035). We conclude that, in a sub-set of NSCLCs, (i) abnormal p16 expression contributes to tumor growth mainly by increasing the proliferative activity in the initial stages of carcinogenesis; (ii) the association with aneuploidy merely reflects the impact of aberrant p16 on proliferative activity; and (iii) other putative TSGs possibly reside within the 9p21-23 region that possibly co-operate in certain cases with CDKN2A in the development of NSCLCs.",

Exome sequencing and array CGH were performed on available samples followed by detailed genetic analysis of the entire sHGG cohort. Clinical and outcome data of genetically distinct subgroups were obtained.;sHGG was observed in 2.9% of PLGGs (26 of 886 patients). Patients with sHGG had a high frequency of nonsilent somatic mutations compared with patients with primary pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG; median, 25 mutations per exome; P = .0042). Alterations in chromatin-modifying genes and telomere-maintenance pathways were commonly observed, whereas no sHGG harbored the BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion.

Utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (MethyLight), we measured DNA methylation in a panel of 5 CIMP-specific gene promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, MLH1, and NEUROG1) in 459 colorectal carcinomas obtained from 2 large prospective cohort studies. CIMP was defined as tumors that showed methylation in >or=4/5 promoters. CIMP was significantly associated with the presence of mucinous or signet ring cell morphology, marked Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, marked peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, tumor necrosis, tumor cell sheeting, and poor differentiation. All these features have previously been associated with microsatellite instability (MSI). Therefore, we divided the 459 colorectal carcinomas into 6 subtypes, namely, MSI-high (MSI-H)/CIMP, MSI-H/non-CIMP, MSI-low (MSI-L)/CIMP, MSI-L/non-CIMP, microsatellite stable/CIMP, and micro satellite sstable/non-CIMP.

G101W is the most common CDKN2A missense mutation identified to date. It has been reported in several families from around the world, with a particularly high occurrence in France and Italy. Given the frequency of this mutation, we were interested in determining whether the mutation resulted from a single origin or represented a mutational hotspot in the CDKN2A gene. In addition, given the geographical distribution of the mutation, we examined the date of origination of the mutation and its migratory spread. We examined 10 families from Italy, 4 families from the United States, and 6 families from France with the G101W mutation. The following eight markers were employed for the haplotype analysis: IFNA, D9S736, D9S1749, D9S942, D9S1748, D9S1604, D9S171, and D9S126. Our findings showed no significant evidence for mutational heterogeneity, suggesting that all studied families derived from a single ancestral haplotype on which the mutation arose. Using maximum-likelihood methods, we estimated the mutation to have arisen 97 generations ago (1-LOD-unit support interval 70-133 generations) providing some explanation for the wide geographical spread of this common mutation, particularly in southwestern Europe. The presence of a founder mutation in a defined geographic area can facilitate carrier detection and genetic counseling and can provide an opportunity to study disease penetrance and the effect of environmental factors on the background of a common genetic susceptibility.",

For the rat p16 gene, its 5' region has not been cloned, and it is uncertain whether surrogate use of exon 1 alpha is adequate for analysis of p16 silencing. In this study, we observed that methylation analysis of exon 1 alpha gave false positive results in three samples of normal rat mammary epithelia and in two of six primary mammary carcinomas. Therefore, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' region of the rat p16 gene. To confirm that methylation status of the 5' region is correlated with p16 expression, the methylation status was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR in three samples of normal mammary glands, six samples of mammary carcinomas and four cell lines. The 5' region was demethylated in all of the three normal and six carcinoma samples that fully expressed p16. On the other hand, the 5' region was highly methylated in the 3Y1 cell line, which lacked p16 expression, but without deletion. These results showed that the methylation status of the 5' region was more closely correlated with p16 expression than that of the exon 1 alpha and analysis of the methylation status is useful in examining p16 silencing in various rat tumors.",

Given that large deletions involving CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) account for only 2% of cases, we describe a family that highlights the co-occurrence of both melanoma and neural system tumours to aid clinical recognition and propose a management strategy. A patient with multiple neurofibromas was referred with a provisional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior molecular testing, though, had failed to identify an NF1 mutation by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. His family history was significant for multiple in situ/malignant melanomas at young ages and several different cancers reminiscent of an underlying syndrome. A search of the Familial Cancer Database, FaCD Online, highlighted several families with cutaneous melanoma and nervous system tumours who were subsequently identified to have large deletions spanning CDKN2A. Although sequencing of CDKN2A and TP53 failed to identify a mutation, a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion was identified by targeted array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH and SNP analysis identified an interstitial deletion of at least 1.5 Mb within 9p21.3 and spanning approximately 25 genes. Identification of the underlying molecular abnormality permits predictive testing for at-risk relatives. Given the young cancer diagnoses, a surveillance regimen was developed and a clinical team organised for ongoing management so that genetic testing could be offered to both adults and minor children. Surveillance recommendations addressed cancer risks associated with FAMMM, and other cancers exhibited by this family with a large contiguous gene deletion.",

These IL-10(+)CD8(+) T cells possessed a strong inhibitory effect on the CD4(+) T cell proliferation in an IL-10-dependent and cell contact-dependent fashion. In comparison with IL-10(-)CD8(+) T cells, IL-10(+)CD8(+) T cells expressed an array of Th2-like cytokines (IL-4, IL-5), perforin, and granzymes, as well as the cell cycle regulatory protein Cdkn2a. Interestingly, knockdown of cdkn2a using siRNA reduced IL-4-induced IL-10 production significantly. Furthermore, CD8(+) T cells from Cdkn2a(-/-) mice produced a significantly lower amount of IL-10, and the effect was limited to CD8(+) T cells but not observed in CD4(+) T cells and APCs. Finally, IL-10(+)CD8(+) T cells played a protective role in the TNBS-induced murine colitis model, indicating a critical role of this population of CD8(+) T cells in regulatory immune responses.

Genes that determine nevus expression may therefore act as low penetrance melanoma susceptibility genes. Rare germline mutations in CDKN2A predispose to melanoma and appear to be nevogenic, although the correlation between nevus phenotype and mutation status is poor. It is plausible that more common CDKN2A variants may influence both melanoma susceptibility and nevus susceptibility. Ala148Thr is a G to A missense polymorphism of CDKN2A, which is found in 4%-6% of the general population. We have investigated the role of Ala148Thr as a low penetrance melanoma or nevus susceptibility allele in two separate groups of individuals. The first was a sample of 488 adults recruited from 179 families of patients with the atypical nevus phenotype and/or a family history of melanoma, and the second was a population-based sample of 599 women. Similar prevalences of Ala148Thr (4.9% and 5.2%) were found in both samples but significant variation in the prevalence of the polymorphism was seen across geographic areas within England. There was no association between Ala148Thr status and nevus number or history of melanoma, and therefore the results did not support the hypothesis that the Ala148Thr variant is a low penetrance melanoma or nevus susceptibility allele. A significant protective role of Ala148Thr on the number of atypical nevi was observed in the family sample (mean of 1 atypical nevus in those with the allele and 3.5 nevi in those without, p = 0.02). After allowing for potential confounders this was not evident in the population-based sample.",

Losses and gains of loci at 112 unique human genome sites were interrogated using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MLPA).;Cytogenetic alterations in the four benign progenitors that persisted in the CIS and invasive cell lines corresponded to gains and losses of genes by MLPA. MCF-10MS had only normal gene copies. The untransformed MCF-10A had cytogenetic gain of 5q13-qter with corresponding gains of the IL3, IL4 and IL12B genes at 5q31-q33; gain of distal 19q12-qter was reflected in gains in KLK3 and BAX gene loci at 19q13-q13.4.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping by hybridization was employed in 100 cases. qRT-PCR for p14ARF and p53 transcript assessment was performed in 16 cases. All results were correlated with clinicopathological variables.;Immunohistochemistry analysis showed p14ARF and p53 positivity in 16.4% and 53% cases respectively. Positive p14ARF expression was significantly associated with the following variables: shorter cancer-specific survival (P=0.04) and shorter disease-free survival (P=0.02), presence of perineural invasion (P=0.037), vascular invasion (P=0.047), and node metastasis (P=0.031). Also, p14ARF-positive HPV-negative cases had the shortest cancer-specific survival (P=0.03) and disease-free survival (P=0.04). HPV infection was detected in 32.8% of the cases; HPV16 was the most prevalent type. Viral infection was more common in poorly differentiated tumors (P=0.032). qRT-PCR demonstrated that CDKN2A (p14ARF) had higher expression in tumor samples compared with paired noncancerous samples (P<0.001). The opposite relationship was seen in TP53 expression evaluation (P<0.001). FISH demonstrated 4 cases with deleted TP53 (6.3%).;p14ARF represents an important marker of poor prognosis in VSCC. p53 and HPV infection did not show any prognostic importance. Further clinical trials concerning p14ARF positivity may result in important contributions due to its relationship with poor outcome. Mainly due to the relationship of p14ARF with lymph node metastasis, the immunohistochemistry evaluation of this marker may help to identify a subset of patients more suitable to less radical procedures.",

In hereditary melanoma, germline CDKN2A mutations have been reproducibly identified in melanoma-prone kindreds worldwide.

To address this challenge, we developed and validated MelaPRO, an algorithm that provides germline CDKN2A mutation probabilities and melanoma risk to individuals from melanoma-prone families. MelaPRO builds on comprehensive genetic information, and uses Mendelian modeling to provide fine resolution and high accuracy. In an independent validation of 195 individuals from 167 families, MelaPRO exhibited good discrimination with a concordance index (C) of 0.86 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 0.75-0.97] and good calibration, with no significant difference between observed and predicted carriers (26; 95% CI, 20-35, as compared with 22 observed). In cross-validation, MelaPRO outperformed the existing predictive model MELPREDICT (C, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93), with a difference of 0.05 (95% CI, 0.007-0.17).

Therefore, we compared 2 age- and gender-matched groups of GBM patients with different post-operative time to tumor progression (TTP), defined as 'short-term' for TTP of less than 6 months (n = 21), and 'long-term' for TTP of more than 24 months (n = 21) for genetic alterations of the PTEN, CDKN2A and TP53 genes as well as overexpression of the EGFR, p53 and Mdm2 proteins.

In addition to CDKN2A, the major known high-risk susceptibility gene for CMM, recent studies suggest that other 9p21 genes may be involved in melanoma/nevi development. To identify 9p21 variants that influence susceptibility to CMM and number of nevi in CMM-prone families with and without CDKN2A mutations, we analyzed 562 individuals (183 CMM) from 53 families (23 CDKN2A+, 30 CDKN2A-) for 233 tagging SNPs in 21 genes at 9p21. Single SNP- and gene-based regression analyses were used to assess the risk of CMM, nevi count, skin complexion, and tanning ability associated with these SNPs and genes. We found that SNP rs7023329 in the MTAP gene was associated with number of nevi (P (trend) = 0.003) confirming a recent finding by a genome-wide association study. In addition, three SNPs in the ACO1 gene, rs7855483 (P (trend) = 0.002), rs17288067 (P (trend) = 0.0009), and rs10813813 (P (trend) = 0.005), showed the strongest associations with CMM risk. None of the examined 9p21 SNPs was associated with skin complexion, whereas two SNPs, rs10964862 in IFNW1 (P (trend) = 0.003), and rs13290968 in TUSC1 (P (trend) = 0.0006), were associated with tanning ability. Gene-based analyses suggested that the ACO1 gene was significantly associated with CMM (P = 0.0004); genes IFNW1 (P = 0.002) and ACO1 (P = 0.0002) were significantly associated with tanning ability. Our findings are consistent with recent proposals that additional 9p21 genes may contribute to CMM susceptibility in CMM-prone families. These genetic variants may, at least partially, exert their effects through nevi and tanning ability.",

Twenty out of 75 (26.6%) tumours showed LOH in at least one of the five primers employed. Most allelic deletions were detected, telomeric to the CDKN2A region at D9S916, with 11 out of 52 informative tumours (21%) displaying LOH. The LOH in the coding region of CDKN2A, at D9S974 and D9S942, was associated with a higher pT-stage (p = 0.004) and metastasis (p = 0.006, both markers). The rate of chromosome 9p deletion in ccRCC was 44% (35/80 cases) according to FISH. Somatic copy number loss of chromosome 9p was associated with a larger tumour size (p = 0.002), higher pathological tumour stage (p = 0.021), presence of tumour necrosis (p = 0.019) and microvascular invasion (p = 0.032). The cases with copy number loss, loss of heterozygosity and copy number neutral (n = 42) were at a higher risk of cancer-specific death when compared to tumours in category D (n = 32) (Log-rank: p = 0.001). Seventeen patients with localised ccRCC developed recurrence, and fourteen of those showed either LOH or somatic copy number loss at CDKN2A (Log-rank: p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that LOH or copy number loss at CDKN2A retained its independent prognostic effect, improving the predictive accuracy of stage and SSIGN score by concordance Index C from 0.823 to 0.878 (p = 0.001).;Cytogenetics data, microsatellite analysis and FISH were acquired for a cohort of patients undergoing resection for clinically localised renal cancer between January 2001 and December 2005. Five microsatellite markers (D9S916, D9S1814, D9S974, D9S942 and D9S171) assessed loss of heterogeneity (LOH) using DNA samples and in the same cohort FISH analysis was accomplished on tissue microarray slides. The FISH data were scored by two observers blinded to the histological data of the patients. Cytogenetic aberrations were correlated with histological and clinical outcomes by univariate and multivariate analyses using different prognostic models. Disease specific and recurrence free survival based on cytogenetic changes were assessed by Kaplan Meier methods.;A comprehensive cytogenetic analysis using microsatellite analysis and FISH of the CDKN2A region on chromosome 9p improves the predictive accuracy of known prognostic factors in clinically localised renal cell carcinoma undergoing surgical resection.",

To do so, we compared genetic profiles between EGFR mutated adenocarcinomas (ADC) and KRAS mutated ADC from 24 women with localized lung cancer.;Patterns of alterations were different between EGFR and KRAS mutated tumors and specific chromosomes alterations were linked to the EGFR mutated group. Indeed chromosome regions 14q21.3 (p = 0.027), 7p21.3-p21.2 (p = 0.032), 7p21.3 (p = 0.042) and 7p21.2-7p15.3 (p = 0.043) were found significantly amplified in EGFR mutated tumors. Within those regions 3 genes are of special interest ITGB8, HDAC9 and TWIST1. Moreover, homozygous deletions at CDKN2A and LOH at RB1 were identified in EGFR mutated tumors. We therefore tested the existence of a link between EGFR mutation, CDKN2A homozygous deletion and cyclin amplification in a larger series of tumors. Indeed, in a series of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (n = 98) we showed that homozygous deletions at CDKN2A were linked to EGFR mutations and absence of smoking whereas cyclin amplifications (CCNE1 and CCND1) were associated to TP53 mutations and smoking habit.;All together, our results show that genome wide patterns of alteration differ between EGFR and KRAS mutated lung ADC, describe two models of oncogenic cooperation involving either EGFR mutation and CDKN2A deletion or cyclin amplification and TP53 inactivating mutations and identified new chromosome regions at 7p and 14q associated to EGFR mutations in lung cancer.",

Quantitative RT-PCR in human endarteryectomy specimens (n = 57) revealed increased p16(INK4a) and decreased MTAP expression in macrophage-rich lesions (P<0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively). Functional studies suggest that decreased MTAP expression in macrophage-rich lesions might be mediated through down-regulation by TNF-alpha. No clear association of p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), and MTAP expression in plaque tissue with Chr9p21 haplotypes was found. The latter finding was corroborated by the lack of correlation of RNA expression of 9p21-regulated transcripts EU741058 and NR_003529 of antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) with mRNA expression of these genes. In contrast, ANRIL DQ485454 which is not genetically determined by the 9p21 genotype was significantly correlated with MTAP expression (P = 0.01).;CDKN2B (p15(INK4b)), CDKN2A (p16(INK4a), p14(ARF)), and MTAP are abundantly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions.

The CDKN2A locus, which houses the INK4a and ARF tumor suppressor genes, is frequently altered in NSCLC. However, the specific role of ARF in pulmonary tumorigenesis remains unclear. KRAS and other oncogenes induce the expression of ARF, thus stabilizing p53 activity and arresting cell proliferation. To address the role of ARF in Kras-driven NSCLC, we compared the susceptibility of NIH/Ola strain wild-type and Arf-knockout mice to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Lung tumor size, malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in Arf(-/-) compared with Arf(+/+) animals at 25 weeks after induction. Pulmonary tumors from Arf-knockout mice exhibited increased cell proliferation and DNA damage compared with wild-type mice. A subgroup of tumors in Arf(-/-) animals presented as dedifferentiated and metastatic, with many characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, a neoplasm previously undocumented in mouse models. Our finding of a role for ARF in NSCLC is consistent with the observation that benign adenomas from Arf(+/+) mice robustly expressed ARF, while ARF expression was markedly reduced in malignant adenocarcinomas. ARF expression also frequently colocalized with the expression of p21(CIP1), a transcriptional target of p53, arguing that ARF induces the p53 checkpoint to arrest cell proliferation in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that induction of ARF is an early response in lung tumorigenesis that mounts a strong barrier against tumor growth and malignant progression. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"In urothelial cancer, hypermethylation of specific genes and genome-wide hypomethylation, reflected in decreased methylation of LINE-1 retrotransposons, have both been reported, but were never investigated in the same specimens. We analyzed hypermethylation of six genes by methylation-specific PCR and LINE-1 hypomethylation by Southern blotting in 96 carcinoma tissues. Hypermethylation frequencies were: SFRP1 (55%), APC (45%), RASSF1A (35%), DAPK1 (29%), RARB2 (19%), and CDKN2A (2%). Three groups of cancers could be discerned, with escalating hypermethylation. Hypermethylation increased with tumor stage, particularly at the transition to invasive cancers, and RARB2 hypermethylation was indicative of lymph node involvement. A comparison to a previous study on prostate cancer using the same techniques suggests that hypermethylation in urothelial carcinoma occurs in a random rather than coordinated manner. LINE-1 hypomethylation was present in 90% of specimens, largely independent of hypermethylation. Lack of hypomethylation indicated a significantly better clinical prognosis. Bisulfite sequencing of SFRP1 demonstrated dense or patchy hypermethylation in tumor tissues that likely accounts for discrepant reported frequencies. In urothelial carcinoma cell lines, the same genes as in tissues were frequently hypermethylated. SFRP1 hypermethylation was concordant with lack of expression. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine induced its reexpression in some lines, whereas additional treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor was required in others. Thus, epigenetic SFRP1 inactivation occurs in a graduated manner. In conclusion, markers of genome-wide hypomethylation seem optimally suited for urothelial carcinoma detection, whereas combinations of hypermethylation and hypomethylation assays hold promise for classification.",

The tumor was a de novo presentation of this aggressive form of lymphoma. The disease demonstrated an aggressive course with only transient improvement of skin lesions after chemotherapy. Punch biopsy taken from a left arm skin lesion showed a diffuse and nodular large cell lymphocytic infiltrate in the 15-20 μm range exhibiting round to oval nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Phenotypically, the tumor cells were CD10, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, and CD43 positive with a residuum of a follicular dendritic cell network revealed by CD21 staining. There was c-MYC rearrangement and CDKN2A deletion in this sample. The importance in reporting this case is to emphasize that in the context of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, the 9p21 deletion while characteristic of the leg-type lymphoma is not a unique signature of the leg-type lymphoma and is not exclusionary to lymphomas falling under the designation of follicle center lymphoma. As with the leg-type lymphoma, however, this cytogenetic abnormality is a critical determinant to a more aggressive clinical course.",

Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 and CDK4/6 by p21 leads to dephosphorylation and activation of Rb. We now show that ectopic p21 expression in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells causes not only dephosphorylation but also depletion of Rb; this effect was p53-independent and susceptible to a proteasome inhibitor. CDK inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B) also caused Rb dephosphorylation and depletion, but another CDK inhibitor p16 (CDKN2A) induced only dephosphorylation but not depletion of Rb. Rb depletion was observed in both HT1080 and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, where p21 was induced by DNA-damaging agents. Rb depletion after DNA damage did not occur in the absence of p21, and it was reduced when p21 induction was inhibited by p21-targeting short hairpin RNA or by a transdominant inhibitor of p53. These results indicate that p21 both activates Rb through dephosphorylation and inactivates it through degradation, suggesting negative feedback regulation of damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoint arrest.",

Arsenic trioxide has been successfully used to treat malignant, hematopoietic diseases and is known to act by induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cellular proliferation. However, arsenic trioxide has been recently reported to act via inhibition of DNA hypermethylation in some solid tumors. The goal of this study was to explore the mechanism of arsenic trioxide induced demethylation of the CDKN2B and CDKN2A promoters in the hematologic malignant cell lines Molt4, MUTZ-1, U937, U266 and CA46. We used bisulphate modification and nested-methylation specific PCR to determine the levels of methylated and unmethylated promoter sequences in untreated and As2O3-treated cells. We used semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting to quantify CDKN2B and CDKN2A mRNA and protein levels, respectively. We measured DNMT activity in nuclear extracts of untreated and treated cells using radiolabeled SAM as a methyl donor. The CDKN2B promoter was hypermethylated in Molt4 and MUTZ-1 cells, while the CDKN2A promoter was hypermethylated in U937, U266 and CA46 cells. As2O3 treatment caused demethylation associated with an increase in mRNA levels of the CDKN2B and CDKN2A genes. We also demonstrated a concomitant inhibition in DNMT activity and DNMT mRNA levels in As2O3-treated cells. In summary, As2O3 restored expression levels of tumor suppressor genes in hematologic malignant cells by causing promoter demethylation along with an inhibition of DNMTs 1, 3a and 3b.",

A series of molecular changes including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p (TP53 gene), 13q (RB gene), 18q (DCC gene), and 9p21 (CDKN2a gene) chromosomal regions have been identified in dysplasias, carcinomas in situ, and invasive carcinomas of the gallbladder, whereas mutations in K- and N-ras genes are rare. To determine whether the molecular abnormalities of adenomas are similar to those found in carcinomas, we obtained extracted DNA from precisely microdissected tissue from 16 gallbladder adenomas (14 pyloric and 2 intestinal-type). We determined the presence of mutations in TP53, K- and N-ras genes, and LOH at five chromosomal regions (5q22 APC-MCC region, RB, TP53, DCC and 9p21-CDKN2a). For the TP53 mutation study, single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in exons 4 to 8 were performed. K- and N-ras mutations detection was performed by designed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method and sequencing. Only a single LOH (at 5q22) was detected in a gallbladder adenoma of intestinal type. No mutations at the TP53 were detected. Four adenomas (25%) showed K-ras mutations (two in codon 12 and two in codon 61). We conclude that gallbladder adenoma lacks the molecular changes frequently detected in dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma of the gallbladder. Likewise the occurrence of K-ras mutations at codon 12 and 61 in 25% of adenomas strongly suggests that these lesions are not precursors of invasive gallbladder carcinoma.",

We screened a cohort of 128 patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma meeting the definition of CUP. Massive parallel multigene sequencing of 50 genes, which had been selected due to their relevance as oncogenic drivers or druggable molecular targets could ultimately be performed on samples from 55 patients for whom complete clinical datasets were also available. Overall, 60 tumor-specific mutations and 29 amplifications/deletions, as revealed by coverage analysis, were detected in 46 cases (84%). The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (30 cases, 55%), KRAS (9 cases, 16%), CDKN2A (5 cases, 9%), and SMAD4 (5 cases, 9%). The most frequently deleted gene was CDKN2A (8 cases, 15%). KRAS and CDKN2A mutations significantly correlated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and, in case of KRAS, overall survival (OS).

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly malignancy characterized at the epigenetic level by global DNA hypomethylation and focal hypermethylation on the promoter of tumor suppressor genes. In most cases it develops on a background of liver steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a second-generation hypomethylating agent, which inhibits DNA methyltransferases. Guadecitabine is formulated as a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine that is resistant to cytidine deaminase (CDA) degradation and results in prolonged in vivo exposure to decitabine following small volume subcutaneous administration of guadecitabine. Here we found that guadecitabine is an effective demethylating agent and is able to prevent HCC progression in pre-clinical models. In a xenograft HCC HepG2 model, guadecitabine impeded tumor growth and inhibited angiogenesis, while it could not prevent liver fibrosis and inflammation in a mouse model of steatohepatitis. Demethylating efficacy of guadecitabine on LINE-1 elements was found to be the highest 8 d post-infusion in blood samples of mice. Analysis of a panel of human HCC vs. normal tissue revealed a signature of hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes (CDKN1A, CDKN2A, DLEC1, E2F1, GSTP1, OPCML, E2F1, RASSF1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) as detected by methylation-specific PCR. A pronounced demethylating effect of guadecitabine was obtained also in the promoters of a subset of tumor suppressors genes (CDKN2A, DLEC1, and RUNX3) in HepG2 and Huh-7 HCC cells. Finally, we analyzed the role of macroH2A1, a variant of histone H2A, an oncogene upregulated in human cirrhosis/HCC that synergizes with DNA methylation in suppressing tumor suppressor genes, and it prevents the inhibition of cell growth triggered by decitabine in HCC cells. Guadecitabine, in contrast to decitabine, blocked growth in HCC cells overexpressing macroH2A1 histones and with high CDA levels, despite being unable to fully demethylate CDKN2A, RUNX3, and DLEC1 promoters altered by macroH2A1. Collectively, our findings in human and mice models reveal novel epigenetic anti-HCC effects of guadecitabine, which might be effective specifically in advanced states of the disease.",

Computational models are perhaps the most tractable and can be used both to interpret data and to develop intuitions and hypotheses for neoplastic progression. Tissue culture models include squamous cell lines, Barrett's oesophagus cell lines and OAC cell lines, although it was recognized recently that BIC-1, SEG-1 and TE-7 are not true OAC cell lines. Some of the unrealistic aspects of the micro-environment in two-dimensional tissue culture may be overcome with the development of three-dimensional organotypic cultures of Barrett's oesophagus. The most realistic, but least tractable, model is a canine surgical model that generates reflux and leads to an intestinal metaplasia. Alternatively, rat surgical models have gained popularity and should be tested for the common genetic features of Barrett's oesophagus neoplastic progression in humans including loss of CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and TP53 (tumour protein 53), generation of aneuploidy and realistic levels of genetic diversity.

In an effort to improve diagnostic accuracy, we set out to determine if an immunohistochemical panel of molecular markers could reproduce consensus subtype assignment. Immunohistochemical expression of 22 biomarkers were examined on tissue microarrays constructed from 322 archival ovarian carcinoma samples from the British Columbia Cancer Agency archives, for the period between 1984 and 2000, and an independent set of 242 cases of ovarian carcinoma from the Gynaecologic Tissue Bank at Vancouver General Hospital from 2001 to 2008. Nominal logistic regression was used to produce a subtype prediction model for each of these sets of cases. These models were then cross-validated against the other cohort, and then both models were further validated in an independent cohort of 81 ovarian carcinoma samples from five different centers. Starting with data for 22 markers, full model fit, backwards, nominal logistic regression identified the same nine markers (CDKN2A, DKK1, HNF1B, MDM2, PGR, TFF3, TP53, VIM, WT1) as being most predictive of ovarian carcinoma subtype in both the archival and tumor bank cohorts. These models were able to predict subtype in the respective cohort in which they were developed with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity (κ statistics of 0.88±0.02 and 0.86±0.04, respectively). When the models were cross-validated (ie using the model developed in one case series to predict subtype in the other series), the prediction equation's performances were reduced (κ statistics of 0.70±0.04 and 0.61±0.04, respectively) due to differences in frequency of expression of some biomarkers in the two case series. Both models were then validated on the independent series of 81 cases, with very good to excellent ability to predict subtype (κ=0.85±0.06 and 0.78±0.07, respectively). A nine-marker immunohistochemical maker panel can be used to objectively support classification into one of the five major subtypes of ovarian carcinoma.",

As this mutation occurs in the first exon of INK4a (exon 1alpha), it has no effect on the primary sequence of p14(ARF). Based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses, the R24P variant is specifically defective for binding to CDK4 but remains able to associate with CDK6. Nevertheless, Milan HDFs behave as if they are p16INK4a deficient, in terms of sensitivity to spontaneous and oncogene-induced senescence, and the R24P variant has little effect on proliferation when ectopically expressed in normal fibroblasts. It can, however, impair the proliferation of U20S cells, presumably because they express more CDK6 than primary fibroblasts.

Moreover, of 17 patients whose tumors displayed allelic imbalance at CDKN2A, 14 preferentially retained the risk allele and lost the protective allele (PBinomial = 0.006), suggesting that the risk allele provides a selective advantage during tumor growth. Notably, the CDKN2A variant was not significantly associated with melanoma, glioblastoma, or pancreatic cancer risk, implying that this polymorphism specifically confers ALL risk but not general cancer risk. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that coding polymorphisms of large effect can underlie GWAS \"hits\" and that inherited polymorphisms may undergo directional selection during clonal expansion of tumors.",

Immunoexpression of p16(Ink4a) following exposure to other hepatocarcinogens/promoters and its DNA methylation status were also analyzed during early and late tumor-promotion stages. GST-P(+) liver cell foci increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis when compared with surrounding liver cells. In concordance with GST-P(+) foci, checkpoint proteins at G(1)/S (p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p16(Ink4a)) and G(2)/M (phospho-checkpoint kinase 1, Cdc25c and phospho-Wee1) were either up- or downregulated. Cellular distribution within GST-P(+) foci was either increased or decreased with proteins related to G(2)-M phase or DNA damage (topoisomerase IIα, phospho-histone H2AX, phospho-histone H3 and Cdc2). In particular, p16(Ink4a) typically downregulated in GST-P(+) foci and regenerative nodules at early tumor-promotion stage with hepatocarcinogens facilitating liver cell regeneration and in neoplastic lesions at late tumor-promotion stage with hepatocarcinogens/promoters irrespective of regenerating potential. Hypermethylation at exon 2 of Cdkn2a was detected at both early- and late-stages. Thus, diverse disruptive expression of G(1)/S and G(2)/M proteins, which allows for clonal selection of GST-P(+) foci, results in the acquisition of multiple aberrant phenotypes to disrupt checkpoint function. Moreover, increased DNA-damage responses within GST-P(+) foci may be the signature of genetic alterations. Intraexonic hypermethylation may be responsible for p16(Ink4a)-downregulation, which facilitates cell cycle progression in early preneoplastic lesions produced by repeated cell regeneration and late-stage neoplastic lesions irrespective of the carcinogenic mechanism.",

To address the roles of MET and CDKN2A (p16INK4A/p14ARF) in human RMS, we performed mutational analyses in 39 samples of RMS by PCR-SSCP. No mutations were detected in exons 14-21 of MET whereas a nonsense mutation at codon 80 of p16(INK4A) was identified in an alveolar RMS cell line. We also quantified the relative expression levels and DNA copy numbers of these genes in seven cell lines and 17 fresh tumors by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of MET was detected in all samples; however, more than 10-fold difference was found in the samples with higher or lower expression level, despite a normal DNA copy number. The protein expression level was consistent with that of mRNA, and in cell lines with a higher expression level, MET was constitutively activated. Notably, the expression level of MET was significantly higher in patients who died (P = 0.02), in patients with stage IV (P = 0.04), as well as in patients with PAX3-FKHR chimeric transcript (P = 0.04).

Some ovarian carcinoma subtypes do not respond well to standard chemotherapy, making accurate subtype diagnosis before starting therapy important. This diagnosis is frequently based on omental biopsy specimens. In particular, with very small biopsies, immunostaining for diagnostic biomarkers may be needed. To assess intratumoral heterogeneity of biomarker expression in pelvic high-grade serous carcinoma, we compared the expression of a set of 10 biomarkers between ovarian and omental sites. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 123 high-grade serous carcinomas with paired ovarian and omental tumor samples. These samples were stained with biomarkers that have been used in ovarian carcinoma subtype diagnosis (WT1, TP53/p53, MUC16/CA125, CDKN2A/p16), and with biomarkers of the tumor microenvironment (CD8, CD163, SPARC, PDGFRB), cell adhesion (CDH1/E-Cadherin), and proliferation (Ki67) as well. Expression frequencies in samples from the 2 sites were compared, as was concordance at the 2 sites for individual tumors. The 2 markers of desmoplastic stromal response (PDGFRB, SPARC) were more frequently expressed in the omentum compared with the ovary (P<0.001; McNemar test). The other 8 markers did not show a significant difference in the frequency of expression between sites. Within individual cases, some markers such as Ki67 and CDKN2A showed variability, indicating that these markers are affected by intratumoral heterogeneity. The intratumoral variability for MUC16, TP53, and WT1 was modest. Commonly used diagnostic markers, such as TP53 and WT1, show little variability between ovarian and omental sites, suggesting that they can be successfully used in small biopsy specimens from extraovarian sites. In contrast, markers of host stromal response do vary between sites, suggesting a biologic difference of the microenvironment at different sites that should be taken into account when tissue-based research is carried out.",

This gene also encodes a second protein product (human p16beta, murine p19ARF), which originates from an unrelated exon of CDKN2A (exon 1beta) spliced onto exon 2 in an alternate reading frame. Cell cycle arrest by p16beta is caused by an as yet unidentified pathway. In order to test the candidacy of p16beta as a glioma suppressor, we replaced p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b) and p16beta wild-type as well as a series of seven glioma-derived p16beta alleles (R87H, A112V, R120H, A121V, G125R, A128A and A128V), into glioma cell lines that had either CDKN2A-/RB+ (U-87MG and U-251MG) or CDKN2A+/RB- (LN-319) endogenous backgrounds and demonstrated that p16beta can act as a functional glioma cell growth suppressor. Moreover, p16beta, but not p16(INK4a) or p15(INK4b) inhibited the growth of RB-negative LN-319 cells, indicating that p16beta likely exerts its effects through an RB-independent pathway. In vitro and in vivo assays of pRB phosphorylation were consistent with this interpretation. Since none of the glioma-derived p16beta mutations inactivated their growth suppressive activities, it appears that mutations in CDKN2A exon 2 (which is shared in the coding sequences of p16(INK4a) and p16beta) likely exclusively target p16(INK4a).",

Here we report that in melanoma cell lines which do not express p16, or express a mutant p16, no G2 delay is observed in response to UV. The loss of functional p16 also correlates with an increase in DNA damage as judged by increased numbers of bi- and multinuclear cells and cells containing 1-2 micronuclei following UV irradiation.

The canonical function of PRC2 is the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine residue 27. This epigenetic modification is associated with gene silencing. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions have been reported for PRC2, depending on cellular context. In leukemia mediated by the leukemogenic fusion MLL-AF9, complete ablation of canonical PRC2 function by genetic inactivation of the core component embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) or by combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PRC2 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 has a strong anti-leukemic effect, and this effect has been linked to de-repression of the PRC2 target locus Cdkn2a. We asked whether inactivation of Cdkn2a is sufficient to restore leukemic activity of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 leukemia cells, using combined genetic inactivation of Cdkn2a and Eed. We found that Cdkn2a inactivation partially rescues in vitro and in vivo growth of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 cells. However, the growth of Eed-null Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9 cells in the absence of Cdkn2a remained severely compromised in vitro and in vivo, compared with that of their Eed-floxed Cdkn2a-null counterparts. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that several genes previously implicated in inefficient growth of MLL-AF9-transformed cells, including Gata2, Egr1, and Cdkn2b were de-repressed as a consequence of Eed inactivation. Furthermore, we found that direct binding targets of MLL fusion proteins are negatively enriched in Eed-inactivated Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9-transformed cells. Our data indicate that interference with PRC2 function affects MLL-AF9-mediated leukemogenesis by both Cdkn2a-dependent and Cdkn2a-independent mechanisms.",

The specific role of MTAP in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma subgroups, mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS), is unknown. In 213 skin samples from patients with MF/SS, MTAP copy number loss (34%) was more frequent than CDKN2A (12%) in all cutaneous T-cell lymphoma stages using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Importantly, in early stage MF, MTAP loss occurred independently of CDKN2A loss in 37% of samples. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with SS, codeletion with CDKN2A occurred in 18% of samples but loss of MTAP alone was uncommon. In CD4(+) cells from SS, reduced MTAP mRNA expression correlated with MTAP copy number loss (P < 0.01) but reduced MTAP expression was also detected in the absence of copy number loss. Deep sequencing of MTAP/CDKN2A-CDKN2B loci in 77 peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA samples from patients with SS did not show any nonsynonymous mutations, but read-depth analysis suggested focal deletions consistent with MTAP and CDKN2A copy number loss detected with quantitative reverse transcription PCR. In a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell line, promoter hypermethylation was shown to downregulate MTAP expression and may represent a mechanism of MTAP inactivation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that there may be selection in early stages of MF for MTAP deletion within the cutaneous tumor microenvironment. ",

Although the results showed overlapping of genomic alterations between the two subtypes, trends including more frequent KRAS alterations in pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma (61 vs 29%) and more frequent mutations in APC in intestinal-type ampullary carcinoma (43 vs 17%) were observed.

Those family members who also have the atypical mole syndrome are commonly targeted for screening in the belief that they are more likely to be mutant gene carriers. We have correlated the atypical mole syndrome phenotype and gene carrier status in five families with germline CDKN2A mutations and shown that family members with the atypical mole syndrome were three times more likely to be mutant gene carriers than their relatives who did not have the atypical mole syndrome (odds ratio 3.4; confidence interval 1.0-11. 1), supporting the view that CDKN2A is nevogenic. Individual characteristics which best predicted mutant gene carrier status were: nevi on the buttocks (odds ratio 4.4; confidence interval 1. 6-12.4), nevi on the feet (odds ratio 4.2; confidence interval 1. 4-12.5), total nevus number being at least 100 (nevi > or = 2 mm in diameter) (odds ratio 3.4; confidence interval 1.0-11.1) and two or more clinically atypical nevi (odds ratio 3.1; confidence interval 1. 1-9.0). Gene carriers were also significantly more likely to have noticeable freckling and possibly also Fitzpatrick skin types 1-3. The overlap between gene carriers and nongene carriers was, however, marked: the atypical mole syndrome did not clearly differentiate mutant gene carriers from those with a normal gene. This study is of significance to clinicians as the clinical practice of using the atypical mole syndrome to identify particular family members for surveillance is shown to be inappropriate. Until formal gene testing is available, all members of families with an excessive number of melanoma cases should be treated as potential mutation carriers at increased risk of melanoma.",

We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets. Given the relatively high costs of whole genome sequencing, we performed a focused genetic analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (Sequenom iPLEX genotyping). We tested 865 hotspot mutations in 111 oncogenes and selected tumor suppressor genes (OncoMap v. 3.0) of 45 human chordoma tumor samples. Of the analyzed samples, seven were identified with at least one mutation. Six of these were from fresh frozen samples, and one was from a paraffin embedded sample. These observations were validated using an independent platform using homogeneous mass extend MALDI-TOF (Sequenom hME Genotyping). These genetic alterations include: ALK (A877S), CTNNB1 (T41A), NRAS (Q61R), PIK3CA (E545K), PTEN (R130), CDKN2A (R58*), and SMARCB1 (R40*). This study reports on the largest comprehensive mutational analysis of chordomas performed to date. To focus on mutations that have the greatest chance of clinical relevance, we tested only oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that have been previously implicated in the tumorigenesis of more common malignancies. We identified rare genetic changes that may have functional significance to the underlying biology and potential therapeutics for chordomas. Mutations in CDKN2A and PTEN occurred in areas of chromosomal copy loss. When this data is paired with the studies showing 18 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at the locus for CDKN2A, 17 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at PTEN, and 3 of 4 chordoma samples displaying deletion at the SMARCB1 locus, we can infer that a loss of heterozygosity at these three loci may play a significant role in chordoma pathogenesis.

Glucocorticoid hormones, (DEX), enhance REF transformation by RAS and facilitates the isolation of transformed and immortal cell lines. We show that DEX induced cell proliferation is paralleled by a decrease in Cdkn2a gene transcripts, suggesting a mechanism for hormone promotion. The mechanisms of progression into hormone independent cell lines were examined. Twenty-two of 30 clones which reached a population size of approximately 10(6) cells could be established as cell lines. All lines studied showed homozygous deletions of the Cdkn2 loci (Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b) on RNO5. LOH was found for all RNO5 genetic markers examined in 7 of 19 cell lines, suggesting non-disjunction events. In the remaining 12 cell lines, both copies of Cdkn2 appeared to be lost by deletions/rearrangements, some of which could by demonstrated by karyotype analysis. We conclude that (i) clonal expansion of RAS-transfected REF by DEX is paralleled by down-regulation of Cdkn2a expression; (ii) homozygous deletion of Cdkn2 were estimated to occur at a frequency of 2 x 10(-8)/cell/generation or higher, and (iii) deletion/rearrangements and nondisjunction appear to be the main mechanisms leading to deletion of Cdkn2.",

The gene-specific and widespread methylation status among the carcinomas was related to patient gender and age, and microsatellite instability status. Possible CIMP tumors were identified by comparing the methylation profile with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF-, KRAS-, and TP53 mutation status.;The mean number of methylated genes per sample was 0.4 in normal colon mucosa from tumor-free individuals, 1.2 in mucosa from cancerous bowels, 2.2 in adenomas, and 3.9 in carcinomas. Widespread methylation was found in both adenomas and carcinomas. The promoters of ADAMTS1, MAL, and MGMT were frequently methylated in benign samples as well as in malignant tumors, independent of microsatellite instability. In contrast, normal mucosa samples taken from bowels without tumor were rarely methylated for the same genes. Hypermethylated CRABP1, MLH1, NR3C1, RUNX3, and SCGB3A1 were shown to be identifiers of carcinomas with microsatellite instability.

We developed a polymerase chain reaction assay to provide information regarding gains or losses of relevant genes and prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.;Two polymerase chain reaction assays (multiplex polymerase chain reaction of short fluorescent fragments, QMPSF) were designed to detect gains or losses of c-REL, BCL6, SIM1, PTPRK, MYC, CDKN2A, MDM2, CDKN1B, TP53 and BCL2. Array comparative genomic hybridization was simultaneously performed to evaluate the sensitivity and predictive value of the QMPSF assay. The biological and clinical relevance of this assay were assessed.;The predictive value of the QMPSF assay for detecting abnormal DNA copy numbers ranged between 88-97%, giving an overall concordance rate of 92% with comparative genomic hybridization results. In 77 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, gains of MYC, CDKN1B, c-REL and BCL2 were detected in 12%, 40%, 27% and 29%, respectively. TP53 and CDKN2A deletions were observed in 22% and 36% respectively. BCL2 and CDKN2A allelic status correlated with protein expression. TP53 mutations were associated with allelic deletions in 45% of cases. The prognostic value of a single QMPSF assay including TP53, MYC, CDKN2A, SIM1 and CDKN1B was predictive of the outcome independently of the germinal center B-cell like/non-germinal center B-cell like subtype or the International Prognostic Index.;QMPSF is a reliable and flexible method for detecting somatic quantitative genetic alterations in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and could be integrated in future prognostic predictive models.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is a multiple genetic disorder with many mutations identified during the progression. Two mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines were established which showed different phenotype in vivo: a non-metastatic cell line, Panc02, and a highly metastatic cell line, Panc02-H7, a derivative of Panc02. In order to investigate whether the genetic mutations of key genes in pancreatic cancer such as KRAS, TP53 (p53), CDKN2A (p16), SMAD4, ZIP4, and PDX-1 contribute to the phenotypic difference of these two mouse pancreatic cancer cells, we sequenced the exonic regions of these key genes in both cell lines and in the normal syngeneic mouse pancreas and compared them with the reference mouse genome sequence. The exons of KRAS, SMAD4, CDKN2A (p16), TP53 (p53), ZIP4, and PDX-1 genes were amplified and the genotype of these genes was determined by Sanger sequencing. The sequences were analyzed with Sequencher software. A mutation in SMAD4 was identified in both cell lines. This homozygote G to T mutation in the first position of codon 174 (GAA) generated a stop codon resulting in the translation of a truncated protein. Further functional analysis indicates that different TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways were involved in those two mouse cell lines, which may explain the phonotypic difference between the two cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KRAS gene (TAT to TAC at codon 32) was also identified in the normal pancreas DNA of the syngenic mouse and in both derived tumoral Panc02 and Panc02-H7 cells. No mutation or SNP was found in CDKN2A (p16), TP53 (p53), ZIP4, and PDX-1 genes in these two cell lines. The absence of mutations in genes such as KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A, which are considered as key genes in the development of human pancreatic cancer suggests that SMAD4 might play a central and decisive role in mouse pancreatic cancer. These results also suggest that other mechanisms are involved in the substantial phenotypic difference between these two mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular pathways that lead to the aggressive metastatic potential of Panc02-H7.",

The five tested lines-LS 180, Vaco 432, Colo 205, CX 1, and HCT 116-responded with differentiation and reduced proliferation to Gal-4 binding. In proteomic analysis (mass spectral data deposited with PRIDE, PXD003489), 2654 proteins were quantified, of which 190 were down-regulated and 115 were up-regulated (>2-fold). 1D annotation analysis of the results indicated down-regulation of DNA replication-associated processes, while protein presence for secretory and transport functions appeared increased. The strongest induction was found for CALB2 (calretinin; ∼24-fold), TGM2 (protein-glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase 2; ∼11-fold), S100A3 (∼10-fold), and GSN (gelsolin; 9.5-fold), and the most pronounced decreases were seen for CDKN2A (tumor suppressor ARF; ∼6-fold), EPCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule; ∼6-fold), UBE2C (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C; ∼5-fold), KIF2C (kinesin-like protein KIF2C; 5-fold), and LMNB1 (lamin-B1; ∼5-fold).

Human pigmentation is one of the main modulators of individual risk of developing MM. Therefore, the genes involved in the determination of skin colour and tanning response are potentially implicated in MM predisposition and may be useful predictors of MM risk in the general population. The human melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R) plays a crucial role in pigmentation and also appears to be important in MM. The OCA2 gene has emerged as a new and significant determinant of human iris colour variation. We present a case-control study in Spanish population including 390 consecutive patients with melanoma and 254 control subjects. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region and genotyping of 5 tag-SNPs in the genomic region of MC1R was performed. We identified 27 variants, two reaching statistical significance [R160W (OR: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.24-14.04, P = 0.02) and D294H (OR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.37-7.01, P = 0.01)] and we detected two novel non-synonymous changes: V92L and T308M. Odds ratio for carrying two functional variants was 4.25 (95% CI: 2.30-7.84, P = 3.63 x 10(-6)). Haplotypes of the entire MC1R region have been established, and we observed an enrichment of a rare European haplotype similar to African values carrying variants V92M and I155T. In addition, three potentially functional SNPs were selected in p16/CDKN2A and in the promoter region of OCA2/HERC2. Our data for CDKN2A gene did not reach statistically significant results for any of the two studied alleles. We found that the variant allele A > G of OCA2/HERC2 (rs12913832) was associated with pigmentation features: eye, hair and skin colour; P-values = 1.8 x 10(-29), 9.2 x 10(-16), 1.1 x 10(-3), respectively, validating previous results.",

TP53 gene mutations occurred in 25% of cases, more than half being codon 249 G to T transversion. Methylation of CDKN2A was frequent (61.7%); of CDKN2B, rare (5.9%). The CGH analysis showed a median of nine aberrations per case, with amplifications more frequent than deletions. Isochromosomes might be involved in about 25% of cases. Amplifications of 1q and 8q were most frequent. Clinicopathologic correlations showed that CDKN2A methylation was significantly associated with tumors arising in cirrhotic livers; amplifications of 17q was significant in multiple parameters of tumor invasiveness (size, venous invasion, poor cellular differentiation, microsatellite formation); other amplifications (1q, 6p, 10p, and 20p) were also significant in tumor invasion; and deletions (at 1p, 11q, 4q, and 14q) were significant in tumor growth.

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer, differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and their target genes in bladder cancer were analyzed. In the present study, miRNA and mRNA expression profiles (GSE40355) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. These consisted of healthy bladder samples (n=8) and urothelial carcinoma samples (low-grade, n=8 and high-grade, n=8). DE-miRNAs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package and the Benjamin and Hochberg method from the multtest package in R. Target genes of DE-miRNAs were screened. Associations between DEGs were investigated using STRING, and an interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for DEGs from the interaction network. 87 DE-miRNAs and 2058 DEGs were screened from low-grade bladder cancer samples, and 40 DE-miRNAs and 2477 DEGs were screened from high-grade bladder cancer samples. DE-target genes were significantly associated with the regulation of cell apoptosis. Bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer biological pathways were found to be enriched. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2F transcription factor 1, which is targeted by miR-106b, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog-2, which are targeted by miR-125b, participate in the bladder cancer pathway. In conclusion, DE-miRNAs in bladder cancer tissue samples and DE-targeted genes, such as miR-106b and CDKN2A, which were identified in the present study, may provide the basis for targeted therapy for breast cancer and enhance understanding of its pathogenesis.",

In addition, the p16INK4a promoter is hypermethylated in most BL biopsies and BL cell lines, leading to silencing of this gene. Activation of c-myc and/or cell cycle dysregulation can induce ARF expression and p53-dependent apoptosis. We therefore investigated the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway in BL cell lines. p14ARF was expressed and localized to nucleoli in all BL carrying mutant p53. Three out of seven BL carrying wt p53 had a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus that encodes both p14ARF and p16INK4a. Three BL carrying wild type p53 retained the CDKN2A locus and overexpressed MDM2. DNA sequencing revealed a point mutation in CDKN2A exon 2 in one of these BL, Seraphine. However, this point mutation did not affect p14ARF's nucleolar localization or ability to induce p53. The Bmi-1 protein that negatively regulates the p14ARF promoter and co-operates with c-myc in tumorigenesis was expressed at low to moderate levels in all BL analysed. Our results indicate that inactivation of the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway is an essential step during the development of Burkitt lymphoma, presumably as a mechanism to escape c-myc induced apoptosis.",

Out of 118 SNPs, 14 are nsSNPs in the coding region and 17 SNPs were found in the untranslated region (UTR). FastSNP suggested that 7 SNPs in the 5' UTR might change the protein expression levels. Sixty-four percent of nsSNPs are found to be damaged in PolyPhen server among the 14 nsSNPs investigated. With this effort, we modeled the mutant p16INK4A proteins based on these deleterious nsSNPs, out of which three nsSNPs associated p16INK4A had RMSD values of greater than 3.00 A with native protein. From a comparison of total energy of these three mutant proteins, we identified that the major mutation is from Aspartic acid to Tyrosine at the residue position of 84 of p16INK4A. Further, we compared the binding efficiency of both native and mutant p16INK4A with cdk6. We found that mutant p16INK4A has less binding affinity with cdk6 compared to native type. This is due to ten hydrogen bonds and eight salt bridges which exist between the native type and cdk6, whereas the mutant type makes only nine hydrogen bonds and five salt bridges with cdk6. Based on our investigation, we propose that the SNP with the ID rs11552822 could be the most deleterious nsSNP in CDKN2A gene, causing malignant melanoma, as it was well correlated with experimental studies carried out elsewhere.",

Stage II-III colon cancers (n = 64) were investigated by methylation-specific multiplex ligated probe amplification (MS-MLPA). Correlation of CNV, CIMP and MSI, with mutations in KRAS and BRAFV600E were assessed for overlap in molecular subtypes and early recurrence risk by uni- and multivariate regression.;The CIMP phenotype occurred in 34% (22/64) and MSI in 27% (16/60) of the tumors, with noted CIMP/MSI overlap. Among the molecular subtypes, a high CNV phenotype had an associated odds ratio (OR) for recurrence of 3.2 (95% CI 1.1-9.3; P = 0.026). Losses of CACNA1G (OR of 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0; P = 0.001), IGF2 (OR of 4.3, 95% CI 1.1-15.8; P = 0.007), CDKN2A (p16) (OR of 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.024), and RUNX3 (OR of 3.4, 95% CI 1.3-8.7; P = 0.002) were associated with early recurrence, while MSI, CIMP, KRAS or BRAF V600E mutations were not. The CNV was significantly higher in deceased patients (CNV in 6 of 8) compared to survivors (CNV in 3 of 8). Only stage and loss of RUNX3 and CDKN2A were significant in the multivariable risk-model for early recurrence.;A high copy number variation phenotype is a strong predictor of early recurrence and death, and may indicate a dose-dependent relationship between genetic instability and outcome.

The present study has analysed a series of 23 formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples of Barrett's adenocarcinoma (BCA, n = 18) and non-neoplastic squamous oesophageal (n = 2) and gastric cardia mucosa (n = 3) by aCGH. The micro-arrays used contained 287 genomic targets covering oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, and DNA sequences localized within chromosomal regions previously reported to be altered in BCA. DNA sequence copy number changes for a panel of approximately 50 genes were identified, most of which have not been previously described in BCA. DNA sequence copy number gains (mean 41 +/- 25/BCA) were more frequent than DNA sequence copy number losses (mean 20 +/- 15/BCA). The highest frequencies for DNA sequence copy number gains were detected for SNRPN (61%); GNLY (44%); NME1 (44%); DDX15, ABCB1 (MDR), ATM, LAMA3, MYBL2, ZNF217, and TNFRSF6B (39% each); and MSH2, TERC, SERPINE1, AFM137XA11, IGF1R, and PTPN1 (33% each). DNA sequence copy number losses were identified for PDGFB (44%); D17S125 (39%); AKT3 (28%); and RASSFI, FHIT, CDKN2A (p16), and SAS (CDK4) (28% each). In all non-neoplastic tissue samples of squamous oesophageal and gastric cardia mucosa, the measured mean ratios were 1.00 (squamous oesophageal mucosa) or 1.01 (gastric mucosa), indicating that no DNA sequence copy number chances were present. For validation, the DNA sequence copy number changes of selected clones (SNRPN, CMYC, HER2, ZNF217) detected by aCGH were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These data show the sensitivity of aCGH for the identification of DNA sequence copy number changes at high resolution in BCA. The newly identified genes may include so far unknown biomarkers in BCA and are therefore a starting point for further studies elucidating their possible role in Barrett's carcinogenesis.",

Because of the highly regulated nature of the cell cycle, it seems likely that variation in gene dosage of key components due to functional regulatory polymorphisms could play an important role in cancer development. Here we provide evidence of the involvement of promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (pSNPs) in the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN1A, and CDKN1B in the etiology of childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A case-control study, conducted in 240 patients with pre-B ALL and 277 healthy controls, combined with a family-based analysis using 135 parental trios, all of French-Canadian origin, were used to evaluate single-site genotypic as well as multilocus haplotypic associations for a total of 10 pSNPs. Using both study designs, we showed evidence of association between variants CDKN2A -222A, CDKN2B -593A, and CDKN1B -1608A, and an increased risk of ALL.

In this model system for human B-cell neoplasia, one of the BALB/c susceptibility and modifier loci, Pctr1, was mapped to a 5.7-centimorgan (cM) chromosomal region that included Cdkn2a, which encodes p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), and the coding sequences for the BALB/c p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) alleles were found to be polymorphic with respect to their resistant Pctr1 counterparts in DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice (45). In the present study, alleles of Pctr1, Cdkn2a, and D4Mit15 from a resistant strain (BALB/cDAG) carrying DBA/2 chromatin were introgressively backcrossed to the susceptible BALB/c strain. The resultant C.DAG-Pctr1 Cdkn2a D4Mit15 congenic was more resistant to plasmacytomagenesis than BALB/c, thus narrowing Pctr1 to a 1.5-cM interval. Concomitantly, resistant C57BL/6 mice, from which both gene products of the Cdkn2a gene have been eliminated, developed pristane-induced plasma cell tumors over a shorter latency period than the traditionally susceptible BALB/cAn strain. Biological assays of the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) alleles from BALB/c and DBA/2 indicated that the BALB/c p16(INK4a) allele was less active than its DBA/2 counterpart in inducing growth arrest of mouse plasmacytoma cell lines and preventing ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, while the two p19(ARF) alleles displayed similar potencies in both assays.

Polycomb-repressive complexes (PRCs) act synergistically during development and differentiation by maintaining transcriptional repression of common genes. PRC2 exerts this activity by catalysing H3K27 trimethylation. Here, we show that in the intestinal epithelium PRC2 is required to sustain progenitor cell proliferation and the correct balance between secretory and absorptive lineage differentiation programs. Using genetic models, we show that PRC2 activity is largely dispensable for intestinal stem cell maintenance but is strictly required for radiation-induced regeneration by preventing Cdkn2a transcription. Combining these models with genomewide molecular analysis, we further demonstrate that preferential accumulation of secretory cells does not result from impaired proliferation of progenitor cells induced by Cdkn2a activation but rather from direct regulation of transcription factors responsible for secretory lineage commitment. Overall, our data uncover a dual role of PRC2 in intestinal homeostasis highlighting the importance of this repressive layer in controlling cell plasticity and lineage choices in adult tissues.",

This study was carried out to analyze the miRNA expression profile of 17 MM samples using miRNA microarray. The analysis distinguished the overall miRNA expression profiles of tumor tissue and normal mesothelium. Differentially expressed miRNAs were found in tumor samples compared with normal sample. Twelve of them, let-7b*, miR-1228*, miR-195*, miR-30b*, miR-32*, miR-345, miR-483-3p, miR-584, miR-595, miR-615-3p, and miR-885-3p, were highly expressed whereas the remaining nine, let-7e*, miR-144*, miR-203, miR-340*, miR-34a*, miR-423, miR-582, miR-7-1*, and miR-9, were unexpressed or had severely reduced expression levels.

Next to sun exposure, the immunosuppressive regimen is an important risk factor for the development of SCC in OTRs. Various gene mutations (e.g. TP53) and genetic alterations (e.g. loss of CDKN2A, amplification of RAS) have been found in SCCs. The aim of this genome-wide study was to identify pathways and genomic alterations that are consistently involved in the formation of SCCs and their precursor lesions, actinic keratoses (AKs).;To perform the analysis in an isogenic background, RNA and DNA were isolated from SCC, AK and normal (unexposed) epidermis (NS) from each of 13 OTRs. Samples were subjected to genome-wide expression analysis and genome SNP analysis using Illumina's HumanWG-6 BeadChips and Infinium II HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChips, respectively. mRNA expression results were verified by quantitative PCR.;Hierarchical cluster analysis of mRNA expression profiles showed SCC, AK and NS samples to separate into three distinct groups. Several thousand genes were differentially expressed between epidermis, AK and SCC; most upregulated in SCCs were hyperproliferation related genes and stress markers, such as keratin 6 (KRT6), KRT16 and KRT17. Matching to oncogenic pathways revealed activation of downstream targets of RAS and cMYC in SCCs and of NFκB and TNF already in AKs. In contrast to what has been reported previously, genome-wide SNP analysis showed very few copy number variations in AKs and SCCs, and these variations had no apparent relationship with observed changes in mRNA expression profiles.;Vast differences in gene expression profiles exist between SCC, AK and NS from immunosuppressed OTRs. Moreover, several pathways activated in SCCs were already activated in AKs, confirming the assumption that AKs are the precursor lesions of SCCs. Since the drastic changes in gene expression appeared unlinked to specific genomic gains or losses, the causal events driving SCC development require further investigation. Other molecular mechanisms, such as DNA methylation or miRNA alterations, may affect gene expression in SCCs of OTRs. Further study is required to identify the mechanisms of early activation of NFκB and TNF, and to establish whether these pathways offer a feasible target for preventive intervention among OTRs.",

Recently we demonstrated that epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A is frequent in both clear cell and papillary adult renal cell carcinomas (even though 3p21.3 allele loss is rare in papillary tumours). Wilms' tumour is the most common childhood kidney tumour, but relatively little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. Thus TSGs such as WT1, p16(CDKN2a) and p53 are inactivated in only a minority of cases. In view of the involvement of RASSF1A in adult renal cancers we investigated RASSF1A as a candidate Wilms' TSG. We detected RASSF1A hypermethylation in 21 of 39 (54%) primary Wilms' tumours. 3p21.3 allele loss was not detected in nine informative Wilms' tumours (five with RASSF1A methylation). In contrast to RASSF1A, only a minority (10.3%) of Wilms' tumours demonstrated p16 promoter methylation. As chromosome 3p allele loss is frequent in colorectal cancer, we proceeded to investigate RASSF1A promoter methylation in colorectal cancer and detected RASSF1A methylation in 80% (4/5) colorectal cancer cell lines and 45% (13/29) primary colorectal cancers. There was no correlation between RASSF1A and p16 methylation in colorectal cancer. We have demonstrated that RASSF1A inactivation is the most frequent genetic or epigenetic event yet reported in Wilms' tumourigenesis and that allelotyping studies may fail to identify regions containing important TSGs.",

Screening among 119 sporadic MM cases revealed two additional CDKN2A mutations at very low prevalences. Identification of a large shared haplotype at 9p21 in some MM families negative for CDKN germline mutations suggests that other CDKN-inactivating mechanisms may be responsible for MM predisposition or, alternatively, additional susceptibility gene(s) may be present on chromosome 9p21.

Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.",

For these particular tumours, its proposed role in tumour suppression is supported both by the observation of methylation-based silencing of DBCCR1 in a large fraction of bladder cancers and by re-expression studies in bladder cancer-derived cell lines. A more general involvement of DBCCR1 in tumour development might be inferred from recent chip-based expression studies in other tumours. The present study addressed expression of DBCCR1 in gliomas, specifically in astrocytomas, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on 25 tumours of different malignancy grade and on 5 control brain tissue samples. Genomic deletion of the DBCCR1 locus at 9q32-33 was also investigated, together with the CDKN2A locus at 9p21, by loss of heterozygosity analysis in a second series of 26 astrocytic tumours. We found that DBCCR1 mRNA expression is markedly reduced in the majority of tumour samples compared to controls, and that this reduction significantly correlates with tumour grade. Genomic loss of the DBCCR1 region was found in only 5 of 24 (21%) informative samples, with no obvious correlation to tumour grade, while loss of the CDKN2A locus was observed in 13 of 21 (62%) informative samples with high-grade tumours being affected more often. If present, LOH at 9q coincided with LOH at 9p and is then likely to reflect loss of the entire chromosome rather than a specific, potentially causative event. In contrast to the situation in bladder cancer, the prevalent inactivation of DBCCR1 seen at the expression level in astrocytomas is not primarily caused by genomic loss of the gene.

Accordingly, mutations in these genes are present in a wide variety of spontaneous human cancers and CDKN2A germ line mutations are found in familial melanoma. The TBX2 gene encoding a key developmental transcription factor is amplified in pancreatic cancer cell lines and preferentially amplified and overexpressed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated breast tumors. Overexpression of Tbx2 and the related factor Tbx3, which is also overexpressed in breast cancer and melanomas, can suppress senescence in defined experimental systems through repression of ARF expression. However, it is not known how Tbx2 mediates its repressive effect nor whether endogenous Tbx2 or Tbx3 perform a similar antisenescence function in transformed cells. This is a particularly important question because the loss of CDKN2A in many human cancers would, in principle, bypass the requirement for Tbx2/3-mediated repression of ARF in suppressing senescence. We show here that Tbx2 is overexpressed in melanoma cell lines and that Tbx2 targets histone deacetylase 1 to the p21Cip1 (CDKN1A) initiator. Strikingly, expression of an inducible dominant-negative Tbx2 (dnTbx2) leads to displacement of histone deacetylase 1, up-regulation of p21(Cip1) expression, and the induction of replicative senescence in CDKN2A-null B16 melanoma cells. In human melanoma cells, expression of dnTbx2 leads to severely reduced growth and induction of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. The results suggest that the activity of endogenous Tbx2 is critically required to maintain proliferation and suppress senescence in melanomas.",

In the present study, to elucidate the molecular processes of 9p21 deletions in nonlymphocytic malignancies, breakpoints for these deletions were analysed in 21 lung cancer cell lines and 32 nonlymphocytic cancer cell lines of nine other histological types. In all, 32 breakpoints in 21 lung cancer cell lines and 56 breakpoints in 32 nonlung cancer cell lines were mapped in a 450-kb segment encompassing the CDKN2A locus with a 10-kb resolution. The largest number of breakpoints (i.e., seven breakpoints in lung cancer and 12 breakpoints in nonlung cancers) was mapped in a 10-kb region containing the CDKN2A gene. More precise mapping of these seven and 12 breakpoints revealed that none of these breakpoints were located within 50-bp intervals to each other in this 10 kb region. Cloning and sequencing of breakpoints in 18 representative cell lines (six lung and 12 nonlung cancers) further revealed that there were no significant homologies among breakpoints in these 18 cell lines. In 11 (61%) cell lines, 1-5-bp nucleotides were overlapped at breakpoint junctions. These results indicate that DNA double-strand breaks triggering 9p21 deletions do not occur at specific DNA sequences, although they preferentially occur in or near the CDKN2A locus.

The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) with extensive promoter methylation appears to be a distinct epigenetic subtype of colorectal carcinoma. Most previous studies on CpG island methylation in colorectal carcinoma used methylation-specific PCR, which may detect low levels of DNA methylation with little or no biological significance. In contrast, quantitative DNA methylation assays have been shown to provide useful information beyond that which can be achieved with methylation-specific PCR. Synchronous neoplasias provide a unique model for investigators to examine molecular alterations in multistep tumorigenesis within one individual. However, no study to date has quantified DNA methylation of CIMP-specific promoters in synchronous colorectal neoplasias. Utilizing real-time PCR (MethyLight), we quantified DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters [CACNA1G (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T type alpha-1G subunit), CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), CRABP1 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein-1), MLH1 and NEUROG1 (neurogenin 1)] and MGMT in six synchronous carcinoma pairs (12 carcinomas) and eight synchronous carcinoma and adenoma pairs (16 tumors). We found that while some synchronous tumor pairs showed discordant promoter methylation patterns, other tumor pairs showed similar, but not exactly identical, patterns of promoter methylation. All but two pairs showed concordant patterns of CIMP status (CIMP positive vs CIMP negative) (P = 0.05 in cancer pairs). BRAF mutations were present in only CIMP-positive tumors. A high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was observed in both CIMP-positive and CIMP-negative tumors. KRAS mutations were not concordant in any synchronous neoplasia pair. In conclusion, epigenetic alterations at CIMP-specific promoter CpG islands in synchronous colorectal neoplasias likely have both random and nonrandom components.",

We further investigated transcriptome-genotype-phenotype correlations in HCC. Global transcriptome analyses were performed on 57 HCCs and 3 hepatocellular adenomas and validated by quantitative RT-PCR using 63 additional HCCs. We determined loss of heterozygosity, gene mutations, promoter methylation of CDH1 and CDKN2A, and HBV DNA copy number for each tumor. Unsupervised transcriptome analysis identified 6 robust subgroups of HCC (G1-G6) associated with clinical and genetic characteristics. G1 tumors were associated with low copy number of HBV and overexpression of genes expressed in fetal liver and controlled by parental imprinting. G2 included HCCs infected with a high copy number of HBV and mutations in PIK3CA and TP53. In these first groups, we detected specific activation of the AKT pathway. G3 tumors were typified by mutation of TP53 and overexpression of genes controlling the cell cycle. G4 was a heterogeneous subgroup of tumors including TCF1-mutated hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. G5 and G6 were strongly related to beta-catenin mutations that lead to Wnt pathway activation; in particular, G6 tumors were characterized by satellite nodules, higher activation of the Wnt pathway, and E-cadherin underexpression.;These results have furthered our understanding of the genetic diversity of human HCC and have provided specific identifiers for classifying tumors. In addition, our classification has potential therapeutic implications because 50% of the tumors were related to WNT or AKT pathway activation, which potentially could be targeted by specific inhibiting therapies.",

The exploratory study cohort comprised 17 breast cancer patients with multiple benign and/or in situ lesions concurrently present with invasive carcinoma within a tumor biopsy. DNA from tumor tissue, normal breast epithelium when present, benign lesions (fibroadenoma, hyperplasia, papilloma, sclerosing adenosis, apocrine metaplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia), and in situ lesions of lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma were interrogated for promoter methylation status in 22 tumor suppressor genes using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). Methylation specific PCR was performed to confirm hypermethylation detected by MS-MLPA. Promoter methylation was detected in 11/22 tumor suppressor genes in 16/17 cases. Hypermethylation of RASSF1 was most frequent, present in 14/17 cases, followed by APC in 12/17, and GSTP1 in 9/17 cases with establishment of an epigenetic monocloncal progression continuum to invasive breast cancer. Hypermethylated promoter regions in normal breast epithelium, benign, and premalignant lesions within the same tumor biopsy implicate RASSF1, APC, GSTP1, TIMP3, CDKN2B, CDKN2A, ESR1, CDH13, RARB, CASP8, and TP73 as early events.

        "Doc_abstract":"Familial melanoma accounts for approximately a tenth of all melanoma cases. The most commonly known melanoma susceptibility gene is the highly penetrant CDKN2A (p16INK4a) locus, which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and accounts for approximately 20-50 % of familial melanoma cases. Mutated p16INK4a shows impaired capacity to inhibit the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, allowing for unchecked cell cycle progression. Mutations in the second protein coded by CDKN2A, p14ARF, are much less common and result in proteasomal degradation of p53 with subsequent accumulation of DNA damage as the cell progresses through the cell cycle without a functional p53-mediated DNA damage response. Mutations in CDK4 that impair the inhibitory interaction with p16INK4a also increase melanoma risk but these mutations are extremely rare. Genes of the melanin biosynthetic pathway, including MC1R and MITF, have also been implicated in melanomagenesis. MC1R variants were traditionally thought to increase risk for melanoma secondary to intensified UV-mediated DNA damage in the setting of absent photoprotective eumelanin. Accumulation of pheomelanin, which appears to have a carcinogenic effect regardless of UV exposure, may be a more likely mechanism. Impaired SUMOylation of the E318K variant of MITF results in increased transcription of genes that confer melanocytes with a pro-malignant phenotype. Mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1 enhance the metastatic potential of uveal melanoma and predispose to cutaneous/ocular melanoma, atypical melanocytic tumors, and other internal malignancies (COMMON syndrome). Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous low-risk alleles. Although several melanoma susceptibility genes have been identified, risk assessment tools have been developed only for the most common gene implicated with hereditary melanoma, CDKN2A. MelaPRO, a validated model that relies on Mendelian inheritance and Bayesian probability theories, estimates carrier probability for CDKN2A and future risk of melanoma taking into account a patient's family and past medical history of melanoma. Genetic testing for CDKN2A mutations is currently available but the Melanoma Genetics Consortium recommends offering such testing to patients only in the context of research protocols because clinical utility is uncertain.",

Most Dutch melanoma families segregate for a unique founder mutation (p16-Leiden), encoding a truncated nonfunctional p16 protein. The highly variable risk for p16-Leiden carriers to develop melanoma suggests a role for other genetic and/or environmental factors. We hypothesized that a 9p21 gene other than CDKN2A may be relevant in the remaining 9p21-linked melanoma families without p16 mutations but may also act as a risk modifier in p16-Leiden carriers. Haplotype analysis for 9p21 was performed using microsatellite markers in six p16-Leiden families originating from a founder population. p16-Leiden carriers in two families shared an unexpectedly large founder haplotype ( approximately 20-cM) around CDKN2A, mostly in proximal direction. Melanoma-positive p16-Leiden carriers from these families showed this extensive proximal haplotype compared with melanoma-negative p16-Leiden carriers from the same families. Additional p16-Leiden families less heavily affected with melanoma showed shorter haplotypes sharing, excluding the region proximally of CDKN2A. The presence of a gene involved in melanoma susceptibility proximal of CDKN2A is corroborated by somatic deletions of 9p in tumors, which frequently do not include CDKN2A but a more proximal chromosomal area instead. Our results provide a candidate region for further gene mapping in p16-negative 9p21-linked melanoma families and guide the search for risk modifiers in melanoma development.",

Novel therapeutics and stratification approaches are needed to improve the outlook for both NMIBC and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We investigated the expression and effects of B Lymphoma Mo-MLV Insertion Region 1 (BMI1) in UC. BMI1 was found to be overexpressed in most UC cell lines and primary tumors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In contrast to some previous reports, no association with tumor stage or grade was observed in two independent tumor panels. Furthermore, upregulation of BMI1 was detected in premalignant bladder lesions, suggesting a role early in tumorigenesis. BMI1 is not located within a common region of genomic amplification in UC. The CDKN2A locus (which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor gene) is a transcriptional target of BMI1 in some cellular contexts. In UC cell lines and primary tissues, no correlation between BMI1 and p16 expression was observed. Retroviral-mediated overexpression of BMI1 immortalized normal human urothelial cells (NHUC) in vitro and was associated with induction of telomerase activity, bypass of senescence, and repression of differentiation. The effects of BMI1 on gene expression were identified by expression microarray analysis of NHUC-BMI1. Metacore analysis of the gene expression profile implicated downstream effects of BMI1 on α4/β1 integrin-mediated adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, and CREB1-mediated transcription. ",

In UCB patients treated with RC, PIK3CA mutations are associated with favorable outcomes, whereas TP53 and CDKN2A alterations are associated with poor outcomes.

To study the contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analysed the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INC4a) and p53. After microdissection, DNA of 71 hepatocellular carcinomas was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation and p53 mutation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction-enzyme related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INC4a) were assessed by differential PCR. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was found in 11/71 cases (15%), alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 47/71 carcinomas (66%), which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Five tumours (7%) had homozygous deletions of the INK4a-ARF locus. We failed to detect specific mutations of both exons. P16(INK4a) methylation with an unmethylated p14(ARF) promotor appeared in 39 cases. Mutations of p53 were found in 30 of 71 HCC (42%), and only one of them harboured p14(ARF) inactivation. We failed to establish alterations of the INK4a-ARF locus or p53 status as independent prognostic factor in these tumours. Our data indicate, that p14(ARF) methylation occurs independently of p16(INK4a) alterations in a subset of HCC together with wild type p53. The INK4a-ARF-/p53-pathway was disrupted in 86% of HCC, either by p53 mutations or by INK4a-ARF inactivation, and may have co-operative effects in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

In this study we investigated 46 nonfunctional pituitary tumors and 21 somatotrophinomas for aberrant methylation of the CpG island contained within the CDKN2A gene as an alternative mechanism of gene silencing. We demonstrate methylation in 32/46 (70%) of nonfunctioning tumors, in contrast to 2/21 (9.5%) somatotrophinomas and 0/15 histologically normal postmortem pituitaries. Methylation in noninvasive and invasive nonfunctional tumors was approximately equal at 15/20 (75%) and 17/26 (65%), respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an absence of CDKN2A protein in 25/32 (78%) methylated nonfunctioning tumors, demonstrating a highly significant overall correlation (P = 0.00007) between hypermethylation of the gene and absence of the p 16 protein. The association between hypermethylation and absence of CDKN2A protein remained when the cohort of nonfunctional tumors was further subdivided into noninvasive 12/15 (80%; P = 0.004) and invasive 13/17 (76%; P = 0.01), suggesting this to be an early event in pituitary tumorigenesis. In contrast, a single invasive methylated somatotrophinoma failed to express the CDKN2A protein. These data show that hypermethylation of the CpG island within exon 1, but not exon 2, of the CDKN2A gene is frequently associated with loss of protein expression in nonfunctional pituitary tumors, but not somatotrophinomas, suggesting different tumorigenic pathways.",

One such pigmentation gene, MC1R, has not only been found to be a low penetrance melanoma gene but has also been shown to act as a genetic modifier of melanoma risk in individuals carrying CDKN2A mutations.

The role for CDKN2A and ARF in tumorigenesis is well established, but whether MTAP loss directly affects tumorigenesis is unclear. MTAP encodes the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway. To determine if loss of MTAP plays a functional role in tumorigenesis, we have created an MTAP-knockout mouse. Mice homozygous for a MTAP null allele (Mtap(lacZ)) have an embryonic lethal phenotype dying around day 8 postconception. Mtap/Mtap(lacZ) heterozygotes are born at Mendelian frequencies and appear indistinguishable from wild-type mice during the first year of life, but they tend to die prematurely with a median survival of 585 days. Autopsies on these animals reveal that they have greatly enlarged spleens, altered thymic histology, and lymphocytic infiltration of their livers, consistent with lymphoma. Immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicate that these lymphomas are primarily T-cell in origin. Lymphoma-infiltrated tissues tend to have reduced levels of Mtap mRNA and MTAP protein in addition to unaltered levels of methyldeoxycytidine. These studies show that Mtap is a tumor suppressor gene independent of CDKN2A and ARF.",

This case-control study aimed at investigating the influence of the main host and environmental risk factors and of MC1R variation on CM risk in 390 CDKN2A-negative and 49 CDKN2A-positive Italian individuals. Multivariate analysis showed that MC1R variation, number of nevi and childhood sunburns doubled CM risk in CDKN2A-negative individuals. In CDKN2A-positive individuals, family history of CM and presence of atypical nevi, rather than MC1R status, modified risk (20.75- and 2.83-fold, respectively).

Here, we developed a method for deriving single estimates, rather than a range, of methylation using MS-HRM and compared the values obtained in this way with those obtained using the gold standard quantitative method of pyrosequencing. We derived an interpolation curve using standards of known methylated/unmethylated ratio (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of methylation) to obtain the best estimate of the extent of methylation for each of our samples.

It contributes strongly to tissue aging and serves as a major barrier against tumor development. Most tumor cells are believed to bypass the senescence barrier (become \"immortal\") by inactivating growth control genes such as TP53 and CDKN2A. They also reactivate telomerase reverse transcriptase. Senescence-to-immortality transition is accompanied by major phenotypic and biochemical changes mediated by genome-wide transcriptional modifications. This appears to happen during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with liver cirrhosis, however, the accompanying transcriptional changes are virtually unknown. We investigated genome-wide transcriptional changes related to the senescence-to-immortality switch during hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Initially, we performed transcriptome analysis of senescent and immortal clones of Huh7 HCC cell line, and identified genes with significant differential expression to establish a senescence-related gene list. Through the analysis of senescence-related gene expression in different liver tissues we showed that cirrhosis and HCC display expression patterns compatible with senescent and immortal phenotypes, respectively; dysplasia being a transitional state. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that cirrhosis/senescence-associated genes were preferentially expressed in non-tumor tissues, less malignant tumors, and differentiated or senescent cells. In contrast, HCC/immortality genes were up-regulated in tumor tissues, or more malignant tumors and progenitor cells. In HCC tumors and immortal cells genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, telomere extension and branched chain amino acid metabolism were up-regulated, whereas genes involved in cell signaling, as well as in drug, lipid, retinoid and glycolytic metabolism were down-regulated. Based on these distinctive gene expression features we developed a 15-gene hepatocellular immortality signature test that discriminated HCC from cirrhosis with high accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that senescence bypass plays a central role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis engendering systematic changes in the transcription of genes regulating DNA repair, proliferation, differentiation and metabolism.",

The p19ARF transcript, an alternative spliced form of the CDKN2a gene, has recently been shown to inhibit, like the p16INK4a protein, cell cycle progression, raising the possibility that it might constitute an additional melanoma tumor suppressor gene at the 9p21 locus. To determine the contribution of these candidate genes to familial melanoma genetic predisposition, we screened 10 such kindreds for germline mutations in the p16INK4a and p19ARF genes. Four independent germline missense mutations, mapping in exon 1alpha (Gly23Asp; Arg24Pro) and exon 2 (Asn71Ileu; Pro114Leu) of the CDKN2a gene, were identified.

Our goal was to take a pathway-based approach to investigate the influence of polymorphisms in cell cycle-related genes on age of onset for Lynch syndrome using a tree model.;We evaluated polymorphisms in a panel of cell cycle-related genes (AURKA, CDKN2A, TP53, E2F2, CCND1, TP73, MDM2, IGF1, and CDKN2B) in 220 MMR gene mutation carriers from 129 families. We applied a novel statistical approach, tree modeling (Classification and Regression Tree), to the analysis of data on patients with Lynch syndrome to identify individuals with a higher probability of developing colorectal cancer at an early age and explore the gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in cell cycle genes.;We found that the subgroup with CDKN2A C580T wild-type genotype, IGF1 CA-repeats >or=19, E2F2 variant genotype, AURKA wild-type genotype, and CCND1 variant genotype had the youngest age of onset, with a 45-year median onset age, while the subgroup with CDKN2A C580T wild-type genotype, IGF1 CA-repeats >or=19, E2F2 wild-type genotype, and AURKA variant genotype had the latest median age of onset, which was 70 years. Furthermore, we found evidence of a possible gene-gene interaction between E2F2 and AURKA genes related to CRC age of onset.;Polymorphisms in these cell cycle-related genes work together to modify the age at the onset of CRC in patients with Lynch syndrome.

Tumor suppressor genes TP53 and CDKN2A were downregulated and protooncogenes JUN and GRB10 were upregulated. Furthermore, several cellular signaling pathways acting either in cell cycle regulation or in apoptosis were altered. Deregulation was found in pathways that contribute to genomic stability (by downregulation of either TP53 or CSE1L and by upregulation of GADD45A) and regulate cell cycle progression (by downregulation of CDKN2A and upregulation of RBBP4, CDC37, and NEDD5). Alterations at the transcriptional level were identified, namely, upregulation of JUN and E2F5. Abnormalities were observed in the regulation of the caspases through upregulation of CASP8 and by altered expression of BCL2-related pathway. Extrinsic apoptotic signals mediated by IGFs were deregulated and the glutathione detoxification pathway was downregulated. These findings provide insight into the regulation of balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation signals, and suggest that these genes and pathways may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AML.",

However, other genetic abnormalities remain to be identified and molecular cytogenetics may be useful to detect chromosomal loci involved in recurrent rearrangements. We have used spectral karyotyping to characterize cytogenetic aberrations in a panel of 20 human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and confirmed their identities by dual and triple color fluorescence in situ hybridization. The most common partial or whole-arm gains involved 5p, 7q, 12p, 1q, 7p, 5q, 9p, 9q and 11p. The most common partial or whole-arm losses affected 9p, 11q, 18q, 3p, 2q and 1p, as well as the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes. Spectral karyotyping allowed us to identify a number of recurrent structural aberrations, all of them unbalanced: most frequently i(5)(p10), del(11)(q23), i(12)(p10), i(1)(q10), del(7)(q22) and del(10)(p11). Spectral karyotyping mapped the complex aberrations occurring in pancreatic cancer cell lines and identified non-random patterns of chromosomal rearrangement. This comprehensive characterization should be useful to direct future investigation. The observation that loss at 11q and gains at 5p with i(5)(p10) and 12p with i(12)(p10) are more frequent changes than previously reported would justify more intensive investigation of these chromosomal regions.",

HCC risk has not previously been associated with gene-specific DNA methylation in India. Promoter region methylation of a panel of six tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDH1, GSTP1, SOCS1, and APC) and three oncogenes (MYC, HRAS, and KRAS) was determined by methylation-specific PCR among 23 HCC samples and 20 control hepatitis samples. CDKN2B methylation frequency in HCC was double that for hepatitis, and methylation allele density of APC, GSTP1, and CDKN2B increased 2.2-, 2.3-, and 7.6-fold, respectively. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes starts during viral infection and progresses toward HCC with the chronicity of the disease. Findings of altered methylation status support involvement of these tumor suppressor genes in HCC. MYC showed decreased methylation in HCC, relative to hepatitis.

Thus, a thorough reassessment of the safety of available gene transfer systems is a crucial outstanding issue for the whole gene therapy field.

The latter is capable of activating ERK kinase, which upregulates JUNB expression through ETS1. JUNB, in turn, interacts with the TNFRSF8 (CD30) gene promoter and induces CD30 (TNFRSF8) overexpression. However, the role of CD30 overexpression in ALK+ ALCL oncogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that the JUNB gene is frequently amplified in ALK+ ALCL, suggesting gene amplification as an additional underlying mechanism for JUNB overexpression. Silencing of JUNB resulted in reduced cell growth and colony formation associated with decreased activator protein-1 activity and G1/S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. These effects were linked to decreased CD30 levels, downregulation of CCNA2 (Cyclin A), CCND2 (Cyclin D2) and CCND3 (Cyclin D3) and upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2A (p14) and CDKN1A (p21), but not CDKN1B (p27). Similar cell cycle changes were observed following the knock-down of TNFRSF8 gene or blockade of its function using anti-CD30 antibodies, which were associated with upregulation of CDKN2A and CDKN1A, but not CDKN1B. These findings indicate that JUNB may partly operate through CD30 signalling. Silencing of JUNB also sensitized NPM1-ALCL+ cells to standard chemotherapeutic agents.

A recent deletion mapping study of chromosome 9p has also identified a site of deletion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) centered around D9S126. The Hel-N1 (human elav-like neuronal protein 1) gene encodes a neural-specific RNA binding protein that is expressed in SCLC. We have mapped this potentially important gene in lung tumorigenesis to within 100 kb of the D9S126 marker at chromosome band 9p21 by using homozygously deleted tumor cell lines and fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal metaphase spreads. Hel-N1 is, therefore, a candidate target suppressor gene in both SCLC and NSCLC. We have determined the genomic organization and intron/exon boundaries of Hel-N1 and have screened the entire coding region for mutations by sequencing 14 primary SCLCs and cell lines and 21 primary NSCLCs preselected for localized 9p21 deletion or monosomy of chromosome 9. A homozygous deletion including Hel-N1 and CDKN2a was found in a SCLC cell line, and a single-base polymorphism in exon 2 of Hel-N1 was observed in eight tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"The polycomb group family protein BMI-1 is overexpressed by and functions as an oncogene in many different human cancers. We have previously shown that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) and that this is mediated independently of CDKN2A repression. In this study, we have discovered that high levels of BMI-1 confer resistance to contact inhibition in ESFT cells. Using stable retroviral transduction, we evaluated the consequences of BMI-1 knockdown on the growth of CDKN2A wild-type and mutant ESFT cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions. Although knockdown of BMI-1 had no effect on proliferation in low-density cultures, at high cell densities it resulted in cell cycle arrest and death. The normal cell contact inhibition response is mediated, in large part, by the recently described Hippo pathway which functions to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death by inactivating the Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). Significantly, we found that YAP levels, activity and expression did not diminish in confluent ESFT cells that expressed high levels of BMI-1. In contrast, YAP expression and nuclear localization were reduced in confluent BMI-1 knockdown cells suggesting that silencing of BMI-1 restored contact inhibition by restoring normal activation of the Hippo-YAP growth-suppressor pathway. Importantly, knockdown of YAP in ESFT cells resulted in profound inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation suggesting that stabilization and continued expression of YAP is critical for ESFT growth and tumorigenicity. Together, these studies reveal a previously unrecognized link between BMI-1, contact inhibition and the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggest that resistance to contact inhibition in BMI-1 overexpressing cancer cells may be in part a result of Hippo inhibition and aberrant stabilization of YAP.",

To address this limitation, we developed a novel bisulfite-microfluidic temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis (bisulfite-μTGCE) platform for gene methylation analysis by combining bisulfite treatment and slantwise radiative heating system-based μTGCE. Bisulfite-treated genomic DNA (gDNA) was amplified with universal primers for both methylated and unmethylated sequences, and introduced into glass microfluidic chip to perform electrophorectic separation under a continuous temperature gradient based on the formation of heteroduplexes. Eight CDKN2A promoter model fragments with different number and location of methylation sites were prepared and successfully analyzed according to their electrophoretic peak patterns, with high stability, picoliter-scale sample consumption, and significantly increased detection speed. The bisulfite-μTGCE could detect methylated gDNA with a detection limit of 7.5pg, and could distinguish as low as 0.1% methylation level in CDKN2A in an unmethylated background. Detection of seven colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with known and unknown methylation statuses of CDKN2A promoter and 20 tumor tissues derived from CRC patients demonstrated the capability of detecting hypermethylation in real-world samples. The wider adaptation of this platform was further supported by the detection of the CDKN2A and MLH1 promoters' methylation statuses in combination. This highly sensitive, fast, and low-consumption platform for methylation detection shows great potential for future clinical applications.",

Of the 24 tumor suppressor genes examined, aberrant methylation was observed in 17. The three most frequently methylated genes were CDKN2B, CDH13 and RASSF1, followed by ESR1 and MLH1. Methylation frequencies ranged from 1.3% for CDKN2A, RARβ, CASP8, VHL and TP73 to 24% for CDKN2B. The corresponding normal DNA from each patient was also investigated. Methylation was detected in tumors, although not in normal tissues, with the exception of two samples, indicating aberrant methylation in tumors. Clear cell carcinoma samples exhibited a higher frequency of CDKN2B promoter hypermethylation compared to those of other histological types (P=0.05). Our data indicate that methylation of the CDKN2B gene is a frequent event in ovarian carcinogenesis and that analysis of only three genes is sufficient to detect the presence of methylation in 35% of ovarian cancer cases.

In the majority of cases, LOH on chromosome 3 was detected at all informative markers. The second most common alteration was LOH at an RB1 intragenic marker (21% tumors), with retention of a more centromeric 13q marker (near BRCA2). The pattern of LOH on chromosome 9p was consistent with the involvement of a region telomeric to CDKN2A. LOH at TP53 was infrequent.;In the majority of cases, chromosome 3 LOH involves an entire chromosome homologue, which hampers identification of the relevant suppressor loci.

Germline deletions were found in 3 of 93 UK pedigrees, with no previously identified CDKN2A mutations.

Microsatellite analysis determined that these two families were ancestrally related. In the third family, a novel p16 hemizygous deletion involving CDKN2A exons 1alpha, 2, and 3 was detected. An additional 9p21 deletion reported previously in a USA melanoma-neural system tumor family was shown to involve CDKN2A exon 1beta, and not p16. The CDKN2A exon 1beta deletions provide further evidence that this tumor suppressor gene is important in melanoma-neural system tumor susceptibility, but do not exclude the possibility of a novel gene or regulatory element also being deleted in this region.

We identified 14 regions of nonrandom copy-number change, including 7 regions of amplification (1q, 2q, 5q, 7q, 8q, 12p, and 20q) and 7 regions of deletion (1p, 3p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 14q). An analysis aimed at identifying the relevant genes revealed VHL as one of three genes in the 3p deletion peak, CDKN2A and CDKN2B as the only genes in the 9p deletion peak, and MYC as the only gene in the 8q amplification peak. An integrated analysis to identify genes in amplification peaks that are consistently overexpressed among amplified samples confirmed MYC as a potential target of 8q amplification and identified candidate oncogenes in the other regions. A comparison of genomic profiles revealed that VHL disease-associated tumors are similar to a subgroup of sporadic tumors and thus more homogeneous overall. Sporadic tumors without evidence of biallelic VHL inactivation fell into two groups: one group with genomic profiles highly dissimilar to the majority of ccRCC and a second group with genomic profiles that are much more similar to tumors with biallelic inactivation of VHL.",

However, K-Ras generally fails to transform precursor lesions into invasive cancers due to activation of powerful fail-safe programmes that counteract transformation and growth. The importance of cellular senescence, a permanent cell growth arrest, is increasingly being recognised as a critical fail-safe programme in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that oncogene-induced senescence requires transcriptional induction of the CDKN2A gene locus as well as comprehensive chromatin modifications involved in epigenetic silencing of pro-proliferative genes. Moreover, recent work in pancreatic cancer mouse models proposes that inactivation of the CDKN2A tumour suppressor locus is the molecular switch required for senescence evasion and unleashed K-Ras driven malignant transformation in the pancreas.",

We assessed genome-wide DNA copy number and mutation of key tumor suppressor genes in T-cell lymphomas arising after weekly irradiation of female B6C3F1 mice with 1.2Gy X-rays for 4 consecutive weeks starting during infancy (1 week old), adolescence (4 weeks old) or as young adults (8 weeks old). Although T-cell lymphoma incidence was similar, loss of heterozygosity at Cdkn2a on chromosome 4 and at Ikaros on chromosome 11 was more frequent in the two older groups, while loss at the Pten locus on chromosome 19 was more frequent in the infant-irradiated group. Cdkn2a and Ikaros mutation/loss was a common feature of the young adult-irradiation group, with Ikaros frequently (50%) incurring multiple independent hits (including deletions and mutations) or suffering a single hit predicted to result in a dominant negative protein (such as those lacking exon 4, an isoform we have designated Ik12, which lacks two DNA binding zinc-finger domains). Conversely, Pten mutations were more frequent after early irradiation (60%) than after young adult-irradiation (30%). Homozygous Pten mutations occurred without DNA copy number change after irradiation starting in infancy, suggesting duplication of the mutated allele by chromosome mis-segregation or mitotic recombination. Our findings demonstrate that while deletions on chromosomes 4 and 11 affecting Cdkn2a and Ikaros are a prominent feature of young adult irradiation-induced T-cell lymphoma, tumors arising after irradiation from infancy suffer a second hit in Pten by mis-segregation or recombination. This is the first report showing an influence of age-at-exposure on genomic alterations of tumor suppressor genes and their relative involvement in radiation-induced T-cell lymphoma. These data are important for considering the risks associated with childhood exposure to radiation. ",

By a consideration of colorectal and pancreatic cancers in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry we show that the log-log model provides a poor description of the data, and that a much better description is provided by a multistage model that predicts two basic phases in the age-specific incidence curves, a first exponential phase until the age of approximately 60 followed by a linear phase after that age. These two phases in the incidence curve reflect two phases in the process of carcinogenesis. Paradoxically, the early-exponential phase reflects events between the formation (initiation) of premalignant clones in a tissue and the clinical detection of a malignant tumor, whereas the linear phase reflects events leading to initiated cells that give rise to premalignant lesions because of abrogated growth/differentiation control. This model is consistent with Knudson's idea that renewal tissue, such as the colon, is converted into growing tissue before malignant transformation. The linear phase of the age-specific incidence curve represents this conversion, which is the result of recessive inactivation of a gatekeeper gene, such as the APC gene in the colon and the CDKN2A gene in the pancreas.",

The objective of this study was to screen primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type for genetic alterations recently described in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Skin biopsies from 23 patients were analyzed for IRF4, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC expression. FISH testing was performed for BCL2, BCL6, MYC with separation probes and for CDKN2A and PRDM1/BLIMP1 deletion. Multiple sequential FISH analyses with up to six probes were performed to define samples with multiple cytogenetic alterations. MYD88 mutations were studied by Sanger sequencing. All cases but one displayed at least one genetic alteration (96%). Nine patients exhibited a single genetic mutation and 12 combined several alterations (52%). We observed a split for BCL2, BCL6, or MYC in 1/23, 6/23, and 3/23 of cases, respectively. No double-hit lymphoma was observed. CDKN2A deletion was detected by FISH in only 5/23 cases. BLIMP1 and/or 6q deletion was observed at a higher rate in 10/20 of cases. No correlation between rearrangement and immunohistochemical expression was found for BCL2 or MYC. FISH tracking of sequential hybridizations showed that several alterations were carried by the same nuclei. The p.L265P MYD88 mutation was found in 11/18 (61%) of cases. Contrary to most cutaneous lymphomas that rarely harbor primary genetic alteration of their nodal histological equivalent, primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type seems to be a 'cutaneous counterpart' of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a similar cytogenetic profile and a high rate of MYD88 oncogenic L265P mutation. This also suggests a common lymphomagenesis with NF-κB activation, strong IRF4 expression and terminal B-cell differentiation blockage. Our data support the use of therapies targeting NF-κB, as most patients displayed disease progression and resistance to conventional therapies. ",

We sought to determine whether GCAs possess distinct genotypic alterations that might reflect their unique morphology or clinical behavior. Eleven GCAs occurring in 7 men and 4 women ranging in age from 46 to 75 years were investigated for genetic alterations of known significance in glial tumorigenesis, including LOH at 1p, 9p, 10q, 17p, and 19q, point mutations of TP53, deletions of p16(CDKN2A) and p14ARF, as well as EGFR amplifications. Tumors included had an infiltrative growth pattern and consisted of large, round cells packed with eosinophilic, PAS-positive granules that varied in quantity, ranging from 30 to 100% of tumor cells. Three tumors were of WHO grade II, one was grade III, and 7 were grade IV lesions. Overall, the tumors showed higher frequencies of LOH at 1p, 9p, 10q, 17p, and 19q than typical infiltrating astrocytomas of similar grades. Losses on 9p and 10q occurred in nearly all cases, including low grade lesions. TP53 mutations were identified in 2 grade IV GCAs, while combined p14ARF and p16(CDKN2A) homozygous deletions were noted in only one grade IV lesion. None showed EGFR amplification. We found no genetic alterations specific for GCA. Instead, it appears that granular cell change occurs across genetic subsets. The high frequency of allelic loss, especially on 9p and 10q, may confer aggressive growth potential and be related to their rapid clinical progression.",

Northern analysis indicated that p16(INK4a) messenger RNA coordinately increased in a dose-dependent manner more than 2-fold in irradiated cells at the tested doses.;UVB irradiation transcriptionally activates the expression of p16(INK4a) in cultured human melanocytes. Therefore the growth arrest that occurs with irradiation of melanocytes could be mediated, in part, by upregulation of p16(INK4a). This transient arrest may allow repair of UVB-induced DNA damage before cell division.

We have used a melanoma cell line (MM96L) with no functional p16, as the basis for a \"semi-in vivo\" transfection-based assay for exogenous p16 functionality based on the growth parameters of the cells and the behaviour of variant proteins after transfection of different CDKN2A cDNAs. Colony counts performed on these transfectants revealed that all but the wild type, + 24 bp ad A148T variants have a diminished ability to inhibit cell growth. All other variants detected either constitutionally in familial melanoma patients (I49T, R87P, G101W and V126D) or somatically in melanomas (N71S, and P81L), appeared functionally impaired in this assay. This diminution of function was independent of CDK4 and CDK6 binding ability. Furthermore, the predominant localization of these variants within the cell was different from that of wt p16. This mislocalization may provide an explanation for their lack of function, or alternatively, it may also be an indicator that the cells are processing unstable, misfolded p16 proteins.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of USP22 and the association with its potential targets in colorectal cancer (CRC).;We evaluated the implication of USP22 and the candidate targets, such as B-cell-specific murine leukemia virus integration site-1 (BMI-1), cellular homolog of avian myelocytomatosis virus oncogene (c-Myc), cyclin D2, inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 (p16INK4a), and an alternate reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus (p14ARF), in matched samples comprising carcinoma and adjacent non-cancerous mucosa from 82 patients with CRC using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining analyses.;The USP22 mRNA expression in the CRC tissues was significantly higher than those in the non-cancerous mucosa tissues (P < 0.0001). Increased mRNA expression of USP22 was associated with advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (P = 0.033) and high likelihood of therapy failure after radical resection (P < 0.0001). The Cox regression analysis revealed that the USP22 mRNA expression level was a significant factor for predicting prognosis (P < 0.0001). The statistical correlation analysis in mRNA levels showed that USP22 was strongly correlated with BMI-1 (r = 0.790, P < 0.0001), c-Myc (r = 0.528, P < 0.0001), and cyclin D2 (r = 0.657, P < 0.0001), but not p16INK4a (r = 0.103, P = 0.358) or p14ARF (r = -0.039, P = 0.731).;Our results indicate that activation of USP22 correlates with CRC progression and therapy failure. Additionally, the oncogenic role of USP22 in the progression of CRC can be mechanistically linked with BMI-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D2, but not with p16INK4a and p14ARF.",

The incidence of CCA is highest in the northeastern part of Thailand, where chronic inflammation caused by liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini: Ov) infection is a major etiologic factor. The incidence of CCA is also increasing in other countries, including Japan. Here, we overview the genetic and transcriptional alterations of CCA with and without association with Ov infection. CCA with Ov shows enhanced expression of the genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and chronic inflammatory responses, including cytokine signaling, whereas CCA without Ov shows enhanced expression of growth factor signaling, such as HER2. Exome and the following prevalence sequencing identified mutations of the BAP1, ARID1A, IDH1 and IDH2 genes in CCA, in addition to the high incidence of known mutations in the TP53, KRAS2 SMAD4, and CDKN2A genes, suggesting the role of chromatin modulators in CCA pathogenesis. CCA with Ov shows significantly higher incidence of the TP53 gene mutation, whereas CCA without Ov showed significantly more frequent mutations of the BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2 genes. However, CCAs with Ov and without Ov share a similar mutation spectrum dominated by C : G > T : A transitions mainly at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that CCA shares etiologic factors with pancreatic ductal carcinoma but not with hepatocellular carcinoma. Comprehensive analyses of the genetic and transcriptional alterations of CCA with and without Ov infection would provide useful information for the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of CCA.

To characterize benign vs. pathogenic missense variants, numerous computational algorithms have been developed based on comparative sequence and/or protein structure analysis. We compared computational methods that use evolutionary conservation alone, amino acid (AA) change alone, and a combination of conservation and AA change in predicting the consequences of 254 missense variants in the CDKN2A (n = 92), MLH1 (n = 28), MSH2 (n = 14), MECP2 (n = 30), and tyrosinase (TYR) (n = 90) genes. Variants were validated as either neutral or deleterious by curated locus-specific mutation databases and published functional data. All methods that use evolutionary sequence analysis have comparable overall prediction accuracy (72.9-82.0%). Mutations at codons where the AA is absolutely conserved over a sufficient evolutionary distance (about one-third of variants) had a 91.6 to 96.8% likelihood of being deleterious. Three algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen, and A-GVGD) that differentiate one variant from another at a given codon did not significantly improve predictive value over conservation score alone using the BLOSUM62 matrix. However, when all four methods were in agreement (62.7% of variants), predictive value improved to 88.1%. These results confirm a high predictive value for methods that use evolutionary sequence conservation, with or without considering protein structural change, to predict the clinical consequences of missense variants. The methods can be generalized across genes that cause different types of genetic disease. The results support the clinical use of computational methods as one tool to help interpret missense variants in genes associated with human genetic disease.",

Among them, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A or p16(INK4a)) gene has been shown to be frequently deleted or inactivated in astrocytic tumors. The CDKN2C (p18(INK4c)) gene is functionally related to CDKN2A. Moreover, mice with targeted disruption of CDKN2C alone or combined CDKN2C and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B or p27(Kip1)), or CDKN2C and TP53 gene disruption develop pituitary adenomas (PA) at high frequencies. The purpose of our study was to investigate genetic alterations of the CDKN2C gene by analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), screening for mutations, analysis of promoter methylation, and protein expression in 38 PAs. In addition, genomic alterations and protein expression of the cell cycle genes CDKN2A and its alternatively spliced form, p14(ARF), as well as the retinoblastoma RB1 gene were investigated. LOH at the CDKN2C gene locus was detected in 25% of pituitary adenomas, whereas the RB1 and CDKN2A loci were altered in only 10%. No mutations were detected within the coding regions of the CDKN2C gene. However, 39.5% of adenomas displayed CDKN2C promoter methylation. The absence of CDKN2C protein was correlated with LOH of the CDKN2C locus on chromosome 1 and with methylation of the CDKN2C promoter. This is the first report to describe that the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2C is frequently targeted by genomic alterations in pituitary adenoma. The most common genetic alteration was promoter methylation suggesting that inactivation of CDKN2C by this mechanism may play an important role in pituitary adenoma development.

Human EC are classified into two major groups: Type I displays endometroid histology, is hormone-dependent, and characterized by frequent microsatellite instability and PTEN, K-RAS, and CTNNB1 (beta-Catenin) mutations; Type II shows non-endometrioid histology, is hormone-unrelated, displays recurrent TP53 mutation, CDKN2A (P16) inactivation, over-expression of ERBB2 (Her2/neu), and reduced CDH1 (Cadherin 1 or E-Cadherin) expression. However, many human EC have overlapping clinical, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of types I and II. The EC developed in BDII rats can be related to type I tumors, since they are hormone-related and histologically from endometrioid type. Here, we combined gene sequencing (Pten, Ifr1, and Ctnnb1) and real-time gene expression analysis (Pten, Cdh1, P16, Erbb2, Ctnnb1, Tp53, and Irf1) to further characterize molecular alterations in this tumor model with respect to different subtypes of EC in humans. No mutation in Pten and Ctnnb1 was detected, whereas three tumors displayed sequence aberrations of the Irf1 gene. Significant down regulation of Pten, Cdh1, p16, Erbb2, and Ctnnb1 gene products was found in the tumors. In conclusion, our data suggest that molecular features of spontaneous EC in BDII rats can be related to higher-grade human type I tumors and thus, this model represents an excellent experimental tool for research on this malignancy in human.",

In the absence of a lipogenic component histologically, the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal DDL includes other sarcomas and, if the tumor has visceral involvement, sarcomatoid carcinoma. DDL demonstrates amplification of chromosome subregion 12q13-q15. Detection of the amplification itself, or the resulting overexpression of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes by genetic and immunohistochemical methods, is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of DDL. More recently, immunohistochemistry for p16, the product of the CDKN2A gene, was shown to be a useful adjunct in differentiating well-differentiated liposarcoma from benign adipocytic tumors. In the present study, we examined the utility of p16 immunohistochemistry to distinguish DDL (n=44) from other high-grade and low-grade retroperitoneal mimics (n=73). p16 positivity was observed in 43/44 (98%) DDLs, with the majority of these showing strong, diffuse, staining. The rate of p16 positivity in other retroperitoneal tumors was lower (37/73, 51%) and staining was not as consistently diffuse or intense. Furthermore, p16 positivity varied between the control sarcomas based on tumor type as follows: 11/11 leiomyosarcomas, 8/11 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas, 9/39 sarcomatoid carcinomas, 7/7 desmoid tumors, 1/3 endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 1/2 malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that p16 is highly sensitive for retroperitoneal DDL. However, the lack of specificity limits the diagnostic utility compared with the more established markers MDM2 and CDK4.",

Western blotting studies demonstrated that PPARgamma activation can upregulate the expression of p16(INK4alpha). PPARgamma can bind to the p16 promoter and induce its transcription, and, after treatment with a selective PPARgamma agonist, we observed more-robust expression of p16(INK4alpha) in senescent cells than in young cells.

In 7 cases the tumor infiltrated the optic nerve. Expression of p16 was studied by immunohistochemistry and recorded by assessment of the proportion of positive tumor cells and staining intensity. Results were expressed as staining index (IRS). Intragenic mutations were studied by PCR-SSCP followed by sequencing, while hypermethylation of the promoter region by CpG methylation assay. In 15% of cases less than 10% of melanoma cells were p16 positive, in 70% of cases less than 50% of cells, while in 7% more than 80% of cells stained for p16 (mean IRS for all cases was 4.87 +/- 2.43). In B type the IRS was 8.5 +/- 0.7, in A + B type 6.0 +/- 2.1 and in the mixed type 4.17 +/- 2.43 (differences statistically significant).

Formalin-fixed primary melanomas from 74 relapsed and 42 nonrelapsed patients were sequenced for common BRAF and NRAS mutations (N = 71 results) and gene dosage at 9p21.3 including the genes CDKN2A (which encodes CDKN2A and P14ARF), CDKN2B (CDKN2B), and MTAP was measured using multiplexed ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA), (N = 75 results). BRAF/NRAS mutations were detected in 77% of relapsers and 58% of nonrelapsers (Fisher's exact P = 0.17), and did not predict ulceration or mitotic rate. There was no relationship between BRAF/NRAS mutations and gene dosage at 9p21.3. Reduced gene dosage at MTAP showed a borderline association with BRAF mutation (P = 0.04) and reduced gene dosage at the interferon gene cluster was borderline associated with wild type NRAS (P = 0.05). Reduced gene dosage in the CDKN2A regions coding for CDKN2A was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P = 0.03). Reduced gene dosage across 9p21.3 was associated with increased tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration (P = 0.02, 0.02, and 0.002, respectively), specifically in coding regions impacting on CDKN2B and P14ARF and CDKN2A. Loss at MTAP (P = 0.05) and the interferon gene cluster (P = 0.03) on 9p21 was also associated with tumor ulceration. There was no association between reduced gene dosage at 9p21.3 and subtype or site of tumor. This study presents supportive evidence that CDKN2B, P14ARF, and CDKN2A may all play a tumor suppressor role in melanoma progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Somatically acquired DNA rearrangements are characteristic of many cancers. The use of these mutations as diagnostic markers is challenging, because tumor cells are frequently admixed with normal cells, particularly in early stage tumor samples, and thus the samples contain a high background of normal DNA. Detection is further confounded by the fact that the rearrangement boundaries are not conserved across individuals, and might vary over hundreds of kilobases. Here, we present an algorithm for designing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and oligonucleotide probes to assay for these variant rearrangements. Specifically, the primers and probes tile the entire genomic region surrounding a rearrangement, so as to amplify the mutant DNA over a wide range of possible breakpoints and robustly assay for the amplified signal on an array. Our solution involves the design of a complex combinatorial optimization problem, and also includes a novel alternating multiplexing strategy that makes efficient detection possible. Simulations show that we can achieve near-optimal detection in many different cases, even when the regions are highly non-symmetric. Additionally, we prove that the suggested multiplexing strategy is optimal in breakpoint detection. We applied our technique to create a custom design to assay for genomic lesions in several cancer cell-lines associated with a disruption in the CDKN2A locus. The CDKN2A deletion has highly variable boundaries across many cancers. We successfully detect the breakpoint in all cell-lines, even when the region has undergone multiple rearrangements. These results point to the development of a successful protocol for early diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. For online Supplementary Material, see www.liebertonline.com.",

After a few months the patient developed mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathies, and a nodal biopsy showed mesothelial cell proliferation invading lymphatic sinuses, consistent with the cells seen in the abdominal cavity. Since overt morphologic criteria for malignancy were lacking and reactive mesothelial cell deposits have been documented in lymph nodes, a molecular investigation of the CDKN2A (henceforth simply p16) gene status via fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed, which showed homozygous deletion in 100% tumor cells.

The molecular genetic profile of these two pathogenetic types, based on the genes reportedly mutated in these cancers, remains to be defined. Although microsatellite inability is reported in approximately 25% of endometrial carcinomas, its relation with the 2 pathogenetic types is not investigated.;To elucidate their underlying genetic changes, we analyzed 53 sporadic endometrial tumors, including 19 with and 34 without hyperplasia, for microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA ploidy (by flow cytometry), and for mutations in different genes.;Microsatellite instability was present in 21%, DNA nondiploidy in 15%, and mutations in the PTEN, KRAS, CTNNB1/beta-catenin, TP53, and CDKN2A genes were detected in 32, 11, 13, 17, and 0% of the tumors, respectively. Microsatellite instability and mutations in these genes were present in tumors both with and without complex atypical hyperplasia. All cases with complex atypical hyperplasia were early stage (I-II) endometrioid tumors and associated with long progression free disease (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, most tumors with hyperplasia had low World Health Organization or International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade, had less myometrial invasion, and showed expression of estrogen receptors. All MSI tumors were diploid and had a significantly higher rate of PTEN mutations, but similar rates of KRAS, beta-catenin, and TP53 mutations compared with microsatellite stable tumors. TP53 mutations more often were found in nondiploid tumors but never in tumors with PTEN, KRAS, or beta-catenin mutations, and all PTEN mutations occurred in diploid tumors.;Thus, PTEN, KRAS, beta-catenin, and TP53 mutations occurred in tumors both with and without hyperplasia, but PTEN and TP53 mutations were more common in tumors without hyperplasia. However, none of these genes seems to clearly distinguish tumors with and without hyperplasia, suggesting that other factors may be involved. Conversely, alterations in the PTEN and TP53 genes seem to define distinct subgroups of endometrial carcinoma, the former associated with diploidy and MSI, the latter with macroscopic chromosomal instability.",

Genetic analysis revealed two individuals with germline deletions in both copies of CDKN2A. One of them did not develop atypical naevi or melanoma, but died of adenocarcinoma at the age of 54 years. This report describes the results of the investigation of the second p16-null individual, who was also found to have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency and who has developed many atypical naevi and seven melanomas. Using electron microscopic techniques, striking alterations in melanosomal structures and deviations in their sulphur, iron and calcium composition indicating a strong preference for phaeomelanogenesis and increased oxidative stress were found in the naevus cells of the patient. Using an in vitro model, we demonstrated that leaking melanin precursors may strongly enhance oxidative DNA damage through iron release from ferritin. We conclude that the homozygous p16 deletion is not sufficient for the development of a dysplastic naevus phenotype and melanoma. However, when an additional modifying factor, such as G-6-PD deficiency, increases the level of oxidative DNA damage in melanin-producing cells, the risk of developing atypical naevi and their malignant transformation may increase significantly.",

At the molecular level, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer has many similarities to the inactive X chromosome in female cells and is defined and maintained by DNA methylation and characteristic histone modifications. In addition, the inactive-X is marked by the histone macroH2A, a variant of H2A with a large non-histone region of unknown function. Studying tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) silenced in cancer cell lines, we find that when active, these promoters are associated with H2A.Z but become enriched for macroH2A1 once silenced. Knockdown of macroH2A1 was not sufficient for reactivation of silenced genes. However, when combined with DNA demethylation, macroH2A1 deficiency significantly enhanced reactivation of the tumor suppressor genes p16, MLH1 and Timp3 and inhibited cell proliferation. Our findings link macroH2A1 to heterochromatin of epigenetically silenced cancer genes and indicate synergism between macroH2A1 and DNA methylation in maintenance of the silenced state.",

The basic underlying observation was that standard hypotonic PCR buffers prevent global cellular chromatin solubilization during thermal cycling while more loosely organized chromatin can be amplified. Despite repeated heating to >90 °C, 41 of 61 tested 5' sequences of silenced genes (CDKN2A, PU.1, IRF4, FOSB, CD34) were not amplifiable while 47 could be amplified from expressing cells. Two gene regions (IRF4, FOSB) even required pre-heating of cells in isotonic media to allow this differentiation; otherwise none of 19 assayed sequences yielded PCR products. Cells with baseline expression or epigenetic reactivation gave similar DC-PCR results. Silencing during differentiation of CD34 positive cord blood cells closed respective chromatin while treatment of myeloma cells with an IRF4 transcriptional inhibitor opened a site to DC-PCR that was occupied by RNA polymerase II and NFκB as determined by ChIP. Translation into real-time PCR can not be achieved with commercial real-time PCR buffers which potently open chromatin, but even with simple ethidium bromide addition to standard PCR mastermix we were able to identify hits in small molecules screens that suppressed IRF4 expression or reactivated CDKN2A in myeloma cells using densitometry or visual inspection of PCR plates under UV light. While need in drug development inspired this work, application to genome-wide analysis appears feasible using phi29 for selective amplification of open cellular chromatin followed by library construction from supernatants since such supernatants yielded similar results as gene specific DC-PCR.",

In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival.

The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%) were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway (n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A, CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1, MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively). In conclusion, genomic alterations are common in advanced HCC. Refractory patients with alterations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway demonstrated early signals of clinical activity when treated with therapies targeting mTOR. ",

This study sought to identify actionable gene targets by selective targeting of the molecular networks that support sarcoma cell proliferation. Silencing of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an amidotransferase that converts aspartate into asparagine, produced the strongest inhibitory effect on sarcoma growth in a functional genomic screen of mouse sarcomas generated by oncogenic Kras and disruption of Cdkn2a. ASNS silencing in mouse and human sarcoma cell lines reduced the percentage of S phase cells and impeded new polypeptide synthesis. These effects of ASNS silencing were reversed by exogenous supplementation with asparagine. Also, asparagine depletion via the ASNS inhibitor amino sulfoximine 5 (AS5) or asparaginase inhibited mouse and human sarcoma growth in vitro, and genetic silencing of ASNS in mouse sarcoma cells combined with depletion of plasma asparagine inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Asparagine reliance of sarcoma cells may represent a metabolic vulnerability with potential anti-sarcoma therapeutic value. ",

Stages II and III sporadic colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant FOLFOX were included. Eight CpG island loci (CACNA1G, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CDKN2A (p16), RUNX3 and SOCS1) and five microsatellite markers were examined. Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed according to CIMP and MSI status.

However, the molecular characteristics of recurrent ovarian cancers following initial treatment have been poorly estimated. This study was to investigate the pattern of somatic point mutations in matched paired samples of primary and recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers, using the OncoMap mutation detection protocol. We have adapted a high-throughput genotyping platform to determine the mutation status of a large panel of known cancer genes. OncoMap v.4.4 was used to evaluate genomic DNA isolated from a set of 92 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors, consisting of matched paired samples of initially diagnosed and recurrent tumors from 46 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Mutations were observed in 33.7% of the samples, with 29.3% of these samples having a single mutation and the remaining 4.3% having two or more mutations. Among the 41 genes analyzed, 35 mutations were found in four genes, namely, CDKN2A (2.2%), KRAS (6.5%), MLH1 (8.2%) and TP53 (20.7%). TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene, but there was no correlation between the presence of mutation in any gene and clinical prognosis. Furthermore, somatic mutations did not differ between primary and recurrent ovarian carcinomas. Every mutation present in recurrent samples was detected in the corresponding primary sample. In conclusion, these OncoMap data of Korean EOC samples provide that somatic mutations were found in CDKN2A, KRAS, MLH1, and TP53. No differences in mutational status between primary and recurrent samples were detected. To understand the biology of tumor recurrence in epithelial ovarian cancer, more studies are necessary, including epigenetic modifications or additional mutations in other genes. ",

In order to further investigate the role of MBD4 in methylation-based transcriptional repression, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed, and the RET finger protein (RFP) was found to be one of the major proteins that interact with the transcriptional repression domain in MBD4. The effect of the MBD4-mediated transcriptional repression in methylated CDKN2A and MLH1 promoters was extremely enhanced by the overexpression of RFP. Furthermore, RFP forms a protein complex not only with MBD4 but also with MBD2 or MBD3 and was shown to enhance transcriptional repression through MBD2. These results suggest that RFP is a mediator connecting several MBD proteins and allowing the formation of a more potent transcriptional repressor complex.

The exact role of the two proteins encoded by this complex locus in this predisposition is unclear. Most mutations affect either CDKN2A only or products of both genes. Recently a deletion affecting ARF-specific exon 1beta was reported in a family with melanoma and neural tumours. However, the possibility of this deletion also altering the CDKN2A transcript could not be excluded. More convincingly, a 16 base pair insertion in exon 1beta has been reported in an individual with multiple melanomas suggesting a direct role for ARF in melanoma predisposition. We report here a splice mutation in exon 1beta in a family with melanoma that results in ARF haploinsufficiency. The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma. A sibling of the mother with breast cancer also had this mutation. Analysis of the melanoma from one individual revealed a 62 bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both CDKN2A and ARF. These somatic events suggest that concomitant inactivation of both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser predisposition. In this situation, the events follow a 'three-hit' model as observed in tumours from FAP patients with an attenuated phenotype. Overall, the data suggest a direct role for ARF haploinsufficiency in melanoma predisposition and co-operation between ARF and CDKN2A in tumour formation, consistent with recent observations in Cdkn2a-specific knockout mice.",

Here, we report that nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. No evidence of drug-induced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate in activating p53.

Although this loss activates the cell-cycle-dependent kinases CDK4/6, which have been considered as drug targets for many years, p16(INK4A)-deficient PDAC cells are inherently resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. This study searched for targeted therapies that might synergize with CDK4/6 inhibition in this setting. We report that the IGF1R/IR inhibitor BMS-754807 cooperated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 to strongly block proliferation of p16(INK4A)-deficient PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo. Sensitivity to this drug combination correlated with reduced activity of the master cell growth regulator mTORC1. Accordingly, replacing the IGF1R/IR inhibitor with the rapalog inhibitor temsirolimus broadened the sensitivity of PDAC cells to CDK4/6 inhibition. Our results establish targeted therapy combinations with robust cytostatic activity in p16(INK4A)-deficient PDAC cells and possible implications for improving treatment of a broad spectrum of human cancers characterized by p16(INK4A) loss.",

Transcriptional repressor Id1 is overexpressed in many malignancies including melanoma, and Id1 targets include tumor suppressor genes TSP1, CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN1A (p21), which are frequently epigenetically silenced in cancer. We confirmed that both TSP1 and CDKN2A have abnormal promoter region DNA methylation in primary melanoma, but the mechanism by which this silencing occurs remains unknown. Here we explore the effects of stable lentiviral Id1 overexpression on the expression of these Id1 target genes in human melanoma cell lines. Overexpressed Id1 was functional and bound transcriptional activator E2A, but did not sequester E2A from gene promoters and repress gene expression. Therefore, these Id1 target genes were resistant to Id1-mediated gene silencing. Our results suggest that Id1 activation may need to occur at discrete stages in cooperation with additional gene dysregulation to repress and induce epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes during melanoma progression.",

However, even for a specific rearrangement, the breakpoints may vary between individuals, such as the recurrent CDKN2A deletion. Characterizing the exact breakpoints for structural variants (SVs) is useful for designating patient-specific tumor biomarkers. We propose AmBre (Amplification of Breakpoints), a method to target SV breakpoints occurring in samples composed of heterogeneous tumor and germline DNA. Additionally, AmBre validates SVs called by whole-exome/genome sequencing and hybridization arrays. AmBre involves a PCR-based approach to amplify the DNA segment containing an SV's breakpoint and then confirms breakpoints using sequencing by Pacific Biosciences RS. To amplify breakpoints with PCR, primers tiling specified target regions are carefully selected with a simulated annealing algorithm to minimize off-target amplification and maximize efficiency at capturing all possible breakpoints within the target regions. To confirm correct amplification and obtain breakpoints, PCR amplicons are combined without barcoding and simultaneously long-read sequenced using a single SMRT cell. Our algorithm efficiently separates reads based on breakpoints. Each read group supporting the same breakpoint corresponds with an amplicon and a consensus amplicon sequence is called. AmBre was used to discover CDKN2A deletion breakpoints in cancer cell lines: A549, CEM, Detroit562, MOLT4, MCF7, and T98G. Also, we successfully assayed RUNX1-RUNX1T1 reciprocal translocations by finding both breakpoints in the Kasumi-1 cell line. AmBre successfully targets SVs where DNA harboring the breakpoints are present in 1:1000 mixtures. ",

We also demonstrate linked overexpression of BMI1 and patched (PTCH), suggestive of SHH pathway activation, in a substantial fraction of primary human medulloblastomas. Together with the rapid induction of Bmi1 expression on addition of Shh or on overexpression of the Shh target Gli1 in cerebellar granule cell cultures, these findings implicate BMI1 overexpression as an alternative or additive mechanism in the pathogenesis of medulloblastomas, and highlight a role for Bmi1-containing polycomb complexes in proliferation of cerebellar precursor cells.",

MTAP is frequently lost due to its proximity to the commonly deleted tumor suppressor gene, CDKN2A. We observed increased intracellular concentrations of methylthioadenosine (MTA, the metabolite cleaved by MTAP) in cells harboring MTAP deletions. Furthermore, MTA specifically inhibited PRMT5 enzymatic activity. Administration of either MTA or a small-molecule PRMT5 inhibitor showed a modest preferential impairment of cell viability for MTAP-null cancer cell lines compared with isogenic MTAP-expressing counterparts.

We investigated this hypothesis in HK-2 cells and primary proximal tubular cells in vitro. CsA induced the production of H2O2, caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and inhibited DNA synthesis. Furthermore, CsA exposure lead to a reduction of telomere length, increased p53 serine 15 phosphorylation, and caused an upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Kip1) (CDKN1A) mRNA levels. CsA caused an increase in p16(INK4a) (CDKN2A) expression after a 13-day exposure in primary proximal tubular cells but not in HK-2 cells. Coincubation of cells with CsA and catalase was able to prevent telomere shortening and partially restored DNA synthesis.

Consistent with the notion that loss of replicative potential provides a barrier for reprogramming, here we show that cells with low endogenous p19(Arf) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a locus) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies with up to threefold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher efficiency than wild-type cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with the potential to form iPS cells.

Tumor suppressor gene loss was based on loss of heterozygosity situated within or adjacent to specific genes of interest (APC, CDKN2A, DCC, MET, MYC1, OGG1, p34, p53, PTEN). Microdissected tissue was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with flanking oligonucleotides bearing fluorescent labels designed for GeneScan fragment analysis; PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis. Normal microdissected tissue samples for each case were evaluated for informative status with respect to individual alleles for 18 microsatellites at 10 genomic loci-1p, 3p, 5q, 7q, 8q, 9p, 10q, 17p, 17q, 18q. The measure of allelic loss of heterozygosity combined with tumor number, tumor size, vascular invasion, lobar distribution, and patient gender provide a highly discriminatory model for predicting cancer recurrence after liver transplantation.

NF-kappaB p65 has been shown to be activated in melanoma cell lines but few studies decribe its expression in the tissue. In the present study we focused on synchronous expression of p16INK4A and NF-kappaB p65 and their functional activation in melanoma cell lines and biopsy tissue. Activation of NF-kappaB p65, as observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in cell lines, was correlated with expression and cellular localization of the active and inactive forms of its inhibitor, IkappaB-alpha. In melanocytic lesions, p16INK4A and NF-kappaB p65 expression were inversely correlated with levels of the nuclear component of NF-kappaB p65 increasing from nevi to primary melanomas and metastases.",

Here, using xenografting and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling of human BCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia, we demonstrate that genetic diversity occurs in functionally defined leukaemia-initiating cells and that many diagnostic patient samples contain multiple genetically distinct leukaemia-initiating cell subclones. Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of leukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts, whereas in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and a trend towards poorer patient outcome. Our findings link clonal diversity with leukaemia-initiating-cell function and underscore the importance of developing therapies that eradicate all intratumoral subclones.",

Mice model harboring large deletion of posterior part of ANRIL and CAD high risk genetic markers resulted in substantial suppression of both CDKN2A and CDKN2B; however, the mechanistic insights of regulation and function of ANRIL have remain elusive. To date multiple splice variants of ANRIL have been reported and expression of specific splice variant of ANRIL has been shown to be tightly associated with 9p21 CAD high risk markers. Here we identified a new splice variant of ANRIL and introduced it into HeLa cells to uncover functional aspects of ANRIL towards cellular function. For this purpose, we monitored global mRNA expressional changes and conducted gene ontology enrichment. The majority of mRNAs was down-regulated by ANRIL overexpression. Among them, a subset of mRNAs particularly involved in the regulation of nucleus and establishment or maintenance of chromatin architecture was significantly enriched. Such a circumstance was manifested after 48 h of ANRIL overexpression but no significant changes were seen after 24 h of ANRIL overexpression. Next we analyzed the sequences containing the intergenic region between ANRIL and CDKN2A (p14ARF) by introducing the sequences upstream of luciferase reporter gene. Based on the luciferase activity, the sequences tested were shown to act as promoter for ANRIL and p14ARF. Moreover, as well p14ARF, ANRIL promoter was responsive to transcription factor E2F1 in HeLa and A549 cells. Taken together, our present results indicate that co-regulation of ANRIL and p14ARF could be coupled by their unique intergenic region potentially through E2F1. Judged from the suppressive effect of ANRIL on a subset of mRNAs involved in the nuclear function suggests that ANRIL might have silencing effect on a specific gene set that accounts for a wide array of gene expression.",

ATM is frequently inactivated in human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including ~50% of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) characterized by ectopic expression of CyclinD1. Here we report that early and robust deletion of ATM in precursor/progenitor B cells causes cell autonomous, clonal mature B-cell lymphomas of both pre- and post-germinal center (GC) origins. Unexpectedly, naive B-cell-specific deletion of ATM is not sufficient to induce lymphomas in mice, highlighting the important tumor suppressor function of ATM in immature B cells. Although EμCyclinD1 is not sufficient to induce lymphomas, EμCyclinD1 accelerates the kinetics and increases the incidence of clonal lymphomas in ATM-deficient B-cells and skews the lymphomas toward pre-GC-derived small lymphocytic neoplasms, sharing morphological features of human MCL. This is in part due to CyclinD1-driven expansion of ATM-deficient naive B cells with genomic instability, which promotes the deletions of additional tumor suppressor genes (i.e. Trp53, Mll2, Rb1 and Cdkn2a). Together these findings define a synergistic function of ATM and CyclinD1 in pre-GC B-cell proliferation and lymphomagenesis and provide a prototypic animal model to study the pathogenesis of human MCL.

DNA was extracted and hybridizations were performed on Agilent 244K CGH oligoarrays. The data were analyzed using Agilent DNA Analytics Software. The number of changes per patient ranged from 0 to 132 (average = 43). Losses were most commonly detected at 6q, 8p, 9p, 10, 13q, and 20p. CDKN2A was homozygously deleted in 7/11 patients.

Melanoma susceptibility genes CDKN2A and CDK4 play a role in the development of melanoma, especially among some familial melanoma kindreds. The functions of CDKN2A and CDK4 in melanoma development, however, are currently incompletely understood. Therefore, at this time, predictive genetic testing for CDKN2A mutations outside of defined research protocols is not recommended because of the low likelihood of detecting mutations even in high-risk groups, the present inadequacy of interpreting a test result due to variations in penetrance and unclear associations with other cancers, and the minimal influence knowledge of mutation status currently has on medical management.

Tbx3-deficient hepatoblasts presented severe defects in proliferation as well as uncontrollable hepatobiliary lineage segregation, including the promotion of cholangiocyte (biliary epithelial cell) differentiation, which thereby caused abnormal liver development. Deletion of Tbx3 resulted in the increased expression of the tumor suppressor p19(ARF) (Cdkn2a), which in turn induced a growth arrest in hepatoblasts and activated a program of cholangiocyte differentiation.

Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed increased EGFR dosage in 28% of MPNSTs. ERBB2 and three tumor suppressor genes (PTEN [phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10], CDKN2A [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A], and TP53 [tumor protein p53]) were frequently lost or reduced. Reduction of CDKN2A was linked to appearance of metastasis. Comparison of corresponding neurofibromas and MPNSTs revealed an increase in genetic lesions in MPNSTs. No somatic mutations were found within tyrosine-kinase-encoding exons of EGFR and ERBB2. However, at the protein level, expression of EGFR and erbB2 was frequently detected in MPNSTs. EGFR expression was significantly associated with increased EGFR gene dosage. The EGFR ligands transforming growth factor alpha and EGF were more strongly expressed in MPNSTs than in neurofibromas.

More than 70% of recurring chromosomal rearrangements in T-ALL activate the expression of oncogenic transcription factors, belonging mostly to three families, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), homeobox (HOX), and c-MYB. This prevalence is indicative of their importance in the T lineage, and their dominant mechanisms of transformation. For example, bHLH oncoproteins inhibit E2A and HEB, revealing their tumor suppressor function in the thymus. The induction of T-ALL, nonetheless, requires collaboration with constitutive NOTCH1 signaling and the pre-TCR, as well as loss-of-function mutations for CDKN2A and PTEN. Significantly, NOTCH1, the pre-TCR pathway, and E2A/HEB proteins control critical checkpoints and branchpoints in early thymocyte development whereas several oncogenic transcription factors, HOXA9, c-MYB, SCL, and LYL-1 control HSC self-renewal. Together, these genetic lesions alter key regulatory processes in the cell, favoring self-renewal and subvert the normal control of thymocyte homeostasis.",

Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization. Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role. Furthermore, Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates Kras(G12D) activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a Kras(G12D)-cooperating oncogene required for Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.",

This combination had minimal effects on healthy donor cells and retained activity when tested in a co-culture system simulating the protective interaction of cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment. Combining sirolimus with entinostat enhanced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At the molecular level, entinostat increased the expression of cell cycle negative regulators including CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16), while the combination decreased critical growth and survival effectors including Cyclin D, BCL-XL, BIRC5, and activated MAPK.",

Furthermore, the NK-cell receptor complex CD94/NKG2 was strongly expressed, as shown by examination with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.",

Because the source of samples used in these prior studies may not have been representative of the general population, we have reinvestigated this issue using samples from a population-based study. A total of 15 MSI+ tumors were identified, and they were compared with 47 MSI- tumors that were similar in distribution by age, sex, and race. Microdissected tumor and normal adjacent mucosal DNA samples from each patient were subjected to a quantitative DNA methylation analysis at 13 separate CpG dinucleotides located in five CpG islands in four different genes [APC, ESR1 (ER), CDKN2A (p16; promoter and exon 2), and MLH1]. Four of five CpG islands showed a statistically significantly increased level of methylation in tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal mucosa. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find any statistically significant correlations between MSI status and methylation levels of any of the CpG islands other than MLH1. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between MLH1 methylation and CDKN2A methylation (P = 0.03), whereas no association was noted between MSI positivity and CDKN2A methylation (P = 0.95). The latter results suggest a possible defect in the protection against CpG island hypermethylation shared between CDKN2A and MLH1 and do not support the notion of a functional association between CDKN2A methylation and the phenotype of mismatch repair deficiency.",

However, little is known regarding the function of p15INK4B translated from the same locus. To determine the frequency of CDKN2AB loss in human mutant KRAS lung cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was interrogated. Two-hit inactivation of CDKN2A and CDKN2B occurs frequently in patients with mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, p15INK4B loss occurs in the presence of biallelic inactivation of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), suggesting that p15INK4B loss confers a selective advantage to mutant KRAS lung cancers that are p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) deficient. To determine the significance of CDKN2AB loss in vivo, genetically engineered lung cancer mouse models that express mutant Kras in the respiratory epithelium were utilized. Importantly, complete loss of CDKN2AB strikingly accelerated mutant Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis, leading to loss of differentiation, increased metastatic disease, and decreased overall survival. Primary mutant Kras lung epithelial cells lacking Cdkn2ab had increased clonogenic potential. Furthermore, comparative analysis of mutant Kras;Cdkn2a null with Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice and experiments with mutant KRAS;CDKN2AB-deficient human lung cancer cells indicated that p15INK4B is a critical tumor suppressor. Thus, the loss of CDKN2AB is of biologic significance in mutant KRAS lung tumorigenesis by fostering cellular proliferation, cancer cell differentiation, and metastatic behavior.;These findings indicate that mutant Kras;Cdkn2ab null mice provide a platform for accurately modeling aggressive lung adenocarcinoma and testing therapeutic modalities.",

Genetic and epigenetic studies on HCC may help to understand better its mechanisms and provide new tools for early diagnosis and therapy. Recent literature on whole genome analysis of HCC indicated a high number of mutated genes in addition to well-known genes such as TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1 and CDKN2A, but their frequencies are much lower. Apart from CTNNB1 mutations, most of the other mutations appear to result in loss-of-function. Thus, HCC-associated mutations cannot be easily targeted for therapy.

This natural agent selectively affects PCa cell viability in a dose and time-dependent manner, without affecting primary prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, AG showed differential effect on cell cycle phases in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 cells compared to retinoblastoma protein (RB(-/-)) and CDKN2A lacking DU-145 cells. G2/M transition was blocked in LNCaP, C4-2b and PC3 after AG treatment whereas DU-145 cells failed to transit G1/S phase. This difference was primarily due to differential activation of cell cycle regulators in these cell lines. Levels of cyclin A2 after AG treatment increased in all PCa cells line. Cyclin B1 levels increased in LNCaP and PC3, decreased in C4-2b and showed no difference in DU-145 cells after AG treatment. AG decreased cyclin E2 levels only in PC3 and DU-145 cells.

Some DFSP progress to a higher-grade fibrosarcomatous form, with rapid growth and increased risk of metastasis. Imatinib provides clinical benefit in approximately 50% of patients with unresectable or metastatic DFSP. However, efficacious medical therapies have not been developed for imatinib-resistant DFSP. We established a model of imatinib-resistant DFSP and evaluated CDK4/6 inhibition as a genomically credentialed targeted therapy. DFSP105, an imatinib-resistant human cell line, was established from a fibrosarcomatous DFSP (FS-DFSP), and was studied by SNP arrays and sequencing to identify targetable genomic alterations. Findings were validated in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed in a series including 12 DFSP and 6 FS-DFSP. SNP analysis of DFSP105 revealed a homozygous deletion encompassing CDKN2A and CDKN2B. The resultant p16 loss implicated CDK4/6 as a potential therapeutic target in DFSP. We further demonstrated CDKN2A homozygous deletion in 1 of 12 conventional DFSP and 2 of 6 FS-DFSP, whereas p16 expression was lost in 4 of 18 DFSP. In vitro treatment of DFSP105 with two structurally distinct selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, PD-0332991 and LEE011, led to inhibition of RB1 phosphorylation and inhibition of proliferation (GI50 160 nmol/L and 276 nmol/L, respectively). In vivo treatment of DFSP105 with PD-0332991 (150 mg/kg) inhibited xenograft growth in mice, in comparison with imatinib-treated or -untreated tumors. In conclusion, CDKN2A deletion can contribute to DFSP progression. CDK4/6 inhibition is a preclinically effective treatment against p16-negative, imatinib-resistant FS-DFSP, and should be evaluated as a therapeutic strategy in patients with unresectable or metastatic imatinib-resistant DFSP.",

We show here that Kaiso represses methylated tumor suppressor genes and can bind in a methylation-dependent manner to the CDKN2A in human colon cancer cell lines. The contribution of Kaiso to epigenetic silencing was underlined by the fact that Kaiso depletion induced tumor suppressor gene expression without affecting DNA methylation levels. As a consequence, colon cancer cells became susceptible to cell cycle arrest and cell death mediated by chemotherapy. The data suggest that Kaiso is a methylation-dependent \"opportunistic\" oncogene that silences tumor suppressor genes when they become hypermethylated.

Despite the progress in glioblastoma cell culturing, the cells isolated from the majority of specimens cannot be propagated infinitely in vitro. The aim of this study was to identify the processes responsible for the stabilization failure. Therefore, we analyzed 56 primary GB cultures, 7 of which were stabilized. Our results indicate that senescence is primarily responsible for the glioblastoma cell line stabilization failure, while mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis play a minor role. Moreover, a new technical approach allowed for a more profound analysis of the senescent cells in primary cultures, including the distinction between tumor and normal cells. In addition, we observed that glioblastoma cells in primary cultures have a varied potential to undergo spontaneous in vitro senescence, which is often higher than that of the normal cells infiltrating the tumor. Thus, this is the first report of GB cells in primary cell cultures (including both monolayer and spheroid conditions) rapidly and spontaneously becoming senescent. Intriguingly, our data also suggest that nearly half of GB cell lines have a combination of TP53 mutation and CDKN2A homozygous deletion, which are considered as mutually exclusive in glioblastoma. Moreover, recognition of the mechanisms of senescence and mitotic catastrophe in glioblastoma cells may be a step towards a potential new therapeutic approach. ",

In this study, we compared 14 SCLC cell lines against 27 NSCLC cell lines using an integrated array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression profiling approach to identify subtype-specific disruptions. Using stringent criteria, we have identified 159 of the genes that are responsible for the different biology of these cell types. Sorting of these genes by their biological functions revealed the differential disruption of key components involved in cell cycle pathways. Our novel comparative combined genome and transcriptome analysis not only identified differentially altered genes, but also revealed that certain shared pathways are preferentially disrupted at different steps in these cell types. Small cell lung cancer exhibited increased expression of MRP5, activation of Wnt pathway inhibitors, and upregulation of p38 MAPK activating genes, while NSCLC showed downregulation of CDKN2A, and upregulation of MAPK9 and EGFR. This information suggests that cell cycle upregulation in SCLC and NSCLC occurs through drastically different mechanisms, highlighting the need for differential molecular target selection in the treatment of these cancers.",

Identification of new molecular targets is clearly needed to improve therapeutic outcomes of this devastating human disease. Activating mutations in K-Ras oncogene and increased expression of FOXM1 protein are associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Transgenic expression of activated Kras(G12D) in mouse respiratory epithelium is sufficient to induce lung adenocarcinomas; however, transcriptional mechanisms regulated by K-Ras during the initiation of lung cancer remain poorly understood. Foxm1 transcription factor, a downstream target of K-Ras, stimulates cellular proliferation during embryogenesis, organ repair and tumor growth, but its role in tumor initiation is unknown. In the present study, we used transgenic mice expressing Kras(G12D) under control of Sftpc promoter to demonstrate that Foxm1 was induced in type II epithelial cells before the formation of lung tumors. Conditional deletion of Foxm1 from Kras(G12D)-expressing respiratory epithelium prevented the initiation of lung tumors in vivo. The loss of Foxm1 inhibited expression of K-Ras target genes critical for the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, including Ikbkb, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, Rela, Jnk1, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a. Transgenic overexpression of activated FOXM1 mutant was sufficient to induce expression of these genes in alveolar type II cells. FOXM1 directly bound to promoter regions of Ikbkb, Nfkb2, N-Myc, Pttg1 and Cdkn2a, indicating that these genes are direct FOXM1 targets. FOXM1 is required for K-Ras-mediated lung tumorigenesis by activating genes critical for the NF-κB and JNK pathways. ",

Most tumors were convexity or parasagittal meningiomas. The number of recurrences studied per tumor varied from 1 to 5. Besides histological methods, immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 MIB-1, TUNEL for apoptosis, counts of mitoses and molecular genetics for CDKN2A were performed. No variation of the mitotic index (MI) or MIB-1 labeling index (LI) was observed in recurrences. Histological features, the number of mitoses and the MIB-1 LI showed a great regional variability. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of CDKN2A was found to be slightly more frequent in the first recurrence than in the initial tumor, but it was lower in the following recurrences. The nervous tissue adjacent to the tumor could contain meningothelial cells and be responsible for recurrences. The number of mitoses appeared to be the most important criterion for establishing the tumor grade. The histological aspect does not change in recurrences and there is no progression. The greater number of recurrences in atypical and anaplastic tumors depends on their initial higher proliferation capacity.

The molecular mechanisms that underlie NF1 tumorigenesis are still poorly understood although inactivation of other modifying loci in conjunction with NF1 mutations is postulated to be involved. These modifying loci may include deficiencies in mismatch repair genes and elements involved in cell cycle regulation (TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A). We have analyzed the somatic mutations in 89 cutaneous neurofibromas derived from three unrelated NF1 patients with high tumor burden, by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the NF1, TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A genes, by assessing microsatellite instability (MSI), by direct sequencing of the NF1, TP53, and several mismatch repair (MMR) genes and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the NF1 and TP53 genes. The aim was both to assess the possible clonality of these tumors and also to assess the involvement of other potential genetic loci in the development of these neurofibromas. Somatic NF1 mutations were identified in 57 (64%) of neurofibroma samples. Each mutation was distinct demonstrating the independent origin of each tumor. While somatic LOH of the TP53 gene was identified in four tumors, no specific deletions or sequence variations were identified. LOH of markers flanking the RB1 gene was also found in one tumor but no CDKN2A mutations were detected. Although evidence of MSI was seen in 21 tumors, no MMR gene alterations were identified.

Overexpression of Bmi1 has been described in medulloblastoma, highly aggressive brain neoplasms of childhood, which are thought to originate from deregulated proliferation of granule cell precursors. Here, we dissected the molecular mechanisms mediating the role of Bmi1 in granule cell development by means of transcriptome analysis in loss of function mouse models in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that lack of Bmi1 causes significant shift in gene expression levels in Shh stimulated cerebellar granule progenitors.

This is in direct contrast to pediatric tumors that usually develop as a result of specific chromosomal translocations and epigenetic aberrations. The development of genomic instability is associated with mutations that contribute to cellular immortalization and transformation. Cancer occurs when cancer-initiating cells (CICs), also called cancer stem cells, develop as a result of these mutations. In this paper, we explore how CICs develop as a result of genomic instability, including looking at which cancer suppression mechanisms are abrogated. A recent in vitro study revealed the existence of a CIC induction pathway in differentiating stem cells. Under aberrant differentiation conditions, cells become senescent and develop genomic instabilities that lead to the development of CICs. The resulting CICs contain a mutation in the alternative reading frame of CDKN2A (ARF)/p53 module, i.e., in either ARF or p53. We summarize recently established knowledge of CIC development and cellular immortality, explore the role of the ARF/p53 module in protecting cells from transformation, and describe a risk factor for genomic destabilization that increases during the process of normal cell growth and differentiation and is associated with the downregulation of histone H2AX to levels representative of growth arrest in normal cells.

Loss-of-function approaches targeting individual PRC2 subunits have, however, generated findings that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we prevent assembly of both Ezh1- and Ezh2-containing PRC2 complexes by conditional deletion of Eed, a core subunit, and assess hematopoiesis. We find that deletion of Eed exhausts adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), although fetal liver HSCs are produced in normal numbers. Eed-null neonatal HSCs express HSC signature genes but are defective in maintenance and differentiation. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that neonatal and adult HSCs lacking Eed upregulated gene sets of conflicting pathways. Deletion of Cdkn2a, a PRC2 target gene, in Eed-null mice enhances hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) survival but fails to restore HSC functions. Taken together, our findings define developmental-stage-specific requirements for canonical PRC2 complexes in normal HSC function.",

These nucleoside compounds are prone to rapid enzymatic inactivation in blood, posing challenges to the development of purely epigenetic dosing schedules. Non-nucleoside compounds that suppress expression or function of DNMT1 may overcome this problem. Using a high-throughput PCR-based site specific chromatin condensation assay, we identified a compound that reactivated Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) in myeloma cells and suppressed expression of DNMT1 from a library of 5120 chemically diverse small molecules. Lead optimization was performed to generate 26 new analogs with lung cancer proliferation and DNMT1 expression as activity readout.

In mice, the manipulation of cell cycle inhibitors such as CDKN1B (p27) and CDKN1A (p21) modifies the risk of developing atherosclerosis. In humans, CDKN1A, CDKN1B and CDKN1C (p57) are differentially expressed in normal versus atherosclerotic vessels. A DNA-polymorphism within the CDKN1B promoter has been associated with myocardial infarction (MI). In the present study, we analyzed the effect of CDKN1A, CDKN1C and CDKN2A (p16) polymorphisms on MI-risk. A total of 316 patients (all male, < 55 years) and 434 controls were genotyped, and the allele and genotype frequencies were compared between the two groups. Two CDKN1C polymorphisms, a promoter GT-repeat and a variable number of repeats of the amino acid PAPA-motif, were associated with MI. The presence of two alleles < or = 11-repeats (9/11, 10/11 and 11/11 genotypes) was significantly less frequent among patients (p < 0.001). This difference was also significant when analyzing the subpopulation of smokers (p = 0.004), suggesting a protective role for these low-repeat genotypes (OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.32-0.73). The PAPA-BB homozygotes were significantly less frequent in patients, but this could be attributed to a linkage disequilibrium between the 11-repeats and B alleles. No significantly different frequencies between patients and controls for the four CDKN1A (-1026A/G, -754G/C, -369G/C and Ser31Arg) and the three CDKN2A (-523 G/A, +22 G/A and Ala148Thr) polymorphisms was found.

To address this issue, we have generated composite tamoxifen-inducible intestine-specific genetic mouse models and analyzed the expression of intestinal differentiation markers. Importantly, we found that activation of β-catenin partially rescues the differentiation phenotype of Rbpj deletion mutants, but not the loss of the ISC compartment. Moreover, we identified Bmi1, which is expressed in the ISC and progenitor compartments, as a gene that is co-regulated by Notch and β-catenin. Loss of Bmi1 resulted in reduced proliferation in the ISC compartment accompanied by p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) (splice variants of Cdkn2a) accumulation, and increased differentiation to the post-mitotic goblet cell lineage that partially mimics Notch loss-of-function defects.

Among these mutated genes, driver genes are defined as being causally linked to oncogenesis, while passenger genes are thought to be irrelevant for cancer development. With increasing numbers of large-scale genomic datasets available, integrating these genomic data to identify driver genes from aberration regions of cancer genomes becomes an important goal of cancer genome analysis and investigations into mechanisms responsible for cancer development. A computational method, MAXDRIVER, is proposed here to identify potential driver genes on the basis of copy number aberration (CNA) regions of cancer genomes, by integrating publicly available human genomic data. MAXDRIVER employs several optimization strategies to construct a heterogeneous network, by means of combining a fused gene functional similarity network, gene-disease associations and a disease phenotypic similarity network. MAXDRIVER was validated to effectively recall known associations among genes and cancers. Previously identified as well as novel driver genes were detected by scanning CNAs of breast cancer, melanoma and liver carcinoma. Three predicted driver genes (CDKN2A, AKT1, RNF139) were found common in these three cancers by comparative analysis. ",

Analysis of copy number alterations (CNAs) showed that the xenografted leukemia, even when reconstituted from 100 cells, remained highly related to the diagnostic sample, with minor changes in CNAs, mostly deletions, emerging in most cases in the first passage into mice. At the single-cell level, the pattern of monoallelic and biallelic deletions of the CDKN2A locus revealed distinct leukemia subpopulations, which were reproducibly tracked in xenografts. In most very high risk ALL cases, the predominant diagnostic clones were reconstituted in xenografts, as shown by multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci. In other cases, the pattern in CNAs and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangement was less concordant in xenografts, suggesting the outgrowth of subclones. These results unequivocally demonstrate the existence of clonally closely related but distinct subsets of leukemia initiating cells in ALL, which has important implications for drug development and preclinical disease modeling.",

Previous studies showed that jararhagin, from the Bothrops jararaca snake venom, induces changes in the morphology and viability of SK-Mel-28 human melanoma cells, and decreases the number of metastases in mice injected with pre-treated cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular effects of jararhagin on SK-Mel-28 cells and fibroblasts, concerning the expression of integrins, cadherins, caspases, and TP53 genes. Sub-toxic doses of jararhagin were administered to confluent cells. RT-PCR was performed following extraction of total RNA. Jararhagin treatments induced similar morphological alterations in both normal and tumor cells, with higher IC50 values for fibroblasts. Integrin genes were downregulated in untreated cells, except for ITGA6a,b, ITGAv, and ITGB3 which were highly expressed in SK-Mel-28. The integrin expression profiles were not affected by the toxin. However, jararhagin 30ng/μl upregulated genes TP53, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CASP3, CASP5, CASP6, CASP8, and E-CDH in SK-Mel-28, and genes ITGB6, ITGB7, CASP3, TP53, and CDKN1B in fibroblasts.

The studies in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) reveal that Kras-activating mutations predispose mice to early onset tumors in the lung, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, most of these tumors do not have metastatic phenotypes. Metastasis occurs when tumors acquire additional genetic changes in other cancer driver genes. Studies on clinical specimens also demonstrated that KRAS mutations are present in premalignant tissues and that most of KRAS mutant human cancers have co-mutations in other cancer driver genes, including TP53, STK11, CDKN2A, and KMT2C in lung cancer; APC, TP53, and PIK3CA in colon cancer; and TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and MED12 in pancreatic cancer. Extensive efforts have been devoted to develop therapeutic agents that target enzymes involved in RAS posttranslational modifications, that inhibit downstream effectors of RAS signaling pathways, and that kill RAS mutant cancer cells through synthetic lethality. Recent clinical studies have revealed that sorafenib, a pan-RAF and VEGFR inhibitor, has impressive benefits for KRAS mutant lung cancer patients. Combination therapy of MEK inhibitors with either docetaxel, AKT inhibitors, or PI3K inhibitors also led to improved clinical responses in some KRAS mutant cancer patients. This review discusses knowledge gained from GEMMs, human cancer cells, and patient-related studies on RAS-mediated tumorigenesis and anti-RAS therapy. Emerging evidence demonstrates that RAS mutant cancers are heterogeneous because of the presence of different mutant alleles and/or co-mutations in other cancer driver genes.

We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REGγ. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REGγ or by pharmacologic blockade of its nuclear export. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of 2 key tumor suppressors mediated by a REGγ-dependent mechanism. The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell-cycle function.;The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell cycle function.

Oleuropein which is active compound of olive leaves, belongs to polyphenols group and has antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive and anti-carcinogenic effects. The aim of the study is to determine the therapeutic effects of oleuropein on cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptotic mechanisms in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line under in vitro conditions. The effect of oleuropein on cell viability was determined by XTT method. 84 cell cycle control and 84 apoptosis related genes were evaluated by RT-PCR. Effects of oleuropein on apoptosis were researched by TUNEL assay. Protein expressions were determined by western blot analysis. Effects of oleuropein on cell invasion, colony formation and migration were detected by matrigel-chamber, colony formation assay and wound-healing assay, respectively. IC50 value of oleuropein in SH-SY5Y cells was detected as 350 μM at 48th hours. It is determined that oleuropein causes cell cycle arrest by down-regulating of CylinD1,CylinD2,CyclinD3,CDK4,CDK6 and up-regulating of p53 and CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN1A gene expressions. Oleuropein also induces apoptosis by inhibiting of Bcl-2 and activating of Bax,caspase-9 and caspase-3 gene expressions. Apoptotic cell ratio was found 36.4 ± 3.27% in oleuropein dose group. Oleuropein decreased invasion in SH-SY5Y cells and suppressed colony numbers in ratio of 53.6 ± 4.71%.Our results demonstrated that oleuropein can be a therapeutic agent in the treatment of neuroblastoma.",

Nearly complete regression of multiple metastatic melanoma lesions was observed in patient 1913 following adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The autologous 1913 melanoma cell line expressed a mutated HLA-A11 class I gene product that was recognized by the bulk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as a dominant T cell clone derived from this line. A second dominant T cell clone, T1D1, did not recognize the mutated HLA-A11 product, but recognized an allogeneic melanoma cell line that shared expression of HLA-A11 with the parental tumor cell line. Screening of an autologous melanoma cDNA library with clone T1D1 T cells in a cell line expressing the mutated HLA-A11 gene product resulted in the isolation of a p14ARF transcript containing a 2-bp deletion in exon 2. The T cell epitope recognized by T1D1, which was encoded within the frameshifted region of the deleted p14ARF transcript, was also generated from frameshifted p14ARF or p16INK4a transcripts that were isolated from two additional melanoma cell lines. The results of monitoring studies indicated that T cell clones reactive with the mutated HLA-A11 gene product and the mutated p14ARF product were highly represented in the peripheral blood of patient 1913 1 wk following adoptive transfer, indicating that they may have played a role in the nearly complete tumor regression that was observed following this treatment.",

The INK4a-ARF (CDKN2A) locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two tumour suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), which act as upstream regulators of the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. To study the contribution of each pathway in pleomorphic adenomas, this study analysed alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb in these tumours. After microdissecting the different histological components, 42 pleomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland were analysed for INK4a-ARF inactivation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction enzyme-related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression, microsatellite analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) were assessed by differential PCR. The status of p53 and Rb was examined by direct sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Using microdissection, it was possible to examine the tumour components, i.e. epithelial, mesenchymal, and transitional, separately after immunohistochemical identification. Methylation of p14(ARF) was found in 1/42 cases and alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 12/42 of pleomorphic adenomas, which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Microdeletions or specific mutations of either exon were not detected. Methylation was detected exclusively in the epithelial and transitional components and not within the mesenchymal part of the tumour. p53 mutations were detected in 4/42 adenomas, also occurring solely in the epithelial components of the tumours. pRb was detected immunohistochemically in 40/42 adenomas. In normal, corresponding parotid tissue, p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), p53, and pRb alterations were not observed. The observation that alterations of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a), and also p53 mutations, occurred exclusively in the epithelial and transitional components of pleomorphic adenoma supports the theory that these areas are prone to malignant transformation to carcinoma in adenoma.",

Surprisingly, we found that HC blocked the ability of both azacitidine and decitabine to inhibit DNA methylation and this antagonistic effect was attributable to the arrest of the cell cycle induced by HC. However, this antagonism could be avoided with sequential treatment of HC followed by azacitidine or decitabine.

Epigenetic studies of this model have thus far been limited to the DNA methylation analysis of a few genes. In this study, we analyzed a panel of 20 genes using a quantitative, high-throughput methylation assay, METHYLIGHT: We used this broader approach to gain insight into concordant methylation behavior between genes and to generate epigenomic fingerprints for the different histological stages of EAC. Our study included a total of 104 tissue specimens from 51 patients with different stages of Barrett's esophagus and/or associated adenocarcinoma. We screened 84 of these samples with the full panel of 20 genes and found distinct classes of methylation patterns in the different types of tissue. The most informative genes were those with an intermediate frequency of significant hypermethylation [ranging from 15% (CDKN2A) to 60% (MGMT) of the samples]. This group could be further subdivided into three classes, according to the absence (CDKN2A, ESR1, and MYOD1) or presence (CALCA, MGMT, and TIMP3) of methylation in normal esophageal mucosa and stomach, or the infrequent methylation of normal esophageal mucosa accompanied by methylation in all normal stomach samples (APC). The other genes were less informative, because the frequency of hypermethylation was below 5% (ARF, CDH1, CDKN2B, GSTP1, MLH1, PTGS2, and THBS1), completely absent (CTNNB1, RB1, TGFBR2, and TYMS1), or ubiquitous (HIC1 and MTHFR), regardless of tissue type. Each class undergoes unique epigenetic changes at different steps of disease progression of EAC, suggesting a step-wise loss of multiple protective barriers against CpG island hypermethylation. The aberrant hypermethylation occurs at many different loci in the same tissues, suggestive of an overall deregulation of methylation control in EAC tumorigenesis. However, we did not find evidence for a distinct group of tumors with a CpG island methylator phenotype. Finally, we found that normal and metaplastic tissues from patients with evidence of associated dysplasia or cancer had a significantly higher incidence of hypermethylation than similar tissues from patients with no further progression of their disease. The fact that the samples from these two groups of patients were histologically indistinguishable, yet molecularly distinct, suggests that the occurrence of such hypermethylation may provide a clinical tool to identify patients with premalignant Barrett's who are at risk for further progression.",

While 9 of 10 patients were successfully treated, 4 of the 9 developed T cell leukemia 31-68 months after gene therapy. In 2 of these cases, blast cells contained activating vector insertions near the LIM domain-only 2 (LMO2) proto-oncogene.

Additional genetic abnormalities in the patients' blast cells included chromosomal translocations, gain-of-function mutations activating NOTCH1, and copy number changes, including deletion of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, 6q interstitial losses, and SIL-TAL1 rearrangement. These findings functionally specify a genetic network that controls growth in T cell progenitors.

Exposure to BPA for 1 week at the early stage at passage 8 increased the proliferation and sphere size of HMEC at the later stage up to passage 16, suggesting that BPA has the capability to modulate cell growth in breast epithelial cells. Interestingly, the number of human heterochromatin protein-1γ positive cells, which is a marker of senescence, was also increased among BPA-treated cells. Consistent with these findings, the protein levels of both p16 and cyclin E, which are known to induce cellular senescence and promote proliferation, respectively, were increased in BPA-exposed HMEC. Furthermore, DNA methylation levels of genes related to development of most or all tumor types, such as BRCA1, CCNA1, CDKN2A (p16), THBS1, TNFRSF10C and TNFRSF10D, were increased in BPA-exposed HMEC.

Here we aimed to identify the underlying mechanism(s) of this protein loss in relation to osteosarcoma behavior. The CDKN2A locus was analyzed in osteosarcoma cases with total loss of CDKN2A/p16 expression and in cases with high protein expression using melting curve analysis-methylation assay (MCA-Meth), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and mutation analysis. All cases with complete CDKN2A/p16 protein loss showed homozygous deletions at the CDKN2A locus. In none of the cases hyper methylation of the promoter region was seen which was confirmed by sequencing this region. Taken together we show that large or smaller deletions of the CDKN2A locus are evident in patient samples and underlie the CDKN2A/p16 protein expression loss while promoter methylation does not appear to be a mechanism of this expression loss. Genomic loss of CDKN2A instead of promoter methylation might be a plausible explanation for the rapid proliferation and high aggressiveness of osteosarcoma by simultaneous impairment CDKN2A/p14(ARF) function.",

Currently, little is known about the effect of age and caloric restriction (CR) on adipose-derived stem cells (ASC).

Secondly, stem cell senescence has been theorized as one of the causes of aging and could reduce the utility of a stem cell as a reagent. Thirdly, the mechanism by which CR extends lifespan is currently not known, one theory postulates that CR maintains the resident stem cell population in youthful \"fit\" state. For the purpose of this study, we define ASC as lineage negative (lin(-))/CD34(+(low))/CD31(-). We show that aging increases the abundance of ASC and the expression of Cdkn2a 9.8-fold and Isl1 60.6-fold. This would suggest that aging causes an accumulation of non-replicative ASC. CR reduced the percentage of ASC in the lin(-) SVF while also reducing colony forming ability.

Recently, it has become increasingly clear that genetic lesions driving tumorigenesis frequently occur at the submicroscopic level and, consequently, escape standard cytogenetic observations. Therefore, we profiled the genomes of 40 childhood ALLs at high resolution. We detected multiple de novo genetic lesions, including gross aneuploidies and segmental gains and losses, some of which were subtle and affected single genes. Many of these lesions involved recurrent (partially) overlapping deletions and duplications, containing various established leukemia-associated genes, such as ETV6, RUNX1 and MLL. Importantly, the most frequently affected genes were those controlling G1/S cell cycle progression (e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN1B and RB1), followed by genes associated with B-cell development. The latter group includes microdeletions of the B-lineage transcription factors PAX5, EBF, E2-2 and IKZF1 (Ikaros), as well as genes with other established roles in B-cell development, that is RAG1 and RAG2, FYN, PBEF1 or CBP/PAG.

Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (WJ-MSCs) from umbilical cord share unique properties with both embryonic and adult stem cells. MSCs are found at low frequency in vivo, and their successful therapeutic application depends on rapid and efficient large-scale expansion in vitro. Non-muscle myosin II (NMII) has pivotal roles in different cellular activities, such as cell division, migration and differentiation. We performed this study to understand the role of NMII in proliferation and cell cycle progression in WJ-MSCs.;WJ-MSCs were cultured in the presence of blebbistatin, and cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry, proliferation kinetics, senescence assay and gene expression profile using polymerase chain reaction array.;When cultured in the presence of blebbistatin, an inhibitor of NMII adenosine triphosphatase activity, WJ-MSCs exhibited dose-dependent reduction in proliferative potential along with increase in cell size and induction of early senescence. Inhibition of NMII activity also affected cell cycle progression in WJ-MSCs and led to an increase in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase with a corresponding reduction in the percentage of cells in G2/M phase. Blebbistatin-induced G0/G1 arrest of WJ-MSCs was further associated with up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitory genes CDKN1A, CDKN2A and CDKN2B and down-regulation of numerous genes related to progression through S and M phases of the cell cycle.;Our study demonstrates that inhibition of NMII activity in WJ-MSCs leads to G0/G1 arrest and alteration in the expression levels of certain key cell cycle-related genes.",

These subpopulations of tumor cells have tumor-initiating properties and may be isolated from heterogeneous tumors when sorted or cultured in defined medium. We report the isolation and characterization of a population of tumor-initiating cells derived from an atypical meningioma. We identify a tumor-initiating population from an atypical meningioma, termed meningioma-initiating cells (MICs). These MICs self-renew, differentiate, and can recapitulate the histological characteristics of the parental tumor when transplanted at 1000 cells into the flank regions of athymic nude mice. Immunohistochemistry reveals stem-like protein expression patterns similar to neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) while genomic profiling verified the isolation of cancer cells (with defined meningioma chromosomal aberrations) from the bulk tumor. Microarray and pathway analysis identifies biochemical processes and gene networks related to aberrant cell cycle progression, particularly the loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (p16(INK4A)), p14(ARF), and CDKN2B (p15(INK4B)). Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of CD44 and activated leukocyte adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166); these may prove to be markers able to identify this cell type. The isolation and identification of a tumor-initiating cell population capable of forming meningiomas demonstrates a useful model for understanding meningioma development. This meningioma model may be used to study the cell hierarchy of meningioma tumorogenesis and provide increased understanding of malignant progression.",

Karyotypic analysis revealed a modal chromosome number of 68 and polysomies of chromosomes 3, 5 and 20, as well as the presence of 3-4 marker chromosomes. GBM6840 also showed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumour formation in nude mice. The p16(CDKN2A) gene was transcriptionally silenced by hypermethylation, consistent with the lack of protein expression observed in the original tumour and cultured cells. Western blot analysis revealed normal protein expression of pRb and CDK4. It appears that p16 is the major component altered in the cell cycle pathway and may confer these cells unrestrained proliferation potential. Neither EGFR gene amplification nor over-expression of the protein was detected in the cultured cells. Over-expression of the p53 protein was observed in the majority of cells, despite undetectable mutation (exons 5-8) in the gene.

In the present study, we asked if ACs are responsible for the demethylation effects observed in colorectal cancers. Three days of treatment of ACs at 0.5, 5, and 25 μg/ml suppressed activity and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116, Caco2 and SW480 cells. Promoters of CDKN2A, and SFRP2, SFRP5, and WIF1, upstream of Wnt pathway, were demethylated by ACs. mRNA expression of some of these genes was increased. mRNA expression of β-catenin and c-Myc, downstream of Wnt pathway, and cell proliferation were decreased; apoptosis was increased. ACs were taken up into HCT116 cells and were differentially localized with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the same cells visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Although it was reported that DNMT3B is regulated by c-Myc in mouse lymphoma, DNMT3B did not bind with c-Myc in HCT116 cells.

Four mesotheliomas were distinguished from 23 preneoplastic mesothelial cell lines (PN) according to their propensity to generate tumors after orthotopic transplantation into syngeneic rats, their growth pattern, and the expression profile of three genes. PN cell lines were further discriminated into groups / subgroups according to morphology in culture and the expression profiles of 14 additional genes. This approach was completed by analysis of positive and negative immunohistochemical MM markers in the four tumors, of karyotype alterations in the most aggressive MM cell line in comparison with a PN epithelioid cell line, and of human normal mesothelial and mesothelioma cells and a tissue array. Our results showed that both the rat and human MM cell lines shared in common a dramatic decrease in the relative expression of Cdkn2a and of epigenetic regulators, in comparison with PN and normal human mesothelial cells, respectively. In particular, we identified the involvement of the relative expression of the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases and Dnmt3a in relation to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level in malignant transformation and the acquisition of metastatic potential.

In an effort further to systematically characterize the genomic alterations that occur in this disease, we conducted a genome wide analysis of alterations in gene copy number using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). For this analysis, we utilized a panel of 25 human pancreatic cancer cell lines derived from either primary or metastatic tumors. This panel also included a metastatic progression series of cell lines derived from COLO 357 cells. Array CGH permitted the identification of alterations in the copy number of genes that might participate in the aberrant behavior of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the acquisition of invasive and metastatic potential by derivatives of COLO 357 cells was accompanied by additional focal genomic alterations including point mutations and amplification of KRAS2. To complement the array CGH analysis, we also conducted an analysis of mRNA expression patterns in a subset of these cells using cDNA microarrays. By this means, we identified a set of candidate genes, including those regulated by RAS signaling, that may contribute to the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

Given that elevated expression levels of PRMT6 have been reported in various cancer types, we explore here its role in cell proliferation and senescence. We find that knockdown of PRMT6 results in proliferation defects of transformed as well as non-transformed cells, causes G1-phase arrest and induces senescence. This phenotype is accompanied by transcriptional upregulation of important cell cycle regulators, most prominently the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor gene p21 (p21(CIP1/WAF1), CDKN1A) and p16 (p16(INK4A), CDKN2A). Chromatin immuno-precipitation analysis reveals that the p21 gene is a direct target of PRMT6 and the corresponding histone mark H3 R2me2a. Using a cell model of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), in which p21 is an essential activator of the senescent phenotype, we show that PRMT6 expression declines upon induction of senescence and conversely p21 gene expression increases. Moreover, overexpression of PRMT6 leads to reduced levels of OIS. These findings indicate that the transcriptional repressor activity of PRMT6 facilitates cell proliferation and blocks senescence by regulation of tumor suppressor genes and that this might contribute to the oncogenic capacity of PRMT6.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The ARF tumor suppressor, encoded by the CDKN2A gene, has a well-defined role regulating TP53 stability; this activity maps to exon 1β of CDKN2A. In contrast, little is known about the function(s) of exon 2 of ARF, which contains the majority of mutations in human cancer. In addition to controlling TP53 stability, ARF also has a role in the induction of autophagy. However, whether the principal molecule involved is full-length ARF, or a small molecular weight variant called smARF, has been controversial. Additionally, whether tumor-derived mutations in exon 2 of CDKN2A affect ARF's autophagy function is unknown. Finally, whereas it is known that silencing or inhibiting TP53 induces autophagy, the contribution of ARF to this induction is unknown. In this report we used multiple autophagy assays to map a region located in the highly conserved 5' end of exon 2 of CDKN2A that is necessary for autophagy induction by both human and murine ARF. We showed that mutations in exon 2 of CDKN2A that affect the coding potential of ARF, but not p16INK4a, all impair the ability of ARF to induce autophagy. We showed that whereas full-length ARF can induce autophagy, our combined data suggest that smARF instead induces mitophagy (selective autophagy of mitochondria), thus potentially resolving some confusion regarding the role of these variants. Finally, we showed that silencing Tp53 induces autophagy in an ARF-dependent manner. Our data indicated that a conserved domain in ARF mediates autophagy, and for the first time they implicate autophagy in ARF's tumor suppressor function. ",

These studies have been conducted in European and Thai populations, and it is unclear whether these observations generalize to other populations with a lower incidence of pediatric ALL. In order to explore the impact of these variants on pediatric ALL risk in the Tunisian population, we genotyped 58 cases of pediatric ALL and 150 controls for SNPs rs4132601 (7p12.2), rs7089424 (10q21.2), rs3731217 (9p21.3), and rs2239633 (14q11.2). Our results, which are consistent with findings in European populations, show that 3 SNPs, i.e., rs4132601 (P = .00116, odds ratio [OR] = 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.42, 5.87]), rs7089424 (P = .0022, OR = 0.49, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.79]), and rs2239633 (P = .0010, OR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.29, 0.75]) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing pediatric ALL (P < .05).

Indeed, non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have been shown to harbor mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a member of the SWI/SNF complex, but evidence has been less clear in primary tumors. Recently, inactivating mutations in AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) were found in liver cancer related to HCV infection and in melanoma. Here, we explored, using a genome-wide strategy and subsequent sequencing of targeted genes, whether chromatin remodeling is implicated in primary lung adenocarcinoma. Two genes were individualized from the genome screening as homozygously deleted in a set of samples: JARID2 and ARID2. Subsequent analysis of the entire coding sequences showed that ARID2 loss-of-function mutations were found in 5% of nonsmall cell lung cancers, thereby constituting one of the most frequently mutated genes in this cancer type after TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and STK11.",

We reported that antigen-stimulated CD8 T cells transduced to express an active form of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5CA) maintained these properties upon adoptive transfer. We now report on the requirements of STAT5CA-expressing CD8 T cells for cell survival and proliferation in vivo. We show that STAT5CA expression allows for greater expansion of T cells in vivo, while preserving dependency on T-cell-receptor-mediated tonic stimulation for their in vivo maintenance and return to a quiescent stage. STAT5CA expression promotes the formation of a large pool of effector memory T cells that respond upon re-exposure to antigen and present an increased sensitivity to γc receptor cytokine engagement for STAT5 phosphorylation. In addition, STAT5CA expression prolongs the survival of what would otherwise be short-lived terminally differentiated KLRG1-positive effector cells with up-regulated expression of the senescence-associated p16(INK) (4A) transcripts. However, development of a KLRG1-positive CD8 T cell population was independent of either p16(INK) (4A) or p19(ARF) expression (as shown using T cells from CDKN2A(-/-) mice) but was associated with expression of transcripts encoding p15(INK) (4B) , another protein involved in senescence induction. We conclude that T-cell-receptor- and cytokine-dependent regulation of effector T cell homeostasis, as well as mechanisms leading to senescent features of a population of CD8 T cells are maintained in STAT5CA-expressing CD8 T cells, even for cells that are genetically deficient in expression of the tumour suppressors p16(INK) (4A) and p19(ARF) .

In FM, a single inherited \"hit\" occurs in every somatic cell, enabling interrogation of cultured normal skin fibroblasts (SFs) from FM gene carriers as surrogates for the cell of tumor origin, namely the melanocyte. We compared the gene expression profile of SFs from FM individuals with two distinct CDKN2A/p16 mutations (V126D-p16 and R87P-p16) with the gene expression profile of SFs from age-matched individuals without p16 mutations and with no family history of melanoma. We show an altered transcriptome signature in normal SFs bearing a single-hit inherited mutation in the CDKN2A/p16 gene, wherein some of these abnormal alterations recapitulate changes observed in the corresponding cancer. Significantly, the extent of the alterations is mutation-site specific with the R87P-p16 mutation being more disruptive than the V126D-p16 mutation. We also examined changes in gene expression after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to define potential early biomarkers triggered by sun exposure. UV treatment of SFs from FM families induces distinct alterations in genes related to cell cycle regulation and DNA damage responses that are also reported to be dysregulated in melanoma. Importantly, these changes were diametrically opposed to UV-induced changes in SF from normal controls. We posit that changes identified in the transcriptome of SF from FM mutation carriers represent early events critical for melanoma development. As such, they may serve as specific biomarkers of increased risk as well as molecular targets for personalized prevention strategies in high-risk populations.",

These data were analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with PD 0332991 response.;Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes were most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450 differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and cyclin D1 were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was decreased in the most sensitive lines. Cell cycle analysis showed G0/G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is blocked in sensitive lines but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER2-amplified cell lines, respectively. PD 0332991 enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen in cell lines with conditioned resistance to ER blockade.;These studies suggest a role for CDK4/6 inhibition in some breast cancers and identify criteria for patient selection in clinical studies of PD 0332991",

HRSV provokes a proliferation arrest and characteristic syncytia in cellular systems such as immortalized epithelial cells. We show here that HRSV induces the expression of DNA damage markers and proliferation arrest such as P-TP53, P-ATM, CDKN1A and γH2AFX in cultured cells secondary to the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). The DNA damage foci contained γH2AFX and TP53BP1, indicative of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and could be reversed by antioxidant treatments such as N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) or reduced glutathione ethyl ester (GSHee). The damage observed is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, displaying a canonical senescent phenotype in both mononuclear cells and syncytia. In addition, we show signs of DNA damage and aging such as γH2AFX and CDKN2A expression in the respiratory epithelia of infected mice long after viral clearance. Altogether, these results show that HRSV triggers a DNA damage-mediated cellular senescence program probably mediated by oxidative stress. The results also suggest that this program might contribute to the physiopathology of the infection, tissue remodeling and aging, and might be associated to long-term consequences of HRSV infections.

By comparing the genetic changes in the primary and corresponding secondary tumors, we found that additional loss of CDKN2A and/or RB1, encoding important components of the cell cycle regulatory pathway, was the most frequent genetic change in both types of recurrence development (10 of 22 cases, 45%). Additional loss of heterozygosity for the 10p15 region, for PTEN, and/or for DMBT1 in the recurrent tumor was noted in 7 of 22 cases (32%), suggesting that additional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 10 is another important feature of glioma relapse. Less frequent additional losses were detected for chromosome regions 11p15 and 19q13 (3 of 22 cases, 14%, each).

Regions of acquired homozygosity were detected in 43/52 (83%) primary specimens with a mean of 1.7 and 3.0 aberrations in the FL and t-FL, respectively.

Homozygosity of 9p and 17p arose predominantly in t-FL and in three cases rendered the cell homozygous for a pre-existing mutation of either CDKN2A or TP53. These data suggest that mutation precedes mitotic recombination, which leads to the removal of the remaining wild-type allele. In all, 18 cases exhibited abnormalities in both FL and t-FL samples. In 10 cases blocks of homozygosity were detected in FL that were absent in the subsequent t-FL sample.

Heparanase, an enzyme expressed by multiple cell types, including tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, has been implicated in angiogenesis and metastasis, and its expression correlates with decreased overall survival in PDAC. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of PG545, an angiogenesis and heparanase inhibitor, in experimental PDAC. PG545 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Heparanase inhibition also reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts but had only modest effects on endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, PG545 significantly prolonged animal survival in intraperitoneal and genetic models (mPDAC: LSL-Kras(G12D); Cdkn2a(lox/lox); p48(Cre)) of PDAC. PG545 also inhibited primary tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic and genetic endpoint studies. Analysis of tumor tissue revealed that PG545 significantly decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced microvessel density, disrupted vascular function, and elevated intratumoral hypoxia. Elevated hypoxia is a known driver of collagen deposition and tumor progression; however, tumors from PG545-treated animals displayed reduced collagen deposition and a greater degree of differentiation compared with control or gemcitabine-treated tumors. These results highlight the potent antitumor activity of PG545 and support the further exploration of heparanase inhibitors as a potential clinical strategy for the treatment of PDAC.",

Gene modules were identified by gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis.;Gene expression profiling revealed that variations in glucose levels have a widespread and highly dynamic impact on the islet transcriptome. Stimulatory glucose levels induced the expression of highly beta cell-selective genes and repressed the expression of ubiquitous genes involved in stress and antiproliferative responses, and in organelle biogenesis. Interestingly, a module comprising cell cycle genes was significantly induced between non-stimulatory and stimulatory glucose concentrations. Unexpectedly, glucose regulation of gene expression was broadly maintained in islets from old mice. However, glucose induction of mitotic genes was selectively lost in aged islets and was not even restored in the absence of the cell cycle inhibitors p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), which have been implicated in the restricted proliferative capacity of beta cells with advanced age.;Glucose-dependent transcriptional networks in islets are globally conserved during ageing, with the exception of the ability of stimulatory glucose levels to induce a cell cycle gene module.",

We show that ARF does this by controlling the subnuclear localization of the RNA polymerase I transcription termination factor, TTF-I. TTF-I shuttles between nucleoplasm and nucleolus with the aid of the chaperone NPM/B23 and a nucleolar localization sequence within its N-terminal regulatory domain. ARF inhibits nucleolar import of TTF-I by binding to this nucleolar localization sequence, causing the accumulation of TTF-I in the nucleoplasm. Depletion of TTF-I recapitulates the effects of ARF on ribosomal RNA synthesis and is rescued by the introduction of a TTF-I transgene. Thus, our data delineate the pathway by which ARF regulates ribosomal RNA synthesis and provide a compelling explanation for the role of NPM.",

Although analogous studies of rare nervous system tumors are needed, there are major barriers to performing such studies. Cross-species comparative oncogenomics, identifying driver mutations in mouse cancer models and validating them in human tumors, is a promising alternative. Although still in its infancy, this approach is being applied to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), rare Schwann cell-derived malignancies that occur sporadically, after radiotherapy, and in neurofibromatosis type 1. Studies of human neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors suggest that NF1 tumor suppressor loss in Schwann cells triggers cell-autonomous and intercellular changes, resulting in development of benign neurofibromas; subsequent neurofibroma-MPNST progression is caused by aberrant growth factor signaling and mutations affecting the p16(INK4A)-cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb and p19(ARF)-Mdm2-p53 cell cycle pathways. Mice with Nf1, Trp53, and/or Cdkn2a mutations that overexpress the Schwann cell mitogen neuregulin-1 or overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor validate observations in human tumors and, to various degrees, model human tumorigenesis. Genomic analyses of MPNSTs arising in neuregulin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing mice and forward genetic screens with Sleeping Beauty transposons implicate additional signaling cascades in MPNST pathogenesis.

Receiver operator characteristic curve analyses suggested that CpG island hypermethylation changes at GSTP1, APC, RASSF1a, PTGS2, and MDR1 in various combinations can distinguish primary prostate cancer from benign prostate tissues with sensitivities of 97.3-100% and specificities of 92-100%. Hypermethylation of the CpG island at EDNRB was correlated with the grade and stage of the primary prostate cancers. PTGS2 CpG island hypermethylation portended an increased risk of recurrence. Furthermore, CpG island hypermethylation patterns in prostate cancer metastases were very similar to the primary prostate cancers and tended to show greater differences between cases than between anatomical sites of metastasis.",

Efforts at modeling GBM using wild-type EGFR in mice have proven unsuccessful. Here, we present a unique mouse model of wild-type EGFR-driven gliomagenesis. We used a combination of somatic conditional overexpression and ligand-mediated chronic activation of EGFR in cooperation with Ink4a/Arf loss in the central nervous system of adult mice to generate tumors with the histopathologic and molecular characteristics of human GBMs. Sustained, ligand-mediated activation of EGFR was necessary for gliomagenesis, functionally substantiating the clinical observation that EGFR-positive GBMs from patients express EGFR ligands. To gain a better understanding of the clinically disappointing EGFR-targeted therapies for GBM, we investigated the molecular responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment in this model. Gefitinib treatment of primary GBM cells resulted in a robust apoptotic response, partially conveyed by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling attenuation and accompanied by BIM(EL) expression. In human GBMs, loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN are a common occurrence. Elimination of PTEN expression in GBM cells posttumor formation did not confer resistance to TKI treatment, showing that PTEN status in our model is not predictive. Together, these findings offer important mechanistic insights into the genetic determinants of EGFR gliomagenesis and sensitivity to TKIs and provide a robust discovery platform to better understand the molecular events that are associated with predictive markers of TKI therapy.",

The effects of THs on tumor development have been studied, but the results are still controversial. Herein, we show the modulatory action of thyroid status on the in vivo growth of T lymphoma cells. For this purpose, euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid mice received inoculations of EL4 cells to allow the development of solid tumors. Tumors in the hyperthyroid animals exhibited a higher growth rate, as evidenced by the early appearance of palpable solid tumors and the increased tumor volume. These results are consistent with the rate of cell division determined by staining tumor cells with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. Additionally, hyperthyroid mice exhibited reduced survival. Hypothyroid mice did not differ significantly from the euthyroid controls with respect to these parameters. Additionally, only tumors from hyperthyroid animals had increased expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and active caspase 3. Differential expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins was also observed. The levels of cyclins D1 and D3 were augmented in the tumors of the hyperthyroid animals, whereas the cell cycle inhibitors p16/INK4A (CDKN2A) and p27/Kip1 (CDKN1B) and the tumor suppressor p53 (TRP53) were increased in hypothyroid mice. Intratumoral and peritumoral vasculogenesis was increased only in hyperthyroid mice. Therefore, we propose that the thyroid status modulates the in vivo growth of EL4 T lymphoma through the regulation of cyclin, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and tumor suppressor gene expression, as well as the stimulation of angiogenesis.

Characterizing important downstream target genes of MLL and of MLL fusion proteins may provide rational therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MLL-associated leukemia. We explored downstream target genes of the most prevalent MLL fusion protein, MLL-AF4. To this end, we developed inducible MLL-AF4 fusion cell lines in different backgrounds. Overexpression of MLL-AF4 does not lead to increased proliferation in either cell line, but rather, cell growth was slowed compared with similar cell lines inducibly expressing truncated MLL. We found that in the MLL-AF4-induced cell lines, the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene CDKN1B was dramatically changed at both the RNA and protein (p27kip1) levels. In contrast, the expression levels of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16) were unchanged. To explore whether CDKN1B might be a direct target of MLL and of MLL-AF4, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and luciferase reporter gene assays. MLL-AF4 binds to the CDKN1B promoter in vivo and regulates CDKN1B promoter activity. Further, we confirmed CDKN1B promoter binding by ChIP in MLL-AF4 as well as in MLL-AF9 leukemia cell lines. Our results suggest that CDKN1B is a downstream target of MLL and of MLL-AF4, and that, depending on the background cell type, MLL-AF4 inhibits or activates CDKN1B expression. This finding may have implications in terms of leukemia stem cell resistance to chemotherapy in MLL-AF4 leukemias.",

Genetic experiments have defined the importance of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 for the maintenance of methylation in mouse cells and its role in neoplasia. In human bladder cancer cells, selective depletion of DNMT1 with antisense inhibitors has been shown to induce demethylation and reactivation of the silenced tumor-suppressor gene CDKN2A. In contrast, targeted disruption of DNMT1 alleles in HCT116 human colon cancer cells produced clones that retained CpG island methylation and associated tumor-suppressor gene silencing, whereas HCT116 clones with inactivation of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B showed much lower levels of DNA methylation, suggesting that the two enzymes are highly cooperative. We used a combination of genetic (antisense and siRNA) and pharmacologic (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) inhibitors of DNA methyl transferases to study the contribution of the DNMT isotypes to cancer-cell methylation. Selective depletion of DNMT1 using either antisense or siRNA resulted in lower cellular maintenance methyltransferase activity, global and gene-specific demethylation and re-expression of tumor-suppressor genes in human cancer cells. Specific depletion of DNMT1 but not DNMT3A or DNMT3B markedly potentiated the ability of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to reactivate silenced tumor-suppressor genes, indicating that inhibition of DNMT1 function is the principal means by which 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivates genes.

Genotyping was performed with Taqman assays and Illumina arrays, and gene expression profiles generated with Affymetrix microarrays. Associations were analyzed with an additive genetic model. In heart tissue, 46 genes were putatively altered in association with the 9p21.3 risk allele (70% down-regulated, fold-change >1.1 per allele, p<0.05 adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, cause of death). These genes were enriched for biomarkers of myocardial infarction (p = 1.53×10(-9)), response to wounding (p = 2.65×10(-10)) and inflammatory processes (p<1.97×10(-7)). Among the top 10 most down-regulated genes, 7 genes shared a set of transcription factor binding sites within conserved promoter regions (p<1.14×10(-5)), suggesting they may be co-regulated. Canonical pathway modelling of the most differentially expressed transcripts across all tissues (154 genes, 60% down-regulated, fold-change >1.1 per allele, p<0.01) showed that 75% of the genes could be transcriptionally regulated through the cell cycle G1 phase progression pathway (p<1.08×10(-258)), in which CDKN2A and CDKN2B play a regulatory role. These data suggest that the cell cycle G1 phase progression pathway is activated in individuals with the 9p21.3 risk allele.

The wild-type 5'-UTR sequence, containing a reported SNP (c.-33G > C) and a known melanoma-predisposing mutation (c.-34G > T), was included as controls. Results revealed that the variants at -21 and -34 severely reduced the reporter activity. The variants at -56 and at -25&-180 exhibited a milder impact, while results with c.-67G > C were dependent on the plasmid type. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA indicated that the effects of the variants were mainly post-transcriptional. Using a bicistronic dual-luciferase reporter plasmid, we confirmed that c.-21C > T and c.-34G > T had a severe negative impact in both cell lines.

The CDK4 exon 2 and the complete coding region of the MC1R gene were sequenced.;Eleven families carried the CDK4 R24H mutation whereas six families had the R24C mutation. The total number of subjects with verified melanoma was 103, with a median age at first melanoma diagnosis of 39 years. Forty-three (41.7%) subjects had developed multiple primary melanomas (MPM). A CDK4 mutation was found in 89 (including 62 melanoma cases) of 209 tested subjects. CDK4 positive family members (both melanoma cases and unaffected subjects) were more likely to have clinically atypical nevi than CDK4 negative family members (p<0.001). MPM subjects had a higher frequency of MC1R red hair colour variants compared with subjects with one tumour (p=0.010).;Our study shows that families with CDK4 germline mutations cannot be distinguished phenotypically from CDKN2A melanoma families, which are characterised by early onset of disease, increased occurrence of clinically atypical nevi, and development of MPM.

Functional classification of these mutated genes suggested that alterations in pathways participating in chromatin remodeling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, and oxidative stress play critical roles in HCC tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, because there are few druggable genes used in HCC therapy, the identification of new therapeutic targets through integrated genomic approaches remains an important task. Because a large amount of HCC genomic data genotyped by high density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is deposited in the public domain, copy number alteration (CNA) analyses of these arrays is a cost-effective way to reveal target genes through profiling of recurrent and overlapping amplicons, homozygous deletions and potentially unbalanced chromosomal translocations accumulated during HCC progression. Moreover, integration of CNAs with other high-throughput genomic data, such as aberrantly coding transcriptomes and non-coding gene expression in human HCC tissues and rodent HCC models, provides lines of evidence that can be used to facilitate the identification of novel HCC target genes with the potential of improving the survival of HCC patients.

Chromosomal changes were compared between the two cell lines by routine G-banded chromosome analyses and both regular and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. After 3 months of exposure to genistein, the cell line MCF-10A/G1 showed loss of a normal chromosome 8 and gain of an extra chromosome 20, as well as loss of a chromosomal segment on the short arm of chromosome 9, leading to a homozygous deletion of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A (alias p16(INK4a)) and CDKN2B (alias p15(INK4b)).

Most of these mutations consist of a V600E substitution resulting in constitutive kinase activation. Mutant BRAF thus represents an important therapeutic target in melanoma. In an effort to produce a pre-clinical model of mutant BRAF function in melanoma, we have generated a mouse expressing BRAF V600E targeted to melanocytes. We show that in these transgenic mice, widespread benign melanocytic hyperplasia with histological features of nevi occurs, with biochemical evidence of senescence. Melanocytic hyperplasia progresses to overt melanoma with an incidence dependent on BRAF expression levels. Melanomas show CDKN2A loss, and genetic disruption of the CDKN2A locus greatly enhances melanoma formation, consistent with collaboration between BRAF activation and CDKN2A loss suggested from studies of human melanoma. The development of melanoma also involves activation of the Mapk and Akt signaling pathways and loss of senescence, findings that faithfully recapitulate those seen in human melanomas. This murine model of mutant BRAF-induced melanoma formation thus provides an important tool for identifying further genetic alterations that cooperates with BRAF and that may be useful in enhancing susceptibility to BRAF-targeted therapeutics in melanoma.",

However, the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in restoring abnormal DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether miRNA-29b, due to its complimentarity to the 3'- untranslated region of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and DNMT3B, could restore normal DNA methylation patterns in human breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that transfection of pre-miRNA-29b into less aggressive MCF-7 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal cells, inhibited cell proliferation, decreased DNMT3A and DNMT3B messenger RNA (mRNA), and decreased promoter methylation status of ADAM23 , CCNA1, CCND2, CDH1, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, HIC1, RASSF1, SLIT2, TNFRSF10D, and TP73 tumor-suppressor genes. Using methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time PCR, we also demonstrated that the methylation status of several critical tumor-suppressor genes increased as stage of breast disease increased, while miRNA-29b mRNA levels were significantly decreased in breast cancers versus normal breast. This increase in methylation status was accompanied by an increase in DNMT1 and DNMT3B mRNA in advanced stage of human breast cancers and in MCF-7, MDA-MB-361, HCC70, Hs-578T, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as compared to normal breast specimens and MCF-10-2A, a non-tumorigenic breast cell line, respectively.

We performed genome-wide analyses of copy number aberrations in 12 T-LBL and 7 precursor B-cell LBL pediatric cases using high-resolution SNP-based array CGH. Similar to what previously has been found in T-ALL, T-LBL exhibited recurrent deletions of the CDKN2A locus, occurring in 92% of the cases. Additionally, we detected deletions of RB1 (16%), duplications of MYB (16%), and an amplification of ABL1 in one case. These results show that, similar to T-ALL, the genomic alterations in T-LBL predominantly target genes involved in cell cycle progression. The majority of precursor B-cell LBL was characterized by high-hyperdiploidy (71%), and showed high resemblance with high-hyperdiploid precursor B-cell ALL.

Id1 transcript levels were also found to be elevated in these radial growth phase melanoma cells without any appreciable evidence of gene amplification and Id1 promoter activity was found to correlate with Id expression levels.

Development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, particularly for the most common subtype, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), has been hampered by controversies over the origin of the disease and a lack of spontaneous HGSC models to resolve this controversy. Over long-term culture in our laboratory, an ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cell line spontaneously transformed OSE (STOSE). The objective of this study was to determine if the STOSE cell line is a good model of HGSC. STOSE cells grow faster than early passage parental M0505 cells with a doubling time of 13 and 48 h, respectively. STOSE cells form colonies in soft agar, an activity for which M0505 cells have negligible capacity. Microarray analysis identified 1755 down-regulated genes and 1203 up-regulated genes in STOSE compared to M0505 cells, many associated with aberrant Wnt/β-catenin and Nf-κB signaling. Upregulation of Ccnd1 and loss of Cdkn2a in STOSE tumors is consistent with changes identified in human ovarian cancers by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Intraperitoneal injection of STOSE cells into severe combined immunodeficient and syngeneic FVB/N mice produced cytokeratin+, WT1+, inhibin-, and PAX8+ tumors, a histotype resembling human HGSC. Based on evidence that a SCA1+ stem cell-like population exists in M0505 cells, we examined a subpopulation of SCA1+ cells that is present in STOSE cells. Compared to SCA1- cells, SCA1+ STOSE cells have increased colony-forming capacity and form palpable tumors 8 days faster after intrabursal injection into FVB/N mice. This study has identified the STOSE cells as the first spontaneous murine model of HGSC and provides evidence for the OSE as a possible origin of HGSC. Furthermore, this model provides a novel opportunity to study how normal stem-like OSE cells may transform into tumor-initiating cells. ",

However, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16) protein, encoded on chromosome 9p21, detected by the immunohistochemical study was heterogeneous among tumor cells.

They represent the second malignant primary bone tumor of adults after osteosarcoma, but in contrast to osteosarcoma they are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical excision remaining the only therapeutic option. Few cell lines and animal models are available, and the mechanisms behind their chemoresistance remain largely unknown. Our goal was to establish new cell lines and animal cancer models from human chondrosarcoma biopsies to study their chemoresistance. Between 2007 and 2012, 10 chondrosarcoma biopsies were collected and used for cell culture and transplantation into nude mice. Only one transplanted biopsy and one injected cell line has engrafted successfully leading to conventional central high-grade chondrosarcoma similar to the original biopsies. In culture, two new stable cell lines were obtained, one from a dedifferentiated and one from a grade III conventional central chondrosarcoma biopsy. Their genetic characterization revealed triploid karyotypes, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53, deletion in CDKN2A and/or MDM2 amplification. These cell lines expressed mesenchymal membrane markers (CD44, 73, 90, 105) and were able to produce a hyaline cartilaginous matrix when cultured in chondrogenic three-dimensional (3D) pellets. Using a high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR approach, we observed that cell lines cultured in monolayer had lost expression of several genes implicated in cartilage development (COL2A1, COMP, ACAN) but restored their expression in 3D cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells in monolayer were sensitive to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents but became resistant to low doses of mafosfamide or doxorubicin when cultured in 3D pellets, in parallel with an altered nucleic accumulation of the drug. Our results indicate that the cartilaginous matrix produced by chondrosarcoma cells may impair diffusion of several drugs and thus contribute to chemoresistance. Therefore, 3D chondrogenic cell pellets constitute a more relevant model to study chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and may be a valuable alternative to animal experimentations. ",

Although the viral transactivator protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATL. One of the genetic events of the disease is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p encodes 2 cell cycle regulatory proteins, p14ARF and p16INK4a, which share exon 2 using different reading frames. The p14ARF and p16INK4a genes have been implicated as tumor suppressor genes by their frequent mutation, deletion or promoter hypermethylation in a variety of human tumors. In this report, we describe the expression status of p14ARF and p16INK4a in 9 ATL cell lines (MT1, MT2, OKM3T, F6T, K3T, Oh13T, S1T, Su9T01 and HUT102). By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), expression of p14ARF was not detected in one cell line (OKM3T), while expression of p16INK4a was not detected in 6 cell lines (OKM3T, MT1, MT2, Oh13T, S1T and Su9T01). In the OKM3T cell line, the shared exon 2 of the p14ARF/p16INK4a gene was deleted; however, the p16INK4a gene, was epigenetically inactivated in 5 other cells lines. In primary tumor cells obtained from ATL patients, p14ARF expression was absent in 6 of the 11 samples. We confirmed the methylation of the p16INK4a gene in MT1 and MT2 cells using the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method. Treatment with 2.0 µM of Azacitidine (AZA), a demethylating agent, for 72 h restored p16INK4a transcript expression and induced growth inhibition in MT2 cells. Our results demonstrate that p16INK4a is epigenetically silenced in ATL. AZA offers a potential new therapeutic approach to improve the poor outcomes associated with ATL.",

Recent studies have shown that astrocytoma formation is the result of the deregulation of several pathways, including the RB/E2F pathway, which is commonly deregulated in various human cancers via genetic or epigenetic mechanisms. On the basis of the assumption that the study of the mechanisms controlling the INK4/ARF locus can help elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of astrocytic tumors, identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, and help select appropriate clinical treatments, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare methylation patterns using bisulfite sequencing PCR and evaluate the gene expression profile using real-time PCR in the genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDC6, Bmi-1, CCND1, and RB1 in astrocytic tumors. Our results indicate that all the evaluated genes are not methylated independent of the tumor grade. However, the real-time PCR results indicate that these genes undergo progressive deregulation as a function of the tumor grade. In addition, the genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and RB1 were underexpressed, whereas CDC6, Bmi-1, and CCND1 were overexpressed; the increase in gene expression was significantly associated with decreased patient survival. Therefore, we propose that the evaluation of the expression levels of the genes involved in the RB/E2F pathway can be used in the monitoring of patients with astrocytomas in clinical practice and for the prognostic indication of disease progression.

Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates molecular alterations to EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in previously untreated tumors. Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. These results suggest that AP-2 transcription factors are activated as feedback from EGFR network inhibition and may mediate EGFR inhibitor resistance.",

In particular detection of homozygous deletions (HDs) is easier using these pure populations of cancer cells. Identification of HDs could potentially lead to the subsequent identification of new tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) involved in esophageal adenocarcinogenesis. Genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to identify HDs in 10 verified EAC cell lines and nine EAC xenografts. In total, 61 HDs (range 1-6 per sample) were detected and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Besides HDs observed in common fragile genomic regions (n = 26), and gene deserts (n = 8), 27 HDs were located in gene-containing regions. HDs were noted for known TSGs, including CDKN2A, SMAD4 and CDH3/CDH1. Twenty-two new chromosomal regions were detected harboring potentially new TSGs involved in EAC carcinogenesis. Two of these regions of homozygous loss, encompassing the ITGAV and RUNX1 gene, were detected in multiple samples indicating a potential role in the carcinogenesis of EAC. To exclude culturing artifacts, these last two deletions were confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the primary tumors of which the involved cell lines and xenografts were derived. In summary, in this report we describe the identification of HDs in a series of verified EAC cell lines and xenografts.

HSCs maintain themselves for the lifetime of the organism because of their ability to self-renew. However, multipotent progenitors lack the ability to self-renew, therefore their mitotic capacity and expansion potential are limited and they are destined to eventually stop proliferating after a finite number of cell divisions. The molecular mechanisms that limit the proliferation capacity of multipotent progenitors and other more mature progenitors are not fully understood. Here we show that bone marrow cells from mice deficient in three genes genetically downstream of Bmi1--p16Ink4a, p19Arf and Trp53 (triple mutant mice; p16Ink4a and p19Arf are alternative reading frames of the same gene (also called Cdkn2a) that encode different proteins)--have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the blood long term. This increase is associated with the acquisition of long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype c-kit+Sca-1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors in wild-type mice. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor response to growth factors resembles that of wild-type multipotent progenitors but not wild-type HSCs. These results demonstrate that p16Ink4a/p19Arf and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. These pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Elderly humans gradually lose strength and the capacity to repair skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle repair requires functional skeletal muscle satellite (or stem) cells (SMSCs) and progenitor cells. Diminished stem cell numbers and increased dysfunction correlate with the observed gradual loss of strength during aging. Recent reports attribute the loss of stem cell numbers and function to either increased entry into a presenescent state or the loss of self-renewal capacity due to an inability to maintain quiescence resulting in stem cell exhaustion. Earlier work has shown that exposure to factors from blood of young animals and other treatments could restore SMSC function. However, cells in the presenescent state are refractory to the beneficial effects of being transplanted into a young environment. Entry into the presenescent state results from loss of autophagy, leading to increased ROS and epigenetic modification at the CDKN2A locus due to decreased H2Aub, upregulating cell senescence biomarker p16ink4a. However, the presenescent SMSCs can be rejuvenated by agents that stimulate autophagy, such as the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Autophagy plays a critical role in SMSC homeostasis. These results have implications for the development of senolytic therapies that attempt to destroy p16ink4a expressing cells, since such therapies would also destroy a reservoir of potentially rescuable regenerative stem cells. Other work suggests that in humans, loss of SMSC self-renewal capacity is primarily due to decreased expression of sprouty1. DNA hypomethylation at the SPRY1 gene locus downregulates sprouty1, causing inability to maintain quiescence and eventual exhaustion of the stem cell population. A unifying hypothesis posits that in aging humans, first loss of quiescence occurs, depleting the stem cell population, but that remaining SMSCs are increasingly subject to presenescence in the very old.

We assessed genetic abnormalities for CDKN2A, TP53, ERBB2, 20q, MYC, and chromosomes 7 and 17 and measures of genetic clonal diversity in brush samples from 29 PSC patients with benign biliary strictures and 12 patients with sporadic CCA or PSC-associated CCA. Diagnostic performance of cytology alone and in combination with genetic markers was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve analysis. Results. The presence of MYC gain and CDKN2A loss as well as a higher clonal diversity was significantly associated with malignancy. MYC gain increased the sensitivity of cytology from 50% to 83%. However, the specificity decreased from 97% to 76%. The diagnostic accuracy of the best performing measures of clonal diversity was similar to the combination of cytology and MYC. Adding CDKN2A loss to the panel had no additional benefit. Conclusion.

Repression of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene products p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) by EBNA3A and EBNA3C is critical for EBV mediated transformation of resting B lymphocytes into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). To define the composition of endogenous EBNA3 protein complexes, we generated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) expressing flag-HA tagged EBNA3A, EBNA3B, or EBNA3C and used tandem affinity purification to isolate each EBNA3 complex. Our results demonstrated that each EBNA3 protein forms a distinct complex with RBPJ. Mass-spectrometry revealed that the EBNA3A and EBNA3B complexes also contained the deubquitylation complex consisting of WDR48, WDR20, and USP46 (or its paralog USP12) and that EBNA3C complexes contained WDR48. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C association with the USP46 complex. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that WDR48 and USP46 are recruited to the p14(ARF) promoter in an EBNA3C dependent manner. Mapping studies were consistent with WDR48 being the primary mediator of EBNA3 association with the DUB complex. By ChIP assay, WDR48 was recruited to the p14(ARF) promoter in an EBNA3C dependent manner. Importantly, WDR48 associated with EBNA3A and EBNA3C domains that are critical for LCL growth, suggesting a role for USP46/USP12 in EBV induced growth transformation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The expression of the catalytic subunit (hTERT) represents the limiting factor for telomerase activity. Previously, we detected a transcriptional repressor effect of the proximal exonic region (first two exons) of the hTERT gene. To better understand the mechanism involved and to identify a potential repressor, we further characterized this region. The addition of the hTERT proximal exonic region downstream of the hTERT minimal promoter strongly reduced promoter transcriptional activity in all cells tested (tumor, normal and immortalized). This exonic region also significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the CMV and CDKN2A promoters, regardless of the cell type. Therefore, the repressor effect of hTERT exonic region is neither cell nor promoter-dependent. However, the distance between the promoter and the exonic region can modulate this repressor effect, suggesting that nucleosome positioning plays a role in transcriptional repression. We showed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binds to the proximal exonic region of hTERT. Chromatin immunoprecipitaion assays confirmed the binding of CTCF to this region. CTCF is bound to hTERT in cells in which hTERT is not expressed, but not in telomerase-positive ones. Moreover, the transcriptional downregulation of CTCF by RNA interference derepressed hTERT gene expression in normal telomerase-negative cells. Our results suggest that CTCF participates in key cellular mechanisms underlying immortality by regulating hTERT gene expression.",

Here we identified a novel pathway involving the concerted action of miR-125a, BMPR2 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN) that controls a proliferative phenotype of endothelial cells. An in silico approach predicted miR-125a to target BMPR2. Functional inhibition of miR-125a resulted in increased proliferation of these cells, an effect that was found accompanied by upregulation of BMPR2 and reduced expression of the tumor suppressors CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16). These data were confirmed in experimental pulmonary hypertension in vivo. Levels of miR-125a were elevated in lung tissue of hypoxic animals that develop pulmonary hypertension. In contrast, circulating levels of miR-125a were found to be lower in mice with pulmonary hypertension as compared to control mice. Similar findings were observed in a small cohort of patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension.

Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells. We previously demonstrated that complex DSBs induced by high-linear energy transfer (LET) Fe ions are repaired slowly and incompletely, whereas those induced by low-LET gamma rays are repaired efficiently by mammalian cells. To determine whether Fe-induced DSBs are more potently tumorigenic than gamma ray-induced breaks, we irradiated 'sensitized' murine astrocytes that were deficient in Ink4a and Arf tumor suppressors and injected the surviving cells subcutaneously into nude mice. Using this model system, we find that Fe ions are potently tumorigenic, generating tumors with significantly higher frequency and shorter latency compared with tumors generated by gamma rays. Tumor formation by Fe-irradiated cells is accompanied by rampant genomic instability and multiple genomic changes, the most interesting of which is loss of the p15/Ink4b tumor suppressor due to deletion of a chromosomal region harboring the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci. The additional loss of p15/Ink4b in tumors derived from cells that are already deficient in p16/Ink4a bolsters the hypothesis that p15 plays an important role in tumor suppression, especially in the absence of p16. Indeed, we find that reexpression of p15 in tumor-derived cells significantly attenuates the tumorigenic potential of these cells, indicating that p15 loss may be a critical event in tumorigenesis triggered by complex DSBs.",

However, there is a rapidly emerging literature that describes inactivation of a diverse array of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) via promoter DNA CpG methylation in MPM, although the etiology of these alterations remains unclear. We studied the relationships among promoter methylation silencing, asbestos exposure, patient demographics and tumor histology using a directed approach; examining six cell cycle control pathway TSGs in an incident case series of 70 MPMs. Promoter hypermethylation of APC, CCND2, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, HPPBP1 and RASSF1 were assessed. We observed significantly higher lung asbestos body burden if any of these cell cycle genes were methylated (P < 0.02), and there was a significant trend of increasing asbestos body counts as the number of methylated cell cycle pathway genes increased from 0 to 1 to >1 (P < 0.005). This trend of increasing asbestos body count and increasing number of methylated cell cycle pathway genes remained significant (P < 0.05) after controlling for age, gender and tumor histology.

Importantly, knockdown of p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF) partially rescued LCLs from EBNA3C or EBNA3A inactivation-induced growth arrest and knockdown of both rescued LCL growth, confirming central roles for p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) in LCL growth arrest following EBNA3C or EBNA3A inactivation.

Using recombinant EBV-BAC viruses expressing conditional EBNA3C (3CHT), we developed a system that allows inactivation of EBNA3C in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) lacking active p16(INK4a) protein but expressing a functional 14(ARF)-fusion protein (p14/p16). The INK4a locus is epigenetically repressed by EBNA3C--in cooperation with EBNA3A--despite the absence of functional p16(INK4a). Although inactivation of EBNA3C in LCLs from normal B cells leads to an increase in p16(INK4a) and growth arrest, EBNA3C inactivation in the p16(INK4a)-null LCLs has no impact on the rate of proliferation, establishing that the repression of INK4a is a major function of EBNA3C in EBV-driven LCL proliferation. This conditional LCL system allowed us to use microarray analysis to identify and confirm genes regulated specifically by EBNA3C, independently of proliferation changes modulated by the p16(INK4a)-Rb-E2F axis. Infections of normal primary B cells with recombinant EBV-BAC virus from which EBNA3C is deleted or with 3CHT EBV in the absence of activating ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen, revealed that EBNA3C is necessary to overcome an EBV-driven increase in p16(INK4a) expression and concomitant block to proliferation 2-4 weeks post-infection.

The genomic profile of the chronic type was nearly identical to that of acute-type ATL, although more genomic alterations characteristic of acute-type ATL were observed. Among the genomic alterations frequently observed in acute-type ATL, the loss of CDKN2A, which is involved in cell-cycle deregulation, was especially characteristic of acute-type ATL compared with chronic-type ATL. Furthermore, we found that genomic alteration of CD58, which is implicated in escape from the immunosurveillance mechanism, is more frequently observed in acute-type ATL than in the chronic-type. Interestingly, the chronic-type cases with cell-cycle deregulation and disruption of immunosurveillance mechanism were associated with earlier progression to acute-type ATL.

We conducted a genome-scale cDNA overexpression screen using a reporter containing INK4a regulatory sequences to identify novel transcriptional activators of this locus. This screen revealed 285 cDNAs that putatively regulate the transcriptional activation of INK4a. Of these, 56 are annotated as transcription factors, including two previously reported activators of the locus, ETS2 and JUNB. Fourteen genes were further validated for activity and specificity, including several homeodomain proteins. We found that the transcription of one of these, the homeodomain protein MEOX2 (GAX) is enhanced in primary cells during the induction of senescence, and forced expression of this protein results in the induction of premature senescence. We further demonstrate that MEOX2-induced senescence is dependent upon INK4a activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicate that MEOX2 directly binds the INK4a promoter. These results support a role for this homeodomain protein as a direct regulator of INK4a transcription and senescence in human cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma displays a variety of molecular changes that evolve exponentially with time and lead cancer cells not only to survive, but also to invade the surrounding tissues and metastasise to distant sites. These changes include: genetic alterations in oncogenes and cancer suppressor genes; changes in the cell cycle and pathways leading to apoptosis; and also changes in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The most common alterations involve the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, the HER2 gene, and the K-ras gene. In particular, the loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes has been documented in this tumor, especially in CDKN2a, p53, DPC4 and BRCA2 genes. However, other molecular events involved in pancreatic adenocarcinoma pathogenesis contribute to its development and maintenance, specifically epigenetic events. In fact, key tumor suppressors that are well established to play a role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may be altered through hypermethylation, and oncogenes can be upregulated secondary to permissive histone modifications. Indeed, factors involved in tumor invasiveness can be aberrantly expressed through dysregulated microRNAs. This review summarizes current knowledge of pancreatic carcinogenesis from its initiation within a normal cell until the time that it has disseminated to distant organs. In this scenario, highlighting these molecular alterations could provide new clinical tools for early diagnosis and new effective therapies for this malignancy. ",

In the RCAS/Ntv-a glia-specific transgenic mouse model, c-Myc increased the GBM incidence from 19.1% to 47.4% by 12 weeks of age when combined with kRas and Akt3 in Ntv-a INK4a-ARF (also known as CDKN2A)-null mice.

Here we describe a novel two-switch GEM model for BRAF(V600E)-induced lung carcinogenesis allowing temporal dissociation of these processes. In mice carrying a Flp recombinase-activated allele of Braf (Braf(FA)) in conjunction with Cre-regulated alleles of Trp53, Cdkn2a, or c-MYC, we demonstrate that secondary genetic events can promote bypass of the senescence-like proliferative arrest displayed by BRAF(V600E)-induced lung adenomas, leading to malignant progression. Moreover, restoring or activating TP53 in cultured BRAF(V600E)/TP53(Null) or BRAF(V600E)/INK4A-ARF(Null) lung cancer cells triggered a G1 cell-cycle arrest regardless of p19(ARF) status.

Approximately 80% of those patients, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, are identified as having concomitant diabetes with a poor prognostic factor. Damaged pancreatic tissue, secondary to pancreatic cancer, leads to diabetes as islet cells and beta cells are taken over by malignancy. Additionally, those on certain anti-diabetic regimens are shown to be at a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer due to the effect of stimulation on the pancreatic beta and islet cells. Therefore, diabetes is thought to be both a potential cause and effect of pancreatic cancer. Diabetes has become a pandemic, and pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of malignancy known. In order to better understand these diseases and how they are associated, more research needs to be done.

Three ATCs harbored the common BRAF mutation V600E. Using array-comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH), several distinct recurrent copy number alterations were revealed including gains in 16p11.2, 20q11.2, and 20q13.12.

Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the ARF tumor suppressor contain abnormal numbers of chromosomes. However, no role for ARF in cell division has previously been proposed. Here we demonstrate a novel, p53-independent role for ARF in the mitotic checkpoint. Consistent with this, loss of ARF results in aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo. ARF(-/-) MEFs exhibit mitotic defects including misaligned and lagging chromosomes, multipolar spindles, and increased tetraploidy. ARF(-/-) cells exhibit overexpression of Mad2, BubR1, and Aurora B, but only overexpression of Aurora B phenocopies mitotic defects observed in ARF(-/-) MEFs. Restoring Aurora B to near-normal levels rescues mitotic phenotypes in cells lacking ARF. Our results define an unexpected role for ARF in chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint function.

The fish CDKN2X locus harbors a CpG island within its promoter and first exon, analogous in location to CpG islands in human CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci. The methylation state of individual CpG dinucleotides was investigated in genomic DNA derived from control tissues and melanomas within the CDKN2X 5' CpG island. The studied genomic area was found to be virtually unmethylated in all tested tissues including melanomas. In addition, RNA expression studies of the fish CDKN2X locus revealed that it is significantly overexpressed in melanoma, in contrast to what has been reported for the human CDKN2A locus in melanoma. Such overexpression may be a consequence of the pronounced upregulation of the Xmrk-2 receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene reported in several Xiphophorus melanoma models.",

The aim of this study was to verify the associations between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and the methylation status of three gastric cancer-related genes. The influence of H. pylori strains was also assessed. DNA extracted from 71 gastric tumor samples was available for MTHFR C677T genotyping by PCR-RFLP, promoter methylation identification by MS-PCR and H. pylori detection and posterior subtyping (cagA and vacA genes) by PCR. In the distal tumors, a positive correlation was found between the methylation of CDKN2A and the allele T carriers (r=0.357; p=0.009). Considering the eldest patients (age ≥60 years old), this correlation was even higher (r=0,417; p=0.014). H. pylori infection by highly pathogenic strains (cagA+/vacAs1m1) was also found correlated to promoter methylation of CDKN2A and the allele T carriers in distal tumors (r=0.484; p=0.026). No significant correlation was verified between MTHFR C677T genotype and promoter methylation status when we analyzed the general sample. DNA methylation in CDKN2A associated to the MTHFR 677T carrier is suggested to be a distal tumor characteristic, especially in those 60 years old or older, and it seems to depend on the infection by H. pylori cagA/vacAs1m1 strains.",

This prompted us to investigate whether persistent activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling will have supportive effects on HSPC self-renewal. NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is an important kinase that mainly activates the non-canonical pathway through directly phosphorylating IKKα. In contrast to our expectations, constitutive activation of NIK in the hematopoietic system leads to bone marrow (BM) failure and postnatal lethality due to intrinsic impairment of HSPC self-renewal and extrinsic disruption of BM microenvironment through enhancing osteoclastogenesis. The impaired HSPC function is associated with reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine responses. RNAseq analysis of control and NIK-activated HSPCs reveals that these effects are through non-canonical NF-κB signaling without significant changes in the canonical pathway. Gene set expression analysis of RNAseq data reveals globally decreased stem cell signature, increased maturation signature, and increased inflammatory responses. Many genes (Mpl, Tifab, Emcn, Flt3, Bcl2, and others) that regulate HSPC self-renewal, lineage commitment, and apoptosis are significantly downregulated-and those genes that regulate inflammatory responses and cell cycle inhibition (Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b) are significantly upregulated-by activation of NIK. Importantly, our data demonstrate that activation of NIK-non-canonical signaling has distinct phenotypes-smaller spleen size, decreased white blood cell counts, and reduced HSPC proliferation-compared to activation of canonical signaling. Collectively, these data indicate that the balanced non-canonical NF-κB signaling is essential for maintaining normal hematopoiesis and NIK-non-canonical signaling contributes to the development of BM failure.

Populations of primary pMEC were then separated by FACS using markers to distinguish epithelial cells (CD140a-) from stromal cells (CD140a+), with or without further enrichment for basal and luminal progenitor cells (CD49f+).

The typical NSCLC patients account for 80-85 % of the total lung cancer patients. To systemically explore the molecular mechanisms of NSCLC, we performed a molecular network analysis between human and mouse to identify key genes (pathways) involved in the occurrence of NSCLC. We automatically extracted the human-to-mouse orthologous interactions using the GeneWays system by natural language processing and further constructed molecular (gene and its products) networks by mapping the human-to-mouse interactions to NSCLC-related mammalian phenotypes, followed by module analysis using ClusterONE of Cytoscape and pathway enrichment analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) successively. A total of 70 genes were proven to be related to the mammalian phenotypes of NSCLC, and seven genes (ATAD5, BECN1, CDKN2A, FNTB, E2F1, KRAS and PTEN) were found to have a bearing on more than one mammalian phenotype (MP) each. Four network clusters centered by four genes thyroglobulin (TG), neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1 ), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2 ) and E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) were generated. Genes in the four network modules were enriched in eight KEGG pathways (p value < 0.05), including pathways in cancer, small cell lung cancer, cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway. Genes p53 and E2F1 may play important roles in NSCLC occurrence, and thus can be considered as therapeutic targets for NSCLC.",

Tumor-specific mutations or epigenetic modifications have predominantly been detected in tissue specimens. The purpose of this study was to investigate methylation of five different genes involved in tumor suppression and DNA repair (suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 and 2 (SOCS1, SOCS2)), Ras-association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1a), D-type p16(INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN), and O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)) in the serum of 100 patients using methylation-specific PCR. In all, 41 melanoma patients (stage I = 18; stage II = 10; stage III/IV = 13), 13 healthy controls without nevi, and 10 individuals with more than 15 nevi of >5 mm in size were investigated. For comparison, sera from patients with other skin tumors (nine basal cell cancers, five Kaposi's sarcoma), different metastasized cancers (five breast cancers, five colon cancers), and several chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 12) were also analyzed. In addition, we examined if methylation was involved in silencing transcription of these genes in 12 melanoma specimens. SOCS1, SOCS2, RASSF1a, CDKN2a, and MGMT were methylated in 75, 43, 64, 75, and 64% of melanoma samples, respectively. Of the 41 melanoma patients, 83% had one hypermethylated gene, while 66, 51, and 41% had two, three, or four hypermethylated genes, respectively. Also, 20% of these patients showed hypermethylation for all genes, while only 17% showed no methylation. Importantly, the methylation profile of the selected genes from melanoma patients was distinct from the other analyzed tumors. Transcription of SOCS1, SOCS2, CDKN2a, and RASSF1a genes was significantly reduced in fresh melanoma samples, while MGMT showed a 12-fold upregulation at the messenger ribonucleic acid level (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that epigenetic silencing of the studied tumor suppressor genes is a common and probably important mechanism for melanoma formation.

We report here the largest genomic survey to date of 101 EFT (65 tumors and 36 cell lines). Using a combination of whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing approaches, we discover that EFT has a very low mutational burden (0.15 mutations/Mb) but frequent deleterious mutations in the cohesin complex subunit STAG2 (21.5% tumors, 44.4% cell lines), homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (13.8% and 50%) and mutations of TP53 (6.2% and 71.9%). We additionally note an increased prevalence of the BRCA2 K3326X polymorphism in EFT patient samples (7.3%) compared to population data (OR 7.1, p = 0.006). Using whole transcriptome sequencing, we find that 11% of tumors pathologically diagnosed as EFT lack a typical EWSR1 fusion oncogene and that these tumors do not have a characteristic Ewing sarcoma gene expression signature. We identify samples harboring novel fusion genes including FUS-NCATc2 and CIC-FOXO4 that may represent distinct small round blue cell tumor variants. In an independent EFT tissue microarray cohort, we show that STAG2 loss as detected by immunohistochemistry may be associated with more advanced disease (p = 0.15) and a modest decrease in overall survival (p = 0.10). These results significantly advance our understanding of the genomic and molecular underpinnings of Ewing sarcoma and provide a foundation towards further efforts to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and precision therapeutics testing.

In addition, we performed microsatellite analyses for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome arms 1p, 19q and 10q. None of tumors showed evidence for LOH on 10q. LOH on 1p was detected in 3 tumors, 1 of which additionally showed LOH on 19q. The 3 tumors with LOH on 1p showed neither TP53 mutations nor nuclear p53 accumulation. In contrast, 9 of 10 tumors without demonstrated losses on 1p showed nuclear p53 accumulation. TP53 mutations were identified in 3 of these cases. Further aberrations detected were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression (3 of 13 tumors), homozygous CDKN2A deletion (2 of 11 tumors), and PTEN mutation (1 of 13 tumors).

We next tested whether S100A7 was induced by the cell cycle effectors ARF (p14(ARF)), CDKN2A (p16(INK4A)) and TP53 (p53) and found that, although all induced a similar level of acute and permanent cell cycle arrest to telomere dysfunction, none induced S100A7 (except p53 over-expression at high levels), showing that cell cycle arrest is not sufficient for its induction. The closely related transcript S100A15 was also upregulated by telomere dysfunction, to a similar extent by p16(INK4A) and p53 and to a lesser extent by p14(ARF).;Our results show that mere cell cycle arrest, the upregulation of senescence-associated cell cycle effectors and DNA damage are not sufficient for the induction of the S100 transcripts; they further suggest that whilst the induction of S100A15 expression is linked to both telomere-dependent and -independent senescence, S100A7 expression is specifically associated with telomere-dependent senescence in normal keratinocytes.

The most frequent GAs were in TP53 (110 [55%]), KRAS (40 [20%]), CDKN2A (37 [19%]), MYC (23 [12%]), ARID1A (21 [11%]), MCL1 (19 [10%]), PIK3CA (17 [9%]), ERBB2 (16 [8%]), PTEN (14 [7%]), EGFR (12 [6%]), SMAD4 (13 [7%]), STK11 (13 [7%]), SMARCA4 (12 [6%]), RB1 (12 [6%]), RICTOR (12 [6%]), MLL2 (12 [6%]), BRAF (11 [6%]), and BRCA2 (11 [6%]). One or more potentially targetable GAs were identified in 169 of 200 (85%) CUP specimens. Mutations or amplifications of ERBB2 were more frequent in ACUPs (13 [10%]) than in non-ACUPs (3 [4%]). Alterations of EGFR (10 [8%] vs 2 [3%]) and BRAF (8 [6%] vs 3 [4%]) were more common in ACUPs than in non-ACUPs.

Both incidences and deaths associated with melanoma are increasing in Caucasian populations. While exposure to ultraviolet radiation through sun-exposure is the major risk factor; the host factors including skin type and number of moles are critical in predisposition. The CDKN2A is a high penetrance melanoma susceptibility gene as carriers of the mutations are predisposed to the disease within familial settings. The gene is also somatically altered to varying degrees in sporadic melanoma. The CDK4 gene due to occurrence of activation mutations in a few families worldwide represents another melanoma susceptibility locus. The variants within the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene, which encodes a melanocyte specific surface receptor with a key role in pigmentation, are associated with high risk phenotypes and increased risk of melanoma. Melanoma tumors are characterized by activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway through either autocrine growth factor stimulation or oncogenic mutations in the B-RAF or N-RAS genes. Somatic mutations in the B-RAF gene are complemented by those in the N-RAS gene and represent the major genetic alterations. The mutations in the B-RAF gene in melanoma due to occurrence in melanocytic nevi represent early events that additionally require loss of cell cycle inhibitors like CDKN2A for melanoma progression and development. The sequence of events points to the cooperative collaboration between different genetic pathways in tumor development that can be and are being used as targets for developing specific therapeutic agents.",

This model is advantageous in overcoming the heterogeneity associated with the prostate cancer up to a certain extent. We characterized and compared the gene expression profiles in LNCaP-C33 (androgen-dependent) and LNCaP-C81 (androgen-independent) cells using Affymetrix GeneChip array analyses. Multiple genes were identified exhibiting differential expression during androgen-independent progression. Among the important genes upregulated in androgen-independent cells were PCDH7, TPTE, TSPY, EPHA3, HGF, MET, EGF, TEM8, etc., whereas many candidate tumor suppressor genes (HTATIP2, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN1C, TP53, TP73, ICAM1, SOCS1/2, SPRY2, PPP2CA, PPP3CA, etc.) were decreased. Pathway prediction analysis identified important gene networks associated with growth-promoting and apoptotic signaling that were perturbed during androgen-independent progression. Further investigation of one of the genes, PPP2CA, which encodes the catalytic subunit of a serine phosphatase PP2A, a potent tumor suppressor, revealed that its expression was decreased in prostate cancer compared to adjacent normal/benign tissue. Furthermore, the downregulated expression of PPP2CA was significantly correlated with tumor stage and Gleason grade. Future studies on the identified differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways may be helpful in understanding the biology of prostate cancer progression and prove useful in developing novel prognostic biomarkers and therapy for androgen-refractory prostate cancer.",

Small intestinal crypts were isolated and subsequently cultured to grow organoids. Intestines and organoids were analyzed by immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, RNA sequence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation methods.;Intestines of EED knockout mice had massive crypt degeneration and lower numbers of proliferating cells compared with wild-type control mice. Cdkn2a became derepressed and we detected increased levels of P21. We did not observe any differences between EZH2 knockout and control mice. Intestinal crypts from EED knockout mice had signs of aberrant differentiation of uncommitted crypt cells-these differentiated toward the secretory cell lineage. Furthermore, crypts from EED-knockout mice had impaired Wnt signaling and concomitant loss of intestinal stem cells, this phenotype was not reversed upon ectopic stimulation of Wnt and Notch signaling in organoids. Analysis of gene expression patterns from intestinal tissues of EED knockout mice showed dysregulation of several genes involved in Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling was regulated directly by PRC2.;In intestinal tissues of mice, PRC2 maintains small intestinal stem cells by promoting proliferation and preventing differentiation in the intestinal stem cell compartment.

C/EBPbeta is required for premature senescence of primary mouse fibroblasts induced by expression of H-Ras(V12), demonstrating its role in oncogene-induced senescence. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms by which Ras inhibits proliferation of normal cells but transforms immortalized cells. We show that oncogenic Ras down-regulates C/EBPbeta expression in NIH 3T3 cells, which are immortalized by a deletion of the CDKN2A locus and, therefore, lack the p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) tumor suppressors. Ras(V12)-induced silencing of C/EBPbeta occurred at the mRNA level and involved both the Raf-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways. Oncogenic Ras decreased C/EBPbeta expression in Ink4a/Arf(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) but increased C/EBPbeta levels in wild-type MEFs. C/EBPbeta down-regulation in NIH 3T3 cells was reversed by expression of p19(Arf), but not of p53 or p16(Ink4a), highlighting a critical role for p19(Arf) in sustaining C/EBPbeta levels. Ectopic expression of p34 C/EBPbeta (LAP) inhibited Ras(V12)-mediated transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, suppressed their tumorigenicity in nude mice, and reactivated expression of the proapoptotic Fas receptor, which is also down-regulated by Ras. Our findings indicate that Cebpb gene silencing eliminates a growth inhibitory transcription factor that would otherwise restrain oncogenesis. We propose that C/EBPbeta is part of a p53-independent, p19(Arf)-mediated network that enforces Ras-induced cell cycle arrest and tumor suppression in primary fibroblasts.",

As the pleiotropic effects mediated by MSCs rely mostly on their unique secretory profile, long-term persistence of ex-vivo-expanded cells in the recipient may not always be desirable. Irradiation is a routine procedure in transfusion medicine to prevent long-term persistence of nucleated cells and could therefore also be applied to MSCs. We have exposed human bone-marrow-derived MSCs to 30 or 60 Gy of γ-irradiation and assessed cell proliferation, clonogenicity, differentiation, cytokine levels in media supernatants, surface receptor profile, as well as expression of proto-oncogenes/cell cycle markers, self-renewal/stemness markers, and DNA damage/irradiation markers. Irradiated MSCs show a significant decrease in proliferation and colony-forming unit-fibroblasts. However, a subpopulation of surviving cells is able to differentiate, but is unable to form colonies after irradiation. Irradiated MSCs showed stable expression of CD73 and CD90 and absence of CD3, CD34, and CD45 during a 16-week follow-up period. We found increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and a decrease of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and PDGF-AB/BB in culture media of nonirradiated cells. Irradiated MSCs showed an inverse pattern, that is, no increase of VEGF, and less consumption of PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB/BB. Interestingly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increased during culture regardless of irradiation. Cells with lower sensitivity toward γ-irradiation showed positive β-galactosidase activity 10 days after irradiation. Gene expression of both irradiated and nonirradiated MSCs 13-16 weeks after irradiation with 60 Gy predominantly followed the same pattern; cell cycle regulators CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16) were upregulated, indicating cell cycle arrest, whereas classical proto-oncogenes, respectively, and self-renewal/stemness markers MYC, TP53 (p53), and KLF4 were downregulated. In addition, DNA damage/irradiation markers ATM, ATR, BRCA1, CHEK1, CHEK2, MDC1, and TP53BP1 also mostly showed the same pattern of gene expression as high-dose γ-irradiation. In conclusion, we demonstrated the existence of an MSC subpopulation with remarkable resistance to high-dose γ-irradiation.

Therefore, mammary nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) may become a specific target for novel anti-breast cancer therapies. Toward this goal, we investigated the difference in the ACh receptor repertoires between normal and malignant BECs, determined effects of nicotinic ligands on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells, and characterized reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP (secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1)-1 on the expression of nAChR subunits and several oncogenes and tumor-suppressing genes in BECs. Both the non-malignant MCF10A and malignant MCF7 breast cells expressed α3, α5, α7, α9, α10, β1, β2, γ, δ and ε nAChR subunits and M(1), M(3), M(4) and M(5) muscarinic receptor subtypes. The malignancy was associated with expression of α1, α4 and β4 nAChR subunits and M(2) subtype. Malignant transformation of BECs was also associated with overexpression of α7-, and α9-made nAChRs. NNK upregulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, stimulated expression of the gene encoding the tumor-promoter HGF, downregulated expression of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, and induced tumorigenic transformation of MCF10A cells. Compared to the canonical nAChR antagonists, SLURP-1 showed the highest ability to abolish the nAChR-mediated effects of NNK in both cell-signaling and cell-transformation assays and reversed many effects of NNK on gene expression. SLURP-1 also markedly upregulated the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2B, RUNX3 and TP73. Altogether, the obtained results provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms of nAChR-mediated oncogenic effects of NNK on BECs and demonstrated the ability to abolish or reverse these effects by SLURP-1.",

The possibility that tumors develop novel aberrations, with relevant biological properties, is often neglected. In this study, we present two cases of diffuse astrocytoma in which additional cytogenetic and epigenetic markers with potential influence on cell proliferation or differentiation were detected at relapse.;The biopsies taken from the primary and recurrent tumors of two patients were analyzed with molecular methods to detect copy number variations (CNVs), gene mutations and epigenetic changes. Both cases were characterized by the R132H mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene. Features typical of astrocytomas, such as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity at 17p and the deletion of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene, were also detected in both cases. These markers were present in the primary and recurrent lesions. Other aberrations, predominantly deletions or amplifications of chromosomal segments and the hypermethylation of gene promoters, were detected in the recurrent lesions.;The IDH1 mutation was the primary event, as previously reported. According to our observations, the methylation of promoters constituted later events, which may have further disrupted cell proliferation and/or differentiation, together with additional CNVs.",

Treatments for low- (extra-nodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas) and high-grade (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) are associated with local and vision-threatening toxicities. High-grade lymphomas relapse frequently and exhibit poor survival rates. Despite advances in genomic profiling and precision medicine, orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas remain poorly characterized molecularly. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas obtained from a single-center using a panel targeting near-term, clinically relevant genes. Potentially actionable mutations and copy number alterations were prioritized based on gain- and loss-of-function analyses, and catalogued, approved, and investigational therapies. Of 36 informative samples, including marginal zone lymphomas (n=20), follicular lymphomas (n=9), and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=7), 53% harbored a prioritized alteration (median=1, range 0-5/sample). MYD88 was the most frequently altered gene in our cohort, with potentially clinically relevant hotspot gain-of-function mutations identified in 71% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 25% of marginal zone lymphomas. Prioritized alterations in epigenetic modulators were common and included gain-of-function EZH2 and loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (14% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 22% of follicular lymphomas contained alterations in each of these two genes). Single prioritized alterations were also identified in the histone methyltransferases KMT2B (follicular lymphoma) and KMT3B (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Loss-of-function mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma), CDKN2A (diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphoma), PTEN (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), ATM (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and NF1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and gain-of-function mutations in the oncogenes HRAS (follicular lymphoma) and NRAS (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were also observed. Together, our study demonstrates that NGS can be used to profile routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas for identification of somatic-driving alterations and nomination of potential therapeutic strategies.

Because its genotype, phenotype and degree of differentiation may underlie events that are instrumental to the development of endocrine tumors and, moreover, may vary between labs and over time, we decided to comprehensively characterize the chromosomal constitution of BON-1 by applying conventional GTG-banding, spectral karyotyping (SKY), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). BON-1 cells proved to be hyperdiploid containing a modal chromosome number of 57 (range 56-64). SKY identified a stemline containing 6 clonal aberrations including del(1p), t(9;12)del(9p)x2, der(10)t(5;10), der(19)t(8;19), der(14)t(9;14)t(9;10), and a sideline harboring an additional del(12q). CGH and FISH confirmed the SKY results and, in addition, highlighted the chromosomal regions involved in the rearrangements. Moreover, they identified a homozygous deletion of the key tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B at 9p21.3, in accordance with absence of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) expression as revealed by immunocytochemistry. Apart from deregulation of the cell cycle and p53 pathway this finding indicates escape from replicative senescence (induced by mutated NRAS) and detachment-induced apoptosis as molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis of BON-1 cells. Immunostaining results for p53, MDM2 and pRb expression were consistent with previously published data using Western analysis. In conclusion, we provide here a comprehensive cytogenetic profile of BON-1. This cell line harbors both numerical and structural genomic alterations indicative for malignant EPTs.",

The MTAP gene product is the principal enzyme involved in purine synthesis via the salvage pathway, such that MTAP-negative cancers are solely dependent on de novo purine synthesis mechanisms. Inhibitors of the de novo pathway can then be used to selectively blockade purine synthesis in cancer cells while causing minimal collateral damage to normal cells. In this study, we determine that 10 of 28 (35%) biliary tract cancers show complete lack of Mtap protein expression. In vitro analysis using a selective inhibitor of the de novo purine synthesis pathway, L-alanosine, shows robust growth inhibition in MTAP-negative biliary cancer cell lines CAK-1 and GBD-1 accompanied by striking depletion of intracellular ATP and failure to rescue this depletion via addition of exogenous methylthioadenosine, the principal substrate of the MTAP gene product; in contrast, no significant effects were observed in MTAP-expressing HuCCT1 and SNU308 cell lines. Colony formation studies confirmed that L-alanosine reduced both number and size of CAK-1 colonies in soft agar assays. Knockdown of Mtap protein by RNA interference in L-alanosine-resistant HuCCT1 cells conferred sensitivity to this agent, confirming that intracellular Mtap protein levels determine response to L-alanosine.

A broad variety of human cancers carry PTEN alterations, including glioblastomas, endometrial, breast, thyroid and prostate cancers. The PTEN protein has at least two biochemical functions: it has both lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity. The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN decreases intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) level and downstream Akt activity. Cell-cycle progression is arrested at G1/S, mediated at least partially through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. In addition, agonist-induced apoptosis is mediated by PTEN, through the upregulation of proapoptotic machinery involving caspases and BID, and the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is apparently less central to its involvement in tumorigenesis. It is involved in the inhibition of focal adhesion formation, cell spreading and migration, as well as the inhibition of growth factor-stimulated MAPK signaling. Therefore, the combined effects of the loss of PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase activity may result in aberrant cell growth and escape from apoptosis, as well as abnormal cell spreading and migration. In melanoma, PTEN loss has been mostly observed as a late event, although a dose-dependent loss of PTEN protein and function has been implicated in early stages of tumorigenesis as well. In addition, loss of PTEN and oncogenic activation of RAS seem to occur in a reciprocal fashion, both of which could cooperate with CDKN2A loss in contribution to melanoma tumorigenesis.",

Nonetheless, ischemic preconditioning partially protected from toxic liver injury. Similarly, primary hepatocytes from donor livers preconditioned with ischemia exhibited undesirably altered antioxidant enzyme content and lipid peroxidation, but better withstood insults. However, donor hepatocytes from livers preconditioned with ischemia did not engraft better than hepatocytes from control livers. Moreover, proliferation of hepatocytes from donor livers preconditioned with ischemia decreased under liver repopulation conditions. Hepatocytes from donor livers preconditioned with ischemia showed oxidative DNA damage with expression of genes involved in MAPK signaling that impose G1/S and G2/M checkpoint restrictions, including p38 MAPK-regulated or ERK-1/2-regulated cell-cycle genes such as FOS, MAPK8, MYC, various cyclins, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, TP53, and RB1.

Quantification of GFP signals in infected cells demonstrated that the CMV promoter produced the highest GFP expression in the six promoters and maintained relatively high GFP expression for up to eight weeks after infection of HCT116, DLD-1, and HT-1080. Exogenous human CDKN2A gene expression was also introduced into DLD-1 and MCF-10A in a similar pattern by using AAV vectors bearing the human β-actin and the CMV promoters. The six constitutive promoters were subsequently placed upstream of the neomycin resistance gene within AAV vectors, and HCT116, DLD-1, and HT-1080 were infected with the resulting vectors. Of the six promoters, the CMV promoter produced the largest number of G418-resistant colonies in all three cell lines. Because AAV vectors have been frequently used as a platform to construct targeting vectors that permit gene editing in human cell lines, we lastly infected the three cell lines with AAV-based targeting vectors against the human PIGA gene in which one of the six promoters regulate the neomycin resistance gene. This assay revealed that the CMV promoter led to the lowest PIGA gene targeting efficiency in the investigated promoters. These results provide a clue to the identification of constitutive promoters suitable to express exogenous genes with AAV vectors, as well as those helpful to conduct efficient gene targeting using AAV-based targeting vectors in human cell lines.

Moreover, McCOBRA can be used to quantitatively estimate the percent of methylated DNA at a specific CpG site within a heterogeneous sample. The accuracy of McMSP and McCOBRA was initially tested using the 5'-CpG site of the tumor-suppressor gene CDKN2A as a model system in homogeneous and heterogeneous controls, and cancer cell line samples. Furthermore, the robustness of McMSP and McCOBRA was validated in four additional loci.

Although IM is known to harbor genetic changes associated with EAC, little is known about NGM. We hypothesized that if NGM and IM infer similar EAC risk, then they would harbor similar genetic aberrations in genes associated with EAC.;Ninety frozen NGM, IM, and normal tissues from 45 subjects were studied. DNA copy number abnormalities were identified using microarrays and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Targeted sequencing of all exons from 20 EAC-associated genes was performed on metaplasia biopsies using Ion AmpliSeq DNA sequencing.;Frequent copy number abnormalities targeting cancer-associated genes were found in IM whereas no such changes were observed in NGM. In 1 subject, fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed loss of CDKN2A and amplification of chromosome 8 in IM but not in a nearby NGM biopsy. Targeted sequencing revealed 11 nonsynonymous mutations in 16 IM samples and 2 mutations in 19 NGM samples.;This study reports the largest and most comprehensive comparison of DNA aberrations in IM and NGM genomes.

We also built multivariate predictive decision-tree models for each GBM driver gene and validated accuracies using leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV).;We collected 48 biopsies (13 tumors) and identified significant imaging correlations (univariate analysis) for 6 driver genes: EGFR, PDGFRA, PTEN, CDKN2A, RB1, and TP53.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cellular senescence, the irreversible proliferative arrest seen in somatic cells after a limited number of divisions, is considered a crucial barrier to cancer, but direct evidence for this in vivo was lacking until recently. The best-known form of human cell senescence is attributed to telomere shortening and a DNA-damage response through p53 and p21. There is also a more rapid form of senescence, dependent on the p16-retinoblastoma pathway. p16 (CDKN2A) is a known melanoma susceptibility gene. Here, we use retrovirally mediated gene transfer to confirm that the normal form of senescence in cultured human melanocytes involves p16, since disruption of the p16/retinoblastoma pathway is required as well as telomerase activation for immortalisation. Expression (immunostaining) patterns of senescence mediators and markers in melanocytic lesions provide strong evidence that cell senescence occurs in benign melanocytic naevi (moles) in vivo and does not involve p53 or p21 upregulation, although p16 is widely expressed. In comparison, dysplastic naevi and early (radial growth-phase, RGP) melanomas show less p16 and some p53 and p21 immunostaining. All RGP melanomas expressed p21, suggesting areas of p53-mediated senescence, while most areas of advanced (vertical growth-phase) melanomas lacked both p16 and p21, implying escape from both forms of senescence (immortalisation). Moreover, nuclear p16 but not p21 expression can be induced in human melanocytes by oncogenic BRAF, as found in around 80% of naevi. We conclude that cell senescence can form a barrier to melanoma development. This also provides a potential explanation of why p16 is a melanoma suppressor gene.",

We screened 150 histologically confirmed cervical cancer cases along with equal number of healthy controls with normal cervical cytology. PCR-RFLP method was employed for genotyping of SNPs in p16 C540G (rs11515), C580T (rs3088440) in the 3'-UTR of exon 3 and RB1 A153104G (rs4151580) located in the intron 18 and confirmed by direct sequencing. Both patients and controls were screened for HPV infection. In this case-control study 84.67% (127/150) of cases were found to be positive for HPV DNA sequence. Women carrying p16 C540G carrier genotypes 540 (CG/GG) may have protective effect for the development of cervical cancer (P=0.0001, OR=0.31, 95% CI=0.17-0.56).

Studies have shown that combination of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors is effective against various cancers, including lung cancer. However, optimizing the synergistic dose regime is very difficult and involves adverse side effects. Therefore, in this study, we have shown that cucurbitacin B (CuB), a single bioactive triterpenoid compound, inhibits both DNMTs and HDACs starting at a very low dose of 60 nmol/L in NSCLC H1299 cells. The CuB-mediated inhibition of DNMTs and HDACs in H1299 cells leads to the reactivation of key tumor suppressor genes (TSG) such as CDKN1A and CDKN2A, as well as downregulation of oncogenes c-MYC and K-RAS and key tumor promoter gene (TPG), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The upregulation of TSGs and downregulation of TPG were consistently correlated with the alterations in their promoter methylation and histone modifications. This altered expression of TPG and TSGs is, at least in part, responsible for the inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of cellular apoptosis in NSCLC. Furthermore, CuB treatment significantly inhibited the tumor incidence and multiplicity in 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of hyperproliferation in the lung tissues. Together, our study provides new insight into the CuB-mediated epigenetic alterations and its chemotherapeutic effects on lung cancer.",

Subsequent genetic studies have assumed this model to be correct, although when viewed in aggregate, the data are inconsistent. The first proposed melanoma gene (CMM1) was mapped to chromosome 1p36. This gene assignment has not been confirmed. A second melanoma gene, designated CMM2, has been mapped to chromosome 9p21. This gene assignment has been confirmed, and the cell cycle regulator CDKN2A has been proposed as the candidate gene. Germline mutations in this gene have been identified in about 20% of melanoma-prone families that have been studied to date. Pancreatic cancer occurs excessively in melanoma families with germline mutations in CDKN2A. Germline mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4 (chromosome 12q14) have been described in three melanoma families. This finding represents a third melanoma gene but one that accounts for only a tiny fraction of all hereditary melanoma. Recently, a familial melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome has been reported. Large germline deletions of 9p21 occur in these families, with the p19 gene implicated in its pathogenesis. At present, clinical predictive genetic testing for mutations in the CDKN2A gene is available commercially, but its use has been limited by uncertainty as to how test results would affect the management of melanoma-prone family members. Currently, management recommendations include monthly skin self-examination, clinical skin examination once or twice yearly, a low threshold for simple excision of changing pigmented lesions, moderation of sun exposure, and appropriate use of sunscreens. A heritable determinant for total nevus number has been suggested by twin studies. Other data suggest the presence of a major gene responsible for \"total nevus density\" in melanoma-prone families. Approximately 55% of the mole phenotype in multiplex melanoma families was explained by this proposed gene. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been proposed for DN, and data exist to suggest that DN may be a pleiotropic manifestation of the 1p36 familial melanoma gene. However, there clearly are melanoma-prone families that do not express the dysplastic nevus trait, and some of the families linked to CDKN2A also present with dysplastic nevi. Several studies have shown a surprisingly high prevalence of DN on the skin of family members of probands with DN. In light of the extensive evidence documenting that persons with DN (both sporadic and familial) have an increased prospective risk of melanoma, these family studies suggest that relatives of persons with DN should be examined for both DN and melanoma. Genetic determinants play a major role in the pathogenesis of normal nevi, DN, and melanoma. Identifying the molecular basis of these genetic events promises to enhance melanoma risk-reduction strategies and, ultimately, reduce melanoma-associated mortality.",

Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, indices of insulin disposition, early-phase insulin release, fasting state, and 0 to 120 minute's proinsulin to insulin conversion were used to dissect insulin physiological characterization. Several variants related to β-cell function were genotyped. The genetic impacts were analyzed using logistic regression under an additive model. By adjusting for maternal age, BMI, and the related interactions, the genetic variants in ABCC8, CDKAL1, CDKN2A, HNF1B, KCNJ11, and MTNR1B were detected to impact gestational insulin signaling through heterogeneous mechanisms; however, compared with that in nonpregnant metabolism, the genetic effects seem to be eminently and heavily influenced by maternal age and BMI, indicating possible particular mechanisms underlying gestational metabolism and diabetic pathogenesis.

The colon adenocarcinomas had a mutation in MSH6 gene, DNA methylation in CDKN2A gene, and increased microsatellite instability (MSI), although these genetic changes were not recognized in either DLBCL or non-neoplastic UC mucosa. The DLBCL was diagnosed as primary colonic lymphoma, and confirmed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The adenocarcinomas and the non-neoplastic UC mucosa were EBV-negative.

To identify mutations contributing to leukemogenesis in DS-ALL, we undertook sequencing of candidate genes, including FLT3, RAS, PTPN11, BRAF, and JAK2. Sequencing of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain identified a specific, acquired mutation, JAK2R683, in 12 (28%) of 42 DS-ALL cases. Functional studies of the common JAK2R683G mutation in murine Ba/F3 cells showed growth factor independence and constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. High-resolution SNP array analysis of 9 DS-ALL cases identified additional submicroscopic deletions in key genes, including ETV6, CDKN2A, and PAX5.

Integration of the vector in an antisense orientation 35 kb upstream of the protooncogene LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) caused overexpression of LMO2 in the leukemic clone. However, leukemogenesis was likely precipitated by the acquisition of other genetic abnormalities unrelated to vector insertion, including a gain-of-function mutation in NOTCH1, deletion of the tumor suppressor gene locus cyclin-dependent kinase 2A (CDKN2A), and translocation of the TCR-beta region to the STIL-TAL1 locus.

Oxidative stress is implicated in carcinogenesis either by directly provoking DNA damage or through the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades. In both cases the cellular response to oxidative stress is determined by the cellular context. ARF, the alternative protein product of the CDKN2A locus has been recently recognized as a novel sensor of oxidative stress, in a β-catenin and Hsp70-mediated manner.

We detected highly altered genomes in the majority of the samples with a high number of partial uniparental disomies (UPDs). The UPD at 17p was one of the most common, and it was associated with TP53 gene inactivation. Homozygous deletions targeted 4 known tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2C, BCL2L11, CDKN2A, and RB1) and 6 new genes (FAF1, MAP2, SP100, MOBKL2B, ZNF280A, and PRAME). Gene amplification coupled with overexpression was identified in 35 different regions. The most recurrent amplified regions were 11q13.3-q13.5, 13q31.3, and 18q21.33, which targeted CCND1, C13orf25, and BCL2, respectively. Interestingly, the breakpoints flanking all the genomic alterations, including UPDs, were significantly associated with genomic regions enriched in copy number variants and segmental duplications, suggesting that the recombination at these regions may play a role in the genomic instability of MCL. This integrative genomic analysis has revealed target genes that may be potentially relevant in MCL pathogenesis.",

However, the specific genetic changes responsible for the induction of this phenotypic change are unknown. Moreover, recent reports indicate that the dysplastic phenotype may not be immutable: in basal crypt dysplasia (CD), unequivocal dysplastic changes are seen in the crypts in Barrett's oesophagus and other pre-invasive lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, but the upper crypts and surface epithelium associated with these dysplastic crypts show the definitive morphology of a differentiated epithelium. The genotypic relationship between CD and the differentiated surface epithelium is presently unclear. We obtained 17 examples of CD: the lower and upper crypts and surface epithelium were differentially laser-microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and mutations were sought in tumour suppressor genes frequently associated with progression in Barrett's oesophagus. We found two patients who both showed a c. C238T mutation in the CDKN2A (CDKN2AInk4A) gene and where the precise microanatomical relationships could be discerned: this mutation was present in both the CD at the crypt base and in the upper crypt and surface epithelium. We conclude that, in CD, the dysplastic basal crypt epithelium and the upper crypt and surface epithelium show clonal CDKN2A mutations, thus showing definitively that the surface epithelium is derived from the dysplastic crypt epithelium: the dysplastic phenotype is therefore not fixed and can be reversed. The mechanism of this change is unclear but may be related to the possibility that dysplastic cells can, probably early in their progression, respond to differentiation signals. However, it is also clear that a heavy mutational burden can be borne by crypts in the gastrointestinal tract without the development of phenotypic dysplasia. We are evidently some way from understanding the plasticity and the genotypic correlates of the dysplastic phenotype.",

However, targeting of the IL-6/STAT3 axis in PCa patients has failed to provide therapeutic benefit. Here we show that genetic inactivation of Stat3 or IL-6 signalling in a Pten-deficient PCa mouse model accelerates cancer progression leading to metastasis. Mechanistically, we identify p19(ARF) as a direct Stat3 target. Loss of Stat3 signalling disrupts the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumour suppressor axis bypassing senescence. Strikingly, we also identify STAT3 and CDKN2A mutations in primary human PCa. STAT3 and CDKN2A deletions co-occurred with high frequency in PCa metastases. In accordance, loss of STAT3 and p14(ARF) expression in patient tumours correlates with increased risk of disease recurrence and metastatic PCa. Thus, STAT3 and ARF may be prognostic markers to stratify high from low risk PCa patients. Our findings challenge the current discussion on therapeutic benefit or risk of IL-6/STAT3 inhibition. ",

The most common BRAF mutation, V599E, was detected in one germline DNA sample only; M116R and G608H were newly described mutations. A high frequency (59%) of BRAF mutations was instead observed in tumor samples from patients also undergoing germline DNA analysis; at the somatic level, substitution of valine 599 was found to account for the majority (88%) of BRAF mutations. We then estimated the germline mutation rates in BRAF and CDKN2A among 358 consecutively collected patient samples originating in southern Italy; a low (2.5%) or very low (0.29%) prevalence of CDKN2A and BRAF mutations, respectively, was detected.;utation analysis of either blood DNA from a large collection of MM patients or matched MM tissues from a subset of such patients revealed that BRAF is somatically mutated and does not play a major role in melanoma susceptibility.

Evidence comes from unique genomic features of host DNA, mRNA, microRNA and CpG methylation profiles as revealed by recent comprehensive genomic analysis by The Cancer Genome Atlas Network. Their data show that gastric cancer is not one disease but rather comprises four major classes: EBV-positive, microsatellite instability (MSI), genomically stable and chromosome instability. The EBV-positive class has even more marked CpG methylation than does the MSI class, and viral cancers have a unique pattern of methylation linked to the downregulation of CDKN2A (p16) but not MLH1. EBV-positive cancers often have mutated PIK3CA and ARID1A and an amplified 9p24.1 locus linked to overexpression of JAK2, CD274 (PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2). Multiple noncoding viral RNAs are highly expressed. Patients who fail standard therapy may qualify for enrollment in clinical trials targeting cancer-related human gene pathways or promoting destruction of infected cells through lytic induction of EBV genes.

The majority of techniques to study oncogenic mutations require high quality and quantity DNA or are analytically challenging. Mass-spectrometry based mutation analysis however is a relatively simple and high-throughput method suitable for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour material. Targeted gene panels using this technique have been developed for several types of cancer. These current cancer hotspot panels are not focussed on the genes that are most relevant in gynaecological cancers. In this study, we report the design and validation of a novel, mass-spectrometry based panel specifically for gynaecological malignancies and present the frequencies of detected mutations. Using frequency data from the online Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, we selected 171 somatic hotspot mutations in the 13 most important genes for gynaecological cancers, being BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FOXL2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A and PTEN. A total of 546 tumours (205 cervical, 227 endometrial, 89 ovarian, and 25 vulvar carcinomas) were used to test and validate our panel, and to study the prevalence and spectrum of somatic mutations in these types of cancer. The results were validated by testing duplicate samples and by allele-specific qPCR. The panel presented here using mass-spectrometry shows to be reproducible and high-throughput, and is usefull in FFPE material of low quality and quantity. It provides new possibilities for studying large numbers of gynaecological tumour samples in daily practice, and could be useful in guided therapy selection. ",

With only ~300 cases diagnosed in the US per year, its link to asbestos exposure is not clear and its mutational landscape unknown.;We analyzed the somatic mutational landscape of 12 peritoneal MM of epitheloid subtype using copy number analysis (N = 9), whole exome sequencing (N = 7) and targeted sequencing (N = 12).;Peritoneal MM display few copy number alterations, with most samples having less than 10 Mbp total changes, mostly through deletions and no high copy number amplification. Chromosome band 3p21 encoding BAP1 is the most recurrently deleted region (5/9), while, in contrast to pleural MM, NF2 and CDKN2A are not affected. We further identified 87 non-silent mutations across 7 sequenced tumors, with a median of 8 mutated genes per tumor, resulting in a very low mutation rate (median 1.3 10(-6)). BAP1 was the only recurrently mutated gene (N = 3/7). In one additional case, loss of the entire chromosome 3 leaves a non-functional copy of BAP1 carrying a rare nonsense germline variant, thus suggesting a potential genetic predisposition in this patient. Finally, with targeted sequencing of BAP1 in 3 additional cases, we conclude that BAP1 is frequently altered through copy number losses (N = 3/12), mutations (N = 3/12) or both (N = 2/12) sometimes at a sub-clonal level.;Our findings suggest a major role for BAP1 in peritoneal MM susceptibility and oncogenesis and indicate important molecular differences to pleural MM as well as potential strategies for therapy and prevention.",

The exposures were performed in spring and autumn, with identical study procedures. In each season, healthy Wistar rats were exposed to TRAP at for 4 h, 7 d, 14 d, or 28 d. Global DNA methylation (LINE-1 and Alu) and specific gene methylation (p16(CDKN2A), APC, and iNOS) in the DNA from blood and lung tissues were quantified by pyrosequencing. Multiple linear regression was applied to assess the influence of air pollutants on DNA methylation levels. The levels of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in the high and moderate groups were significantly higher than in the control group. The DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between spring and autumn. When spring and autumn data were analyzed together, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 exposures were associated with changes in%5mC (95% CI) in LINE-1, iNOS, p16(CDKN2A), and APC ranging from -0.088 (-0.150, -0.026) to 0.102 (0.049, 0.154) per 1 μg/m(3) increase in the pollutant concentration. Prolonged exposure to a high level of TRAP was negatively associated with LINE-1 and iNOS methylation, and positively associated with APC methylations in the DNA from lung tissues but not blood.

BAP1 immunohistochemistry and p16 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have recently been reported as reliable markers of malignancy in biopsies of mesothelioma. To determine whether these markers, singly or in combination, might also be useful in effusion cytology specimens, we examined 15 biopsies of epithelial mesotheliomas and 3 benign mesothelial reactions and corresponding effusion cytology paraffin-embedded cell blocks. Four cytology specimens were too scanty for p16 FISH analysis but were interpretable for BAP1 immunohistochemistry. Overall, loss of BAP1 and/or deletion of p16 was seen in 11/11 (100%) of matched cytology and tissue biopsy specimens. BAP1 loss alone was seen in 10/15 (67%) biopsies and 10/15 (67%) cytology specimens. Homozygous deletion of p16 by FISH was found in 12/15 (80%) biopsy specimens and 8/11 (73%) evaluable cytology specimens. Seven of 15 (47%) biopsies and 5/11 (42%) cytology specimens showed loss of both markers. All mesothelioma biopsy/cytology pairs showed exactly the same pattern of BAP1 or p16 retention or loss in the biopsy and cytology specimens. The 2 peritoneal mesothelioma cases demonstrated loss of BAP1 but not p16. None of the benign mesothelial reactions or corresponding cytology specimens showed loss of either marker. We conclude that both BAP1 immunohistochemistry and p16 FISH analysis provide reliable markers of mesothelial malignancy in effusion cytology specimens, especially where the atypical mesothelial proliferation is well sampled. BAP1 is easier to interpret with scanty specimens. On the basis of small numbers of cases, use of both markers appears to increase sensitivity. ",

As a consequence, testing for DNA methylation biomarkers in plasma or other body fluids shows great promise for detection of malignancies at early stages and/or for monitoring response to treatment. However, DNA from normal leukocytes may contribute to the DNA in plasma and will affect biomarker specificity if there is any methylation in the leukocytes. DNA from 48 samples of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated for the presence of methylation of a panel of DNA methylation biomarkers that have been implicated in cancer. SMART-MSP, a methylation specific PCR (MSP) methodology based on real time PCR amplification, high-resolution melting and strategic primer design, enabled quantitative detection of low levels of methylated DNA. Methylation was observed in all tested mononuclear cell DNA samples for the CDH1 and HIC1 promoters and in majority of DNA samples for the TWIST1 and DAPK1 promoters. APC and RARB promoter methylation, at a lower average level, was also detected in a substantial proportion of DNA samples. We found no BRCA1, CDKN2A, GSTP1 and RASSF1A promoter methylation in this sample set. Several individuals had higher levels of methylation at several loci suggestive of a methylator phenotype. In conclusion, methylation of many potential DNA methylation biomarkers can be detected in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and is likely to affect their specificity for detecting low level disease.

Pathogenetic roles of these melanoma-prone mutations and their genetic interactions have been established in genetically engineered mouse models. Here, we catalog frequent genetic alterations observed in human melanomas and describe mouse models of melanoma initiation and progression, including our recent study that investigated the genetic interactions of RAS activation and PTEN loss in a CDKN2A (INK4a/ARF) null melanoma prone genetic background. We showed that loss of PTEN cooperates with HRAS activation, leading to increased development of melanoma and emergence of metastasis. Moreover, we observed that RNA i-mediated PTEN inactivation in RAS-driven melanomas enhanced migration and invasion with concomitant downregulation of E-cadherin, the major regulator of epithelial and mesenchymal transition, and enhanced AKT2 phosphorylation, which has been previously linked to invasion and metastasis of several cancer types, including breast and ovary. These data show that activated RAS cooperates with PTEN loss in melanoma genesis and progression.",

Here, the development of an ultrasensitive laser capture microdissection (LCM)/RNA-seq approach for studying the epithelial and stromal compartments of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) is described. ACF are the earliest identifiable preneoplastic lesion found within the human colon and are detected using high-definition endoscopy with contrast dye spray. The current analysis focused on the epithelium of ACF with somatic mutations to either KRAS, BRAF, or APC, and expression patterns compared with normal mucosa from each patient. By comparing gene expression patterns among groups, an increase in a number of proinflammatory NF-κB target genes was identified that was specific to ACF epithelium, including TIMP1, RELA, and RELB Distinct transcriptional changes associated with each somatic mutation were observed and a subset of ACF display BRAF(V600E)-mediated senescence-associated transcriptome characterized by increased expression of CDKN2A Finally, LCM-captured ACF-associated stroma was found to be transcriptionally distinct from normal-appearing stroma, with an upregulation of genes related to immune cell infiltration and fibroblast activation. Immunofluorescence confirmed increased CD3(+) T cells within the stromal microenvironment of ACF and an abundance of activated fibroblasts. Collectively, these results provide new insight into the cellular interplay that occurs at the earliest stages of colonic neoplasia, highlighting the important role of NF-κB, activated stromal fibroblasts, and lymphocyte infiltration.;Fibroblasts and immune cells in the stromal microenvironment play an important role during the earliest stages of colon carcinogenesis.

Overall, 80-85% of pHPT cases are due to a benign, single parathyroid adenoma (PA), and 15% to multiglandular disease (multiple adenomas/hyperplasia). Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is rare, accounting for <0.5-1% of pHPT cases. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is a complication of renal failure, with the development of parathyroid tumours and hypercalcaemia. Recurrent mutations in the MEN1 gene have been confirmed by the whole-exome sequencing in 35% of PAs, suggesting that non-protein-coding genes, regulatory elements or epigenetic derangements may also have roles in the majority of PAs. DNA translocations with cyclin D1 overexpression occur in PAs (8%). In PCs, mutations in CDC73/HRPT2 are common. Activation of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway (accumulation of nonphosphorylated β-catenin) by an aberrantly truncated LRP5 receptor has been seen for the majority of investigated PAs and sHPT tumours, and possibly by APC inactivation through promoter methylation in PCs. Promoter methylation of several other genes and repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation by EZH2 of the HIC1 gene may also contribute to parathyroid tumorigenesis. It is possible that a common pathway exists for parathyroid tumour development. CCND1 (cyclin D1) and EZH2 overexpression, accumulation of nonphosphorylated β-catenin and repression of HIC1 have all been observed to occur in PAs, PCs and sHPT tumours. In addition, hypermethylation has been observed for the same genes in PAs and PCs (e.g. SFRP1, CDKN2A and WT1). Whether β-catenin represents a 'hub' in parathyroid tumour development will be discussed.",

We show that during retinal development in mouse, there are dynamic patterns of expression of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalytic subunit EZH2 in retinal progenitors and some differentiated cells, as well as dynamic changes in the histone modification H3K27me3. Using conditional knockout of Ezh2 using either Pax6-αCre or Six3-Cre, we find selective reduction in postnatal retinal progenitor proliferation, disruption of retinal lamination, and enhanced differentiation of several late born cell types in the early postnatal retina, including photoreceptors and Müller glia, which are ultimately increased in number and become reactive. RNA-seq identifies many non-retinal genes upregulated with loss of Ezh2, including multiple Hox genes and the cell cycle regulator Cdkn2a, which are established targets of EZH2-mediated repression. ChIP analysis confirms loss of the H3K27me3 modification at these loci. Similar gene upregulation is observed in retinal explants treated with an EZH2 chemical inhibitor. There is considerable overlap with EZH2-regulated genes reported in non-neural tissues, suggesting that EZH2 can regulate similar genes in multiple lineages. Our findings reveal a conserved role for EZH2 in constraining the expression of potent developmental regulators to maintain lineage integrity and retinal progenitor proliferation, as well as regulating the timing of late differentiation.

Conventional 2-year rodent cancer studies of aspartame are considered negative, although a small number of neoplasms of the brain were observed in a rat study (Fed. Regist., 1981a,b). The NTP has explored the use of genetically altered mouse models as adjuncts to the 2-year rodent cancer assay. These models may prove to be more rapid, use fewer animals, and provide some mechanistic insights into neoplastic responses. As part of the evaluation of new mouse cancer screening models, aspartame was tested for potential toxicity and carcinogenicity in two relatively well-studied models, the Tg.AC hemizygous strain and the p53 haploinsufficient strain, and an uncharacterized model, the Cdkn2a deficient strain. Male and female Tg.AC hemizygous, p53 haploinsufficient, and Cdkn2a deficient mice were given feed containing aspartame (greater than 98% pure) for 9 months. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, rat bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 9-MONTH STUDY IN Tg.AC HEMIZYGOUS MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female Tg.AC hemizygous mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 490, 980, 1,960, 3,960, or 7,660 mg aspartame/kg body weight to males and 550, 1,100, 2,260, 4,420, or 8,180 mg/kg to females) for 40 weeks. Exposure to aspartame had no effect on survival. The mean body weights of 50,000 ppm females were greater than those of the controls from week 15 until the end of the study. Feed consumption by the exposed groups was similar to that by the control groups throughout the study. There were no neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions that were attributed to exposure to aspartame. 9-MONTH STUDY IN p53 HAPLOINSUFFICIENT MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female p53 haploinsufficient mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 490, 970, 1,860, 3,800, or 7,280 mg/kg to males and 630, 1,210, 2,490, 5,020, or 9,620 mg/kg to females) for 40 weeks. Exposure to aspartame had no effect on survival or mean body weights. Feed consumption by the exposed groups was similar to that by the control groups throughout the study. No neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions were attributed to exposure to aspartame. 9-MONTH STUDY IN Cdkn2a DEFICIENT MICE: Groups of 15 male and 15 female Cdkn2a deficient mice were fed diets containing 0, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame for 40 weeks (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately of approximately 490, 960, 1,900, 3,700, and 7,400 mg/kg to males and 610, 1,200, 2,390, 4,850, and 9,560 mg/kg to females). Survival of all exposed groups was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 3,125 and 6,250 ppm males were less than those of the controls after weeks 29 and 16, respectively. Mean body weights of female mice were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. The incidences of minimal to mild cytoplasmic vacuolization of periportal hepatocytes were significantly greater than controls in males exposed to 6,250, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm aspartame.;Aspartame was tested for induction of gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium. No mutagenicity was detected in strains TA98, TA100, or TA1535 with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). In addition, a single test in TA1537 with 30% rat liver S9 gave negative results. In TA97 with 30% rat liver S9, however, a reproducible small increase in mutant colonies was observed, and this response was judged to be equivocal. No mutagenicity was detected in TA97 without S9 or with hamster liver S9. An acute bone marrow micronucleus test was conducted with aspartame administered by gavage to male F344/N rats. No increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed at any dose level. Peripheral blood micronucleus tests were conducted after 9 months exposure of Tg.AC hemizygous, p53 haploinsufficient, and Cdkn2a deficient mice to aspartame in dosed feed. Negative results were obtained in male and female Tg.AC hemizygous and Cdkn2a deficient mice. Negative results were also obtained with male p53 haploinsufficient mice. In female p53 haploinsufficient mice, the results of the micronucleus test were judged to be positive, based on a significant trend test and a small but statistically significant increased frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in the 50,000 ppm group.;Under the conditions of this 9-month feed study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of aspartame in male or female p53 haploinsufficient mice exposed to 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm. Because this is a new model, there is uncertainty whether the study possessed sufficient sensitivity to detect a carcinogenic effect."},

        "Doc_abstract":"Mitochondria are more than just the powerhouse of cells; they dictate if a cell dies or survives. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fusion and fission in response to environmental conditions. We showed previously that mitochondria of cells in a low oxygen environment (hypoxia) hyperfuse to form enlarged or highly interconnected networks with enhanced metabolic efficacy and resistance to apoptosis. Modifications to the appearance and metabolic capacity of mitochondria have been reported in cancer. However, the precise mechanisms regulating mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism in cancer are unknown. Since hypoxia plays a role in the generation of these abnormal mitochondria, we questioned if it modulates mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial outer-membrane voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is at center stage in regulating metabolism and apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that VDAC1 was post-translationally C-terminal cleaved not only in various hypoxic cancer cells but also in tumor tissues of patients with lung adenocarcinomas. Cells with enlarged mitochondria and cleaved VDAC1 were also more resistant to chemotherapy-stimulated cell death than normoxic cancer cells.;Transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) knocked out for Vdac1 highlighted alterations in not only cancer and inflammatory pathways but also in the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway in normoxia. HIF-1α was stable in normoxia due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which decreased respiration and glycolysis and maintained basal apoptosis. However, in hypoxia, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in combination with maintenance of respiration and increased glycolysis counterbalanced the deleterious effects of enhanced ROS, thereby allowing Vdac1 (-/-) MEF to proliferate better than wild-type MEF in hypoxia. Allografts of RAS-transformed Vdac1 (-/-) MEF exhibited stabilization of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, blood vessel destabilization, and a strong inflammatory response. Moreover, expression of Cdkn2a, a HIF-1-target and tumor suppressor gene, was markedly decreased. Consequently, RAS-transformed Vdac1 (-/-) MEF tumors grew faster than wild-type MEF tumors.;Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells may be regulated by VDAC1 through vascular destabilization and inflammation. These findings provide new perspectives into the understanding of VDAC1 in the function of mitochondria not only in cancer but also in inflammatory diseases.",

Its invasive, lobular growth despite low-grade histology suggests a loss of chondrocyte polarity. The known genetics of osteochondromagenesis include mosaic loss of EXT1 or EXT2 in both hereditary and non-hereditary cases. The most frequent genetic aberrations in human PCS also include disruptions of CDKN2A or TP53. In order to test the sufficiency of either of these to drive progression of an osteochondroma to PCS, we added conditional loss of Trp53 or Ink4a/Arf in an Ext1-driven mouse model of osteochondromagenesis. Each additional tumour suppressor silencing efficiently drove the development of growths that mimic human PCS. As in humans, lobules developed from both Ext1-null and Ext1-functional clones within osteochondromas. Assessment of their orientation revealed an absence of primary cilia in the majority of mouse PCS chondrocytes, which was corroborated in human PCSs. Loss of primary cilia may be responsible for the lost polarity phenotype ascribed to PCS. Cilia deficiency blocks proliferation in physeal chondrocytes, but cell cycle deregulation is sufficient to rescue chondrocyte proliferation following deciliation. This provides a basis of selective pressure for the frequent cell-cycle regulator silencing observed in peripheral chondrosarcomagenesis. Mosaic loss of Ext1 combined with loss of cell cycle regulators promotes peripheral chondrosarcomagenesis in the mouse and reveals deficient ciliogenesis in both the model and the human disease, explaining biological behaviour including lobular and invasive growth.",

Thirty-two cases were retrieved and histomorphology was reviewed. Clinical history and follow-up were obtained through electronic record review. DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was extracted and processed from 27 cases. Genome-wide DNA copy number (CN) alterations and allelic imbalances were analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism array using Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Assay. Massive high-throughput deep parallel sequencing was performed using a customized panel targeting 410 cancer genes. Log rank, Fisher's exact test and Cox proportional hazards were used for statistical analysis. In this series of 32 patients (male n = 12, female n = 20), the average age was 66 years (19-93) and median follow up was 24 months (range 6-120 months). Frequent genomic alterations included CN losses in tumour suppressor genes including CDKN2A (70%), TP53 (56%) and RB1 (49%). Mutations affecting methylation/demethylation, chromatin remodeling and WNT/SHH pathways were identified in 40%, 27%, and 27%, respectively.

Our findings suggest that age above 60, positive margin status, simultaneous biallelic TP53 and RB1 losses and CDKN2A loss are associated with a worse outcome in ESOSA. Comparison between conventional paediatric osteosarcoma and ESOSA shows that, while both share genetic similarities, there are notable dissimilarities and mechanistic differences in the molecular pathways involved in ESOSA.

The bulk of this variation is stochastic and functionally neutral, with only a small minority representing \"drivers\" that contribute to the genesis and maintenance of tumors. Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors, reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate. Here, a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns. Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-RB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor β (RARB) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14(ARF) (P < 0.0001), suggesting a functional link between RARβ signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14(ARF). Mechanistically, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased the expression of p14(ARF) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14(ARF) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARβ. Furthermore, the ability of ATRA to induce senescence is reduced in p14(ARF)-depleted melanocytes, and we provide proof-of-concept that ATRA can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARβ-p14(ARF) signaling axis, independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status.;These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARβ and p14(ARF) with potential implications for melanoma treatment.",

Tumour cells from HDN are leukaemic counterparts of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Despite increased knowledge of the ontogenetic origin of these tumours, the genetic causes and oncogenic signalling events involved in malignant transformation are still unknown. To delineate novel candidate regions and disease-related genes, we studied nine typical CD4+CD56+ HDN cases using genome-wide high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Genomic imbalances, which were predominantly losses, were frequently detected. Gross genomic losses or gains involving an entire chromosome were observed in eight cases. The most frequent imbalances were deletions of chromosome 9, chromosome 13 and partial losses affecting 17p or 12p. Combinations of deletions of tumour suppressor genes (TSG), namely RB1, CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2A, (p16(ink4a), p14(arf)) or TP53 (p53), were observed in all cases. These results indicate that deletion events altering G1/S regulation are crucial for HDN oncogenesis. Furthermore, in addition to frequent sporadic gene losses, in one case we observed a 8q24 interstitial deletion that brought MYC closer to miR-30b/miR-30d, which may be related to their deregulation. Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to frequent G1/S checkpoint alterations, various genetic events could contribute to the chemoresistance of the tumour.",

Seventeen (57%) breakpoints were mapped at five breakpoint cluster sites, BCS-LL1 to LL5, each of <15 bp. Two breakpoint cluster sites were located within the ARF and CDKN2B loci, respectively, whereas the remaining three were located >100 kb distal to the CDKN2A, ARF, and CDKN2B loci. The sequences of breakpoint junctions indicated that deletions in the 11 (73%) cell lines were mediated by illegitimate V(D)J recombination targeted at the five BCS-LL and six other sites, which contain sequences similar to recombination signal sequences for V(D)J recombination. An extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assay indicated that BCS-LL3, at which the largest number of breakpoints (i.e. five breakpoints) was clustered, has a V(D)J recombination potential 150-fold less than the consensus recombination signal sequence.

Among the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are distinguished by their remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with approximately two thirds of anaplastic (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding dramatically to combination treatment with procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (termed PCV). Unfortunately, no clinical or pathologic feature of these tumors allows accurate prediction of their response to chemotherapy. Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas also are distinguished by a unique constellation of molecular genetic alterations, including coincident loss of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q in 50%-70% of tumors. We have hypothesized that these or other specific genetic changes might predict the response to chemotherapy and prognosis in patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Therefore, we have analyzed molecular genetic alterations involving chromosomes 1p, 10q, and 19q and the TP53 (on chromosome 17p) and CDKN2A (on chromosome 9p) genes, in addition to clinicopathologic features in 39 patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas for whom chemotherapeutic response and survival could be assessed.;Allelic loss (or loss of heterozygosity) of chromosome 1p is a statistically significant predictor of chemosensitivity, and combined loss involving chromosomes 1p and 19q is statistically significantly associated with both chemosensitivity and longer recurrence-free survival after chemotherapy. Moreover, in both univariate and multivariate analyses, losses involving both chromosomes 1p and 19q were strongly associated with longer overall survival, whereas CDKN2A gene deletions and ring enhancement (i.e., contrast enhancement forming a rim around the tumor) on neuroimaging were associated with a significantly worse prognosis. The inverse relationship between CDKN2A gene deletions and losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q further implies that these differential clinical behaviors reflect two independent genetic subtypes of anaplastic oligodendroglioma. These results suggest that molecular genetic analysis may aid therapeutic decisions and predict outcome in patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.",

Despite their common origin, these tumor types have distinct pathologies and clinical behaviors; a growing body of evidence indicates that they also arise via distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Identification of the genes that are mutated in genetic diseases characterized by the development of either neurofibromas and MPNSTs [neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)] or schwannomas [neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), schwannomatosis and Carney complex type 1] has greatly advanced our understanding of these mechanisms. The development of genetically engineered mice with ablation of NF1, NF2, SMARCB1/INI1 or PRKAR1A has confirmed the key role these genes play in peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis. Establishing the functions of the NF1, NF2, SMARCB1/INI1 and PRKAR1A gene products has led to the identification of key cytoplasmic signaling pathways promoting Schwann cell neoplasia and identified new therapeutic targets. Analyses of human neoplasms and genetically engineered mouse models have established that interactions with other tumor suppressors such as TP53 and CDKN2A promote neurofibroma-MPNST progression and indicate that intratumoral interactions between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types play an essential role in peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis. Recent advances have also provided new insights into the identity of the neural crest-derived populations that give rise to different types of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a transcription/translation factor that promotes the formation of tumors in transgenic mice; however, the underlying molecular events are not understood. To explore this in a human model system, YB-1 was expressed in mammary epithelial cells under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. The induction of YB-1 promoted phenotypes associated with malignancy in three-dimensional breast acini cultures. This was attributed to YB-1 enhancing the expression and activity of the histone acetyltransferase p300 leading to chromatin remodeling. Specifically, this relaxation of chromatin allowed YB-1 to bind to the BMI1 promoter. The induction of BMI1 engaged the Polycomb complex resulting in histone H2A ubiquitylation and repression of the CDKN2A locus. These events manifested functionally as enhanced self-renewal capacity that occurred in a BMI1-dependent manner. Conversely, p300 inhibition with anacardic acid prevented YB-1 from binding to the BMI1 promoter and thereby subverted self-renewal. Despite these early changes, full malignant transformation was not achieved until RSK2 became overexpressed concomitant with elevated human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity. The YB-1/RSK2/hTERT expressing cells formed tumors in mice that were molecularly subtyped as basal-like breast cancer. We conclude that YB-1 cooperates with p300 to allow BMI1 to over-ride p16(INK4a) -mediated cell cycle arrest enabling self-renewal and the development of aggressive breast tumors.",

A majority of Swedish families with hereditary melanoma predisposition thus lack germline mutations in these cell cycle G1 checkpoint-regulating genes. Additional genes with the potential to contribute to increased melanoma risk may code for related components of the cell cycle-regulating machinery.

We performed a genome-wide scan for allelic imbalance comparing 20 rat pheochromocytoma DNAs with normal rat DNA to better understand the pathobiology of the tumors and to correlate the findings with human pheochromocytoma. We identified allelic imbalance (AI) at candidate regions on rat chromosomes 8 and 19. Interestingly, the regions often lost in rat tumors are syntenic to regions involved in human pheochromocytomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis further validated the AI data. Sdhd and Rassf1a were analyzed in detail as they map to regions of AI on chromosome 8 and their homologues are implicated in human pheochromocytoma: we found no genetic mutations nor decreased expression. We also analyzed additional candidate genes, that is, rat homologues of genes predisposing to human pheochromocytoma and known tumor-suppressor genes, but we found no AI. In contrast, we observed frequent overexpression of Cdkn2a and Cdkn2c, encoding the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p18INK4c, respectively. The relative small number of allelic changes we found in rat pheochromocytoma might be related to their nonmalignant status and losses at chromosomes 8 and 19 are events that precede malignancy.

Pathogenesis involves upregulation of D-type cyclins and activation of oncogenes, but little is known about the role of tumor suppressor genes. Gene hypermethylation is an alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Various approaches have been used to elucidate the role of gene hypermethylation in MM, including a candidate gene approach, microarray approach for genes upregulated by hypomethylating agents, and a cancer pathway approach, which enables a comprehensive picture of the involvement of multiple tumor suppressor genes in MM. Based on the cancer pathway approach, the following data on the involvement of cell cycle control, intrinsic tumor suppressor, and cell signaling were derived. First, among the INK4 and CIP/KIP families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, only CDKN2B and CDKN2A are frequently hypermethylated. Second, methylation of SHP1 and soluble Wnt inhibitors is associated with constitutive activation of JAK/STAT and Wnt signaling. Importantly, downregulation of the signaling pathways can be restored by demethylation and re-expression of SHP1 and soluble Wnt inhibitors, which is potentially important therapeutically. Third, of the tumor suppressor genes involved in the DAPK/P14/HDM2/P53/Apaf-1 pathway, only DAPK is frequently methylated, which appeared to be an adverse prognostic factor to survival. Lastly, apart from being implicated in the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance to MM, aberrant gene promoter methylation might also account for late disease progression in MM. Future studies are needed to delineate the biologic consequence of gene hypermethylation, the prognostic effect of gene methylation, and the possibility of hypomethylation therapy.",

Therefore, detection of promoter hypermethylation is becoming important for diagnosis, prognosis, and aiding the design of cancer therapies. We describe a novel isothermal method for the detection of DNA hypermethylation.;Methylation-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MS-LAMP) is a novel adaptation of LAMP. MS-LAMP was used for the highly specific detection of hypermethylated CpGs in the promoters of the CDKN2A [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4)], GATA5 (GATA binding protein 5), and DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1) genes. The reactions occurred under isothermal conditions with 3 primer sets specific for methylated promoters. Both turbidimetry and fluorescence were used for detection. The MS-LAMP assay was validated with bisulfite-treated plasmid and genomic DNA controls of known methylation status and was applied to detect hypermethylation in 18 clinical tumor samples. A multiplex MS-LAMP for CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1 was also validated with the aid of synthetic positive and negative controls.;The MS-LAMP assay showed high specificity with plasmid and genomic DNA targets in reactions carried out in <1 h. The assay had a detection limit of approximately 30 copies of methylated target sequence and a selectivity of 0.5% methylated DNA in a mixture with unmethylated DNA. Compared with methylation-specific PCR, the MS-LAMP assay detected lower rates of methylation in lung adenocarcinoma samples. Simultaneous multiplex detection of hypermethylation in the 3 targets (CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1) was readily achieved with the MS-LAMP assay in both the turbidimetric and fluorescence detection formats.;MS-LAMP provides a highly specific isothermal method for methylation detection and is well suited for multiplex approaches.",

Activating point mutations in the KRAS oncogene are prevalent in pancreatic cancer and result in the stimulation of several pathways including the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Other genetic alterations, including telomere shortening and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4, which encode p16, p53, and SMAD4, respectively, also contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer. These, and other genetic events, can present at different stages in the development of PDAC at histologically defined precursor lesions known as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, or mucinous cystic neoplasms. Each precursor lesion represents alternate routes to PDAC formation and has a unique presentation and somewhat distinct genetic events controlling its development. Despite the advances in the understanding of the genetics of PDAC, the prognosis for this cancer remains poor, and several important aspects of its pathogenesis must be clarified to improve therapeutics, including the timing and method of metastases, as well as the relationship of the tumor cells with the desmoplastic stroma, which is a characteristic feature of the cancer. This review discusses the principal genetic alterations in PDAC and its precursor lesions, including their effects on promoting carcinogenesis. ",

Germline-inactivating mutations of BAP1 predispose to mesothelioma and certain other cancers. However, why mesothelioma is the predominate malignancy in some BAP1 families and not others, and whether exposure to asbestos is required for development of mesothelioma in BAP1 mutation carriers are not known. To address these questions experimentally, we generated a Bap1(+/-) knockout mouse model to assess its susceptibility to mesothelioma upon chronic exposure to asbestos. Bap1(+/-) mice exhibited a significantly higher incidence of asbestos-induced mesothelioma than wild-type (WT) littermates (73% vs. 32%, respectively). Furthermore, mesotheliomas arose at an accelerated rate in Bap1(+/-) mice than in WT animals (median survival, 43 weeks vs. 55 weeks after initial exposure, respectively) and showed increased invasiveness and proliferation. No spontaneous mesotheliomas were seen in unexposed Bap1(+/-) mice followed for up to 87 weeks of age. Mesothelioma cells from Bap1(+/-) mice showed biallelic inactivation of Bap1, consistent with its proposed role as a recessive cancer susceptibility gene. Unlike in WT mice, mesotheliomas from Bap1(+/-) mice did not require homozygous loss of Cdkn2a. However, normal mesothelial cells and mesothelioma cells from Bap1(+/-) mice showed downregulation of Rb through a p16(Ink4a)-independent mechanism, suggesting that predisposition of Bap1(+/-) mice to mesothelioma may be facilitated, in part, by cooperation between Bap1 and Rb. Drawing parallels to human disease, these unbiased genetic findings indicate that BAP1 mutation carriers are predisposed to the tumorigenic effects of asbestos and suggest that high penetrance of mesothelioma requires such environmental exposure.",

The malignant phenotype results from a step-wise increase of both genetic abnormalities and epigenetic modifications, leading to dysregulation of critical genes controlling cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The methylation of CpG islands within gene promoters is a major epigenetic transcriptional control mechanism that is frequently dysregulated in human cancer. This phenomenon (methylation of CpG islands) plays a critical role in the transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes in cancer and has prompted the development and testing of several demethylating agents aimed at reversing this process. Clinical trials using epigenetically targeted therapies have yielded particularly promising results in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in which tumour suppressor gene silencing by promoter methylation is a frequent event. Several genes and gene pathways disrupted by aberrant CpG island methylation have now been identified in haematological malignancies, the most frequently studied being the cell cycle inhibitors p16 (now termed CDKN2A; mostly methylated in lymphoid malignancy) and p15 (now termed CDKN2B; commonly methylated in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies).

The surveillance program consisted of annual magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and/or endoscopic ultrasound.;Four hundred eleven asymptomatic individuals participated in the surveillance programs, including 178 CDKN2A mutation carriers, 214 individuals with FPC, and 19 BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutation carriers. PDAC was detected in 13 (7.3%) of 178 CDKN2A mutation carriers. The resection rate was 75%, and the 5-year survival rate was 24%. Two CDKN2A mutation carriers (1%) underwent surgical resection for low-risk PRL. Two individuals (0.9%) in the FPC cohort had a pancreatic tumor, including one advanced PDAC and one early grade 2 neuroendocrine tumor. Thirteen individuals with FPC (6.1%) underwent surgical resection for a suspected PRL, but only four (1.9%) had high-risk lesions (ie, high-grade intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or grade 3 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms). One BRCA2 mutation carrier was found to have PDAC, and another BRCA2 mutation carrier and a PALB2 mutation carrier underwent surgery and were found to have low-risk PRL.

Furthermore, the cell expansion poses a risk of accumulating genetic abnormalities that could lead to malignant cell transformation. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the proliferation pattern as well as the resistance to spontaneous transformation of hASCs during expansion in a xeno-free culture condition.;hASCs were expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with pooled allogeneic human serum or fetal bovine serum to enable a side-by-side comparison. Cell viability and differentiation capacity toward the mesenchymal lineages were assessed, along with immunophenotype. Ki-67 expression and the proliferation kinetics were investigated. The expression of the transcription factors c-FOS and c-MYC was examined with Western blot, and MYC, CDKN2A, ERBB2 and TERT gene expression was assessed with quantitative PCR. Senescence was evaluated by β-gal staining. Karyotype analysis was performed and tumorigenesis assay in vivo was also evaluated.;The hASCs expanded in medium with pooled allogeneic human serum did not show remarkable differences in morphology, viability, differentiation capacity or immunophenotype. The main difference observed was a significantly higher proliferative effect on hASCs cultured in pooled allogeneic human serum. There was no significant difference in C-FOS expression; however, C-MYC protein expression was enhanced in pooled allogeneic human serum cultures compared to fetal bovine serum cultures. No difference was observed in MYC and TERT mRNA levels. Moreover, the hASCs presented normal karyotype undergoing senescence, and did not form in vivo tumors, eliminating the possibility that spontaneous immortalization of hASCs had occurred with pooled allogeneic human serum.;This complete characterization of hASCs cultivated in pooled allogeneic human serum, a suitable xeno-free approach, shows that pooled allogeneic human serum provides a high proliferation rate, which can be attributed for the first time to C-MYC protein expression, and showed cell stability for safe clinical applications in compliance with good manufacturing practice.",

To validate that hypothesis, we have investigated responses to gefitinib on various tumor parameters in human malignant gliomas that exhibited different molecular alterations.;We used a panel of six human malignant gliomas from established xenografts characterized for their genetic (EGFR, PTEN, TP53, and CDKN2A) and molecular (EGFR, PTEN, ERK, and Akt) alterations.

After treatment, invasion was inhibited in tumors with EGFR amplification in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment had only antiproliferative effect in two of three tumors with EGFR amplification. Tumors with PTEN loss were resistant to treatment. We did not observe shrinkage of the tumors after treatment. None of the tumors had mutations of the EGFR kinase domain.

Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007).

Among ten highly altered miRNAs, six miRNAs were successfully validated in tissues, whereas only two miRNAs, miR-126 and miR-142-3p showed increased expression in plasma of HBV-HCC compared to HBV-non-HCC patients. Subsequently, ROC curve analysis revealed that neither miR-126 nor miR-142-3p performed better than AFP in discriminating HCC from non-HCC while combination of each with AFP showed significantly higher efficiency rather than AFP alone (AUC: 0.922, 0.908 vs. 0.88; sensitivity: 0.84, 0.86 vs. 0.82 and specificity: 0.92, 0.94 vs. 0.86 respectively). Interestingly, triple combination of markers (miR-126 + miR-142-3p + AFP) showed no additive effect on efficiency (AUC: 0.925) over the dual combination. Again, the expression of only miR-126 was noticed significantly higher in HBV-HCC patients with low-AFP [<250 ng/ml] compared to either non-HCC or liver cirrhosis (AUC: 0.77, 0.64, respectively). Furthermore, no alteration in expression of mir-126 in HCV-HCC or non-viral-HCC revealed that miR-126 + AFP might be specific to HBV-HCC. To understand the physiological role of these two miRNAs in hepato-carcinogenesis, target genes related to cancer pathways (APAF1, APC2, CDKN2A, IRS1, CRKL, LIFR, EGR2) were verified.

        "Doc_abstract":"Phyllodes tumours and cellular fibroadenomas are both fibroepithelial tumours of the breast. Phyllodes tumours, unlike fibroadenomas, have the ability to recur and metastasise. Although these lesions can be distinguished by their stromal cellularity, mitotic index, presence or absence of stromal overgrowth and cellular atypia, there is overlap and not infrequently a definitive diagnosis cannot be made, particularly on biopsy. We sought to evaluate whether DNA promoter methylation profiling using selected genes known to be methylated in cancer would allow us to learn more about the biology of these tumours, and whether it could identify methylation markers that could differentiate phyllodes tumours from fibroadenomas and/or distinguish phyllodes tumours of different grades. Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) was used to screen promoter DNA methylation changes in 86 phyllodes tumours (15 benign, 28 borderline, 43 malignant) and 26 fibroadenomas. A panel of 11 genes (RASSF1A, TWIST1, APC, WIF1, MGMT, MAL, RARβ, CDKN2A, CDH1, TP73 and MLH1) was tested. Methylation status was correlated with histology and with clinicopathological parameters. Five of the gene promoters showed some methylation in a proportion of phyllodes tumours; RASSF1A, 45.3%; TWIST1, 10.7%; APC, 4.1%; WIF1, 2.9% and MGMT, 1.3%. Only two genes showed any methylation in fibroadenomas usually at background levels; RASSF1A, 53.8% and MGMT, 8.3%. No CDKN2A methylation was observed in either tumour type, contrary to previous reports. Overall, the methylation patterns differed little from that which might be seen in normal cells. However, significant levels of methylation of RASSF1A (24.4%) and TWIST1 (7.1%) was observed in some phyllodes tumours. Elevated RASSF1A and/or TWIST1 methylation was significantly associated with phyllodes tumours compared with fibroadenomas (P = 0.02), TWIST1 methylation correlated with increasing malignancy in phyllodes tumours (P < 0.001). In conclusion, assessment of methylation of RASSF1A and TWIST1 may aid in the diagnosis of phyllodes tumours. The absence of frequent methylation in fibroadenomas supports a non-neoplastic origin.",

Therefore, the detection of DNA methylation with high sensitivity and specificity is important, and various detection methods have been developed. Recently, upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been found to display a high signal-to-noise ratio and no photobleaching, making them useful for diagnostic applications. In this pilot study, we applied UCNPs to the detection of CDKN2A methylation and evaluated the feasibility of this system for use in molecular diagnostics. DNA PCR was performed using biotinylated primers, and the PCR amplicon was then intercalated with SYTOX Orange dye, followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated UCNPs. Fluorescence detection of the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of the UCNPs (MS-UC-FRET) was then performed, and the results were compared to those from real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) and pyrosequencing. Detection by MS-UC-FRET was more sensitive than that by either RQ-PCR or pyrosequencing. Our results confirmed the success of our MS-UC-FRET system for detecting DNA methylation and demonstrated the potential application of this system in molecular diagnostics. ",

Samples 2 and 3 comprised, respectively, 864 and 524 Italian non-diabetic participants. All individuals underwent an OGTT. Screening for the rs10811661 polymorphism was performed using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay.;The rs10811661 polymorphism did not show a significant association with age, BMI and insulin sensitivity. Participants carrying the TT genotype showed a significant reduction in insulin release, measured by an OGTT-derived index, compared with carriers of the C allele, in the three samples. When these results were pooled with those of three published studies, and meta-analysed with a random-effects model, the T allele was significantly associated with reduced insulin secretion (-35.09 [95% CI 14.68-55.52], p = 0.0008 for CC+CT vs TT; and -29.45 [95% CI 9.51-49.38], p = 0.0038, for the additive model).

Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed during gestation one of two isocaloric diets, control (18% casein) or low protein (LP, 9% casein). The expression of p16 mRNA in the mammary gland of the LP offspring was decreased by 75% vs. control. We also detected decreased p16 protein content in the mammary glands of pups gestated under the LP diet. Analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in offspring rats with maternal LP diet revealed the regulatory mechanisms underlying decreased p16 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that the altered p16 mRNA level and transcription rate in LP offspring resulted from histone code changes, including the reduced acetylation of histone H4 and the dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 residues within the p16 promoter region. These results supported the hypothesis that maternal protein restriction during pregnancy programs p16 expression through histone code alterations in offspring mammary gland.",

We observed significantly decreased risk of meningioma with the CASP8 Ex14-271A>T variant [odds ratio (OR)(AT), 0.8; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.5-1.2; OR(AA), 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P(trend) = 0.03] and increased risk of meningioma with the CASP8 Ex13+51G>C variant (OR(GC), 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1; OR(CC), 3.6; 95% CI, 1.0-13.1; P(trend) = 0.04).

To study resistance mechanisms, which include feedback activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in melanoma, we developed a luciferase-modified cell line (2341luc) from a BrafV600E mutant and Cdkn2a- deficient murine high-grade glioma, and analyzed its molecular responses to BRAFV600E- and MAPK kinase (MEK)-targeted inhibition. Immunocompetent, syngeneic FVB/N mice with intracranial grafts of 2341luc were tested for effects of BRAFV600E and MEK inhibitor treatments, with bioluminescence imaging up to 14-days after start of treatment and survival analysis as primary indicators of inhibitor activity. Intracranial injected tumor cells consistently generated high-grade glioma-like tumors in syngeneic mice. Intraperitoneal daily delivery of BRAFV600E inhibitor dabrafenib only transiently suppressed MAPK signaling, and rather increased Akt signaling and failed to extend survival for mice with intracranial 2341luc tumor. MEK inhibitor trametinib delivered by oral gavage daily suppressed MAPK pathway more effectively and had a more durable anti-growth effect than dabrafenib as well as a significant survival benefit. Compared with either agent alone, combined BRAFV600E and MEK inhibitor treatment was more effective in reducing tumor growth and extending animal subject survival, as corresponding to sustained MAPK pathway inhibition.

Understanding the mechanisms driving the subtypes may be key in development of novel therapeutics but is challenged by lineage-specific expression signals. Using a t-test statistics approach, we compared gene expression subtypes across 12 tumor types, which identified eight transcriptional superclusters characterized by commonly activated disease pathways and similarities in gene expression. One of the largest superclusters was determined by the upregulation of a proliferation signature, significant enrichment in TP53 mutations, genomic loss of CDKN2A (p16(ARF)), evidence of increased numbers of DNA double strand breaks and high expression of cyclin B1 protein. These correlations suggested that abrogation of the P53-mediated apoptosis response to DNA damage results in activation of cell cycle pathways and represents a common theme in cancer. A second consistent pattern, observed in 9 of 11 solid tumor types, was a subtype related to an activated tumor-associated stroma. The similarity in transcriptional footprints across cancers suggested that tumor subtypes are commonly unified by a limited number of molecular themes. ",

Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division.;We examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2 [p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study. DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in the genes. The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis.;The rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. Elevated expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding.;It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Further study is required to validate this finding.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is regarded as a rare glial neoplasm of unknown origin, and a detailed analysis of molecular alterations underlying this disease has started only recently. However, because GC characteristically affects large parts of the brain and spinal cord, the distribution of genetic alterations may be highly variable between different tumor areas. Additionally, tumor areas with varying degrees of differentiation may be present, raising the possibility to model the genetic events associated with astrocytoma progression. Here we analyzed various tumor regions with features of low-grade and high-grade astrocytomas from 9 autopsy-proven GC cases for the immunoexpression of the cell cycle-controlling proteins mdm2, p21, p27/kip1, p16, and Rb. The samples were also screened for EGFR expression, and for amplification of the EGFR and MDM2 genes. Furthermore, allelic losses of the CDKN2A gene and of a PTEN flanking region of chromosome 10 were determined. We detected tumor regions with immunoexpression of p21 only rarely in our series, without association to the tumor grade. No MDM2 gene amplification was detected. In contrast, three cases demonstrated maintained Rb expression. The expression of p27(kip1) showed a clear reduction with increasing astrocytoma malignancy in 7 cases. Allelic loss of the CDKN2A gene occurred in 5 patients but was not related to the tumor grading, nor to the intensity of p16 immunoexpression. No homozygous CDKN2Adeletions were detected. EGFR amplification was also absent in our series, but one case demonstrated EGFR expression only in the high-grade tumor area. Allelic losses on chromosome 10 were found in one out of six informative cases. However, marked differences in the immunoexpression, as well as in the distribution of genetic aberrations were seen between different tumor samples within a given case. The distribution of the alterations suggests that these molecular genetic changes represent secondary events, which may develop within tumor clones derived from a common founder tumor clone characterized by extraordinary spreading through the brain. Moreover, the detected aberrations in gliomatosis cerebri can reflect the tumor progression associated with secondary malignant astrocytoma formation even within a single case.",

        "Doc_abstract":"One major challenge in cancer research is to understand the complex interplay between the DNA damage response (DDR), genomic integrity, and tumor development. To address these issues, we analyzed 43 bladder tumor genomes from 22 patients using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and tissue expression of multiple DDR proteins, including Timeless and its interaction partner Tipin. The SNP profiles confirmed and extended known copy number alterations (CNAs) at high resolution, showed clustering of CNAs at nine common fragile sites, and revealed that most metachronous tumors were clonally related. The occurrence of many novel uniparental disomy regions (UPDs) was of potential functional importance in some tumors because UPDs spanned mutated FGFR3 and PIK3CA alleles, and also homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus. The DDR signaling as evaluated by phospho-epitope-specific antibodies against Ser139-phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γH2AX), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) was commonly activated in tumors with both moderate and high extent of accumulated genomic aberrations, the latter tumors showing a more frequent loss of ATM expression. Strikingly, the tumor genomes exhibiting the most complex alterations were associated with a high Ki67-proliferation index, abundant Timeless but not Tipin expression, aberrant p53 expression, and homozygous CDKN2A deletions. Of clinical relevance, evaluation of a tissue microarray (TMA; n=319) showed that abundant Timeless expression was associated with risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease (P<0.0005; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.8) and higher T stage (P<0.05). Univariate analysis confirmed this association (P=0.006) in an independent cohort (n=241) but statistical significance was not reached in a multivariate model. Overall, our results are consistent with DDR activation preceding the accumulation of genomic aberrations. Tumors with extensive genomic rearrangements were associated with inactivation of CDKN2A, excessive proliferation, and robust Timeless expression, the latter also correlating with the risk of disease progression. Moreover, we provide evidence to suggest that UPDs likely contribute to bladder tumorigenesis. ",

The SNPs from the 9p21 region constitute a risk haplotype due to the strong linkage disequilibrium in this area. These SNPs have been extensively replicated in several European and Asian populations, and are associated with other pathologies such as abdominal aortic and intracranial aneurysms, and with intermediate phenotypes such as arterial stiffness and coronary calcium. The risk haplotype of 9p21 is located in a region without annotated genes, near CDKN2A and CDKN2B, known tumor suppressor genes encoding for inhibitors of cell cycle kinases. In the remaining regions the SNPs are located in genes with known roles in atherosclerosis as well as others with new roles. It has been shown that the incorporation of genetic information in the form of SNPs slightly improves the prediction of long-term cardiovascular risk estimated by the Framingham function, allowing the reclassification of individuals into more precise categories.

Functional ablation of Rnf2 results in gastrulation arrest, in contrast to relatively mild phenotypes in most other PcG gene null mutants belonging to the same functional group, among which is Ring1. Developmental defects occur in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues during gastrulation. The early lethal phenotype is reminiscent of that of the PcG-gene knockouts Eed and Ezh2, which belong to a separate functional PcG group and PcG protein complex. This finding indicates that these biochemically distinct PcG complexes are both required during early mouse development. In contrast to the strong skeletal transformation in Ring1 hemizygous mice, hemizygocity for Rnf2 does not affect vertebral identity. However, it does aggravate the cerebellar phenotype in a Bmi1 null-mutant background. Together, these results suggest that Rnf2 or Ring1-containing PcG complexes have minimal functional redundancy in specific tissues, despite overlap in expression patterns. We show that the early developmental arrest in Rnf2-null embryos is partially bypassed by genetic inactivation of the Cdkn2a (Ink4aARF) locus. Importantly, this finding implicates Polycomb-mediated repression of the Cdkn2a locus in early murine development.",

However, a choice of markers for CIMP has been controversial. A recent extensive investigation has selected five methylation markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) as surrogate markers for epigenomic aberrations in tumor. The use of these markers as a CIMP-specific panel needs to be validated by an independent, large dataset. Using MethyLight assays on 920 colorectal cancers from two large prospective cohort studies, we quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific markers [the above five plus CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, and MLH1]. A CIMP-high cutoff was set at > or = 6/8 or > or = 5/8 methylated promoters, based on tumor distribution and BRAF/KRAS mutation frequencies. All but two very specific markers [MLH1 (98% specific) and SOCS1 (93% specific)] demonstrated > or = 85% sensitivity and > or = 80% specificity, indicating overall good concordance in methylation patterns and good performance of these markers. Based on sensitivity, specificity, and false positives and negatives, the eight markers were ranked in order as: RUNX3, CACNA1G, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CRABP1, SOCS1, and CDKN2A. In conclusion, a panel of markers including at least RUNX3, CACNA1G, IGF2, and MLH1 can serve as a sensitive and specific marker panel for CIMP-high.",

Because constitutional DNA is not readily available as a control at the time of diagnosis, it is important to be able to distinguish between acquired and constitutional aberrations in a diagnostic setting. In the present study we focused on uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs). SNP array analyses of 143 pediatric and 38 adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias and matched remission samples revealed acquired whole chromosome or segmental UPIDs (wUPIDs, sUPIDs) in 32 cases (18%), without any age- or gender-related frequency differences. Acquired sUPIDs were larger than the constitutional ones (mean 35.3 Mb vs. 10.7 Mb; P < 0.0001) and were more often terminally located in the chromosomes (69% vs. 4.5%; P < 0.0001). Chromosomes 3, 5, and 9 were most often involved in acquired wUPIDs, whilst recurrent acquired sUPIDs targeted 6p, 9p, 9q, and 14q. The majority (56%) of sUPID9p was associated with homozygous CDKN2A deletions. In pediatric ALL, all wUPIDs were found in high hyperdiploid (51-67 chromosomes) cases and an extended analysis, also including unmatched diagnostic samples, revealed a higher frequency of wUPID-positivity in higher modal number (56-67 chromosomes) than in lower modal number (51-55 chromosomes) high hyperdiploid cases (34% vs. 11%; P = 0.04), suggesting different underlying mechanisms of formation of these subtypes of high hyperdiploidy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Doc_abstract":"Interaction of doxorubicin DOX with iron and the consequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major player in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, this study has been initiated to investigate the preventive effect of the iron chelator, desferrioxamine (DFX), against DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity in rats. Male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups and were injected intraperitoneally (I.P.) with normal saline, a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg), a single dose of DFX (250 mg/kg) and a combined treatment with DFX (250 mg/kg) 30 min prior to a single dose of DOX, (15 mg/kg). A single dose of DOX significantly increased mRNA expression of TGF-β, Smad2, Smad4, CDKN2A and p53 and significantly decreased Samd7 and Mdm2 mRNA expression levels. Administration of DFX prior to DOX resulted in a complete reversal of DOX-induced alteration in cardiac enzymes and gene expression to normal levels. Data from this study suggest that (1) DOX induces its acute cardiotoxicity secondary to increasing genes expression of TGF-β/Smad pathway. (2) DOX increases apoptosis through upregulation of CDKN2A and p53 and downregulation of Mdm2 gene expression. (3) The preventive effect of DFX against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated via the TGF-β1/Smad pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) are typical genotoxic carcinogens that can induce tumors in a variety of human and rodent tissues. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying their tumorigenesis are unclear. In this study we used a MCA/DEN-induced multistep lung carcinogenesis rat model to study the evolution of alterations in DNA methylation. Rats were treated with a single dose of MCA and DEN in iodized oil by left intra-bronchial instillation. The animals were killed on days 15, 35, 55, 65 and 75 and samples of various pathological phases during carcinogenesis were obtained on these days. The status of global methylation was analyzed for each sample using a monoclonal antibody specific for 5-methycytosine (5-mC) and quantified by image analysis software. We found that the degree of global methylation was, in general, higher in basal cells compared to luminal cells of normal, precancerous and tumor tissues. The combined 5-mC scores of different types of tissues decreased gradually during the progression of carcinogenesis. We also used methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR (MS-AP-PCR) to screen a total of eight differentially methylated DNA fragments in both precancerous and tumor tissues isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM), and observed that both unique hypomethylation and hypermethylation fragments coexist after exposure to genotoxic carcinogens. Remarkably, epigenetic alterations in p16 (CDKN2A), but not in p15 (CDKN2B), were observed, and these correlated with the presence of pathologic lung lesions and loss of p16 protein expression. Moreover, defective expression of p16 in methylated primary tumor cell lines recovered markedly after treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). These results suggest that DNA methylation alterations are an early event in tumorigenesis and play an important role during MCA/DEN-induced multistep rat lung carcinogenesis.",

To date, two high-penetrance melanoma susceptibility genes, cyclin-dependent kinas inhibitor (CDKN)2A on chromosome 9p21 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4) on 12q13, have been identified. Germline inactivating mutations of the CDKN2A gene are the most common cause of inherited susceptibility to melanoma. Worldwide, a few families have been found to harbor CDK4 mutations. However, predisposing alterations to familial melanoma are still unknown in a large proportion of kindreds. Other melanoma susceptibility loci have been mapped through genome-wide linkage analysis, although the putative causal genes at these loci have yet to be identified. Much ongoing research is being focused on the identification of low-penetrance melanoma susceptibility genes that confer a lower melanoma risk with more frequent variations. Specific variants of the MC1R gene have been demonstrated to confer an increase in melanoma risk. In addition, conflicting data are available on other potential low-penetrance genes encoding proteins involved in pigmentation, cell growth and differentiation, DNA repair or detoxifying of metabolites.",

This gene, termed CDKN2X, shows a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to members of the mammalian CDKN2 gene family, which includes the tumor suppressor loci CDKN2A (P16) and CDKN2B (P15). Comparative sequence analysis suggests that fish CDKN2X is similarly related to all four mammalian gene family members, and may represent a descendant of an ancestral prototypic CDKN2 gene. CDKN2X was mapped to a region on autosomal Xiphophorus linkage group V (LG V) known to contain the DIFF gene that acts as a tumor suppressor of melanoma formation in X. helleri/X. maculatus backcross hybrids. Thus, CDKN2X may be a candidate for the tumor suppressor DIFF gene. Here we have sequenced CDKN2X in both Xiphophorus species and have characterized its expression in normal and melanotic tissues within control and backcross hybrid fish. A simultaneous expressional analysis of the Xmrk-2 tyrosine kinase receptor gene, which is strongly implicated in melanomagenesis in this system, was also performed. RT - PCR analyses revealed that both genes were highly expressed in melanomas.

Thereof, 27 showed significant up-regulation and 4 significant down-regulation. Markedly elevated mRNA-levels of the constitutively active and reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme NOX4 were found in all evaluable FECD samples. In addition, increased expression of CDKN2A and its transcriptional activators ETS1 and ARHGAP18 (SENEX) along with decreased expression of CDKN2A inhibitor ID1 were detected in FECD samples.

        "Doc_abstract":"Understanding the biology that underlies histologically similar but molecularly distinct subgroups of cancer has proven difficult because their defining genetic alterations are often numerous, and the cellular origins of most cancers remain unknown. We sought to decipher this heterogeneity by integrating matched genetic alterations and candidate cells of origin to generate accurate disease models. First, we identified subgroups of human ependymoma, a form of neural tumour that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Subgroup-specific alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma. To select cellular compartments most likely to give rise to subgroups of ependymoma, we matched the transcriptomes of human tumours to those of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), isolated from different regions of the CNS at different developmental stages, with an intact or deleted Ink4a/Arf locus (that encodes Cdkn2a and b). The transcriptome of human supratentorial ependymomas with amplified EPHB2 and deleted INK4A/ARF matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf(-/-) NSCs. Notably, activation of Ephb2 signalling in these, but not other, NSCs generated the first mouse model of ependymoma, which is highly penetrant and accurately models the histology and transcriptome of one subgroup of human supratentorial tumour. Further, comparative analysis of matched mouse and human tumours revealed selective deregulation in the expression and copy number of genes that control synaptogenesis, pinpointing disruption of this pathway as a critical event in the production of this ependymoma subgroup. Our data demonstrate the power of cross-species genomics to meticulously match subgroup-specific driver mutations with cellular compartments to model and interrogate cancer subgroups.",

Although the outcomes in patients affected by GIST have dramatically improved, tumor progression control still remains a challenge. The aim of this study is the genomic characterization of individual metastatic KIT-exon 11-mutant GIST to identify additional aberrations and simultaneous molecular events representing potential therapeutic targets.Seven patients with metastatic GIST were studied with whole transcriptome sequencing and copy number analysis. Somatic single nucleotide variations were called; however, no shared mutated genes were detected except KIT. Almost all patients showed loss of genomic regions containing tumor suppressor genes, sometimes coupled with single nucleotide mutation of the other allele. Additionally, six fusion transcripts were found and three patients showed amplifications involving known oncogenes.Evaluating the concordance between CN status and mRNA expression levels, we detected overexpression of CCND2 and EGFR and silencing of CDKN2A, CDKN2C, SMARCB1, PTEN and DMD. Altered expression of these genes could be responsible for aberrant activation of signaling pathways that support tumor growth. In this work, we assessed the effect of Hedgehog pathway inhibition in GIST882 cells, which causes decrement of cell viability associated with reduction of KIT expression.Additional genomic alterations not previously reported in GIST were found even if not shared by all samples. This contributes to a more detailed molecular understanding of this disease, useful for identification of new targets and novel therapeutics and representing a possible point of departure for a truly individualized clinical approach.

The genomic landscape of the PDAC genome features four frequently mutated genes (KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4) and dozens of candidate driver genes altered at low frequency, including potential clinical targets. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising resource to detect molecular characteristics of tumors, supporting the concept of \"liquid biopsy\".We determined the mutational status of KRAS in plasma cfDNA using multiplex droplet digital PCR in 259 patients with PDAC, retrospectively. Furthermore, we constructed a novel modified SureSelect-KAPA-Illumina platform and an original panel of 60 genes. We then performed targeted deep sequencing of cfDNA in 48 patients who had ≥1 % mutant allele frequencies of KRAS in plasma cfDNA.Droplet digital PCR detected KRAS mutations in plasma cfDNA in 63 of 107 (58.9 %) patients with inoperable tumors. Importantly, potentially targetable somatic mutations were identified in 14 of 48 patients (29.2 %) examined by cfDNA sequencing.Our two-step approach with plasma cfDNA, combining droplet digital PCR and targeted deep sequencing, is a feasible clinical approach.

We assessed the role of these factors on melanoma risk in two types of families: families ascertained through melanoma probands but unselected by family history and melanoma-prone families.;Data on pigmentary traits, nevus phenotypes, exposure to sun, and reactions to sunlight were collected from 295 families unselected by family history and 53 melanoma-prone families. We modeled melanoma risk using a logistic regressive model incorporating the effect of a melanoma-predisposing gene, familial dependence, and potential risk factors (e.g., pigmentary traits, nevus phenotypes, history of sun exposure, skin reactions to sunlight). Maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the regressive model were used to compute odds ratios associated with each risk factor and age-specific melanoma risk depending on the genotype at the melanoma-predisposing gene and the effects of risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided.;In the families unselected by family history, there was statistically significant evidence (P<.001) for a dominant gene, with melanoma risk reaching 0.49 and 0.67 by age 80 years in male and female gene carriers, respectively. Melanoma risk was statistically significantly influenced by total nevi (odds ratio of hazard function [OR] = 5.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.47 to 8.99), sun exposure (OR = 5.37, 95% CI = 4.44 to 6.36), and sunburn interacting with the gene (OR = 26.31, 95% CI = 7.56 to 99.22 in gene carriers and OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.03 in noncarriers).

With regard to genetic factors, the discovery of two types of genes was a great advance in further understanding the biology of the melanocyte. CDKN2A (p16) is the prototype of the high-penetrance, low-prevalence gene related to melanoma. This gene has been studied in some families in which several members have been diagnosed with melanoma. In the general population with non-familial melanoma, low-penetrance, high-prevalence genes such as MC1R seem to be more interesting. Studies on the MC1R gene have not only shown its importance in skin and hair pigmentation, but also in the development of melanoma. Functional studies on CDKN2A and MC1R have led us to new and important conclusions. The analysis of data from studies on families, twins and control cases, with the collaboration of several countries, will lead us to new discoveries.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) routine biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection samples from 32 patients were tested: nonprogressors to HGD or EAC (BIM-NP) with BIM, who never had a diagnosis of dysplasia or EAC (N = 13); progressors to HGD or EAC (BIM-P) with BIM and a worse diagnosis of HGD or EAC (N = 15); and four BIM-negative samples.

Recently, these two epigenetic processes have been dynamically linked. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 appears to reside in a complex with histone deacetylase activity. MeCP2 can mediate formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin on methylated promoter templates in vitro, and this process can be reversed by trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase. Little is known, however, about the relative roles of methylation and histone deacetylase activity in the stable inhibition of transcription on densely methylated endogenous promoters, such as those for silenced alleles of imprinted genes, genes on the female inactive X chromosome and tumour-suppressor genes inactivated in cancer cells. We show here that the hypermethylated genes MLH1, TIMP3 (TIMP3), CDKN2B (INK4B, p15) and CDKN2A (INK4, p16) cannot be transcriptionally reactivated with TSA alone in tumour cells in which we have shown that TSA alone can upregulate the expression of non-methylated genes. Following minimal demethylation and slight gene reactivation in the presence of low dose 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC), however, TSA treatment results in robust re-expression of each gene. TSA does not contribute to demethylation of the genes, and none of the treatments alter the chromatin structure associated with the hypermethylated promoters. Thus, although DNA methylation and histone deacetylation appear to act as synergistic layers for the silencing of genes in cancer, dense CpG island methylation is dominant for the stable maintenance of a silent state at these loci.",

In lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum. To date the penetrance of DNA methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. We used the real-time PCR-based method MethyLight to examine DNA methylation quantitatively at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples from non-lung cancer patients.;We identified thirteen loci showing significant differential DNA methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor lung; eight of these show highly significant hypermethylation in adenocarcinoma: CDH13, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1, OPCML, RASSF1, SFPR1, and TWIST1 (p-value << 0.0001). Using the current tissue collection and 5-fold cross validation, the four most significant loci (CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML) individually distinguish lung adenocarcinoma from non-cancer lung with a sensitivity of 67-86% and specificity of 74-82%. DNA methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers. We applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.;The identification of eight CpG island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum.

MMs arising in Arf (+/-) mice consistently exhibit biallelic inactivation of Arf, but, unexpectedly, do not acquire additional recurrent genetic alterations that we previously identified in asbestos-induced MMs arising in Nf2 (+/-) mice. Array CGH analysis was used to detect a recurrent deletion at chromosome 4C6 in MMs from Arf (+/-) mice. A candidate gene in this region, Faf1 (FAS-associated factor 1), was further explored, because it encodes a protein implicated in tumor cell survival and in the pathogenesis of some human tumor types. We confirmed hemizygous loss of Faf1 and down-regulation of Faf1 protein in a series of MMs from Arf (+/-) mice, and we then showed that Faf1 regulates TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB signaling, a pathway previously implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis of human mesothelial cells. Collectively, these data indicate that Arf inactivation has a significant role in driving MM pathogenesis, and implicate Faf1 as a key component in the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling node that has now been independently implicated in asbestos-induced oncogenesis.",

Although several recent modifications of the grading system have improved our ability to predict biologic behavior, additional prognostic markers are needed. Inactivation of the cell cycle regulator, p16 (CDKN2A), has recently been observed in a small subset of atypical and the majority of anaplastic meningiomas. To assess the potential clinical utility of this marker, we performed dual-color FISH on 117 well-characterized archival meningiomas using paired commercial probes to the chromosome 9 centromeric (CEP9) and p16 (9p21) regions. Benign meningiomas (N = 42) were divided into non-recurring versus recurring groups. Atypical meningiomas (N = 52) consisted of proliferative and brain invasive subsets. The 23 anaplastic meningiomas were not further stratified. Deletion of p16 or monosomy 9 was seen in 17% of benign, 52% of atypical, and 74% of anaplastic meningiomas (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found among subsets of benign or subsets of atypical meningioma, though there were more recurrences in those with deletion. Despite potential effects on cell cycle regulation, p16 deletions were not restricted to meningiomas with a high proliferative index. Most importantly, p16 deletion was strongly associated with survival in the anaplastic meningioma cohort, with a risk ratio for death of 6.79 (p = 0.016). Conversely, absence of deletion identified a subset of anaplastic meningioma patients (26%) with prolonged survival. We conclude that chromosome 9p21 deletions are associated with malignant progression of meningiomas and poor prognosis in anaplastic meningiomas.",

We have previously shown that a single neonatal UV radiation (UVR) dose delivered to mice that carry melanocyte-specific activation of Hras (TPras) increases melanoma penetrance from 0% to 57%. Here, we report that activated Cdk4 cooperates with activated Hras to enhance susceptibility to melanoma in mice. Whereas UVR treatment failed to induce melanomas in Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice, it greatly increased the penetrance and decreased the age of onset of melanoma development in Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras animals compared with TPras alone. This increased penetrance was dependent on the threshold of Cdk4 activation as Cdk4(R24C/+)/TPras animals did not show an increase in UVR-induced melanoma penetrance compared with TPras alone. In addition, Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras mice invariably developed multiple lesions, which occurred rarely in TPras mice. These results indicate that germ-line defects abrogating the pRb pathway may enhance UVR-induced melanoma. TPras and Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras tumors were comparable histopathologically but the latter were larger and more aggressive and cultured cells derived from such melanomas were also larger and had higher levels of nuclear atypia. Moreover, the melanomas in Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras mice, but not in TPras mice, readily metastasized to regional lymph nodes. Thus, it seems that in the mouse, Hras activation initiates UVR-induced melanoma development whereas the cell cycle defect introduced by mutant Cdk4 contributes to tumor progression, producing more aggressive, metastatic tumors.",

Multiple HCC is clinically classified as either intratumor metastasis (IM) or multicentric carcinogenesis (MC). Molecular markers that differentiate IM and MC are of interest to clinical practitioners because the clinical diagnoses of IM and MC often lead to different therapies.;We analyzed 30 multiple tumors from 15 patients for somatic mutations of cancer-related genes, chromosomal aberrations, and promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes using techniques such as high-resolution melting, array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and quantitative methylation-specific PCR.;Somatic mutations were found in TP53 and CTNNB1 but not in CDKN2A or KRAS. Tumors from the same patient did not share the same mutations. Array-CGH analysis revealed variations in the number of chromosomal aberrations, and the detection of common aberrations in tumors from the same patient was found to depend on the total number of chromosomal aberrations. A promoter methylation analysis of genes revealed dense methylation in HCC but not in the adjacent non-tumor tissue. The correlation coefficients (r) of methylation patterns between tumors from the same patient were more similar than those between tumors from different patients. In total, 47% of tumor samples from the same patients had an r ≥ 0.8, whereas, in contrast, only 18% of tumor samples from different patients had an r ≥ 0.8 (p = 0.01).

However, the mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR activates the expression of genes is not completely understood. Here, we report that the pRb pocket proteins pRb, p107, and p130 were degraded in various cancer cell lines in response to 5-aza-CdR treatment, and this effect was dependent on the proteasome pathway. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) played a critical role in this 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation of pRb. Furthermore, PP2A phosphatase-induced MDM2 dephosphorylation at S260 was found to be essential for MDM2 binding to pRb in the presence of 5-aza-CdR. pRb degradation resulted in the significant reexpression of several genes, including methylated CDKN2A, RASFF1A, and unmethylated CDKN2D. Finally, knockdown of pRb pocket proteins by either RNAi or 5-aza-CdR treatment induced a significant decrease in the recruitment of SUV39H1 and an increase in the enrichment of KDM3B and KDM4A to histones around the promoter of RASFF1A and thus reduced H3K9 di- and trimethylation, by which RASFF1A expression is activated.

Understanding the upstream signaling pathway that turns on the expression of p16 is required both for knowing the tumorigenic stresses from which this pathway provides protection and for appreciating the selective pressure that leads to the loss of this pathway in most human tumors. We report that COOH-terminal binding protein (CtBP), a physiologically regulated transcriptional corepressor that dimerizes to hold together repressive complexes, regulates p16 expression in primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Interfering with CtBP-mediated repression increased p16 expression and accelerated senescence. CtBP had little influence on the expression of the alternate product of the CDKN2A tumor-suppressor gene, p14(ARF). Loss of CtBP-mediated repression diminished the Polycomb-based epigenetic histone mark that is reported to favor silencing of p16 via DNA methylation. Enhancing CtBP-mediated repression by growing cells in low oxygen increased the association of CtBP with the p16 promoter, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reduced p16 expression. Stresses and stimuli that reduce CtBP-mediated repression are associated with increased p16 expression; therefore, CtBP may provide a common final target for regulating the balance among tumor suppression, regenerative capacity, and senescence.",

A targeted copy number screen in an unselected cohort of 131 precursor B-ALL cases, enrolled in the dexamethasone-based Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocol ALL9, revealed that IKZF1 deletions are significantly associated with poor relapse-free and overall survival rates. Separate analysis of ALL9-treatment subgroups revealed that non-high-risk (NHR) patients with IKZF1 deletions exhibited a approximately 12-fold higher relative relapse rate than those without IKZF1 deletions.

In terms of genetic factors, the discovery of two genes CDKN2A and CDK4 has been a great advance with more understanding of melanocyte biology in relation to defects in senescence. For phenotypic risk factors such as fair skin and high numbers of naevi, the role of genetic factors is clearly evident but these traits are complex and the discovery of genes involved in skin pigmentation and naevi formation is not an easy task. Research on the MC1R gene has not only shown the importance of this gene in hair and skin pigmentation but also in senescence and immunity. Functional studies involving CDKN2A and MC1R are leading to important new findings. There is also some hope regarding the use of micro-arrays in helping to dissect many genetic events in melanoma.

To better understand the pathogenesis of this disease and to facilitate novel preclinical approaches, we previously developed a conditional mouse model of ARMS by faithfully recapitulating the genetic mutations observed in the human disease, i.e., activation of Pax3:Fkhr fusion gene with either p53 or Cdkn2a inactivation. In this report, we show that this model recapitulates the immunohistochemical profile and the rapid progression of the human disease. We show that Pax3:Fkhr expression increases during late preneoplasia but tumor cells undergoing metastasis are under apparent selection for Pax3:Fkhr expression. At a whole-genome level, a cross-species gene set enrichment analysis and metagene projection study showed that our mouse model is most similar to human ARMS when compared with other pediatric cancers. We have defined an expression profile conserved between mouse and human ARMS, as well as a Pax3:Fkhr signature, including the target gene, SKP2. We further identified 7 \"druggable\" kinases overexpressed across species. The data affirm the accuracy of this genetically engineered mouse model.",

An interesting feature of this disease is the relatively young age of the affected women. The average age in the present cohort of 100 sporadic cases of invasive ductal carcinomas was 45 years, with a median of 46 years (range between 19-81 years). In an effort to understand the molecular signature of BC in the Saudi population, we undertook this study to profile the methylation events in a series of key genes including Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 1 isoform a (RASSF1A), hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), paired-like homeodomain 2 (PITX2), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1), and slit homolog 2 (SLIT2), using MethyLight analysis in archival tumour samples. Interestingly, the overall methylation levels were low in this cohort, with only 84% of the cases displaying methylation in one or more of the analysed genes. The frequency of RASSF1A methylation was the highest (65%), while there was almost complete absence of methylation of the ESR1 and the CDH1 genes (1% and 3%, respectively). Several statistically significant correlations were identified between specific methylation events and clinical parameters which gained more significance when analysis was limited to the estrogen receptor positive samples. Although there was no significant correlations between any methylation event and disease-specific survival, methylation of MYOD1 or RASSF1A was associated with lower disease-free survival and increased chance of disease recurrence. Furthermore, multivariate (Cox) regression analysis identified RASSF1A as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in terms of disease-free survival in this cohort. Our findings provide further evidence on the usefulness of RASSF1A methylation status as an informative prognostic biomarker in BC in a Saudi population.",

Analyses included TP53 and CDKN2A mutational and SNP status, MDM2 and MDM4 amplification and MDM2 SNP309 status.;We found an inverse relationship between MDM2 amplification and TP53 mutations, with a predominantly wild-type CDKN2A background. A high rate of point mutations in TP53 was observed uniquely in leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and MFH. Both MDM2 and MDM4 were also amplified in a subtype-specific manner, which was frequently seen as a coamplification event. We have also analyzed the risk allele frequencies for MDM2 SNP309, and show that the G allele was strongly associated with both liposarcomas and MDM2 amplification.;Our data emphasize the critical role of p53 inactivation in sarcomagenesis, whereby different pathway alterations may be related to the heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, we observed a strong association of malignancy with TP53 mutation, or MDM2 amplification and the presence of a G allele in SNP309, especially in lipoma versus liposarcoma. We propose, therefore, that MDM2 markers along with TP53 sequencing should be considered as patient biomarkers in clinical trials of sarcomas using MDM2 antagonists.",

Pleural space is the most common site, accounting for about 80% of cases, while peritoneum makes up the majority of the remaining 20%. While histologically similar, tumors from these sites are epidemiologically and clinically distinct and their attribution to asbestos exposure differs. We compared DNA array-based findings from 48 epithelioid peritoneal MMs and 41 epithelioid pleural MMs to identify similarities and differences in copy number alterations (CNAs). Losses in 3p (BAP1 gene), 9p (CDKN2A) and 22q (NF2) were seen in tumors from both tumor sites, although CDKN2A and NF2 losses were seen at a higher rate in pleural disease (p<0.01). Overall, regions of copy number gain were more common in peritoneal MM, whereas losses were more common in pleural MM, with regions of loss containing known tumor suppressor genes and regions of gain encompassing genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinase pathway members. Cases with known asbestos causation (n = 32 ) were compared with those linked to radiation exposure (n = 9 ). Deletions in 6q, 14q, 17p and 22q, and gain of 17q were seen in asbestos-associated but not radiation-related cases. As reported in post-radiation sarcoma, gains outnumbered losses in radiation-associated MM. The patterns of genomic imbalances suggest overlapping and distinct molecular pathways in MM of the pleura and peritoneum, and that differences in causation (i.e., asbestos vs. radiation) may account for some of these site-dependent differences.

Our 9L-European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) model was developed from cells acquired at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (NY, USA) in 1997 and implanted in the right caudate nucleus of syngeneic Fisher rats. It has been largely used by the user community of the ESRF during the last decade, for imaging, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, including innovative treatments based on particular irradiation techniques and/or use of new drugs. This work presents a detailed study of its characteristics, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic analysis. The data used for this work were from rats sampled in six experiments carried out over a 3-year period in our lab (total number of rats = 142). The 9L-ESRF tumors were induced by a stereotactic inoculation of 10(4) 9L cells in the right caudate nucleus of the brain. The assessment of vascular parameters was performed by MRI (blood volume fraction and vascular size index) and by immunostaining of vessels (rat endothelial cell antigen-1 and type IV collagen). Immunohistochemistry and regular histology were used to describe features such as tumor cell infiltration, necrosis area, nuclear pleomorphism, cellularity, mitotic characteristics, leukocytic infiltration, proliferation, and inflammation. Moreover, for each of the six experiments, the survival of the animals was assessed and related to the tumor growth observed by MRI or histology. Additionally, the cytogenetic status of the 9L cells used at ESRF lab was investigated by comparative genomics hybridization analysis. Finally, the response of the 9L-ESRF tumor to radiotherapy was estimated by plotting the survival curves after irradiation. The median survival time of 9L-ESRF tumor-bearing rats was highly reproducible (19-20 days). The 9L-ESRF tumors presented a quasi-exponential growth, were highly vascularized with a high cellular density and a high proliferative index, accompanied by signs of inflammatory responses. We also report an infiltrative pattern which is poorly observed on conventional 9 L tumor. The 9L-ESRF cells presented some cytogenetic specificities such as altered regions including CDK4, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MDM2 genes. Finally, the lifespan of 9L-ESRF tumor-bearing rats was enhanced up to 28, 35, and 45 days for single doses of 10, 20, and 2 × 20 Gy, respectively. First, this report describes an animal model that is used worldwide. Second, we describe few features typical of our model if compared to other 9L models worldwide. Altogether, the 9L-ESRF tumor model presents characteristics close to the human high-grade gliomas such as high proliferative capability, high vascularization and a high infiltrative pattern. Its response to radiotherapy demonstrates its potential as a tool for innovative radiotherapy protocols.",

However, a new class of non-APC mutated CRCs has been defined that have a serrated histopathology and carry the (V600E)BRAF oncogene. Here we have investigated the pathogenesis of serrated CRCs by expressing (V600E)Braf in the proliferative cells of the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We show that the oncogene drives an initial burst of Mek-dependent proliferation, leading to the formation of hyperplastic crypts. This is associated with β-catenin nuclear localization by a mechanism involving Mapk/Erk kinase (Mek)-dependent, Akt-independent phosphorylation of Gsk3β. However, hyperplastic crypts remain dormant for prolonged periods due to the induction of crypt senescence accompanied by upregulation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and p16(Ink4a). We show that tumour progression is associated with down-regulation of p16(Ink4a) through enhanced CpG methylation of exon 1 and knockout of Cdkn2a confirms this gene is a barrier to tumour progression. Our studies identify (V600E)BRAF as an early genetic driver mutation in serrated CRCs and indicate that, unlike APC-mutated cancers, this subtype arises by the bypassing of a (V600E)Braf driven oncogene-induced senescence programme.",

First, we perform a bioinformatic analysis of copy number variation (CNV) and DNA methylation covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumor cells. We separately examined CNV and DNA methylation for 42 primary serous ovarian cancer samples using MOMA-ROMA assays and 379 tumor samples analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have identified 346 genes with significant deletions or amplifications among the tumor samples. Utilizing associated gene expression data we predict 156 genes with altered copy number and correlated changes in expression. Among these genes CCNE1, POP4, UQCRB, PHF20L1 and C19orf2 were identified within both data sets. We were specifically interested in copy number variation as our base genomic property in the prediction of tumor suppressors and oncogenes in the altered ovarian tumor. We therefore identify changes in DNA methylation and expression for all amplified and deleted genes. We statistically define tumor suppressor and oncogenic features for these modalities and perform a correlation analysis with expression. We predicted 611 potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors candidates by integrating these data types. Genes with a strong correlation for methylation dependent expression changes exhibited at varying copy number aberrations include CDCA8, ATAD2, CDKN2A, RAB25, AURKA, BOP1 and EIF2C3. We provide copy number variation and DNA methylation analysis for over 11,500 individual genes covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumors.

In large cohorts of nevi and melanoma samples, PDK1 expression was significantly higher in primary melanoma, compared with nevi, and was further increased in metastatic melanoma. PDK1 expression suffices for its activity, owing to auto-activation, or elevated phosphorylation by phosphoinositide 3'-OH-kinase (PI3K). Selective inactivation of Pdk1 in the melanocytes of Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) or Braf(V600E)::Cdkn2a(-/-)::Pten(-/-) mice delayed the development of pigmented lesions and melanoma induced by systemic or local administration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Melanoma invasion and metastasis were significantly reduced or completely prevented by Pdk1 deletion. Administration of the PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470 (PDKi) effectively delayed melanomagenesis and metastasis in Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) mice. Pdk1(-/-) melanomas exhibit a marked decrease in the activity of AKT, P70S6K and PKC. Notably, PDKi was as effective in inhibiting AGC kinases and colony forming efficiency of melanoma with Pten wild-type (WT) genotypes.

        "Doc_abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is a major cause of cancer-associated mortality, with a dismal overall prognosis that has remained virtually unchanged for many decades. Currently, prevention or early diagnosis at a curable stage is exceedingly difficult; patients rarely exhibit symptoms and tumours do not display sensitive and specific markers to aid detection. Pancreatic cancers also have few prevalent genetic mutations; the most commonly mutated genes are KRAS, CDKN2A (encoding p16), TP53 and SMAD4 - none of which are currently druggable. Indeed, therapeutic options are limited and progress in drug development is impeded because most pancreatic cancers are complex at the genomic, epigenetic and metabolic levels, with multiple activated pathways and crosstalk evident. Furthermore, the multilayered interplay between neoplastic and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment challenges medical treatment. Fewer than 20% of patients have surgically resectable disease; however, neoadjuvant therapies might shift tumours towards resectability. Although newer drug combinations and multimodal regimens in this setting, as well as the adjuvant setting, appreciably extend survival, ∼80% of patients will relapse after surgery and ultimately die of their disease. Thus, consideration of quality of life and overall survival is important. In this Primer, we summarize the current understanding of the salient pathophysiological, molecular, translational and clinical aspects of this disease. In addition, we present an outline of potential future directions for pancreatic cancer research and patient management. ",

Better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of mesothelial carcinogenesis is required to develop new therapeutic strategies. MPM, like all cancer cells, needs to maintain telomere length to prevent senescence. Previous studies suggested that the telomere lengthening mechanism in MPM is based mainly on telomerase activity. For this reason, we focused on the key catalytic enzyme, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), by analyzing its gene expression in MPM and by studying the mechanism underlying its upregulation. We used our large collection of MPM composed of 61 MPM in culture and 71 frozen MPM tumor samples. Evaluation of TERT mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR showed overexpression in MPM in culture compared with normal mesothelial cells, and in MPM tumor samples compared with normal pleura. We identified a 'hot spot' of mutations in the TERT gene core promoter in both MPM in culture and in MPM tumor samples with an overall frequency of 15%. Furthermore, data clearly identified mutation in the TERT promoter as a mechanism of TERT mRNA upregulation in MPM. In contrast, gene copy number amplification was not associated with TERT overexpression. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological, etiological and genetic characteristics of MPM with mutations in the TERT promoter. TERT promoter mutations were more frequent in MPM with sarcomatoid histologic subtype (P<0.01), and they were frequently associated with CDKN2A gene inactivation (P=0.03). In conclusion, a subgroup of MPM presents TERT promoter mutations, which lead to TERT mRNA upregulation. This is the first recurrent gain-of-function oncogenic mutations identified in MPM. ",

Studies in animal models have shown that inactivation of the products of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene locus, p16INK4A and p14ARF, promotes the development of pheochromocytoma, especially in malignant form. The present study evaluated the involvement of CDKN2A in human pheochromocytomas and abdominal extra-adrenal paragangliomas from 55 patients. Promoter methylation was assessed using quantitative Pyrosequencing and methylation-specific PCR, and mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. For p16, western blot analysis and sequencing were also performed. succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (SDHB) sequencing analysis included extra-adrenal paragangliomas, all tumors classified as malignant, and cases diagnosed at 30 years or younger. The p16INK4A promoter was heavily methylated in a subset of paragangliomas, and this was significantly associated with malignancy (P<0.0043) and SDHB mutation (P<0.002). p16INK4A mRNA expression showed moderate suppression in malignant cases (P<0.05). In contrast, very little p14ARF promoter methylation was seen and there was no significant difference in p14ARF expression between tumors and normal samples. The p16 protein expression was reduced in 16 tumors, and sequence variations were observed in four tumors including the missense mutation A57V and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A148T. The results suggest that p16INK4A, and not p14ARF, is a subject of frequent involvement in these tumors. Importantly, hypermethylation of the p16INK4A promoter was significantly associated with malignancy and metastasis, and SDHB gene mutations. This finding suggests an etiological link and could provide a clinical utility for diagnostic purposes.",

These methyltransferases are ideal therapeutic targets due to their frequent hyperactive mutations and overexpression found in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we characterized a set of small molecules that allow pharmacologic manipulation of EZH2 and EZH1, which include UNC1999, a selective inhibitor of both enzymes, and UNC2400, an inactive analog compound useful for assessment of off-target effect. UNC1999 suppresses global H3K27 trimethylation/dimethylation (H3K27me3/2) and inhibits growth of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia cells. UNC1999-induced transcriptome alterations overlap those following knockdown of embryonic ectoderm development, a common cofactor of EZH2 and EZH1, demonstrating UNC1999's on-target inhibition. Mechanistically, UNC1999 preferentially affects distal regulatory elements such as enhancers, leading to derepression of polycomb targets including Cdkn2a. Gene derepression correlates with a decrease in H3K27me3 and concurrent gain in H3K27 acetylation. UNC2400 does not induce such effects. Oral administration of UNC1999 prolongs survival of a well-defined murine leukemia model bearing MLL-AF9. Collectively, our study provides the detailed profiling for a set of chemicals to manipulate EZH2 and EZH1 and establishes specific enzymatic inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-EZH2 and PRC2-EZH1 by small-molecule compounds as a novel therapeutics for MLL-rearranged leukemia.

The DNA extracted was analyzed by means of a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction test for the CDKN2A (p16), MLH1, APC, FHIT, and CDH1 (E-cadherin) genes. Morphological and clinical data and follow-up information were obtained.;All cases were in an advanced stage: histologically moderate or poorly differentiated tumors (95%).

We have recently shown a positive correlation between MSI/CIMP and loss of nuclear p27. However, no study has examined cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization in relation to CIMP and MSI in colorectal cancer. Using MethyLight assays, we quantified DNA methylation in 8 CIMP-specific gene promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) in 853 colorectal cancer samples obtained from 2 large prospective cohorts. We assessed expressions of nuclear and cytoplasmic p27 and nuclear p53 by immunohistochemistry. Cytoplasmic p27 expression was inversely associated with loss of nuclear p27 (P < .0001), CIMP-high (P < .0001), MSI-H (P < .0001), and BRAF mutations (P < .0001). The inverse association of cytoplasmic p27 with CIMP-high (or MSI-H) was independent of MSI (or CIMP) status. In addition, the inverse association of cytoplasmic p27 with CIMP-high was independent of KRAS/BRAF status. BRAF and CDKN2A (p16) methylation were not correlated with cytoplasmic p27 after stratification by CIMP status. The inverse associations of cytoplasmic p27 with MSI-H and CIMP-high were much more pronounced in p53-negative than p53-positive tumors. In conclusion, cytoplasmic p27 expression is inversely associated with MSI-H and CIMP-high, particularly in p53-negative tumors, suggesting interplay of functional losses of p27 and p53 in the development of various molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.",

To this end, we investigated the levels of p16/INK4A protein using immunohistochemical techniques in 153 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, using as reference the levels found in reactive lymphoid tissue. The existence of gene mutation, CpG island methylation, and allelic loss were investigated in a subset of 26 cases, using single-strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing, Southern Blot, polymerase chain reaction, and microsatellite analysis, respectively. Loss of p16/INK4A expression was detected in 41 of the 112 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas studied (37%), all of which corresponded to high-grade tumors. This loss of p16/INK4A was found more frequently in cases showing tumor progression from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue low-grade lymphomas (31 of 37) or follicular lymphomas (4 of 4) into diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Analysis of the status of the p16/INK4A gene showed different genetic alterations (methylation of the 5'-CpG island of the p16/INK4A gene, 6 of 23 cases; allelic loss at 9p21, 3 of 16 cases; and nonsense mutation, 1 of 26 cases). In all cases, these events were associated with loss of the p16/INK4A protein. No case that preserved protein expression contained any genetic change.

However, introducing new morphological criteria such as intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) might facilitate colorectal polyp diagnoses. Additionally, the phenotype-genotype correlation needs to be updated as the terminology has repeatedly changed. This study analysed 516 polyps, consisting of 118 classical adenomas (CAD), 116 hyperplastic polyps (HPP), 179 SSAs, 41 SSA-Ds, and 62 TSAs. The lesions were analysed in relation to the patients' clinical parameters including gender, age, localisation, and size. The inflammatory background of the polyps was quantified and BRAF and KRAS mutations as well as MLH1 and CDKN2A promoter methylation were assessed. In multivariate analyses, an increase in IELs was an independent and robust new criterion for the diagnosis of SSA-D (p < 0.001). Superficial erosions and acute neutrophil granulocytes led to reactive changes potentially resembling dysplasia. KRAS and BRAF mutations were associated with CAD/TSA and HPP/SSA, respectively. However, almost half of TSAs had a BRAF mutation and were KRAS wild type. CDKN2A seems to precede MLH1 hyper-methylation within the serrated carcinogenesis model. The genotyping of WHO-based entities - and especially SSA - has sharpened in comparison to previously published data. TSAs can be sub-grouped according to their mutation status. Of note, the higher number of IELs in SSA-D reflects their close relationship to colorectal cancers with micro-satellite instability. Therefore, IELs might represent a new diagnostic tool for SSA-D.

We evaluated the characteristics and outcomes (overall survival (OS), time to metastasis/recurrence, and best progression-free survival (PFS)) of 392 patients for whom next generation sequencing (182 or 236 genes) had been performed. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used for our analysis, and results were subjected to internal validation using a resampling method (bootstrap analysis). In a multivariable analysis (Cox regression model), the parameters that were statistically associated with a poorer overall survival were the presence of metastases at diagnosis (P = 0.014), gastrointestinal histology (P < 0.0001), PTEN (P < 0.0001), and CDKN2A alterations (P = 0.0001). The variables associated with a shorter time to metastases/recurrence were gastrointestinal histology (P = 0.004), APC (P = 0.008), PTEN (P = 0.026) and TP53 (P = 0.044) alterations. TP53 (P = 0.003) and PTEN (P = 0.034) alterations were independent predictors of a shorter best PFS. A personalized treatment approach (matching the molecular aberration with a cognate targeted drug) also correlated with a longer best PFS (P = 0.046). Our study demonstrated that, across diverse cancers, anomalies in specific tumor suppressor genes (PTEN, CDKN2A, APC, and/or TP53) were independently associated with a worse outcome, as reflected by time to metastases/recurrence, best PFS on treatment, and/or overall survival.

To clarify the association, we here quantified methylation levels of promoter CGIs of 11 genes, which are unlikely to confer growth advantage to cells, in 63 human breast cancers. The number of methylated genes in a cancer did not obey a bimodal distribution, and the 63 cancers were classified into those with frequent methylation (n = 16), moderate methylation (n = 26) and no methylation (n = 21). The incidence of HER2 amplification was significantly higher in the cancers with frequent methylation (11 of 16) than in those with no methylation (2 of 21, P = 0.001). Also, the number of methylated genes correlated with the degree of HER2 amplification (r = 0.411, P = 0.002). Correlation analysis with clinicopathological characteristics and methylation of CDKN2A, BRCA1 and CDH1 revealed that frequent methylation had significant correlation with higher nuclear grades (P = 0.001).

To clarify the clinical importance of aberrant DNA methylation, we studied the hypermethylation status of 16 target genes in the genomes of 92 patients with JMML by bisulfite conversion and the pryosequencing technique. Among 16 candidate genes, BMP4, CALCA, CDKN2A, and RARB exhibited significant hypermethylation in 72% (67/92) of patients. Based on the number of hypermethylated genes, patients were stratified into three cohorts based on an aberrant methylation score (AMS) of 0, 1-2, or 3-4. In the AMS 0 cohort, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and transplantation-free survival (TFS) were good (69% and 76%, respectively).

Epigenetic analysis provides helpful information for clinicians to select treatment strategies for patients with JMML.

Combining SNP array with cytogenetic data revealed that most cases were polyploid, with at least one case having started as a near-haploid tumor. Further bioinformatic analysis of the SNP array data disclosed genetic heterogeneity, in the form of subclonal chromosomal imbalances, in five tumors. The outcome was worse for patients with FP-ARMS than ERMS or FN-ARMS (6/8 vs. 1/9 dead of disease), and the only children with ERMS showing intratumor diversity or with MYOD1 mutation-positive SRMS also died of disease.

In addition, 19 sporadic metastatic tumors were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 11q13.

Such structures are mitotically unstable and during tumor progression they accumulate material from many different parts of the genome. Hence, their content varies considerably between and within tumors. Partly due to this extensive variation, the genetic content of many ring-containing tumors remains poorly characterized. Ring chromosomes are particularly prevalent in specific subtypes of sarcoma. Here, we have combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), global genomic copy number and gene expression data on ring-containing soft tissue sarcomas and show that they harbor two fundamentally different types of ring chromosome: MDM2-positive and MDM2-negative rings. While the former are often found in an otherwise normal chromosome complement, the latter seem to arise in the context of general chromosomal instability. In line with this, sarcomas with MDM2-negative rings commonly show complete loss of either CDKN2A or RB1 -both known to be important for genome integrity. Sarcomas with MDM2-positive rings instead show co-amplification of a variety of potential driver oncogenes. More than 100 different genes were found to be involved, many of which are known to induce cell growth, promote proliferation or inhibit apoptosis.

On the genomic level a highly variable degree of alterations in nearly all chromosomal regions and between individual tumors is observable. This hampers the identification of common drivers in OS biology. To identify the common molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of OS, we follow the hypothesis that all the copy number-associated differences between the patients are intercepted on the level of the functional modules. The implementation is based on a network approach utilizing copy number associated genes in OS, paired expression data and protein interaction data. The resulting functional modules of tightly connected genes were interpreted regarding their biological functions in OS and their potential prognostic significance. We identified an osteosarcoma network assembling well-known and lesser-known candidates. The derived network shows a significant connectivity and modularity suggesting that the genes affected by the heterogeneous genetic alterations share the same biological context. The network modules participate in several critical aspects of cancer biology like DNA damage response, cell growth, and cell motility which is in line with the hypothesis of specifically deregulated but functional modules in cancer. Further, we could deduce genes with possible prognostic significance in OS for further investigation (e.g. EZR, CDKN2A, MAP3K5). Several of those module genes were located on chromosome 6q. The given systems biological approach provides evidence that heterogeneity on the genomic and expression level is ordered by the biological system on the level of the functional modules. Different genomic aberrations are pointing to the same cellular network vicinity to form vital, but already neoplastically altered, functional modules maintaining OS.

The authors use the standard FISH-positivity as a tie-breaker for challenging melanocytic neoplasms mainly in a non-Spitzoid morphologic context because the currently available test leaves several unresolved issues: namely, a relatively low diagnostic accuracy in morphologically ambiguous melanocytic neoplasms; a relatively low sensitivity and specificity in Spitzoid neoplasms; and the occurrence of false positives due to tetraploidy in Spitz nevi and in nevi with an atypical epithelioid component. Under investigation is currently a new melanoma probe cocktail targeting RREB1 (6p25), C-MYC (8q24), CDKN2A (9p21), and CCND1 (11q13). However, CDKN2A is a significant parameter only if lost in homozygosis, and this complicates the interpretation of the results. Furthermore, the new melanoma probe cocktail has been tested on cases of atypical Spitzoid proliferations with fatal outcomes which at present are too few to allow definite conclusions. The authors propose the implementation of a FISH algorithm (standard 4-probe test followed by either C-MYC or CDKN2A/centromere 9) to assist the histopathological diagnosis and minimize the technical problems. Nevertheless, because the diagnostic accuracy of the FISH technique is far from being absolute, the overall clinicopathological context must always guide the decision-making process about the management of morphobiologically ambiguous melanocytic proliferations.

The aim of our study was to analyse whether the molecular markers of glioblastoma (i.e. TP53 and IDH1 mutations, CDKN2A deletion, EGFR amplification, chromosome 7 polysomy and EGFRvIII expression) could be associated with distinct prognosis and/or response to the therapy. Moreover, we describe a method which allows for a reliable, as well as time- and cost-effective, screening for EGFR amplification and chromosome 7 polysomy with quantitative Real-Time PCR at DNA level. In the clinical data, only the patient's age had prognostic significance (continuous: HR = 1.04; p<0.01). At the molecular level, EGFRvIII expression was associated with a better prognosis (HR = 0.37; p = 0.04). Intriguingly, EGFR amplification was associated with a worse outcome in younger patients (HR = 3.75; p<0.01) and in patients treated with radiotherapy (HR = 2.71; p = 0.03). We did not observe any difference between the patients with the amplification treated with radiotherapy and the patients without such a treatment. Next, EGFR amplification was related to a better prognosis in combination with the homozygous CDKN2A deletion (HR = 0.12; p = 0.01), but to a poorer prognosis in combination with chromosome 7 polysomy (HR = 14.88; p = 0.01). Importantly, the results emphasise the necessity to distinguish both mechanisms of the increased EGFR gene copy number (amplification and polysomy). To conclude, although the data presented here require validation in different groups of patients, they strongly advocate the consideration of the patient's tumour molecular characteristics in the selection of the therapy.",

To identify the specific genetic aberrations that play key roles in chordoma pathogenesis, we utilized a genome-wide high-resolution SNP-array and next generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular profiling platform to study 24 patient samples with typical histopathologic features of chordoma. Matching normal tissues were available for 16 samples. SNP-array analysis revealed nonrandom copy number losses across the genome, frequently involving 3, 9p, 1p, 14, 10, and 13. In contrast, copy number gain is uncommon in chordomas. Two minimum deleted regions were observed on 3p within a ∼8 Mb segment at 3p21.1-p21.31, which overlaps SETD2, BAP1 and PBRM1. The minimum deleted region on 9p was mapped to CDKN2A locus at 9p21.3, and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was detected in 5/22 chordomas (∼23%). NGS-based molecular profiling demonstrated an extremely low level of mutation rate in chordomas, with an average of 0.5 mutations per sample for the 16 cases with matched normal. When the mutated genes were grouped based on molecular functions, many of the mutation events (∼40%) were found in chromatin regulatory genes. The combined copy number and mutation profiling revealed that SETD2 is the single gene affected most frequently in chordomas, either by deletion or by mutations.

Copy neutral LOH events averaged 27 (range, 7-57) per EAC. We noted 126 homozygous deletions (HD) across the EAC panel (range, 0-11 in individual tumors). Frequent HDs within FHIT (17 of 23), WWOX (8 of 23), and DMD (6 of 23) suggest a role for common fragile sites or genomic instability in EAC etiology. HDs were also noted for known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), including CDKN2A, CDKN2B, SMAD4, and GALR1, and identified PDE4D and MGC48628 as potentially novel TSGs. All tumors showed LOH for most of chromosome 17p, suggesting that TSGs other than TP53 may be targeted. Frequent gains were noted around MYC (13 of 23), BCL9 (12 of 23), CTAGE1 (14 of 23), and ZNF217 (12 of 23). Thus, we have confirmed previous reports indicating frequent changes to FHIT, CDKN2A, TP53, and MYC in EAC and identified additional genes of interest. Meta-analysis of previous genome-wide EAC studies together with the data presented here highlighted consistent regions of gain on 8q, 18q, and 20q and multiple LOH regions on 4q, 5q, 17p, and 18q, suggesting that more than one gene may be targeted on each of these chromosome arms.

However, various observations suggest that other melanoma susceptibility genes have not yet been identified. To search for new susceptibility loci, we used the MeLiM swine as an animal model of hereditary melanoma to perform a genome scan for linkage to melanoma. Founders of the affected MeLiM stock were crossed with each other and with healthy Duroc pigs, generating MeLiM, F1 and backcross families. As we had previously excluded the MeLiM CDKN2A gene, we paid special attention to CDK4 and MC1R, as well as to other candidates such as BRAF and the SLA complex, mapping them on the swine radiation hybrid map and/or isolating close microsatellite markers to introduce them into the genome scan. The results revealed, first, that swine melanoma was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance, preferably in black animals. Second, 4 chromosomal regions potentially involved in melanoma susceptibility were identified on Sus Scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 1, 2, 7 and 8, respectively, in intervals 44-103, 1.9-18, 59-73 and 47-62 cM. A fifth region close to MC1R was revealed on SSC 6 by analyzing an individual marker located at position 7.5 cM. Lastly, CDK4 and BRAF were unlikely to be melanoma susceptibility genes in the MeLiM swine model. The 3 regions on SSC 1, 6 and 7, respectively, have counterparts on human chromosomes (HSA) 9p, 16q and 6p, harboring melanoma candidate loci.

Although some studies have shown genetic alterations in protruded-type tumors, little is known about genetic and epigenetic alterations in flat-type tumors, as well as pT1 (early invasive) colorectal cancers (CRCs). In the current study, we compared the frequencies of genetic and epigenetic alterations of the RAS-RAF and Wnt signaling pathways in flat-type and protruded-type tumors. In addition, we investigated the relationship between those alterations and invasive potential of pT1 CRCs. Methylations of RASSF2, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), EPHB2, CDKN2A and MLH1 were detected in 44.3, 30.3, 81.4, 7.5, 43.6 and 13.4% of the 307 early colorectal tumors, respectively. Mutations of KRAS, BRAF, catalytic subunit alpha of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PIK3CA) and beta-catenin were detected in 25.4, 4.6, 1.6 and 9.4% of those tumors, respectively. Methylations of MGMT, WIF-1 and CDKN2A were detected in significantly higher percentages of protruded-type tumors than in flat-type tumors. Mutation of at least one gene was detected in a significantly higher percentage of flat-type tumors than in protruded-type tumors. RASSF2 methylation was correlated significantly with KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutation. Multiple logistic analysis showed that lymphatic invasion and RASSF2 methylation with KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutation were independent risk factors for venous invasion in pT1 CRCs. In conclusion, since genetic alterations of these pathways have frequently occurred in flat-type tumors, flat-type tumors seem to have a distinct genetic profile different from that of protruded-type tumors. RASSF2 methylation with oncogenic activation is a promising biomarker for predicting invasive potential of pT1 CRCs.",

Yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for these important effects remain to be completely understood. The purpose of this study was to determine signaling pathway-focused gene expression profile associated with the antihypertrophic action of propranolol in pressure overloaded hearts. To address this question, a focused real-time PCR array was used to screen left ventricular RNA expression of 84 gene transcripts representative of 18 different signaling pathways in C57BL/6 mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery. On the surgery day, mice received either propranolol (80 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 14 days. TAC caused a 49% increase in the left ventricular weight-to-body weight (LVW/BW) ratio without changing gene expression. Propranolol blunted LVW/BW ratio increase by approximately 50% while causing about a 3-fold increase in the expression of two genes, namely Brca1 and Cdkn2a, belonging to the TGF-beta and estrogen pathways, respectively. In conclusion, after 2 weeks of pressure overload, TAC hearts show a gene expression profile superimposable to that of sham hearts. Conversely, propranolol treatment is associated with an increased expression of genes which negatively regulate cell cycle progression. It remains to be established whether a mechanistic link between gene expression changes and the antihypertrophic action of propranolol occurs.",

Two CDKN2A-mutations were found; the Dutch founder mutation p16-Leiden (c.225_243del, p.Ala76fs) and the c.19_23dup, p.Ser8fs-mutation. After disclosure of the CDKN2A-mutation in one of the families, a curable melanoma was diagnosed at dermatological surveillance in a 17-year-old family member.;CDKN2A-mutation can be found in a considerable proportion of families with FPC. CDKN2A-mutation analysis should therefore be included in genetic testing in FPC families, even in the absence of reported melanomas. This strategy will enhance the recognition of individuals at risk for PC and facilitate the early detection of melanomas.",

NF1 individuals have an 8-13% lifetime risk of developing a malignant PNST (MPNST). Atypical neurofibromas are symptomatic, hypercellular PNSTs, composed of cells with hyperchromatic nuclei in the absence of mitoses. Little is known about the origin and nature of atypical neurofibromas in NF1 patients. In this study, we classified the atypical neurofibromas in the spectrum of NF1-associated PNSTs by analyzing 65 tumor samples from 48 NF1 patients. We compared tumor-specific chromosomal copy number alterations between benign neurofibromas, atypical neurofibromas, and MPNSTs (low-, intermediate-, and high-grade) by karyotyping and microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). In 15 benign neurofibromas (4 subcutaneous and 11 plexiform), no copy number alterations were found, except a single event in a plexiform neurofibroma. One highly significant recurrent aberration (15/16) was identified in the atypical neurofibromas, namely a deletion with a minimal overlapping region (MOR) in chromosome band 9p21.3, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Copy number loss of the CDKN2A/B gene locus was one of the most common events in the group of MPNSTs, with deletions in low-, intermediate-, and high-grade MPNSTs. In one tumor, we observed a clear transition from a benign-atypical neurofibroma toward an intermediate-grade MPNST, confirmed by both histopathology and aCGH analysis. These data support the hypothesis that atypical neurofibromas are premalignant tumors, with the CDKN2A/B deletion as the first step in the progression toward MPNST.",

        "Doc_abstract":"As the incidence of malignant melanoma continues to increase and with the completion of the sequencing of the human genome, there have been increasing efforts to identify the \"melanoma gene(s).\" Although some patients and families have significantly increased risks due to genetic predisposition, most melanoma cases are sporadic and likely result from low to moderate risk genetic factors. This review focuses on the genes that cover the greatest risk of developing melanoma. It is important to remember that many--if not most--cases of melanoma are the result of undiscovered variants. The strongest genetic risk for the development of melanoma results from heritable alterations in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene, which encodes two separate but related proteins, p16/INK4a and p14/ARF. These proteins help regulate cell division and apoptosis, both of which are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. Other important genes include CDK4/6 and retinoblastoma (RB1), which encode downstream proteins in the same pathway as p16/INK4a and p14/ARF. Finally, we discuss the relative importance of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene as a moderate risk factor for melanoma. Although great advances have been made in understanding the molecular basis and genetic predisposition of melanoma, many questions still remain to be answered. Someday soon, it will be possible to predict a patient's risk of melanoma by DNA analysis; however, it is important to reconcile our tremendous technologic capabilities with documented clinical utility.",

We performed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses-in a three-step manner-using probes for: (i) CDKN2A at 9p21, (ii) 20p and 20q subtelomeres and (iii) cen9 and cen20. Out of 1033 BCP ALLs diagnosed from 2001 to 2006, 533 were analyzed; 16% (84/533) displayed 9p21 deletions, of which 30% (25/84) had dic(9;20). Thus, dic(9;20)-positivity was found in 4.7% (25/533), making it the third most common genetic subgroup after high hyperdiploidy and t(12;21)(p13;q22). The dic(9;20) was associated with a female predominance and an age peak at 3 years; 18/25 (72%) were allocated to non-standard risk treatment at diagnosis.

Primary glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer that typically appears suddenly in older adults. With aggressive treatment, the median survival time is only 15 months. Their acute onset and widespread genomic instability indicates that chromothripsis may play a key role in their initiation and progression. GBMs are often characterized by EGFR amplification, CDKN2A and PTEN deletion, although approximately 20% of GBMs harbor additional amplifications in MDM2 or MDM4 with CDK4.;We used the chromothripsis prediction tool, Shatterproof, in conjunction with a custom whole genome sequence analysis pipeline in order to generate putative regions of chromothripsis. The data derived from this study was further expanded on using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and susceptibility studies with colony formation assays.;We show that primary GBMs are associated with higher chromothripsis scores and establish a link between chromothripsis and gene amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), as well as modulators of the TP53 and RB1 pathways.;Utilizing a newly introduced bioinformatic tool, we provide evidence that chromothripsis is associated with the formation of amplicons containing several oncogenes involved in key pathways that are likely essential for post-chromothriptic cell survival.",

CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a phenotype of colorectal cancer with extensive promoter methylation, and associated with high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and BRAF mutations. We have recently shown that both CIMP and MSI-H are inversely associated with downregulation of p21 (CDKN1A or CIP1), another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. However, no study to date has examined relationship between p27 and CIMP status in colorectal cancer. Using MethyLight assays, we measured DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters {CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, MLH1 and NEUROG1} in 706 colorectal cancer samples obtained from two large prospective cohorts. Among the 706 tumors, 112 (16%) were CIMP-high tumors with >or=4/5 methylated promoters. We assessed p27 and p53 expressions by immunohistochemistry. Loss of nuclear p27 expression {observed in 231 tumors (33%)} was significantly associated with CIMP-high, MSI-H and BRAF mutations, and these associations were much more pronounced among p53-negative tumors than p53-positive tumors. When CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high tumors were stratified by MSI status (or KRAS and BRAF status), CIMP-high and MSI-H (but not BRAF mutations) were still significantly associated with nuclear p27 loss. Nuclear p27 loss did not appear to be directly related to CDKN2A (p16) methylation. We conclude that downregulation of nuclear p27 is associated with CIMP-high and MSI-H in colorectal cancer. These associations are stronger among p53 wild-type tumors, implying important interplay of p27 and p53 functions (or dysfunctions) in the development of various molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.",

The need to develop more accurate cancer risk assessment tools is imperative to improve the ability to identify individuals at greatest risk of developing disease. The Cytokinesis-Blocked Micronucleus Cytome Assay (CBMNcyt) presents a sensitive and specific method of assessing DNA damage. We have previously reported that this assay is sensitive to genetic damage caused by the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), and that binucleated cells with micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds are strong predictors of lung cancer risk. The current study confirmed our previous findings and sought to identify the specific chromosomes involved in lung carcinogenesis. Spectral karyotyping was conducted on a subset of lung cancer cases [n = 116] and cancer-free controls [n = 126] with the highest CBMNcyt endpoints, on baseline and NNK-treated blood lymphocytes. After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and pack and smoke years, consistent significant associations between chromosome: 9, 19, 22, X, at baseline; chromosome: 3, 4, and 16 after NNK-induction; and chromosome: 1, 13, and 17 at both baseline and NNK-induction; and lung cancer risk (all P ≤ 0.05) were observed. Several of these chromosomes harbor critical genes involved in lung carcinogenesis, such as the FHIT gene, CDKN2A, PADPRP, and TP53. Our results indicate that the CBMNcyt assay when used in conjunction with other cytogenetic methodologies can increase our ability to identify specific chromosomal regions associated with DNA damage, thereby improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in individual cancer predisposition.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cellular senescence is an important tumor suppression mechanism. We have previously reported that both oncogene-induced dissociation of BRCA1 from chromatin and BRCA1 knockdown itself drive senescence by promoting formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). However, the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates SAHF formation and senescence is unclear. BRG1 is a chromatin-remodeling factor that interacts with BRCA1 and pRB. Here we show that BRG1 is required for SAHF formation and senescence induced by oncogenic RAS or BRCA1 loss. The interaction between BRG1 and BRCA1 is disrupted during senescence. This correlates with an increased level of chromatin-associated BRG1 in senescent cells. BRG1 knockdown suppresses the formation of SAHF and senescence, while it has no effect on BRCA1 chromatin dissociation induced by oncogenic RAS, indicating that BRG1 functions downstream of BRCA1 chromatin dissociation. Furthermore, BRG1 knockdown inhibits SAHF formation and senescence induced by BRCA1 knockdown. Conversely, BRG1 overexpression drives SAHF formation and senescence in a DNA damage-independent manner. This effect depends upon BRG1's chromatin-remodeling activity as well as the interaction between BRG1 and pRB. Indeed, the interaction between BRG1 and pRB is enhanced during senescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that BRG1's association with the human CDKN2A and CDKN1A gene promoters was enhanced during senescence induced by oncogenic RAS or BRCA1 knockdown. Consistently, knockdown of pRB, p21(CIP1), and p16(INK4a), but not p53, suppressed SAHF formation induced by BRG1. Together, these studies reveal the molecular underpinning by which BRG1 acts downstream of BRCA1 to promote SAHF formation and senescence.",

A probe-based, quantitative, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) called MethyLight may become an eligible method for detecting this marker clinically. We studied oral mucosa biopsies with epithelial dysplasia from 78 patients enrolled in a published 4-years' followup cohort, in which cancer risk for patients with p16 methylation-positive dysplasia was significantly higher than those without p16 methylation (by 150-bp MSP and bisulfite sequencing; +133 ~ +283, transcription starting site, +1). The p16 methylation status in samples (N = 102) containing sufficient DNA was analyzed by the 70-bp classic (+238 ~ +307) and 115-bp novel (+157 ~ +272) MethyLight assays, respectively.;p16 Methylation was detectable in 75 samples using the classic MethyLight assay. The methylated-p16 positive rate and proportion of methylated-p16 by the MethyLight in MSP-positive samples were higher than those in MSP-negative samples (positive rate: 37/44 vs. 38/58, P=0.035, two-sided; proportion [median]: 0.78 vs. 0.02, P <0.007). Using the published results of MSP as a golden standard, we found sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for this MethyLight assay to be 70.5%, 84.5%, and 55.0%, respectively. Because amplicon of the classic MethyLight procedure only partially overlapped with the MSP amplicon, we further designed a 115-bp novel MethyLight assay in which the amplicon on the sense-strand fully overlapped with the MSP amplicon on the antisense-strand. Using the 115-bp MethyLight assay, we observed methylated-p16 in 26 of 44 MSP-positive samples and 2 of 58 MSP-negative ones (P = 0.000). These results were confirmed with clone sequencing. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using the 115-bp MethyLight assay were 59.1%, 98.3%, and 57.4%, respectively. Significant differences in the oral cancer rate were observed during the followup between patients (≥60 years) with and without methylated-p16 as detected by the 115-bp MethyLight assay (6/8 vs. 6/22, P = 0.034, two-sided).;The 115-bp MethyLight assay is a useful and practical assay with very high specificity for the detection of p16 methylation clinically.",

While most are slowly growing Word Health organization (WHO) grade I tumors, rare variants (clear cell, chordoid, papillary, and rhabdoid), as well as brain invasive (WHO grade II), atypical (WHO grade II), and anaplastic (WHO grade III) meningiomas are considerably more aggressive. This review summarizes the histopathological and genetic features of meningiomas, including differential diagnosis, pitfalls, and grading challenges. Early stages of meningioma tumorigenesis are closely linked to inactivation of one or more members of the 4.1 superfamily, including the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and 4.1B (DAL-1) genes, which interact with the 14-3-3 protein family. Other chromosome 22q genes implicated include BAM22, BCR (breakpoint cluster region), and TIMP-1, the last of which is implicated in higher-grade meningiomas. Atypical meningiomas also commonly show chromosomal losses of 1p, 6q, 10, 14q, and 18q, as well as multiple chromosomal gains. While most relevant genes remain unknown, two chromosome 14q candidates (MEG3 and NDRG2) have recently been identified. In addition to alterations of CDKN2A, p14(ARF), and CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes on 9p21, a contribution of the wingless (wnt) pathway with alterations of the E-cadherin and beta-catenin proteins, as well as alterations of the hedgehog signaling pathway have been implicated in anaplastic meningiomas. The integration of histopathological appearance, complex genetic/genomic data, and outcome will likely result in the identification of clinically distinct meningioma subgroups, which in turn can facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In breast cancers, only a minority of patients fully benefit from the different chemotherapy regimens currently in use. Identification of markers that could predict the response to a particular regimen would thus be critically important for patient care. In cell lines or animal models, tumor protein p53 (TP53) plays a critical role in modulating the response to genotoxic drugs. TP53 is activated in response to DNA damage and triggers either apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest, which have opposite effects on cell fate. Yet, studies linking TP53 status and chemotherapy response have so far failed to unambiguously establish this paradigm in patients. Breast cancers with a TP53 mutation were repeatedly shown to have a poor outcome, but whether this reflects poor response to treatment or greater intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor is unknown.;In this study we analyzed 80 noninflammatory breast cancers treated by frontline (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Tumor diagnoses were performed on pretreatment biopsies, and the patients then received six cycles of a dose-dense regimen of 75 mg/m(2) epirubicin and 1,200 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide, given every 14 days. After completion of chemotherapy, all patients underwent mastectomies, thus allowing for a reliable assessment of chemotherapy response. The pretreatment biopsy samples were used to determine the TP53 status through a highly efficient yeast functional assay and to perform RNA profiling. All 15 complete responses occurred among the 28 TP53-mutant tumors. Furthermore, among the TP53-mutant tumors, nine out of ten of the highly aggressive basal subtypes (defined by basal cytokeratin [KRT] immunohistochemical staining) experienced complete pathological responses, and only TP53 status and basal subtype were independent predictors of a complete response. Expression analysis identified many mutant TP53-associated genes, including CDC20, TTK, CDKN2A, and the stem cell gene PROM1, but failed to identify a transcriptional profile associated with complete responses among TP53 mutant tumors. In patients with unresponsive tumors, mutant TP53 status predicted significantly shorter overall survival. The 15 patients with responsive TP53-mutant tumors, however, had a favorable outcome, suggesting that this chemotherapy regimen can overcome the poor prognosis generally associated with mutant TP53 status.;This study demonstrates that, in noninflammatory breast cancers, TP53 status is a key predictive factor for response to this dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen and further suggests that the basal subtype is exquisitely sensitive to this association. Given the well-established predictive value of complete responses for long-term survival and the poor prognosis of basal and TP53-mutant tumors treated with other regimens, this chemotherapy could be particularly suited for breast cancer patients with a mutant TP53, particularly those with basal features.",

The molecular basis of NF1 tumorigenesis is, however, still unclear. Ninety-one tumors from 31 NF1 patients were screened for gross changes in the NF1 gene using microsatellite/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 17 out of 91 (19%) tumors (including two out of seven MPNSTs). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Thirteen germline and 12 somatic mutations were identified, of which three germline (IVS7-2A>G, 3731delT, 6117delG) and eight somatic (1888delG, 4374-4375delCC, R2129S, 2088delG, 2341del18, IVS27b-5C>T, 4083insT, Q519P) were novel. A mosaic mutation (R2429X) was also identified in a neurofibroma by DHPLC analysis and cloning/sequencing. The observed somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in terms of mutation type, relative frequency of occurrence, and putative underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Tumors lacking mutations were screened for NF1 gene promoter hypermethylation but none were found. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis revealed MSI in five out of 11 MPNSTs as compared to none out of 70 neurofibromas (p=1.8 x 10(-5)). The screening of seven MPNSTs for subtle mutations in the CDKN2A and TP53 genes proved negative, although the screening of 11 MPNSTs detected LOH involving either the TP53 or the CDKN2A gene in a total of four tumors. These findings are consistent with the view that NF1 tumorigenesis is a complex multistep process involving a variety of different types of genetic defect at multiple loci.",

WT mice were more susceptible than Nrf2(-/+) mice to tumor induction in the colon. Tumors from WT mice had higher HDAC levels globally and locally on genes such as cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a/p16) that were dysregulated during tumor development. The average tumor burden was reduced by SFN from 62.7 to 26.0 mm(3) in WT mice and from 14.6 to 11.7 mm(3) in Nrf2(-/+) mice. The decreased antitumor activity of SFN in Nrf2(-/+) mice coincided with attenuated Cdkn2a promoter interactions involving HDAC3. HDAC3 knockdown in human colon cancer cells recapitulated the effects of SFN on p16 induction. Human subjects given a broccoli sprout extract supplement (200 μmol SFN equivalents), or reporting more than five cruciferous vegetable servings per week, had increased p16 expression that was inversely associated with HDAC3 in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in biopsies obtained during screening colonoscopy.;Nrf2 expression varies widely in both normal human colon and human colon cancers and likely contributes to the overall rate of tumor growth in the large intestine. It remains to be determined whether this influences global HDAC protein expression levels, as well as local HDAC interactions on genes dysregulated during human colon tumor development. If corroborated in future studies, Nrf2 status might serve as a biomarker of HDAC inhibitor efficacy in clinical trials using single agent or combination modalities to slow, halt, or regress the progression to later stages of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.",

However, variants identified only account for <10% of the genetic risk of ALL.;We applied pathway-based analyses to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study to determine whether different biologic pathways were overrepresented in childhood ALL and major ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we applied causal inference and data reduction methods to prioritize candidate genes within each identified overrepresented pathway, while accounting for correlation among SNPs.;Pathway analysis results indicate that different ALL subtypes may involve distinct biologic mechanisms. Focal adhesion is a shared mechanism across the different disease subtypes. For ALL, the top five overrepresented Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways include axon guidance, protein digestion and absorption, melanogenesis, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and focal adhesion (PFDR < 0.05). Notably, these pathways are connected to downstream MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways which have been linked to B-cell malignancies.

Pheochromocytoma that develop in rats homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in p27Kip1 (MENX syndrome) show a clear progression from hyperplasia to tumor, offering the possibility to gain insight into tumor pathobiology. We compared the gene-expression signatures of both adrenomedullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma with normal rat adrenal medulla. Hyperplasia and tumor show very similar transcriptome profiles, indicating early determination of the tumorigenic signature. Overrepresentation of developmentally regulated neural genes was a feature of the rat lesions. Quantitative RT-PCR validated the up-regulation of 11 genes, including some involved in neural development: Cdkn2a, Cdkn2c, Neurod1, Gal, Bmp7, and Phox2a. Overexpression of these genes precedes histological changes in affected adrenal glands. Their presence at early stages of tumorigenesis indicates they are not acquired during progression and may be a result of the lack of functional p27Kip1. Adrenal and extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma development clearly follows diverged molecular pathways in MENX rats. To correlate these findings to human pheochromocytoma, we studied nine genes overexpressed in the rat lesions in 46 sporadic and familial human pheochromocytomas. The expression of GAL, DGKH, BMP7, PHOX2A, L1CAM, TCTE1, EBF3, SOX4, and HASH1 was up-regulated, although with different frequencies.

VDR was not independently associated with body mass index, family history of colorectal cancer, tumor location (colon versus rectum), stage, tumor grade, signet ring cells, CIMP, MSI, LINE-1 hypomethylation, BRAF, p53, p21, beta-catenin, or cyclooxygenase-2. VDR expression was not significantly related with patient survival, prognosis, or clinical outcome. In conclusion, VDR overexpression in colorectal cancer is independently associated with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations. Our data support potential interactions between the VDR, RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, and possible influence by KRAS or PIK3CA mutation on therapy or chemoprevention targeting VDR.",

Molecular analysis of aspirated pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) can provide valuable information not obtained by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) analysis or cytology.;All patients who underwent molecular analysis of PCF between March 2013 and June 2015 were reviewed, including pathology, imaging, and follow-up. Molecular testing was performed using a patented, anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform, which sequenced numerous hotspots in 39 genes linked with malignancy. Performance of NGS and cytology was calculated using final outcome, as determined by clinicopathologic follow-up.;The study cohort included 113 PCFs from 105 patients. In total, 119 variants were detected in 67 PCFs (59%). Variants were more common in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)/cancer than in nonmucinous cysts (P < .005). The inclusion of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)/guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GNAS) variants improved the classification of IPMNs as mucinous from 50% by microscopy to 100%. Seventy-five percent of cancers had high-grade atypia versus 0% of IPMNs and nonmucinous cysts (P < .002). Variants in tumor protein 53 (TP53), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), and notch1 (NOTCH1) were detected only in malignant cysts. Cytology was similarly specific (100%) for detecting malignant cysts but was more sensitive than the identification of late mutations by NGS (75% vs 46%).;The detection of KRAS/GNAS variants improves the identification of mucinous neoplasms. Variants in TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 support the diagnosis of a high-risk cyst requiring surgery or additional sampling. Although molecular analysis is not a replacement for cytopathology, it does provide valuable information for accurate preoperative diagnosis, helping to classify mucinous neoplasms and high-risk cysts that require surgical resection.

Loss of the p16 tumor suppressor (CDKN2A), through homozygous deletions of 9p21, is a good marker of mesotheliomas but lacks sensitivity. Recent reports indicate that some mesotheliomas are associated with loss of BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression. Here we investigate BAP1 and p16 as potential markers of malignancy and compare test characteristics with previously proposed markers using a well-characterized tissue microarray. BAP1 protein expression was interrogated by IHC. The p16 locus was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) directed toward chromosome 9p21. Loss of BAP1 was identified in 7/26 mesotheliomas and 0/49 benign proliferations. Loss of p16 was identified in 14/27 mesotheliomas and 0/40 benign proliferations, yielding 100% specificity and positive predictive value for each marker. Together, BAP1 IHC and p16 FISH were 58% sensitive for detecting malignancy. Various combinations of p53, EMA, IMP3, and GLUT1 showed reasonably high specificity (96% to 98%) but poor to extremely poor sensitivity. Combined BAP1 IHC/p16 FISH testing is a highly specific method of diagnosing malignant mesotheliomas when the question is whether a mesothelial proliferation is benign or malignant and is particularly useful when tissue invasion by mesothelial cells cannot be demonstrated. However, combined BAP1/p16 FISH testing is not highly sensitive, and negative results do not rule out a mesothelioma. The test characteristics of previously proposed markers EMA, p53, GLUT1, IMP3 suggest that, even in combination, these markers are not useful tools in this clinical setting. ",

The recent multidimensional analysis of the GBM genome has provided a more complete view of the landscape of such alterations and their linked pathways. This effort has demonstrated that certain pathways are universally altered, but that the specific genetic events altered within each pathway can vary for each particular patient's tumor. With this atlas of genetic and epigenetic events, it now becomes feasible to assess how the patterns of mutations in a pathway influence response to drugs that are targeting such pathways. This issue is particularly important for GBM because, in contrast to other tumor types, molecularly targeted therapies have failed to alter overall survival substantially. Here, we combined functional genetic screens and comprehensive genomic analyses to identify CDK6 as a GBM oncogene that is required for proliferation and viability in a subset of GBM cell lines and tumors. Using an available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, we sought to determine if the specific pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated the response to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. We showed that codeletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2C serves as a strong predictor of sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Thus, genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify a subset of GBMs likely to respond to CDK4/6 inhibition. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genomic, functional and pharmacologic data can be exploited to inform the development of targeted therapy directed against specific cancer pathways.",

We sequenced 24 candidate healthy aging genes in DNA samples from 47 healthy individuals aged eighty-five years or older (the 'oldest-old'), to characterize genetic variation that is present in this exceptional group. These healthy seniors were never diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, or Alzheimer disease. We re-sequenced all exons, intron-exon boundaries and selected conserved non-coding sequences of candidate genes involved in aging-related processes, including dietary restriction (PPARG, PPARGC1A, SIRT1, SIRT3, UCP2, UCP3), metabolism (IGF1R, APOB, SCD), autophagy (BECN1, FRAP1), stem cell activation (NOTCH1, DLL1), tumor suppression (TP53, CDKN2A, ING1), DNA methylation (TRDMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) Progeria syndromes (LMNA, ZMPSTE24, KL) and stress response (CRYAB, HSPB2).

The possible role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) genes was raised by recognition of cyclin D1 as a parathyroid oncogene, identification of rare germline mutations in CDKI genes in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; that in rodents, mutation in Cdkn1b caused parathyroid tumors; and subsequently through identification of rare predisposing germline sequence variants and somatic mutation of CDKN1B, encoding p27(kip1), in sporadic human parathyroid adenoma. We therefore sought to determine whether mutations/variants in the other six CDKI genes CDKN1A, CDKN1C, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, and CDKN2D, encoding p21, p57, p14(ARF)/p16, p15, p18, and p19, respectively, contribute to the development of typical parathyroid adenomas. In a series of 85 sporadic parathyroid adenomas, direct DNA sequencing identified alterations in five adenomas (6 %): Two contained distinct heterozygous changes in CDKN1A, one germline and one of undetermined germline status; one had a CDKN2B germline alteration, accompanied by loss of the normal allele in the tumor (LOH); two had variants of CDKN2C, one somatic and one germline with LOH. Abnormalities of three of the mutant proteins were readily demonstrable in vitro. Thus, germline mutations/rare variants in CDKN1A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2C likely contribute to the development of a significant subgroup of common sporadic parathyroid adenomas, and somatic mutation in CDKN2C further suggests a direct role for CDKI alteration in conferring a selective growth advantage to parathyroid cells, providing novel support for the concept that multiple CDKIs can play primary roles in human neoplasia.

About 20% of melanoma-prone families bear a mutation in the CDKN2A locus, which encodes two unrelated proteins, p16INK4A and p14ARF. Mutations in the other locus, CDK4, are much rarer and have been linked to the disease in only three families worldwide. In the 1960s, a large Norwegian pedigree with multiple atypical nevi and malignant melanomas was identified. Subsequently, six generations and more than 100 family members were traced and 20 cases of melanoma verified. In this article, we report that CDK4 codon 24 is mutated from CGT to CAT (Arg24His) in this unusually large melanoma kindred. Intriguingly, one of the family members had ocular melanoma, but the CDK4 mutation could not be detected in archival tissue samples from this subject. Thus, the case of ocular melanoma in this family was sporadic, suggesting an etiology different from that of the skin tumors. The CDK4 mutation in the Norwegian family was identical to that in melanoma families in France, Australia, and England. Haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers flanking the CDK4 gene and single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene did not support the possibility that there was a common founder, but rather indicated at least two independent mutational events. All CDK4 melanoma families known to date have a substitution of amino acid 24. In addition to resulting from selection pressure, this observation may be explained by the CG dinucleotide of codon 24 representing a mutational hot spot in the CDK4 gene.",

HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types.

In this study, we combined statistical analyses and computational modeling to explain patterns of genetic alterations seen in 178 patients with bladder tumors (either muscle-invasive or non-muscle-invasive). A statistical analysis on frequently altered genes identified pair associations, including co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity. Focusing on genetic alterations of protein-coding genes involved in growth factor receptor signaling, cell cycle, and apoptosis entry, we complemented this analysis with a literature search to focus on nine pairs of genetic alterations of our dataset, with subsequent verification in three other datasets available publicly. To understand the reasons and contexts of these patterns of associations while accounting for the dynamics of associated signaling pathways, we built a logical model. This model was validated first on published mutant mice data, then used to study patterns and to draw conclusions on counter-intuitive observations, allowing one to formulate predictions about conditions where combining genetic alterations benefits tumorigenesis. For example, while CDKN2A homozygous deletions occur in a context of FGFR3-activating mutations, our model suggests that additional PIK3CA mutation or p21CIP deletion would greatly favor invasiveness. Furthermore, the model sheds light on the temporal orders of gene alterations, for example, showing how mutual exclusivity of FGFR3 and TP53 mutations is interpretable if FGFR3 is mutated first. Overall, our work shows how to predict combinations of the major gene alterations leading to invasiveness through two main progression pathways in bladder cancer.",

The ABL gene on chromosome band 9q34 is a proto-oncogene and is the well-known translocation partner of the BCR gene on 22q11 giving rise to t(9;22)(q34;q11), which is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia and is the most common chromosomal abnormality in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Amplification of ABL is an exceedingly rare event, with only less than 5 cases reported in the literature. The p16(INK4a) (or CDKN2A) gene on 9p21 is a tumor suppressor gene, and deletion thereof is recently recognized as one of the most common genetic abnormalities in ALL. The authors herein describe an 8-year-old male patient with precursor T-cell ALL harboring both ABL gene amplification and p16(INK4a) gene deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using BCR/ABL probes revealed five or more ABL signals, indicating amplification in 51.5% of interphase nuclei. FISH using p16(INK4a) gene probes showed heterozygous p16(INK4a) deletion in 71.0%. On conventional cytogenetic analysis, however, only 10 metaphases were available, which showed the normal karyotype, 46,XY[10], serving no evidence for the findings on FISH. This is the first report of an ALL case with ABL amplification, and the authors speculate that both ABL proto-oncogene amplification and the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor gene deletion have been implicated in leukemogenesis in the present case, although whether the ABL amplification truly contributes to the leukemogenesis or merely an epiphenomenon representing underlying genomic instability remains to be determined.",

Similar to cancer, ageing also results from the accumulation of damage and, therefore, we have reasoned that Arf/p53 could have anti-ageing activity by alleviating the load of age-associated damage. Here we show that genetically manipulated mice with increased, but otherwise normally regulated, levels of Arf and p53 present strong cancer resistance and have decreased levels of ageing-associated damage.

Non-1p/19q-deleted high-grade ODTs can present other genetic aberrations, CDKN2A deletion (9p21.3), EGFR amplification (7p11.2) and/or chromosome 10 loss, which are associated with a poor prognosis. The identification of these abnormalities allowed drafting a histo-molecular classification. The aim of this study was to precisely identify, using array CGH, the genomic hallmarks of these tumors, particularly those that are not deleted on 1p/19q. We studied 14 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded high-grade ODTs using pangenomic oligonucleotide array CGH with an average resolution of 22.3 kb. The 1p/19q codeletion was found in five anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. The three genomic aberrations carrying a poor prognosis were found, most often associated, in five out of nine tumors not deleted on 1p/19q. In addition, four recurrent copy number alterations, involving genes that participate to cell growth and cycle, were found to be strongly associated in five tumors not deleted on 1p/19q: gain or amplification at 1q32.1 (MDM4, PIK3C2B genes), 12q14.1 (CDK4 gene), 12q14.3-q15 (MDM2 gene) and homozygous deletion at 22q13.1 (APOBEC3B gene). MDM2, MDM4, CDK4 and PIK3C2B are known for potentially being amplified or overexpressed in high-grade gliomas. However, the involvement of APOBEC3B, coding for mRNA edition enzyme, is described here for the first time. Our results show a strong association between these four alterations. Therefore, this can open a perspective for a novel subgroup in high-grade ODTs not deleted on 1p/19q.",

A positive family history of the disease is among the most established risk factors for CMM; it is estimated that 10% of CMM cases result from an inherited predisposition. Although mutations in two genes, CDKN2A and CDK4, have been shown to confer an increased risk of CMM, they account for only 20%-25% of families with multiple cases of CMM. Therefore, to localize additional loci involved in melanoma susceptibility, we have performed a genomewide scan for linkage in 49 Australian pedigrees containing at least three CMM cases, in which CDKN2A and CDK4 involvement has been excluded. The highest two-point parametric LOD score (1.82; recombination fraction [theta] 0.2) was obtained at D1S2726, which maps to the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p22). A parametric LOD score of 4.65 (theta=0) and a nonparametric LOD score of 4.19 were found at D1S2779 in nine families selected for early age at onset. Additional typing yielded seven adjacent markers with LOD scores >3 in this subset, with the highest parametric LOD score, 4.95 (theta=0) (nonparametric LOD score 5.37), at D1S2776. Analysis of 33 additional multiplex families with CMM from several continents provided further evidence for linkage to the 1p22 region, again strongest in families with the earliest mean age at diagnosis. A nonparametric ordered sequential analysis was used, based on the average age at diagnosis in each family. The highest LOD score, 6.43, was obtained at D1S2779 and occurred when the 15 families with the earliest ages at onset were included. These data provide significant evidence of a novel susceptibility gene for CMM located within chromosome band 1p22.",

Aberrations of various components of the pRb pathway, such as retinoblastoma protein and its upstream actors including cyclin D1, cyclin dependence kinase-4 and p16/p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, have been reported in a variety of human tumors. Furthermore, the alterations of retinoblastoma protein and its upstream components often occur in a reciprocal manner. Previously, we have reported frequent inactivation of the Cdkn2a/Cdkn2b loci encoding p16/p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors in a subset of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine- and 1, 3-butadiene-induced mouse lymphomas (S.-M.

To investigate whether alteration of other components in pRb pathway is an alternative mechanism underlying the development of these chemically induced lymphomas, we have examined the genetic status of Rb1, Ccnd1 and Cdk4 genes that encode retinoblastoma protein, cyclin D1 and cyclin dependence kinase-4, respectively. Gross alterations of the Rb1, Ccnd1, and Cdk4 genes were not detected by Southern analysis in any of the tumors examined. In addition, single-strand conformation analysis failed to reveal point mutations in the Cdk4 amino terminal domain that is important for its association with Cdkn2a gene products. These results indicate that the mechanisms underlying the development of 2', 3'-dideoxycytidine- and 1,3-butadiene-induced lymphomas involve inactivation of p16/p15 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors but not genomic alterations of the Rb1, Ccnd1 and Cdk4 genes.",

Samples from 16 patients with PDAC were collected by ultrasound‑guided biopsy or from surgical specimens for DNA and RNA extraction. All samples were analyzed by RNASeq performed at 75x2 base pairs on a HiScanSQ Illumina platform. Single‑nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected with SNVMix and filtered on dbSNP, 1000 Genomes and Cosmic. Non‑synonymous SNVs were analyzed with SNPs&GO and PROVEAN. A total of 13 samples were analyzed by high resolution copy number analysis on an Affymetrix SNP array 6.0. RNAseq resulted in an average of 264 coding non‑synonymous novel SNVs (ranging from 146‑374) and 16 novel insertions or deletions (In/Dels) (ranging from 6‑24) for each sample, of which a mean of 11.2% were disease‑associated and somatic events, while 34.7% were frameshift somatic In/Dels. From this analysis, alterations in the known oncogenes associated with PDAC were observed, including Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations (93.7%) and inactivation of cyclin‑dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (50%), mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) (50%), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) (56%). One case that was negative for KRAS exhibited a G13D neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog mutation. In addition, gene fusions were detected in 10 samples for a total of 23 different intra‑ or inter‑chromosomal rearrangements, however, a recurrent fusion transcript remains to be identified. SNP arrays identified macroscopic and cryptic cytogenetic alterations in 85% of patients. Gains were observed in the chromosome arms 6p, 12p, 18q and 19q which contain KRAS, GATA binding protein 6, protein kinase B and cyclin D3. Deletions were identified on chromosome arms 1p, 9p, 6p, 18q, 10q, 15q, 17p, 21q and 19q which involve TP53, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, runt‑related transcription factor 2, AT‑rich interactive domain‑containing protein 1A, phosphatase and tensin homolog and serine/threonine kinase 11.

We established a mouse model of sporadic oncogene-driven breast tumorigenesis in a series of mutant mouse strains with specific DDR deficiencies to reveal a role for the Mre11 complex in the response to oncogene activation. We demonstrate that an Mre11-mediated DDR restrains mammary hyperplasia by effecting an oncogene-induced G2 arrest. Impairment of Mre11 complex functions promotes the progression of mammary hyperplasias into invasive and metastatic breast cancers, which are often associated with secondary inactivation of the Ink4a-Arf (CDKN2a) locus. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of DDR engagement by activated oncogenes and highlight genetic interactions between the DDR and Ink4a-Arf pathways in suppression of oncogene-driven tumorigenesis and metastasis.

We report on the first population-based case-control study of risk factors for melanoma in adolescents (15-19 years). Data were collected through personal interviews with cases, controls and parents. A single examiner conducted full-body nevus counts and blood samples were collected from cases for analysis of the CDKN2A melanoma predisposition gene. A total of 201 (80%) of the 250 adolescents with melanoma diagnosed between 1987 and 1994 and registered with the Queensland Cancer Registry and 205 (79%) of 258 age-, gender- and location-matched controls who were contacted agreed to participate. The strongest risk factor associated with melanoma in adolescents in a multivariate model was the presence of more than 100 nevi 2 mm or more in diameter (odds ratio [OR] = 46.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.4-190.8). Other risk factors were red hair (OR = 5.4, 95%CI = 1.0-28.4); blue eyes (OR = 4.5, 95%CI = 1.5-13.6); inability to tan after prolonged sun exposure (OR = 4.7, 95%CI = 0.9-24.6); heavy facial freckling (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 0.9-12.3); and family history of melanoma (OR = 4.0, 95%CI = 0.8-18.9). Only 2 of 147 cases tested had germline variants or mutations in CDKN2A. There was no association with sunscreen use overall, however, never/rare use of sunscreen at home under the age of 5 years was associated with increased risk (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 0.7-7.1). There was no difference between cases and controls in cumulative sun exposure in this high-exposure environment. Factors indicating genetic susceptibility to melanoma, in particular, the propensity to develop nevi and freckles, red hair, blue eyes, inability to tan and a family history of the disease are the primary determinants of melanoma among adolescents in this high solar radiation environment. Lack of association with reported sun exposure is consistent with the high genetic susceptibility in this group.",

The MTHFR gene has genetic variants (C667T and A1298C), which cause reduced enzyme activity. Impaired folate metabolism by these genetic variants of MTHFR could change the methylation pattern of DNA including promoter hypermethylation, which has been frequently observed in cancer. In this study, we compared the MTHFR genotypes and haplotype to the features of colorectal cancer focusing on the promoter methylation of tumor DNA.;Genomic DNA was isolated from 194 colorectal cancer tissues and subjected to MTHFR genotyping by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The MTHFR haplotype was determined by combination of C667T and A1298C genotype and classified into 2 groups, high (H-haplotype) or low (L-haplotype) enzymatic activity of MTHFR. The methylation level of tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A, hMLH1, ARF and TIMP3) was measured by a fluorescence-based, real-time methylation specific PCR method.;There was no significant association of the clinicopathological features with either C667T genotype, A1298C genotype or haplotype of MTHFR. The methylation level of CDKN2A was higher in cancer with the L-haplotype of MTHFR than in that with the H-haplotype when cancers of proximal origin were considered (p=0.029). hMLH1 methylation also tended to be higher in proximal colon cancers of MTHFR L-haplotype (p=0.059). In addition, the proximal colon cancers showing CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) were significantly more frequent in L-haplotype than in H-haplotype.;These results suggest that the haplotype with low enzymatic activity of MTHFR is linked with promoter hypermethylation and consequently modifies the risk of CIMP(+) proximal colon cancer development in the Japanese people. The relationship between MTHFR polymorphism and DNA methylation in the Japanese is contrary to the previous results in Caucasians. Further study is needed focusing on ethnic variations in the relationships among MTHFR polymorphism, DNA methylation and the development of CIMP(+) colorectal cancer.",

These discrepancies may be rooted in differing telomere length measurement methods and their application. This leads to the question of just how robust telomere length is as a biomarker of aging and whether measurement of CDKN2A levels offers a better alternative. The latter has already provided reproducible data from a small number of clinical studies and in one proven better than telomere length determination in predicting organ function.

Deletion of 9p is one of the most frequent genomic alterations in bladder cancer. In addition, alterations of 9p21 and P16 are frequently seen in the epithelial cells of chronic smokers. This pilot study evaluated whether 9p21 aberrations induced by exposure in vitro to benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the metabolic product of benzo[a]pyrene, a constituent of tobacco smoke, were more common in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 61 bladder cancer patients compared to 64 matched controls. Our hypothesis was that 9p21 sensitivity to BPDE reflects the susceptibility of a specific locus to damage from carcinogens in tobacco smoke. We found that BPDE-induced chromosome band 9p21 aberrations were significantly higher in lymphocytes of bladder cancer cases (24.97 +/- 5.26 per 1,000) than in controls (20.72 +/- 4.51 per 1,000; P < 0.0001). However, no difference was observed for CEP9, a control locus. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking status, 9p BPDE sensitivity had an odds ratio (OR) of 9.01 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3.75, 21.67] for bladder cancer. We further observed a gradient of elevated bladder cancer risk associated with increasing chromosomal damage. The adjusted ORs for subjects in the second, third, and highest quartiles of BPDE-induced 9p21 aberrations relative to the first quartile were 0.48 (0.04, 5.69), 5.14 (1.12, 23.59), and 21.51 (4.75, 97.34), respectively, providing increasing dose-response evidence of the locus-specific alterations.

As part of an ongoing project to determine how in utero exposure to chemical carcinogens affects the molecular pathogenesis of murine lung tumors, the p53 and p16Cdkn2a genes were analyzed by using paraffin-embedded lung tissues from mice treated transplacentally with 3-methylcholanthrene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene, as well as their flanking introns, demonstrated an absence of mutations at this gene locus. However, a genetic polymorphism was identified at nt 708 in intron 4 of the DBA/2 strain of mice 5 bp downstream of a 3' branching-point splice signal. Analysis of exons 1 and 2 of the Cdkn2a gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses revealed mutations in exon 2 in 7% of the tumors examined. Tumor 23-1 exhibited a CAC-->TAC transition at nt 301 (His74-->Tyr74), and tumor 36-1 exhibited a GGG-->GAG transition at nucleotide 350 (Gly90-->Glu90). Northern blot analysis of 14 of the larger tumors showed a marked decrease in the levels of Rb RNA expression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a spectrum of pRb expression, with the smaller adenomas showing moderate numbers of nuclei with heterogeneous staining for pRb in contrast with a highly reduced or near-complete absence of expression in the nuclei of larger tumors with features of adenocarcinomas. The low incidence of mutations at tumor suppressor loci suggested that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes was a late event in murine lung tumor pathogenesis. The identification of both mutations at the Cdkn2a gene locus and reduced levels of Rb expression combined with previous studies demonstrating a high incidence of mutated Kras2 alleles in these tumors implies that alterations of the Rb regulatory axis, in combination with mutation of Kras2, may be the preferred pathway for the pathogenesis of pulmonary tumors in transplacentally exposed mice.",

The WRN helicase plays an important role in the maintenance of telomere function. WRN promoter methylation and gene silencing are common in colorectal cancer with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), which is associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and mucinous tumors. However, no study has examined the relationship between mucinous differentiation, WRN methylation, CIMP and MSI in colorectal cancer. Utilizing 903 population-based colorectal cancers and real-time PCR (MethyLight), we quantified DNA methylation in WRN and eight other promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1) known to be specific for CIMP. Supporting WRN as a good CIMP marker, WRN methylation was correlated well with CIMP-high diagnosis (> or =6/8 methylated promoters), demonstrating 89% sensitivity and 81% specificity. WRN methylation was associated with the presence of any mucinous component and > or =50% mucinous component (P<0.0001). Because both MSI and CIMP were associated with mucinous tumors and WRN methylation, we stratified tumors into 9 MSI/CIMP subtypes, to examine whether the relationship between WRN methylation and mucin still persisted. In each MSI/CIMP subtype, tumors with mucinous component were persistently more common in WRN-methylated tumors than WRN-unmethylated tumors (P=0.004). No relations of WRN methylation with other variables (age, sex, tumor location, poor differentiation, signet ring cells, lymphocytic reactions, KRAS, BRAF, p53, p21 or 18q loss of heterozygosity) persisted after tumors were stratified by CIMP status. In conclusion, WRN methylation is associated with mucinous differentiation independent of CIMP and MSI status. Our data suggest a possible role of WRN methylation in mucinous differentiation, and may provide explanation to the enigmatic association between mucin and MSI/CIMP.",

Their inactivation is caused by epigenetic mechanisms, mainly promoter hypermethylation, and can be placed into two groups based on their functional interaction with tumor suppressors RB or p53. The RB group includes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, RB1, BMP4, CDH1, CDH13, GADD45B and GADD45G; AIP and MEN1 genes also belong to this group. The p53 group includes MEG3, MGMT, PLAGL1, RASSF1, RASSF3 and SOCS1. We propose that the tumor suppression function of these genes is mainly mediated by the RB and p53 pathways. We also discuss possible tumor suppression mechanisms for individual genes. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"p21 (CDKN1A/CIP1/WAF1), one of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle and is transcriptionally regulated by p53. Down-regulation of p21 is caused by TP53 mutations in colorectal cancer. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) appears to be a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer with concordant methylation of multiple gene promoters and is associated with a high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and BRAF mutations. However, no study to date has evaluated the relationship between p21 expression and CIMP in colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the inter-relationships between p21, p53, CIMP, MSI and KRAS/BRAF status in colorectal cancer. We utilized 737 relatively unbiased samples of colorectal cancers from two large prospective cohort studies. Using quantitative real-time PCR (MethyLight), we measured DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), CRABP1, MLH1 and NEUROG1]. CIMP-high (>or=4/5 methylated promoters) was diagnosed in 118 (16%) of the 737 tumours. We also assessed expression of p21 and p53 by immunohistochemistry. Among the 737 tumours, 371 (50%) showed p21 loss. Both p21 loss and p53 positivity were inversely associated with CIMP-high, MSI-H and BRAF mutations. The associations of p21 with these molecular features were still present after tumours were stratified by p53 status. In contrast, the associations of p53 positivity with the molecular features were no longer present after tumours were stratified by p21 status. When CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high tumours were stratified by MSI or KRAS/BRAF status, CIMP-high and MSI-H (but not BRAF mutations) were still inversely associated with p21 loss. In conclusion, down-regulation of p21 is inversely correlated with CIMP-high and MSI-H in colorectal cancer, independent of TP53 and BRAF status.",

There is increasing evidence for methylation profiling being able to delineate biologically relevant tumor groups even within the same cellular lineage. Therefore, we used DNA methylation arrays for methylome- and chromosomal profile-based characterization of 171 peripheral nerve sheath tumors. We analyzed 28 conventional high-grade MPNST, three malignant Triton tumors, six low-grade MPNST, four epithelioid MPNST, 33 neurofibromas (15 dermal, 8 intraneural, 10 plexiform), six atypical neurofibromas, 43 schwannomas (including 5 NF2 and 5 schwannomatosis associated cases), 11 cellular schwannomas, 10 melanotic schwannomas, 7 neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid tumors, 10 nerve sheath myxomas and 10 ganglioneuromas. Schwannomas formed different epigenomic subgroups including a vestibular schwannoma subgroup. Cellular schwannomas were not distinct from conventional schwannomas. Nerve sheath myxomas and neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid tumors were most similar to schwannomas. Dermal, intraneural and plexiform neurofibromas as well as ganglioneuromas all showed distinct methylation profiles. Atypical neurofibromas and low-grade MPNST were indistinguishable with a common methylation profile and frequent losses of CDKN2A. Epigenomic analysis finds two groups of conventional high-grade MPNST sharing a frequent loss of neurofibromin. The larger of the two groups shows an additional loss of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The smaller one retains H3K27me3 and is found in spinal locations. Sporadic MPNST with retained neurofibromin expression did not form an epigenetic group and most cases could be reclassified as cellular schwannomas or soft tissue sarcomas. Widespread immunohistochemical loss of H3K27me3 was exclusively seen in MPNST of the main methylation cluster, which defines it as an additional useful marker for the differentiation of cellular schwannoma and MPNST.

In the present study, we investigated UHRF1 expression and function in GC proliferation and explored its downstream regulatory mechanism. The results demonstrated that UHRF1 overexpression was an independent and significant predictor of GC prognosis. Downregulation of UHRF1 suppressed GC proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo, and UHRF1 upregulation showed opposite effects. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 reactivated 7 TSGs, including CDX2, CDKN2A, RUNX3, FOXO4, PPARG, BRCA1 and PML, via promoter demethylation.

Transgenic expression of βhCG in mice causes hyper-luteinized ovaries, a loss in estrous cyclicity and infertility, increased body weight, prolactinomas and mammary gland tumors. Strategies were devised to generate antibody responses against hCG to investigate whether reversal of the molecular processes driving tumorigenesis would follow. hCG-immunized transgenic mice did not exhibit increases in body weight or serum prolactin levels, and gross ovarian and pituitary morphology remained normal. While non-immunized transgenic animals demonstrated heightened levels of transcripts associated with pituitary tumorigenesis (HMG2A, E2F1, CCND1, PRL, GH, GAL, PTTG1, BMP4) and decreased levels of CDK inhibitors CDKN1B (p27), CDKN2A (p16) and CDKN2c (p18), immunization led to a reversal to levels found in non-transgenic animals. Serum derived from transgenic (but not non-transgenic) mice led to enhanced transcription as well as expression of VEGF, IL-8, KC (murine IL-8) and MMP-9 in tumor cells, effects not seen when sera derived from hCG-immunized transgenic mice was employed. As the definitive indication of the restoration of the reproductive axis, immunization led to the resumption of estrous cyclicity as well as fertility in transgenic mice. These results indicate that hCG may influence cancer pathogenesis and progression via several distinct mechanisms. Using a stringent in vivo system in which βhCG acts both a \"self\" antigen and a tumor-promoting moiety (putatively akin to the situation in humans), the data builds a case for anti-gonadotropin vaccination strategies in the treatment of gonadotropin-dependent or secreting malignancies that frequently acquire resistance to conventional therapy.",

However, a comprehensive study of SIRT1 using human cancer tissue with clinical outcome data is currently lacking, and its prognostic significance is uncertain. Using the database of 485 colorectal cancers in two independent prospective cohort studies, we detected SIRT1 overexpression in 180 (37%) tumors by immunohistochemistry. We examined its relationship to the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), related molecular events, clinical features including body mass index, and patient survival. We quantified DNA methylation in eight CIMP-specific promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A, CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) and eight other CpG islands (CHFR, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, p14, and WRN) by MethyLight.

However, the majority of such patients either exhibit de novo resistance from the beginning of the treatment or acquire resistance and eventually relapse. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance, overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors remains an unmet medical need. Constitutive activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 as a result of genetic aberrations including CDKN2A inactivation and CCND1 amplification is common across many cancer types and frequently co-occurs with oncogenic BRAF mutations. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression is a common feature of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here we review CDK4/6 as a therapeutic target in BRAF mutant cancers and discuss emerging evidence supporting a critical role of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 axis in de novo and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Co-targeting CDK4/6 and BRAF could be a more effective therapy to augment clinical response of BRAF inhibitors and overcome resistance in BRAF mutant cancers. ",

However, the processes driving this particular ATM phenotype are not understood. Genome-wide association studies associated the CDKN2A locus, encoding the tumour suppressor p16(INK4A), with the development of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, p16(INK4A) levels in human ATMs and the role of p16(INK4A) in acquiring the ATM phenotype were assessed.;Gene expression of p16                            (                               INK4A                            ) in ATMs was analysed and compared with that in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from obese patients or with macrophages from human atherosclerotic plaques (AMs). Additionally, p16(INK4A) levels were studied during macrophage differentiation and polarisation of monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of p16(INK4A) in MDMs from healthy donors was investigated by small interfering (si)RNA-mediated silencing or adenovirus-mediated overproduction of p16(INK4A).;Compared with MDMs and AMs, ATMs from obese patients expressed lower levels of p16                            (                               INK4A                            ). In vitro, IL-4-induced M2 polarisation resulted in lower p16(INK4A) protein levels after differentiation of monocytes from healthy donors in macrophages. Silencing of p16(INK4A) in MDMs mediated by siRNA increased the expression of M2 marker genes and enhanced the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to give a phenotype resembling that of ATM. By contrast, adenovirus-mediated overproduction of p16(INK4A) in MDMs diminished M2 marker gene expression and the response to LPS. Western blot analysis revealed that p16(INK4A) overproduction inhibits LPS- and palmitate-induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (NF-κB) signalling.;These results show that p16(INK4A) inhibits the acquisition of the ATM phenotype. The age-related increase in p16(INK4A) level may thus influence normal ATM function and contribute to type 2 diabetes risk.",

Consistent with an important role for BRCA2 in error-free DNA repair, complex genomic changes are frequently observed in tumors derived from BRCA2 mutation carriers. Here, we explore the impact of DNA copy-number changes in BRCA2 tumors with respect to phenotype and clinical staging of the disease.;Breast tumors (n = 33) derived from BRCA2 999del5 mutation carriers were examined in terms of copy-number changes with high-resolution aCGH (array comparative genomic hybridization) containing 385 thousand probes (about one for each 7 kbp) and expression of phenotypic markers on TMAs (tissue microarrays). The data were examined with respect to clinical parameters including TNM staging, histologic grade, S phase, and ploidy.;Tumors from BRCA2 carriers of luminal and basal/triple-negative phenotypes (TNPs) differ with respect to patterns of DNA copy-number changes. The basal/TNP subtype was characterized by lack of pRb (RB1) coupled with high/intense expression of p16 (CDKN2A) gene products. We found increased proportions of Ki-67-positive cells to be significantly associated with loss of the wild-type (wt) BRCA2 allele in luminal types, whereas BRCA2wt loss was less frequent in BRCA2 tumors displaying basal/TNP phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that deletions at 13q13.1, involving the BRCA2wt allele, represents a part of a larger network of co-occurring genetic changes, including deletions at 6q22.32-q22.33, 11q14.2-q24.1, and gains at 17q24.1. Importantly, copy-number changes at these BRCA2-linked networking regions coincide with those associated with advanced progression, involving the capacity to metastasize to the nodes or more-distant sites at diagnosis.;The results presented here demonstrate divergent paths of tumor evolution in BRCA2 carriers and that deletion of the wild-type BRCA2 allele, together with co-occurring changes at 6 q, 11 q, and 17 q, are important events in progression toward advanced disease.",

Numerous studies have focused on the role of p16(INK4a) in melanoma, but the involvement of ARF, a well-known p53 activator, is still controversial. Using a transgenic BRAF(V600E) mouse model previously generated in our laboratory, we report that loss of ARF is able to enhance spontaneous melanoma formation and cause profound sensitivity to neonatal UVB exposure. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) and ARF deletion synergize to inhibit nucleotide excision repair by epigenetically repressing XPC and inhibiting the E2F4/DP1 complex.

We hypothesized that molecular genetic analysis could provide a more objective means to classify tumors and, thus, reduce diagnostic variability.;We performed molecular genetic analysis on 91 nonselected gliomas for 1p, 19q, 10q, TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 abnormalities and compared with the consensus diagnoses established among four independent neuropathologists.;There were six astrocytomas, seven anaplastic astrocytomas, 45 glioblastomas, 21 oligodendrogliomas, eight anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, three oligoastrocytomas, and one anaplastic oligoastrocytoma. Twenty-nine cases had either 1p or 19qloss of heterozygosity (LOH) while retaining both copies of 10q, of which 25 (86%) were histologically oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma. As for the oligodendroglial tumors, unanimous agreement of the initial diagnoses was almost restricted to those cases with combined 1p/19qLOH, whereas all nine tumors without 1p loss initially received variable diagnoses. Interestingly, TP53 mutation was inversely related to 1pLOH in all gliomas (P = 0.0003) but not 19qLOH (P = 0.15).;These data demonstrate that molecular genetic analysis of 1p/19q/10q/TP53 has significant diagnostic value, especially in detecting oligodendroglial tumors. In addition, 1pLOH and TP53 mutations in gliomas may be markers of oligodendroglial and astrocytic pathways, respectively, which may separate gliomas with the same histological diagnosis, especially oligodendroglial tumors and glioblastomas. Testing for those molecular genetic alterations would be essential to obtain more homogeneous sets of gliomas for the future clinical studies.",

In this study, we aimed to identify DNA methylation based biomarkers to distinguish patients with locally advanced breast cancer who may benefit from neoadjuvant doxorubicin treatment.;We investigated quantitatively the methylation patterns in the promoter regions of 14 genes (ABCB1, ATM, BRCA1, CDH3, CDKN2A, CXCR4, ESR1, FBXW7, FOXC1, GSTP1, IGF2, HMLH1, PPP2R2B, and PTEN) in 75 well-described pre-treatment samples from locally advanced breast cancer and correlated the results to the available clinical and molecular parameters. Six normal breast tissues were used as controls and 163 unselected breast cancer cases were used to validate associations with histopathological and clinical parameters.Aberrant methylation was detected in 9 out of the 14 genes including the discovery of methylation at the FOXC1 promoter. Absence of methylation at the ABCB1 promoter correlated with progressive disease during doxorubicin treatment. Most importantly, the DNA methylation status at the promoters of GSTP1, FOXC1 and ABCB1 correlated with survival, whereby the combination of methylated genes improved the subdivision with respect to the survival of the patients. In multivariate analysis GSTP1 and FOXC1 methylation status proved to be independent prognostic markers associated with survival.;Quantitative DNA methylation profiling is a powerful tool to identify molecular changes associated with specific phenotypes. Methylation at the ABCB1 or GSTP1 promoter improved overall survival probably due to prolonged availability and activity of the drug in the cell while FOXC1 methylation might be a protective factor against tumour invasiveness. FOXC1 proved to be general prognostic factor, while ABCB1 and GSTP1 might be predictive factors for the response to and efficacy of doxorubicin treatment. Pharmacoepigenetic effects such as the reported associations in this study provide molecular explanations for differential responses to chemotherapy and it might prove valuable to take the methylation status of selected genes into account for patient management and treatment decisions.",

Three types of histological precursors of pancreatic cancer: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, mucinous cystic neoplasm, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, had been recognized by morphological studies and the recent genomic screening techniques revealed that each of these precursor lesions were associated with specific molecular alterations. In the familial pancreatic cancer cases, several responsible genes were discovered. Epigenetic changes also play an important role in the progression of pancreatic cancer. Several tumor suppressor genes were silenced due to aberrant promoter CpG island hypermethylation. Several genetically engineered mouse models, based on the Kras mutation, were created, and provided reliable tools to identify the key molecules responsible for the development or progression of pancreatic cancer.

To determine the extent to which ARF suppresses vascular neoplasia, we examined the incidence of hepatic vascular lesions in Arf-deficient mice exposed to the carcinogen urethane [intraperitoneal (i.p.), 1 mg/g]. Loss of Arf resulted in elevated morbidity and increased the incidence of both haemangiomas and incipient haemangiosarcomas. Suppression of vascular lesion development by ARF was heavily dependent on both Arf gene-dosage and the genetic strain of the mouse. Trp53-deficient mice also developed hepatic vascular lesions after exposure to urethane, suggesting that ARF signals through a p53-dependent pathway to inhibit the development of hepatic haemangiosarcoma.

It has been documented that genetic predisposition exists but exogenous factors are also very important. In familial melanomas it has been well established that mutation in the CDKN2A gene which is located at chromosome 9 leads to a marked risk for malignant melanoma. This tumor-suppressor gene is important for the regulation of the cell cycle and mutation in this gene is associated also with an increased rate of pancreas cancer. The penetrance of this mutation is influenced by UV-energy. In addition it has been shown that a second cluster for the familial atypical nevus syndrome is located at chromosome 1p36. Patients with the rare disease xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the DNA-repair mechanism inherited in an autosomal recessive trait and therefore develop within the first 20 years of life numerous malignant skin tumours including malignant melanomas. But also in non-syndromic patients a decrease of DNA-repair ability may occur. It has been shown recently that reduced DNA-repair ability is an independent risk factor for malignant melanoma and may contribute to susceptibility to sunlight-induced melanoma among the general population. Other constitutional risk factors for the development of malignant melanoma are fair skin, red hair and blue eyes. The most important exogenous risk factor is UV-exposition. Extensive and repetitive sunburns before the age of 15 years are especially predisposing to malignant melanoma. The most important preventive measures are continuous sun-protection including avoidance of sun in noon time on tropical and subtropical places, wearing a hut and sunglasses and application of sun-screens with high sun-protection factor. Furthermore a regular check for changing moles is indicated in persons with multiple atypical nevi or a familial melanoma syndrome. Nowadays molecular genetic screenings are available within research projects for members of melanoma-prone families. The controversy of such possibilities is discussed.",

There was no association between rs4977756 polymorphism and glioma risk in south Indian population. GG genotype had a non-significant low risk in glioma (OR = 0.69). rs11515 polymorphism was not in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium in our sample, so it was not considered for association studies. There was difference in genotype in tissue samples paired with blood samples for rs4977756 polymorphism, suggesting the importance of tissue SNP status in association studies. These results show that these two polymorphisms may not contribute to risk for glioma in South Indian population. ",

In this study, we sought to stratify young adult glioblastomas by BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 mutations and examine the clinical relevance of the biomarkers. In 107 glioblastomas aged from 17 to 35 years, mutually exclusive BRAF-V600E (15%), H3F3A-K27M (15.9%), H3F3A-G34R/V (2.8%) and IDH1-R132H (16.8%) mutations were identified in over half of the cases. EGFR amplification and TERTp mutation were only detected in 3.7% and 8.4% in young adult glioblastomas, respectively. BRAF-V600E identified a clinically favorable subset of glioblastomas with younger age, frequent CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and was more amendable to surgical resection. H3F3A-K27M mutated glioblastomas were tightly associated with midline locations and showed dismal prognosis. IDH1-R132H was associated with older age and favorable outcome. Interestingly, tumors with positive PDGFRA immunohistochemical expression exhibited poorer prognosis and identified an aggressive subset of tumors among K27M mutated glioblastomas. Combining BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 mutations allowed stratification of young adult glioblastomas into four prognostic subgroups. In summary, our study demonstrates the clinical values of stratifying young adult glioblastomas with BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 mutations, which has important implications in refining prognostic classification of glioblastomas.",

We have investigated the status of the gene family in the southern platyfish X. maculatus. Xiphophorus harbors at least two such loci, which we now term CDKN2A/B and CDKN2D. Both loci map to Xiphophorus linkage group 5, a genomic area that has long been known to harbor the DIFF tumor suppressor locus. Within this report, we report on the complete cloning, genomic exon/intron boundary delineation, linkage mapping and expressional characteristics of Xiphophorus CDKN2D. We also compare and contrast this expression to that of the previously isolated CDKN2AB locus in normal and neoplastic tissues derived from non-hybrid and hybrid fishes. The hypothetical evolutionary relationships of gene family members and their involvement in melanoma is evaluated.

A penalized regression approach was used to discover those SNP markers that most parsimoniously explain the observed association in each genomic region. For the majority of the regions, the signal is best explained by a single SNP, which sometimes, as in the tyrosinase region, is a known functional variant. However in five regions the explanation is more complex. At the CDKN2A locus, for example, there is strong evidence that not only multiple SNPs but also multiple genes are involved.

The reasons for the rate of increase are not known; increasing sun and UV exposure, however, is the major hypothesized explanation. In the past several years, two major susceptibility genes for melanoma, CDKN2A and CDK4, have been identified, but the two genes together account for a minority of familial melanoma. Other high-risk susceptibility genes are being sought actively. Genetic epidemiologic studies suggest that penetrance of each of the two identified genes is altered by other factors, either genetic or environmental. Epidemiologic studies have also identified other major host factors important in the development of melanoma. In European, North American, and Australian populations, the presence of clinically identified dysplastic nevi confers greatly increased risk of melanoma. A new measure of sun exposure, based on individual residential history, confers substantially increased risk of melanoma. Recent surveys of sun behavior in the US reveal extensive sunburning and use of tanning beds in adolescents and adults.

Retinoblastoma is initiated by RB gene mutations, but the subsequent cooperating mutational events leading to tumorigenesis are poorly characterized.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization studies revealed deletions in the CDKN2A locus that include ARF and P16INK4A, both of which encode tumor suppressor proteins, in both human and mouse retinoblastoma. Through mouse genetic analyses, we found that Arf was the critical tumor suppressor gene in the deleted region. In mice, inactivation of one allele of Arf cooperated with Rb and p107 loss to rapidly accelerate retinoblastoma, with frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Arf locus. Arf has been reported to exhibit p53-independent tumor suppressor roles in other systems; however, our results showed no additive effect of p53 and Arf coinactivation in promoting retinoblastoma. Moreover, p53 inactivation completely eliminated any selection for Arf LOH.

In this article, we propose a new approach named TAGCNA for identifying SCEs in somatic CNAs that may encompass cancer driver genes. TAGCNA employs a peel-off permutation scheme to generate a reasonable null distribution based on a prior step of selecting tag CNA markers from the genome being considered. We demonstrate the statistical power of TAGCNA on simulated ground truth data, and validate its applicability using two publicly available cancer datasets: lung and prostate adenocarcinoma. TAGCNA identifies SCEs that are known to be involved with proto-oncogenes (e.g. EGFR, CDK4) and tumor suppressor genes (e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN2B), and provides many additional SCEs with potential biological relevance in these data.

The Lynch syndrome is discussed as a clinical model wherein the presence of mismatch repair mutations provides a high level of diagnostic certainty for the initiation of targeted cancer screening and management. The familial atypical multiple mole melanoma-pancreatic cancer (FAMMM-PC) syndrome, on the other hand, provides another model with cancer-control potential. Given its phenotypic features of multiple atypical nevi, high total body mole count and cutaneous malignant melanoma, coupled with the integral association of PC in a subset of FAMMM kindreds with the CDKN2A germline mutation, this may result in a perhaps lower level of diagnostic certainty when compared with the Lynch syndrome.

Both MSI-high and CIMP-high were associated with cyclin D1 overexpression (P < 0.0001). After tumours were stratified by MSI and CIMP status, the relationship between MSI-high and cyclin D1 persisted (P < or = 0.02), whereas the relationship between CIMP-high and cyclin D1 did not. Cyclin D1 overexpression was correlated with BRAF mutation (P = 0.0001), p27 loss (P = 0.0007) and p16 loss (P = 0.02), and inversely with p53 expression (P = 0.0002) and p21 loss (P < 0.0001). After stratification by MSI status, the inverse relationship between cyclin D1 and p21 loss still persisted (P < 0.008).;Cyclin D1 activation is associated with MSI and inversely with p21 loss in colorectal cancers. Cyclin D1 may play an important role in the development of MSI-high tumours, independent of CIMP status.",

In such situations, essential information is missed if the methylation detection is purely qualitative. We describe a new probe-free quantitative methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay that incorporates evaluation of the amplicon by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Depending on amplicon design, different types of information can be obtained from the HRM analysis. Much of this information cannot be obtained by electrophoretic analysis. In particular, identification of false positives due to incomplete bisulphite conversion or false priming is possible. Heterogeneous methylation can also be distinguished from homogeneous methylation. As proof of principle, we have developed assays for the promoter regions of the CDH1, DAPK1, CDKN2A (p16(INK4a)) and RARB genes. We show that highly accurate quantification is possible in the range from 100% to 0.1% methylated template when 25 ng of bisulphite-modified DNA is used as a template for PCR.

In this study, we describe the generation and phenotypes of Phc2-deficient mice. We show posterior transformations of the axial skeleton and premature senescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts associated with derepression of Hox cluster genes and Cdkn2a genes, respectively. Synergistic actions of a Phc2 mutation with Phc1 and Rnf110 mutations during A-P specification, coimmunoprecipitation of their products from embryonic extracts, and chromatin immunoprecipitation by anti-Phc2 monoclonal antibodies suggest that Hox repression by Phc2 is mediated through the class II PcG complexes, probably via direct binding to the Hox locus. The genetic interactions further reveal the functional overlap between Phc2 and Phc1 and a strict dose-dependent requirement during A-P specification and embryonic survival.

This study was undertaken to explore CpG methylation abnormalities in an extended tumor panel and assess possible relationships between metastatic disease and mutation status. CpG methylation was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing for selected TSG promoters and LINE1 repeats. Methylation indices above normal reference were observed for DCR2 (TNFRSF10D), CDH1, P16 (CDKN2A), RARB, and RASSF1A. Z-scores for overall TSG, and individual TSG methylation levels, but not LINE1, were significantly correlated with metastatic disease, paraganglioma, disease predisposition, or outcome. Most strikingly, P16 hypermethylation was strongly associated with SDHB mutation as opposed to RET/MEN2, VHL/VHL, or NF1-related disease. Parallel analyses of constitutional, tumor, and metastasis DNA implicate an order of events where constitutional SDHB mutations are followed by TSG hypermethylation and 1p loss in primary tumors, later transferred to metastatic tissue. In the combined material, P16 hypermethylation was prevalent in SDHB-mutated samples and was associated with short disease-related survival. The findings verify the previously reported importance of P16 and other TSG hypermethylation in an independent tumor series. Furthermore, a constitutional SDHB mutation is proposed to predispose for an epigenetic tumor phenotype occurring before the emanation of clinically recognized malignancy.",

To understand the genetic events that contribute to relapse and chemoresistance and identify novel targets of therapy, 3 high-throughput assays were used to identify genetic and epigenetic changes at relapse. Using matched diagnosis/relapse bone marrow samples from children with relapsed B-precursor ALL, we evaluated gene expression, copy number abnormalities (CNAs), and DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis revealed a signature of differentially expressed genes from diagnosis to relapse that is different for early (< 36 months) and late (≥ 36 months) relapse. CNA analysis discovered CNAs that were shared at diagnosis and relapse and others that were new lesions acquired at relapse. DNA methylation analysis found increased promoter methylation at relapse. There were many genetic alterations that evolved from diagnosis to relapse, and in some cases these genes had previously been associated with chemoresistance. Integration of the results from all 3 platforms identified genes of potential interest, including CDKN2A, COL6A2, PTPRO, and CSMD1.

Seventy-six percent of cases showed genomic aberrations. The most common imbalances were gains of 7q33.3q35 followed by 17q21.1, 8q24.21, 9q34qter, and 10p14 and losses of 9p21.3 followed by 9q31.2, 17p13.1, 13q14.11, 6q21.3, 10p11.22, 16q23.2, and 16q24.3. Three specific chromosomal regions, 9p21.3, 8q24.21, and 10q26qter, were defined as prognostic markers showing a significant correlation with overall survival (OS) (P=0.042, 0.017, and 0.022, respectively). Moreover, we have established two MFt genomic subgroups distinguishing a stable group (0-5 DNA aberrations) and an unstable group (>5 DNA aberrations), showing that the genomic unstable group had a shorter OS (P=0.05). We therefore conclude that specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as gains of 8q24.21 (MYC) and losses of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP) and 10q26qter (MGMT and EBF3) may have an important role in prognosis.

Primary MD-gene defects and strain background strongly influence sarcoma incidence, latency, localization, and gender prevalence. Combined loss of dystrophin and dysferlin, as well as dystrophin and calpain-3, leads to accelerated tumor formation. Irrespective of the primary gene defects, all MD sarcomas share non-random genomic alterations including frequent losses of tumor suppressors (Cdkn2a, Nf1), amplification of oncogenes (Met, Jun), recurrent duplications of whole chromosomes 8 and 15, and DNA damage. Remarkably, these sarcoma-specific genetic lesions are already regularly present in skeletal muscles in aged MD mice even prior to sarcoma development. Accordingly, we show also that skeletal muscle from human muscular dystrophy patients is affected by gross genomic instability, represented by DNA double-strand breaks and age-related accumulation of aneusomies.

In addition, increased risks were found for cancers of the lip, mouth and pharynx (RR 18.8; 95% CI 6.05-58.2) and respiratory tumours (RR 4.56; 95% CI 1.71-12.1). Current smokers developed significantly more cancers of the lip, mouth and pharynx, respiratory system and pancreas compared with former and never-smokers. In conclusion, this study shows that carriers of a p16-Leiden variant have an increased risk of developing various types of cancer, and smoking significantly increases the risk of frequently occurring cancers. Smoking cessation should be an integral part of the management of p16-Leiden variant carriers. ",

Eight were high-grade oligodendroglial tumors, and four were glioblastoma. They were characterized for their genetic alterations, including those considered as \"early\" alterations, namely loss of chromosome 1 +/- loss of chromosome 19q, TP53 mutation, and those considered as \"late\" alterations, namely loss of chromosome 10, loss of chromosome 9p, EGFR genomic amplification, PTEN mutation, CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and telomerase reactivation. Chemosensitivity of xenografts to four alkylating agents, temozolomide (42 mg/kg, days 1-5, p.o.), 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (5 mg/kg, day 1, i.p.), Ifosfamide (90 mg/kg, days 1-3, i.p.), and carboplatin (66 mg/kg, day 1, i.p.) was tested by administration of drugs to tumor-bearing mice. Although each tumor presented an individual response pattern, glioblastoma had a lower chemosensitivity than oligodendrogliomas, and temozolomide was the most effective drug. Deletion of 1p +/- 19q was associated with higher chemosensitivity, whereas late molecular alterations, particularly EGFR amplification, were associated with chemoresistance. These results suggest that the combined use of histology and molecular markers should eventually be helpful selecting the most appropriate agents for treatment of malignant oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas.",

We report a case of a 67-year-old male with a diagnosis of a superficial spreading melanoma (stage IB) rendered 6 years earlier who presented clinically with an atypical nevus on his left thigh. Histopathological examination showed an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation that was interpreted as melanoma in situ. Subsequently, 45 additional pigmented macules appeared in crops over a 9-month period. Clinically and dermoscopically, these lesions were extremely polymorphic. Histopathological findings were compatible with melanoma in situ, as each lesion consisted of a wholly intraepidermal proliferation of markedly atypical melanocytes arranged singly and in nests. A complete gastrointestinal study showed multiple pigmented metastatic lesions throughout the stomach and small bowel, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with gastrointestinal and epidermotropic skin involvement. Monosomy of chromosome 9 and a BRAF V600E mutation were detected in the primary tumor sample and in macro-dissected secondary lesions. No CDKN2A or CDK4 germline mutations were found. Intraepidermal epidermotropic metastases of melanoma have been rarely described in literature.

The QMSP analyses showed that PTGS2 (100.0%), SFN (100.0%), CDKN2B (90.2%), CDH1 (88.2%), ESR1 (72.5%), HIC1 (70.5%), CCND2 (62.7%), DCC (45.1%) and TGFbetaR2 (39.2%) are frequently hypermethylated in MM while aberrant methylation of RARbeta (16.6%), MGMT (12.5%), AIM1 (12.5%), CDKN2A (8.3%), SOCS1 (8.3%), CCNA1 (8.3%) and THBS1 (4.1%) are rare events. There was no methylation of GSTP1, MINT31, p14ARF and RB1 in the samples tested. Hypermethylation of ESR1 was correlated positively with isotype IgA, while aberrant methylation of THBS1 correlated negatively with isotype IgG. Furthermore, hypermethylation of DCC and TGFbetaR2 were correlated with poor survival. The multivariate analysis showed ISS and TGFbetaR2 hypermethylation strongly correlated with poor outcome. This study represents the first quantitative evaluation of promoter methylation in MM and our data provide evidence that TGFbetaR2 hypermethylation, besides ISS, may be useful as prognostic indicator in this disease.",

While somatically acquired DNA methylation changes have been associated with UADT cancers, what triggers these events and precise epigenetic targets are poorly understood. In this study, we applied quantitative profiling of DNA methylation states in a panel of cancer-associated genes to a case-control study of UADT cancers. Our analyses revealed a high frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of several genes, including MYOD1, CHRNA3 and MTHFR in UADT tumors, whereas CDKN2A was moderately hypermethylated. Among differentially methylated genes, we identified a new gene (the nicotinic acetycholine receptor gene) as target of aberrant hypermethylation in UADT cancers, suggesting that epigenetic deregulation of nicotinic acetycholine receptors in non-neuronal tissues may promote the development of UADT cancers. Importantly, we found that sex and age is strongly associated with the methylation states, whereas tobacco smoking and alcohol intake may also influence the methylation levels in specific genes. This study identifies aberrant DNA methylation patterns in UADT cancers and suggests a potential mechanism by which environmental factors may deregulate key cellular genes involved in tumor suppression and contribute to UADT cancers.",

Monocytes can polarize toward classically (CAMϕ) or alternatively (AAMϕ) activated macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of these phenotypes are not well defined. Here, we show that p16(INK4a) deficiency (p16(-/-)) modulates the macrophage phenotype. Transcriptome analysis revealed that p16(-/-) BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) exhibit a phenotype resembling IL-4-induced macrophage polarization. In line with this observation, p16(-/-) BMDMs displayed a decreased response to classically polarizing IFNγ and LPS and an increased sensitivity to alternative polarization by IL-4. Furthermore, mice transplanted with p16(-/-) BM displayed higher hepatic AAMϕ marker expression levels on Schistosoma mansoni infection, an in vivo model of AAMϕ phenotype skewing. Surprisingly, p16(-/-) BMDMs did not display increased IL-4-induced STAT6 signaling, but decreased IFNγ-induced STAT1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IKKα,β phosphorylation. This decrease correlated with decreased JAK2 phosphorylation and with higher levels of inhibitory acetylation of STAT1 and IKKα,β. These findings identify p16(INK4a) as a modulator of macrophage activation and polarization via the JAK2-STAT1 pathway with possible roles in inflammatory diseases.",

Specifically based on the co-occurrence of these aberrations we built a model for the timing of the different events and their exact nature (hemi- → homozygous loss; low-level gain → (high-copy) amplification) in the course of molecular progression. The mutation status of IDH1 and TP53 was also evaluated and shown to correlate with the level of molecular progression. The relevance of the proposed model was confirmed by analysis of 36 sets of gliomas and their 39 recurrence(s) whereas survival analysis for anaplastic gliomas confirmed the actual prognostic relevance of detecting molecular malignancy. Moreover, based on our results, molecular diagnostic analysis of 1p/19q can be further improved as different aberrations were identified, some of them being indicative for advanced molecular malignancy rather than for favorable tumor behavior. In conclusion, identification of molecular malignancy as proposed will aid in establishing a risk profile for individual patients and thereby in therapeutic decision making.",

A test is needed that allows simultaneous detection of multiple changes and that is widely applicable in a routine diagnostic setting. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) allows detection of DNA copy number changes of up to 45 loci in one relatively simple, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction-based assay. To assess the applicability of MLPA, we performed MLPA analysis to detect relevant genetic markers in a spectrum of 88 gliomas. The vast majority of these tumors (n = 79) were previously characterized by comparative genomic hybridization. With MLPA kit P088 (78 cases), complete and partial loss of 1p and 19q were reliably identified, even in samples containing only 50% tumor DNA. Distinct 1p deletions exist with different clinically prognostic consequences, and in contrast to the commonly used diagnostic strategies (loss of heterozygosity or fluorescent in situ hybridization 1p36), P088 allows detection of such distinct 1p losses. Combining P088 with P105 will further increase the accurate prediction of clinical behavior because this kit identified markers (EGFR, PTEN, and CDKN2A) of high-grade malignancy in 41 cases analyzed.

A few years later cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was also identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene. The technologic advances have allowed the identification of new genes involved in melanoma susceptibility: Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) associated protein 1 (BAP1), CXC genes, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), protection of telomeres 1 (POT1), ACD and TERF2IP, the latter four being involved in telomere maintenance. Furthermore variants in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) give a moderately increased risk to develop melanoma. Melanoma genetic counseling is offered to families in order to better understand the disease and the genetic susceptibility of developing it. Genetic counseling often implies genetic testing, although patients can benefit from genetic counseling even when they do not fulfill the criteria for these tests. Genetic testing for melanoma predisposition mutations can be used in clinical practice under adequate selection criteria and giving a valid test interpretation and genetic counseling to the individual.
