        "Doc_abstract":"Genetic alteration is the driving force for thyroid tumorigenesis and progression, based upon which novel approaches to the management of thyroid cancer can be developed. A recent important genetic finding in thyroid cancer is the oncogenic T1799A transversion mutation of BRAF (the gene for the B-type Raf kinase, BRAF). Since the initial report of this mutation in thyroid cancer 2 years ago, rapid advancements have been made. BRAF mutation is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer, occurring in about 45% of sporadic papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), particularly in the relatively aggressive subtypes, such as the tall-cell PTC. This mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role, as demonstrated by transgenic mouse studies that showed BRAF mutation-initiated development of PTC and its transition to anaplastic thyroid cancer. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with RET/PTC rearrangement, and also displays a reciprocal age association with this common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer. The T1799A BRAF mutation occurs exclusively in PTC and PTC-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer and is a specific diagnostic marker for this cancer when identified in cytological and histological specimens. This mutation is associated with a poorer clinicopathological outcome and is a novel independent molecular prognostic marker in the risk evaluation of thyroid cancer. Moreover, preclinical and clinical evaluations of the therapeutic value of novel specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors in thyroid cancer are anticipated. This newly discovered BRAF mutation may prove to have an important impact on thyroid cancer in the clinic.",

In vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated that overexpression of activated BRAF induces malignant transformation and aggressive tumour behaviour. BRAF and other RAF kinases are frequently activated by other thyroid oncogenes and are important mediators of their biological effects including dedifferentiation and proliferation. Because current therapeutic options for patients with thyroid cancers that are aggressive and/or do not respond to standard therapies are limited, BRAF and its downstream effectors represent attractive therapeutic targets. In this review, data supporting a role for BRAF activation in thyroid cancer development and establishing the potential therapeutic efficacy of BRAF-targeted agents in patients with thyroid cancer will be reviewed.",

BRAF is the only member of the RAF family activated by mutation in human cancers. A single amino acid substitution (V600E) accounts for a multitude of human cancers, which causes constitutive kinase activity. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and papillary-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), the BRAF(V600E) mutation promotes follicular cell transformation. The BRAF(V600E)mutation could provide valuable prognostic information for thyroid cancer, because this mutation has been correlated with more aggressive and iodine-resistant phenotypes. Evidence has also shown that the detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in cancer is crucial in order to identify novel avenues for thyroid cancer treatment.Based on the BRAF kinase structure, novel drugs can potentially be designed to target oncogenic BRAF in cancer therapeutics. This review will focus on the recent progress in understandingthe functions of BRAF, the role of the BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma, and the correlation between BRAF mutations and cancer microenvironment.

However, the frequency of this mutation in several other types of thyroid neoplasms was not thoroughly investigated. In the present study, in addition to PTC, we evaluated various thyroid tumor types for the most common BRAF T1796A mutation by direct genomic DNA sequencing. We found a high and similar frequency (45%) of the BRAF T1796A mutation in two geographically distinct PTC patient populations: one composed of sporadic cases from North America, and the other from Kiev, Ukraine, that included individuals who were exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident. In contrast, we found BRAF mutation in only 20% of anaplastic thyroid cancers and no mutation in medullary thyroid cancers and benign thyroid hyperplasia. We also confirmed previous reports that the BRAF T1796A mutation did not occur in benign thyroid adenomas and follicular thyroid cancers. Specific analysis of the Ukraine patients with confirmed history of radiation exposure failed to show a higher incidence of BRAF mutation. Our results suggest that frequent occurrence of BRAF mutation is inherently associated with PTC, irrespective of geographic origin, and is apparently not a radiation-susceptible mutation. The lack or low prevalence of BRAF mutation in other thyroid neoplasms is consistent with the notion that other previously defined genetic alterations on the same signaling pathway are sufficient to cause tumorigenesis in most thyroid neoplasms.",

Twenty five consecutive patients operated for benign nodules and for papillary carcinoma were prospectively included. Fresh tissue samples of thyroid nodules and of adjacent thyroid parenchyma were obtained. DNA was extracted and amplified by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS PCR). Direct sequencing was performed in four samples. Of those patients operated for papillary thyroid cancer, 77% harbored BRAF mutation. All samples from adjacent thyroid parenchyma and from patients operated for benign nodules tested negative for the mutation. Direct sequencing confirmed the results obtained by ARMS PCR. Patients with BRAF mutation were significantly older at the time of diagnosis (BRAF+ 47.7 ± 12.7 years vs. BRAF- 24.7 ± 8.1 years, p < 0.01). Nine out of ten papillary carcinomas with BRAF mutation corresponded to the classic histological subtype, which was not observed in BRAF negative tumors (p < 0.02).

However, BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer is relatively resistant to vemurafenib, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear. Anti-cancer therapy induced autophagy can trigger adaptive drug resistance in a variety of cancer types and treatments. To date, role of autophagy during BRAF inhibition in thyroid cancer remains unknown.;In this study, we investigate if autophagy is activated in vemurafenib treated BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells, and whether autophagy inhibition improves or impairs the treatment efficacy of vemurafenib.;Autophagy level was determined by western blot assay and transmission electron microscopy. The combined effects of autophagy inhibitor and vemurafenib were assessed in terms of cell viability in vitro and tumor growth rate in vivo. Whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was in response to vemurafenib-induced autophagy was also analyzed.;Vemurafenib induced a high level of autophagy in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy by either a pharmacological inhibitor or interfering RNA knockdown of essential autophagy genes augmented vemurafenib-induced cell death. Vemurafenib-induced autophagy was independent of MAPK signaling pathway and was mediated through the ER stress response. Finally, administration of vemurafenib with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine promoted more pronounced tumor suppression in vivo.;Our data demonstrate that vemurafenib induces ER stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib.",

So, the main aim of the study was to elucidate the involvement of BRAF gene mutations and its expression in Kashmiri (North India) patients and investigate their association with clinico-pathological characteristics. Mutational analysis of BRAF gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing, whereas analysis of BRAF protein expression was done by western blotting. Overall mutations in BRAF was found to be 25% (15 of 60) and all of them were transversions (T>A) affecting codon 600 (valine to glutamine), restricted only to papillary thyroid cancer and well-differentiated grade. Patients with well-differentiated disease and in particular elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were significantly associated with BRAF mutations (P < 0.05). Overall, 90% (54 of 60) of thyroid cancer cases showed increased expression of BRAF and non-smokers being significantly associated with BRAF over-expression. Totally, 86.7% (13 of 15) of BRAF mutation-positive patients were having over-expression of BRAF protein, whereas 91.2% (41 of 45) of patients with wild-type BRAF status were having over-expressed BRAF protein (P > 0.05). We conclude that both mutational events as well as over-expression of BRAF gene is highly implicated in pathogenesis of thyroid cancer and the BRAF protein over-expression is independent of the BRAF mutational status of thyroid cancer patients.

Unlike its high treatment response to selective BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) in metastatic melanoma, the treatment response in thyroid cancer is reported to be low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the resistance mechanism responsible for this low treatment response to BRAF inhibitor in order to maximize the effect of targeted therapy. We examined the expression of feedback regulation mechanisms and alterations in the upper signal transduction pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAF mutation. Also, we investigated the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid cancer cell lines, 8505C (anaplastic thyroid cancer) and BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) were selected and treated with PLX4032 and its drug sensitivity were examined and compared. Further investigation on the changes in signals responsible for the different treatment response to PLX4032 was carried out and the same experiment was performed on orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, 8505C cells presented drug resistance to PLX4032 treatment and this was mainly due to increased expression of c-Met. Effective inhibitions of c-Met, p-AKT, and p-ERK were achieved after dual treatment with BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752). Similar results were confirmed by in vivo study with orthotopic xenograft mouse model. c-Met-mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway contributes to the relative insensitivity of BRAF (V600E) mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to PLX4032.

Here, we show that BRAF depletion by siRNA or inhibition of its activity by treatment with BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 decreases migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells expressing oncogenic (V600E)BRAF through a MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism, since treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 exerts the same effect. Moreover, over-expression of (V600E)BRAF increases migration and invasion of wild-type BRAF thyroid cells. Using the same strategies, we demonstrate that these effects are mediated by upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Snail with a concomitant decrease of its target E-cadherin, both hallmarks of EMT.

The possibility of using inhibitors on the BRAF pathway as became an interesting therapeutic approach. In thyroid cancer cells the target molecules, implicated on the cellular effects, mediated by inhibition of BRAF are not well established. In order to fill this lack of knowledge we studied the proliferation and survival pathways and associated molecules induced by BRAF inhibition in thyroid carcinoma cell lines harbouring distinct genetic backgrounds.;Suppression of BRAF pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C, TPC1 and C643) was achieved using RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF and the kinase inhibitor, sorafenib. Proliferation analysis was performed by BrdU incorporation and apoptosis was accessed by TUNEL assay. Levels of protein expression were analysed by western-blot.;Both BRAF RNAi and sorafenib inhibited proliferation in all the cell lines independently of the genetic background, mostly in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation. In BRAF(V600E) mutated cells inhibition of BRAF pathway lead to a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels and an increase in p27(Kip1). Specific inhibition of BRAF by RNAi in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation had no effect on apoptosis. In the case of sorafenib treatment, cells harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed increase levels of apoptosis due to a balance of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2.;Our results in thyroid cancer cells, namely those harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed that BRAF signalling pathway provides important proliferation signals. We have shown that in thyroid cancer cells sorafenib induces apoptosis by affecting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in BRAF(V600E) mutated cells which was independent of BRAF. These results suggest that sorafenib may prove useful in the treatment of thyroid carcinomas, particularly those refractory to conventional treatment and harbouring BRAF mutations.",

In this study, we hypothesized that histone deacetylation at the NIS (SLC5A5) promoter was the mechanism. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we examined histone acetylation status on the lysine residues H3K9/14, H3K18, total H4, and H4K16 at the NIS promoter under the influence of BRAF V600E. We found that expression of stably or transiently transfected BRAF V600E inhibited NIS expression while the deacetylase inhibitor SAHA stimulated NIS expression in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells. Although BRAF V600E enhanced global histone acetylation, it caused histone deacetylation at the NIS promoter while SAHA caused acetylation in the cells. In human thyroid cancer BCPAP cells harboring homozygous BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, and MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, increased histone acetylation of the NIS promoter, suggesting that BRAF V600E normally maintained histone in a deacetylated state at the NIS promoter. The regions most commonly affected with deacetylation by BRAF V600E were the transcriptionally active areas upstream of the translation start that contained important transcription factor binding sites, including nucleotides -297/-107 in the rat NIS promoter and -692/-370 in the human NIS promoter. Our findings not only reveal an epigenetic mechanism for BRAF V600E-promoted NIS silencing involving histone deacetylation at critical regulatory regions of the NIS promoter but also provide further support for our previously proposed combination therapy targeting major signaling pathways and histone deacetylase to restore thyroid gene expression for radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer.

Overexpression of CYP24A1, the primary vitamin D-inactivating enzyme, is also observed in a variety of human cancers, thus potentially neutralizing the antitumour effect of 1α, 25(OH)2 D3. This study investigates the expression of CYP24A1 and the effect of BRAF(V600E) on its expression in thyroid cancer.;We investigated 60 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) specimens for CYP24A1 expression and its association with BRAF mutation and disease progression. CYP24A1 expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR, and BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected by PCR-DNA sequencing analysis. The interaction between BRAF(V600E) and CYP24A1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR.;CYP24A1 expression was increased in PTC as compared to benign multinodular goitre. The expression was further increased in stage III and IV tumours. There is a strong correlation between CYP24A1 overexpression and BRAF(V600E) mutation (P < 0·01). In thyroid cancer cell lines expressing BRAF(V600E) , CYP24A1 expression was significantly higher when compared to those without BRAF(V600E) expression. BRAF(V600E) transgene expression in CAL62 cell line can induce CYP24A1 expression. Furthermore, BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 can significantly down-regulate CYP24A1 expression and enhance the antiproliferative effects of calcitriol in thyroid cancer cell lines.;CYP24A1 overexpression is a poor prognostic indicator for PTC and may reflect BRAF(V600E) mutation and MARK activation.

As a novel prognostic molecular marker, this mutation has received considerable attention in recent years for its potential utility in the risk stratification and management of PTC. In PTC, BRAF mutation is closely associated with extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stages, disease recurrence, and even patient mortality. Many of the responsible molecular derangements promoted by, or associated with, BRAF mutation have been identified, including over-expression of tumor-promoting genes, suppression of tumor-suppressor genes, and silencing of thyroid iodide-handling genes, resulting in impairment or loss of radioiodine avidity and hence the failure of radioiodine treatment of PTC. BRAF mutation can be readily tested on thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens, with high preoperative predictive probabilities for clinicopathological outcomes of PTC. As such, the knowledge of BRAF mutation status can facilitate more accurate risk stratification and better decision making at various steps in the management of PTC, from preoperative planning of initial surgical scale to postoperative decisions about appropriate radioiodine treatment and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, and to selections of appropriate surveillance modalities for PTC recurrence. The greatest utility of BRAF mutation status is in those cases where traditional clinicopathological criteria alone would otherwise be unreliable in the risk stratification and management of PTC. Use of this unique molecular marker, in conjunction with conventional clinicopathological risk factors, to assist the prognostication of PTC is likely to improve the efficiency of contemporary management of thyroid cancer.",

Activated AMPK inhibits the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby reducing the extent of protein translation and suppressing both cell growth and cell cycle entry. Recent reports indicate that AMPK-mediated growth inhibition is achieved via an action of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in melanoma cells harboring the V600E mutant form of the BRAF oncogene. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of AICAR by measuring its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression of BRAF wild-type and V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. We also explored the mechanism underlying these effects. AICAR inhibited the proliferation of BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines more strongly than was the case with wild-type cell lines. The suppressive effect of AICAR on cell proliferation was associated with increased S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, AICAR suppressed phosphorylation of ERK and p70S6K in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cells, but rather increased phosphorylation in wild-type cells. Together, the results indicate that AICAR-induced AMPK activation in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in increases in apoptosis and S-phase arrest via downregulation of ERK and p70S6K activity. Thus, regulation of AMPK activity may be potentially useful as a therapy for thyroid cancer if the cancer harbors a BRAF V600E mutation.",

However, in PTC without RASSF1A methylation, the regulatory mechanisms of RASSF1A-MST1 pathways remain to be elucidated, and the functional cooperation or cross regulation between BRAF(V600E) and MST1,which activates Foxo3,has not been investigated.;The negative regulators of the cell cycle, p21 and p27, are strongly induced by transcriptional activation of FoxO3 in BRAF(V600E) positive thyroid cancer cells. The FoxO3 transactivation is augmented by RASSF1A and the MST1 signaling pathway. Interestingly, introduction of BRAF(V600E)markedly abolished FoxO3 transactivation and resulted in the suppression of p21 and p27 expression. The suppression of FoxO3 transactivation by BRAF(V600E)is strongly increased by coexpression of MST1 but it is not observed in the cells in which MST1, but not MST2,is silenced. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E)was able to bind to the C-terminal region of MST1 and resulted in the suppression of MST1 kinase activities. The induction of the G1-checkpoint CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27,by the RASSF1A-MST1-FoxO3 pathway facilitates cellular apoptosis, whereas addition of BRAF(V600E) inhibits the apoptotic processes through the inactivation of MST1. Transgenic induction of BRAF(V600E)in the thyroid gland results in cancers resembling human papillary thyroid cancers.

Some investigators have suggested that the increased incidence is because of increased detection of small primary tumors as a result of diagnostic scrutiny. Conversely, some investigators have demonstrated an increased incidence across all tumor sizes, suggesting that other factors may play a role. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical, pathologic, and molecular changes present in papillary thyroid cancer over a 15-year period during which the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer doubled.;A total of 628 patients with conventional papillary thyroid cancer and 228 tumor samples from a single institution were analyzed from 1991 to 2005. Time-trend analyses of demographic, clinical, pathologic, and tumor genotype were performed over three 5-year time periods: group I (1991-1995), group II (1996-2000), and group III (2001-2005).;The authors found no differences in age, sex, ethnicity, primary tumor size, rate of extrathyroidal invasion, or overall TNM cancer stage among the 3 time groups. The rate of BRAF V600E mutation was significantly higher in group III (88% BRAF V600E positive) as compared with groups I and II (51% and 43%, respectively) (P < .001). The rate of all the common somatic mutations was also significantly higher in group III (92% positive) as compared with groups I and II (68% and 64%, respectively) (P < .002).;The rate of BRAF V600E mutation increased significantly over a 15-year period at the authors' institution.

Mutant BRAF has constitutive kinase activity and causes hyperactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. BRAF silencing induces regression of melanoma xenografts, indicating the essential role of BRAF for cell survival. We set up an inducible short hairpin RNA system to compare the role of oncogenic BRAF in thyroid carcinoma versus melanoma cells. Although BRAF knockdown led to apoptosis in the melanoma cell line A375, the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell ARO underwent growth arrest upon silencing, with little or no cell death. Reexpression of the thyroid differentiation marker, sodium iodide symporter, was induced after long-term silencing. The different outcome of BRAF down-regulation in the two cell lines was associated with an opposite regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression levels in response to the block of the BRAF mitogenic signal. These results were confirmed using a specific BRAF small-molecule inhibitor, PLX4032. Restoration of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression rescued melanoma cells from death. Altogether, our data indicate that oncogenic BRAF inhibition can have a different effect on cell fate depending on the cellular type. Furthermore, we suggest that a BRAF-independent mechanism of cell survival exists in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.",

We evaluated the relationship between BRAF((V600E)) and tumor, host, and environmental factors in PTCs from all geographical areas of Sicily. By PCR, BRAF((V600E)) was investigated in a series of 323 PTCs diagnosed in 2002-2005. The correlation between clinicopathological tumor, host, and environmental characteristics and the presence of BRAF((V600E)) were evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. BRAF((V600E)) was found in 38.6% PTCs, with a 52% frequency in the classical PTCs and 26.4% in the tall cell variant. Univariate analysis indicated that BRAF((V600E)) was associated with greater tumor size (P=0.0048), extra-thyroid invasion (P<0.0001), and cervical lymph nodal metastases (P=0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that BRAF((V600E)) was an independent predictor of extra-thyroid invasion (P=0.0001) and cervical lymph nodal metastasis (P=0.0005). The association between BRAF((V600E)) and extra-thyroid invasion was also found in micro-PTCs (P=0.006). In 60 classical PTCs, BRAF((V600E)) was positively correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression (P=0.0047), suggesting a possible mechanism for BRAF((V600E)) effect on PTC invasiveness. No association was found between BRAF((V600E)) and patient age, gender, or iodine intake. In contrast, a strong association was found with residency in Eastern Sicily (P<0.0001 compared with Western Sicily). These results indicate that BRAF((V600E)) mutation is a marker of aggressive disease in both micro- and macro-PTCs.

They include BRAF(V600E) and AKT that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. They can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. Humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. In addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic effects of treatments. So far, human thyroid cancer in vivo models were mainly used to test single compounds, non selective and selective. Despite the greater antitumor activity and lower toxicity obtained with different selective drugs in respect to non-selective ones, most of them are only able to delay disease progression, which ultimately could restart with similar aggressive behavior. Aggressive thyroid tumors (for example, anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) carry several complex genetic alterations that are likely cooperating to promote disease progression and might confer resistance to single-compound approaches. Orthotopic models of human thyroid cancer also hold the potential to be good models for testing novel combinatorial therapies. In this article, we will summarize results on preclinical testing of selective and nonselective single compounds in orthotopic mouse models based on validated human thyroid cancer cell lines harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation or with wild-type BRAF. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential use of this model also for combinatorial approaches, which are expected to take place in the upcoming human thyroid cancer basic and clinical research.",

To answer this question, the BRAF(V600E) mutational status of individual tumor foci was examined. This approach was justified because in the Korean population a high proportion (65%) of papillary carcinomas harbor the BRAF mutation.;DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue samples of multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma and the BRAF exon 15 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The aim of the present study was to disclose the role of BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma development. Seventy-two thyroid tumors, including 60 PTCs, six follicular adenomas, five follicular carcinomas, and one anaplastic carcinoma, were studied. BRAF mutation screening focused on exon 15 and exon 11 of the gene by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis. Search of RET/PTC expression was conducted with the RT-PCR technique. The molecular genetic study of the BRAF gene showed the presence of a missense thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 1796, resulting in the V599E substitution, in 24 of 60 PTCs (40%), none of six follicular adenomas, and none of five follicular carcinomas or one anaplastic carcinoma. Moreover, nine of 60 PTCs (15%) presented RET/PTC expression. A genetico-clinical association analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutation and development of PTCs of the classic papillary histotype (P = 0.038). On the contrary, no link could be detected between expression of BRAF(V599E) and age at diagnosis, gender, dimension, and local invasiveness of the primary cancer, presence of lymph node metastases, tumor stage, and multifocality of the disease.

In PTC, this mutation itself is a poor prognostic sign independent of other clinicopathological characteristics.

The results show that BRAF(V600E) mutation rate was found in 39.45% of our patients. We observed that BRAF(V600E) mutation was significantly higher in men, in tumors larger than 1 cm in size, and in patients with classical PTC. Moreover, statistically significant correlations of BRAF(V600E) with indicators of tumor aggressiveness such as thyroid capsular invasion, multifocality, lymph node metastasis, and extrathyroidal spread were found. Patient groups below and over the age of 45 did not differ in mutation frequency.

U0126 also restored the expression of these genes in V600E BRAF-harboring PTC-derived NPA cells. Knockdown of BRAF by specific small interfering RNA restored expression of some of these genes in NPA cells. Luciferase reporter assay using thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor gene as a model showed that the promoter activity was modulated by the MAP kinase pathway. Promoter methylation in association with DNA methyltransferase expression played a role in gene silencing by MAP kinase pathway in NPA cells.;We showed the restorability of expression of thyroid iodide-metabolizing genes silenced by V600E BRAF, and linked this process to gene methylation in PTC cells.

Diagnostically, the BRAF(V600E)  mutation is a powerful molecular marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma and, quite possibly, hairy cell leukemia as well. Cancers with a BRAF mutation are generally more aggressive than their counterparts without the mutation. Importantly, mutant BRAF has been a highly attractive target for precision cancer therapy.

The TGFβ pathway is predicted to be regulated by miR-17-92 cluster microRNAs. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that inhibit target mRNA translation and have emerged as potent modulators of tumorigenesis. Although the BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most prevalent alteration in thyroid cancer, the impact of iodine intake on BRAF-mediated oncogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of high iodine on miR-17-92 transcriptional regulation and expression in thyroid cells expressing activated BRAF.;Rat thyroid follicular cells that conditionally express BRAF(V600E) under doxycycline stimulation (PC-BRAF(V600E)-6) were derived from the PCCl3 line. These cells were treated with doxycycline for two days, in the absence or presence of 10 μM sodium iodide. The thyroid cancer cell lines BCPAP and KTC2 were also analyzed. Expression of the miR-17-92 cluster and Notch1 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and expression of these genes was modulated by anti-miR or anti-Notch1 siRNAs transfection. Protein expression was assessed by Western blot. Luciferase assays were used to quantify Smad4 3'-UTR/miR-19 interaction and Notch signaling activation. TGFβ responsiveness was evaluated by cell cycle analysis of TGFβ-treated cells.;High iodine blocked BRAF(V600E)-induced upregulation of miR-17-92, including miR-19a/b. miR-17-92 promoter region analysis revealed a putative binding site for Hes1, a transcription factor responsive to Notch signaling. Notch-1 overexpression resulted in miR-19 upregulation in normal thyroid cells, while Notch-1 knockdown blocked BRAF-induced miR-19 expression. Moreover, in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, Notch-1 knockdown reduced miR-19. Expression of BRAF(V600E) decreased Smad4 protein in normal thyroid cells. Smad4 was validated as a miR-19 target by luciferase assays, which revealed reduced luminescence associated with miR-19 interaction in Smad4 3'-UTR. Iodine treatment restored Smad4 levels in BRAF-activated cells, resulting in enhanced G1-cell cycle arrest in response to TGFβ. Moreover, this effect was mimicked in papillary thyroid cancer cells treated with anti-miR-19.;High iodine abrogates BRAF(V600E)-induced activation of miR-19, a newly identified Smad4 regulator, through Notch pathway inhibition and restores responsiveness to TGFβ signaling. Our results indicate that iodine exerts protective effects in thyroid cells, attenuating acute BRAF oncogene-mediated microRNA deregulation.",

In thyroid carcinomas, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression was found increased in differentiated, poorly differentiated, medullary and anaplastic variants. Hypoxia represents the principal stimulus responsible for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha induction. Other nonhypoxic stimuli increase hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha synthesis through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in a cell-type-specific manner. We have previously shown the role of BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid cancer cells as a factor that facilitates tumor cell growth and progression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BRAF(V600E) mutation influences hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. We analyzed 27 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 13 of which presented BRAF(V600E) mutation. In tumor tissues, immunoreactivity for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was detected in the majority of analyzed BRAF(V600E) mutated cases. Transcriptional analyses revealed elevated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha levels with significant differences between wild-type and mutated group. A BRAF wild-type papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line and a BRAF(V600E) mutated papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line were selected to study the effects of BRAF mutation on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in vitro. Knockdown of mutant BRAF(V600E) or both the wild type and the BRAF(V600E) by RNA interference induced a significant reduction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression at mRNA and protein levels. Pharmacological inhibition of BRAF significantly reduces hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression levels in papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation. Our results suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha is expressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas and is regulated not only by hypoxia but also by BRAF(V600E)-mediated signaling pathway.",

Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was used for detection of promoter methylation while BRAF gene mutational status was analyzed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing in the same series of 60 thyroid tumor tissues.

The requirement for BRAF in RET/PTC-mediated MAPK activation and gene expression has not been tested functionally. There are three RAF isoforms: ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF. Compared with the others, ARAF is a much weaker stimulator of MAPK. To determine the key RAF isoform mediating RET/PTC-induced ERK phosphorylation, we stably transfected doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3-expressing thyroid PCCL3 cells with small interfering RNA vectors to induce selective knockdown of BRAF or CRAF. Conditional RET/PTC3 expression induced comparable ERK phosphorylation in CRAF knockdown and control cells but negligible ERK phosphorylation in BRAF knockdown cells. Selective knockdown of BRAF prevented RET/PTC-dependent down-regulation of the sodium iodide symporter, a gene that confers key biological effects of RET/PTC in PTCs. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed numerous RET/PTC-regulated genes showing requirement of BRAF for appropriate expression. These data indicate that BRAF is required for RET/PTC-induced MAPK activation in thyroid cells and support the notion that BRAF inactivation may be an attractive target for PTCs.",

Functionally, thyroid cancer cell motility in vitro is dependent on group 1 PAKs, particularly PAK1. In this study, we hypothesize that BRAF, a central kinase in PTC tumorigenesis and invasion, regulates thyroid cancer cell motility in part through PAK activation. Using three well-characterized human thyroid cancer cell lines, we demonstrated in all cell lines that BRAF knockdown reduced PAK phosphorylation of direct downstream targets. In contrast, inhibition of MEK activity either pharmacologically or with siRNA did not reduce PAK activity, indicating MEK is dispensable for PAK activity. Inhibition of cell migration through BRAF loss is rescued by overexpression of either constitutive active MEK1 or PAK1, demonstrating that both signaling pathways are involved in BRAF-regulated cell motility. To further characterize BRAF-PAK signaling, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that both exogenously overexpressed and endogenous PAK1 and BRAF co-localize and physically interact, and that this interaction was enhanced in mitosis. Finally, we demonstrated that acute induction of BRAFV600E expression in vivo in murine thyroid glands results in increased PAK expression and activity confirming a positive signaling relationship in vivo.

Testing for BRAF mutation is clinically useful in providing prognostic prediction and facilitating accurate diagnosis of PTC in thyroid fine-needle aspirate (FNA) samples.;This study assessed the correlation of cellularity with DNA yield and compared 2 technical platforms with different sensitivities in detection of BRAF mutation in cytologic specimens. Cellularity was evaluated based on groups of 10+ cells on a ThinPrep slide: 1+ (1-5 groups), 2+ (6-10 groups), 3+ (11-20 groups), and 4+ (> 20 groups). Genomic DNA was extracted from residual materials of thyroid FNAs after cytologic diagnosis.;Approximately 49% of thyroid FNA samples had low cellularity (1-2+). DNA yield is proportionate with increased cellularity and increased nearly 4-fold from 1+ to 4+ cellularity in cytologic samples. When applied to BRAF mutational assay, using a cutoff of 6 groups of follicular cells with 10+ cells per group, 96.7% of cases yielded enough DNA for at least one testing for BRAF mutation. Five specimens (11.6%) with lower cellularity did not yield sufficient DNA for duplicate testing. Comparison of Sanger sequencing to allele-specific polymerase chain reaction methods shows the latter confers better sensitivity in detection of BRAF mutation, especially in limited cytologic specimens with a lower percentage of malignant cells.;This study demonstrates that by using 6 groups of 10+ follicular cells as a cutoff, nearly 97% of thyroid FNA samples contain enough DNA for BRAF mutational assay. Careful selection of a molecular testing system with high sensitivity facilitates the successful conduction of molecular testing in limited cytologic specimens.

Furthermore, in TC cells the capability to metabolize iodine is frequently lost. SLC5A8 and SLC26A4 genes are both involved in the iodine metabolism, and SLC5A8 hypermethylation status is associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, which is the most frequent genetic event underlying the development of papillary TC. The aim of our study is the development of a new non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of TC based on cf-DNA, SLC5A8 and SLC26A4 hypermethylation, and BRAF(V600E) analysis.;cf-DNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in nine cases of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), 58 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC), five of synchronous medullary and follicular thyroid cancers (SMFC), 23 follicular adenomas (FA), 86 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). A control group of 19 healthy subjects was taken. Moreover, in the PTC group we analyze the state of hypermethylation of SLC5A8 and SLC26A4, BRAF(V600E) mutation, and their involvement in the loss of function of the thyroid.;cf-DNA showed a high ability to discriminate healthy individuals from cancer patients. cf-DNAALU83 and cf-DNAALU244 values were significantly correlated with the histological type of TC (P-value < 0.0001). A significant increase in the amount of cf-DNAALU83 and cf-DNAALU244 when methylation occurs was observed (P-value = 0.02). A correlation between BRAF(V600E) and cf-DNAALU244/ALU83 was also found (P-value = 0.02).;According to our experimental results, the panel including cf-DNA, SLC5A8 and SLC26A4 hypermethylation, and BRAF(V600E) analysis appears easy, reproducible, and non-invasive for the diagnosis on TC.

The amino acid substitution V600E accounts for 90% of all oncogenic BRAF mutations and is typically detected in classic PTCs, whereas other less frequent BRAF mutations seem to be associated with other PTC histotypes.;Screening for activating BRAF mutations in a series of 83 PTCs identified the most common V600E mutation in 39 cases (histologically, 38 classic PTCs and 1 sclerosing variant PTC) and a complex in-frame mutation involving amino acids V600-S605 in a stage III multicentric follicular variant PTC, occurring in a 50-year-old female patient, who was affected by hypothyroidism in autoimmune thyroiditis and had a family history of PTC and autoimmune thyroiditis. Since the identified BRAF mutation was novel in the literature, bioinformatic modeling was performed to predict its impact on BRAF activity. Although the mutation resulted in loss of a phosphorylation site in the activation loop of BRAF, it was predicted to increase BRAF kinase activity by mimicking an activating phosphorylation.;This study, which reports a new BRAF mutation, highlights the usefulness of bioinformatic modeling in the prediction of functional effects of new mutations and indicates that mutation-specific screening tests might miss some rare BRAF mutations. These facts should be taken into consideration in the molecular diagnosis of thyroid cancer and in the design of therapeutic protocols based on inhibitors of the BRAF pathway.",

To clarify this phenomenon, we analysed BRAF V600E mutation in 20 cases of anaplastic carcinoma and 13 accompanying differentiated carcinomas. Among twenty cases of anaplastic carcinomas, nine and four accompanied papillary and follicular carcinomas, respectively. BRAF V600E mutation was found in four (20%) cases.

In summary, BRAF V600E mutation was occasionally observed in anaplastic carcinomas with papillary carcinoma, and the low frequency of BRAF V600E mutation in anaplastic carcinoma was thought to be due to the low frequency of anaplastic carcinomas with papillary carcinoma.

The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs. However, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations.

These mutations have a significantly higher prevalence in aggressive thyroid tumors, including widely invasive oncocytic carcinomas, poorly differentiated carcinomas, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Interestingly, in some studies, TERT mutations were found to be more common in tumors with a BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, mutational analysis of TERT promoter mutations in thyroid tumors has not been previously performed for patients in Korea, where the BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is particularly prevalent. This study analyzed TERT promoter mutations in various thyroid tumors and examined their relationship with clinicopathologic factors and the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC cases.;Using 242 preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens (including 207 PTCs) with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of the biopsied thyroid nodules, the TERT promoter status (C228T and C250T) was analyzed, and the relationship with clinicopathologic factors and the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC cases was examined.;Of 242 patients, 14.5% (30/207), 26.7% (4/15), 50% (1/2), and 60% (2/5) of PTCs, follicular thyroid carcinomas, poorly differentiated carcinomas, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas harbored a TERT(C228T) mutation, respectively. The TERT(C228T) mutation was associated with recurrence (p = 0.03). However, no association with other clinicopathologic factors in PTC was found. Coexistence of TERT(C228T) and BRAF(V600E) mutations was found in 13.0% of PTCs and was significantly associated with older age and advanced stage compared with the group negative for either mutation. The TERT(C228T) mutation status was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 3.08 [confidence interval 1.042-9.079]; p = 0.042) in patients with PTC in multivariate analysis.;Identification of TERT promoter mutations in preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens may help in better characterizing the prognosis and triaging thyroid cancer patients for appropriate treatment.",

BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

Mice with thyroid-specific expression of Braf(V600E) (TPO-Braf(V600E)) develop PTC rapidly with high levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). It is unclear to what extent the elevated TSH contributes to tumor progression. To investigate the progression of Braf(V600E)-induced PTC (BVE-PTC) under normal TSH, we transplanted BVE-PTC tumors subcutaneously into nude and TPO-Braf(WT) mice. Regression of the transplanted tumors was observed in both nude and TPO-Braf(WT) mice. They were surrounded by heavy lymphocyte infiltration and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) was demonstrated by strong β-gal staining and absence of Ki-67 expression. In contrast, BVE-PTC transplants continued to grow when transplanted into TPO-Braf(V600E) mice. The expression of Trp53 was increased in tumor transplants undergoing OIS. Trp53 inactivation reversed OIS and enabled tumor transplants to grow in nude mice with characteristic cell morphology of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). PTC-to-ATC transformation was also observed in primary BVE-PTC tumors. ATC cells derived from Trp53 knockout tumors had increased PI3K/AKT signaling and became resistant to Braf(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720, which could be overcome by combined treatment of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and PLX4720. In conclusion, BVE-PTC progression could be contained via p53-dependent OIS and TSH is a major disruptor of this balance. Simultaneous targeting of both MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways offer a better therapeutic outcome against ATC. The current study reinforces the importance of rigorous control of serum TSH in PTC patients.

We examined the pattern of gene expression after activation of these oncoproteins in thyroid PCCL3 cells, with the goal of identifying pathways or gene subsets that may account for the phenotypic differences observed in human cancers. We hybridized cDNA from cells treated with or without doxycycline to induce expression of BRAF(V600E), RET/PTC3, or RET/PTC3 with small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF, respectively, to slides arrayed with a rat 70-mer oligonucleotide library consisting of 27,342 oligos. Among the RET/PTC3-induced genes, 2,552 did not require BRAF as they were similarly regulated by RET/PTC3 with or without BRAF knockdown and not by expression of BRAF(V600E). Immune response and IFN-related genes were highly represented in this group. About 24% of RET/PTC3-regulated genes were BRAF dependent, as they were similarly modified by RET/PTC3 and BRAF(V600E) but not in cells expressing RET/PTC3 with knockdown of BRAF. A gene cluster coding for components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain pathway was down-regulated in this group, potentially altering regulation of cell viability. Metalloproteinases were also preferentially induced by BRAF, particularly matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), MMP9, and MMP13. Accordingly, conditional expression of BRAF was associated with markedly increased invasion into Matrigel compared with cells expressing RET/PTC3. The preferential induction of MMPs by BRAF could explain in part the more invasive behavior of thyroid cancers with BRAF mutations.",

The aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis of ETE in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs).;We systematically defined genes and pathways regulated in ETE using mutation and gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and examined the effect of BRAF and RAS mutations on ETE. The significance of these genes was further validated using public microarray data.;Genes related to extracellular matrix and immune response were significantly up-regulated in ETE and ion-transport genes were often down-regulated. Differentiation properties and WNT signaling were also found to be altered by ETE. BRAF and RAS mutations were shown to have distinct effects on genes associated with ETE. Specifically, PAX8 and its downstream target WNT4 were differentially expressed according to mutation status in addition to ETE, indicating their critical roles in cell motility.;BRAF V600E mutation predisposes PTC cells toward invasive phenotypes, while RAS mutation confers resistance to ETE. The differential regulation appears to be mediated through WNT4.",

This article provides a comprehensive review of this exciting new thyroid cancer field. The oncogenic role of TERT promoter mutations involves their creation of consensus binding sites for E-twenty-six transcriptional factors. TERT C228T is far more common than TERT C250T and their collective prevalence is, on average, 0, 11.3, 17.1, 43.2 and 40.1% in benign thyroid tumors, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer, respectively, displaying an association with aggressive types of thyroid cancer. TERT promoter mutations are associated with aggressive thyroid tumor characteristics, tumor recurrence and patient mortality as well as BRAF V600E mutation. Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations have a robust synergistic impact on the aggressiveness of PTC, including a sharply increased tumor recurrence and patient mortality, while either mutation alone has a modest impact. Thus, TERT with promoter mutations represents a prominent new oncogene in thyroid cancer and the mutations are promising new diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers for thyroid cancer, which, in combination with BRAF V600E mutation or other genetic markers (e.g. RAS mutations), are proving to be clinically useful for the management of thyroid cancer. Future studies will specifically define such clinical utilities, elucidate the biological mechanisms and explore the potential as therapeutic targets of TERT promoter mutations in thyroid cancer. ",

Previous studies have reported conflicting data regarding the impact of BRAF(V600E) on clinicopathological features of PTC. The study aims to determine whether BRAF(V600E) is useful as a prognostic biomarker in PTC.;A cohort study of patients undergoing surgery for PTC was undertaken. The primary outcome measure was disease-free survival. Secondary outcome measures were tumour size, nodal positivity and radioactive iodine ablation rate. All cases were re-examined to confirm PTC. Immunohistochemistry for BRAF(V600E) was performed on tissue microarrays. A single endocrine pathologist, blinded to clinicopathological data, interpreted staining.;496 patients with PTC were included, and 309 (62 %) were BRAF(V600E) positive. Tumour size was similar for BRAF(V600E)-positive and -negative tumours (21.3 vs. 23.2 mm, p = 0.23). BRAF(V600E)-positive patients were significantly older at first operation (mean age 45 versus 49 years, p = 0.003).

TERT promoter mutations were seen more frequently in advanced cancers with BRAF/RAS mutations compared to those that were BRAF/RAS wild-type (ATC + PDTC, 67.3 vs 24.1%; P < 10(-4)), whereas BRAF-mutant PTCs were less likely to have TERT promoter mutations than BRAF wild-type tumors (11.8 vs 50.0%; P = .04).;TERT promoter mutations are highly prevalent in advanced thyroid cancers, particularly those harboring BRAF or RAS mutations, whereas PTCs with BRAF or RAS mutations are most often TERT promoter wild type.

Previous studies detected ret/PTC rearrangements more frequently in PTC from children than adults, and recent reports describe a high incidence of BRAF T1796A transversion in adult PTC. However, BRAF mutations have not been adequately studied in PTC from young patients. We amplified and sequenced segments of the BRAF gene spanning the T1796A transversion site in 14 PTC from patients 10-21 years of age (mean, 17.5 +/- 3.5 years). The PTC (7 = class 1; 5 = class 2; 1 = class 3) ranged from 0.7-2.9 cm in diameter (mean, 1.4 +/- 0.75 cm). None of them (0/14) contained BRAF T1796A and none recurred (mean follow-up, 66 +/- 40 months). This incidence of BRAF T1796A is significantly less than that reported for adult PTC (270/699, 38.6%, p = 0.0015) in several series. None of our PTC (0/10) contained ras mutations, but 7/12 (58%) contained ret/PTC rearrangements.

It is relatively indolent, however other types poorly differentiated or anaplastic, are more aggressive and usually associated with poor prognosis. Approximately half of these papillary carcinomas harbor a thymine-to-adenine transversion (T1799A) point mutation, in the gene encoding the serine/threonine-kinase B-type Raf kinase (BRAF), with substitution of valine by glutamate (V600E). Mutated BRAF, generates a constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in transmitting proliferative signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements, to the nucleus. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role in cell proliferation, survival and tumor de-differentiation. The BRAFV600E occurs exclusively in papillary thyroid carcinoma and papillary carcinoma-derived anaplastic cancer, rising as a specific diagnostic marker for this tumor when identified in cytological / histological exams. This mutation has recently emerged, as a potential prognostic marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma, after several studies have found this mutation to be associated with some clinicopathological characteristics, known to predict tumor recurrence and progression, including, for instance, old patient age, extrathyroidal invasion and lymph node metastasis. It is therefore considered a marker of aggressive disease in these tumors, associated with increased cancer recurrence and even loss of radioiodine avidity. Several studies were not able to confirm these associations. It has become clearer that BRAF mutation will likely have significant impact on the clinical management of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

RNA was isolated, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the mRNA levels of BRAF, the BRAF pseudogene, and thyroid-specific and tumor-related genes. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of BRAF, ERK, sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), thyrotropin receptor, glucose transporter 1, and Ki67 was also performed.;BRAF(V600E) and the BRAF pseudogene were detected in 73.0% (57/78) and 91.7% (44/48), respectively, of the conventional PTCs.

Neither was it associated with IHC staining or tumor-related/thyroid-specific gene expression, except for decreased NIS gene expression. The BRAF pseudogene was not associated with clinical characteristics or thyroid-specific gene expression, except for decreased decoy receptor 3 (DCR3) expression. High BRAF mRNA levels were associated with bilateral and multifocal lesions, and BRAF-pseudogene mRNA levels were positively correlated with BRAF mRNA levels (r = 0.415, p = 0.009).;These results do not support the use of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a prognostic marker of conventional PTC. However, the association of high BRAF mRNA levels with more advanced clinical features suggests that BRAF mRNA levels might be a more useful clinical marker of PTCs, independent of the BRAF(V600E) mutation status. The correlation between BRAF-pseudogene mRNA levels and BRAF mRNA levels in PTCs is in agreement with the hypothesis that the BRAF pseudogene regulates BRAF expression during tumorigenesis by acting as competitive noncoding RNA.

Mice were euthanized weekly to evaluate tumor volume and metastases. Control mice showed progressive tumor growth and lung metastases by 35 d after tumor implantation. At that time, all control mice had large tumors, were cachectic, and were euthanized due to their tumor-related weight loss. PLX4720-treated mice, however, showed a significant decrease in tumor volume and lung metastases in addition to a reversal of tumor-related weight loss.

Understanding the genetic alterations underlying the development of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, such as mutational activation of BRAF, could help clarify its relationship with well-differentiated forms of thyroid carcinoma (ie follicular and papillary carcinoma) and could help select patients most likely to benefit from novel therapeutic strategies targeting BRAF. We tested 16 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas for the thymine (T) --> adenine (A) missense mutation at nucleotide 1796 in the BRAF gene using a newly developed assay that employs a novel primer extension method (Mutector assay). Seven of these anaplastic thyroid carcinomas arose in association with a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and these were also evaluated. The 1796T --> A mutation was detected in eight (50%) of the anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, in four of five (80%) associated papillary thyroid carcinomas, and in zero of two (0%) associated follicular carcinomas. In all seven cases where anaplastic thyroid carcinoma arose in association with a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, BRAF status in the two components was concordant. Like papillary thyroid carcinoma, a significant percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas also harbor BRAF mutations. Indeed, when papillary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma occur together, they consistently share the same BRAF profile, supporting the notion that many anaplastic thyroid carcinomas actually represent progressive malignant degeneration of a pre-existing well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The high frequency of BRAF mutations in a tumor that is generally regarded as uniformly fatal justifies evaluation of the potential benefits of anti-BRAF therapy for patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS. BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8% of human tumors, most frequently in melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare. Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified, a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 (V600E) is found in over 80% of cases. These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation. The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation. However, BRAF mutations are common in nevi and colon polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development. Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer, preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival. Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. The first generation of RAF inhibitors, including sorafenib, were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as melanoma. Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results. To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents, clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed.",

Moreover, this activation can lead to a growth advantage of tumor cells. Therefore, mitogenic mutations in the RAS family of oncogenes are detectable in a significant percentage in most tumors. Moreover, mutations in the BRAF gene have recently been suggested as an alternate predominant cause of colorectal and papillary thyroid cancers without ras mutations. Similar to neoplasms of other organs mutations of all three ras genes can be found in thyroid tumors. In our set of 40 cold thyroid adenoma and adenomatous nodules ras mutations were detected in only a single case. We therefore tested these hypofunctional tumors for BRAF mutations. Genomic DNA was extracted from nodular and surrounding tissue. Mutational hot spots in exons 11 and 15 of the BRAF gene were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to screen for mutations. No point mutation could be found in the two exons of the BRAF gene. Our study suggests that BRAF mutations are rather rare in solitary cold adenomas and adenomatous nodules and do not explain the molecular etiology of ras mutation-negative cold thyroid nodules.",

Among the mutations commonly seen in thyroid cancers, the vast majority are associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) mutations are the most common mutations observed in papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), followed by RET/PTC rearrangements and RAS mutations, while follicular thyroid cancers are more likely to harbor RAS mutations or PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements. Beyond these more common mutations, alterations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter have recently been associated with clinicopathologic features, disease prognosis, and tumorigenesis in thyroid cancer. While the mutations underlying thyroid tumorigenesis are well known, the frequency of these mutations is strongly associated with geography, with clear differences reported between Asian and Western countries. Of particular interest is the prevalence of BRAF mutations, with Korean patients exhibiting the highest rate of BRAF-associated thyroid cancers in the world.

Here we review CDK4/6 as a therapeutic target in BRAF mutant cancers and discuss emerging evidence supporting a critical role of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 axis in de novo and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Co-targeting CDK4/6 and BRAF could be a more effective therapy to augment clinical response of BRAF inhibitors and overcome resistance in BRAF mutant cancers. ",

The average prevalence of BRAF-positive cases in papillary carcinomas (PTC) was 58.6%, while in follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (FVPTC), the average prevalence was 29.6%. For lesions diagnosed as indeterminate or suspicious, the average prevalence of BRAF positivity in PTC was 48.5%.

Matched lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases (DMs) were screened in 35 patients. Focal changes in the growth pattern or microscopic grade within the primary tumour (Pt) or the metastases were separately genotyped. Mutations at H-, K-, N-ras and PIK3CA exons 9 and 20 were also investigated. For comparison with PTC cases, the BRAF and Ras mutational status was evaluated in 89 specimens obtained from 24 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDCs) and 36 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs).;BRAF(V600E) was found in 13/16 classical PTCs (CL-PTCs), 6/17 follicular variant PTCs (FV-PTCs) and 8/16 mixed (papillary/follicular) PTCs (Mx-PTCs), being significantly associated with CL-PTCs (P = 0.015). BRAF(V600E) segregated with metastatic PTC-cells in 43% of the patients, but only one DM disclosed the mutation. PTC-tumours featuring concurrent less-differentiated foci were BRAF wild-type in both components. Noteworthy, the frequency of BRAF mutations among PDCs and ATCs resulted considerably lower (16.6% and 25%, respectively) than in PTCs (55%). The prevalence of Ras mutations among PDCs and ATCs (46% and 36%, respectively) was, however, much higher than in PTCs (14%). Five (71%) of the patients who died of PTC displayed somatic mutations. Four of them had other gene alteration associated with BRAF(V600E) and the only one that did not, BRAF(V600E) was restricted to the Pt.

Conversely, in adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer among the general population, the most common molecular event is BRAF(V600E) point mutation, not RET/PTC rearrangements. To clarify which gene alteration, chromosome aberration, or point mutation preferentially occurs in radiation-associated adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer, we have performed molecular analyses on RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF(V600E) mutation in 71 papillary thyroid cancer cases among atomic bomb survivors (including 21 cases not exposed to atomic bomb radiation), in relation to radiation dose as well as time elapsed since atomic bomb radiation exposure. RET/PTC rearrangements showed significantly increased frequency with increased radiation dose (P(trend) = 0.002). In contrast, BRAF(V600E) mutation was less frequent in cases exposed to higher radiation dose (P(trend) < 0.001). Papillary thyroid cancer subjects harboring RET/PTC rearrangements developed this cancer earlier than did cases with BRAF(V600E) mutation (P = 0.03). These findings were confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. These results suggest that RET/PTC rearrangements play an important role in radiation-associated thyroid carcinogenesis.",

We discussed the clonal heterogeneity through the prognostic role of CXCR4 and BRAF mutation in WDC with a minor PD/insular component.

The chief consequence of these mutations is a hyperactive ERK1/2 MAPK able to promote cell proliferation, producing a critical hallmark of metastatic disease. The biochemistry of the ERK pathway is well characterized; however, how the pathway achieves different outcomes in the face of genetic aberrations of cancer and subsequent treatment with chemical inhibitors is not clear. To investigate this, we used mass spectrometry to complete a global phosphoproteomic analysis of a BRAFV600E thyroid cancer cell line (SW1736) after treatment with the mutation-selective inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) and MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244). We identified thousands of phosphorylation events orchestrated in BRAFV600E cells and performed kinase landscape analysis to identify putative kinases regulated in response to MAPK blockade. The abundance of phosphopeptides containing consensus motifs for acidophilic kinases increased after short-term inhibition with these compounds. We showed that coinhibition of the pleiotropic acidophilic protein kinase CK2 (CK2) and BRAFV600E synergistically reduced proliferation in patient-derived melanomas and thyroid cancer cells harboring the BRAF lesion. We investigated this mechanism and show a role for CK2 in controlling AKT activation that was not reliant on changes to PTEN or PDK1 phosphorylation. These findings highlight a role for CK2 blockade in potentiating the antiproliferative effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition in BRAF cancers.",

Fine-needle aspiration samples were obtained for cytology, immunocytology, and molecular analysis. Immunoblot analysis on thyroid tissues was performed to evaluate the most important tumor activating pathways. Cytology was consistent with \"follicular neoplasia\" (negative for galectin-3 immunostaining); molecular analysis on the cytology sample detected a K601E mutation in the exon 15 of the BRAF gene. After total thyroidectomy with lymph-node dissection, the diagnosis of FTC was established by histopathological examination. The BRAF(K601E) mutation was confirmed in DNA obtained from different areas of the FTC. In addition, an activating mutation (E545A) in the PKI3CA oncogene was found in the FTC. As expected, immunoblot analysis showed activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.;This article describes what may be the first case of a classical FTC carrying a BRAF mutation. Unlike the most common BRAF mutation seen in PTC carcinoma (BRAF(V600E)), this patient's mutation was a BRAF(K601E) mutation that previously has been associated with some cases of the follicular variant of PTC.

Concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), a disease characterized by thyroid lymphocytic infiltration, is a frequent occurrence. A large lymphocytic infiltrate might reduce the sensitivity of methods employed to detect BRAF mutation in thyroid cytology specimens. To determine whether testing for BRAF mutational status in fine needle aspirates (FNA) is reliable also in the presence of HT lymphocytic infiltration, we assessed the BRAF status by direct sequencing and pyrosequencing in a series of FNAs with and without concomitant HT lymphocytic infiltration. We also performed the same assessment by pyrosequencing in the corresponding tissue samples. Pyrosequencing demonstrated to be more sensitive than direct sequencing. The percentage of mutant BRAF(V600E) alleles was higher in FNAs than in the corresponding tissues, probably because of the lower stromal contamination in FNA than in the sections. In the presence of lymphocytic infiltration, the percentage of mutant BRAF(V600E) alleles determined by pyrosequencing was higher in FNAs than in the corresponding tissue samples (P < 0.0001), indicating a minor lymphocytic contamination in FNA. The diagnostic value of BRAF(V600E) in inconclusive FNAs was not hampered by thyroid lymphocytic infiltration.

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status.

Structurally, the BRAF deletions are predicted to shorten the β3/αC-helix loop and hinder its flexibility by locking the helix in the active αC-helix-in conformation that favors dimer formation. Expression of L485-P490-deleted BRAF is able to transform NIH/3T3 cells in a BRAF dimer-dependent manner.

Armed with data that correlate biomarker activity with disease presence and progression, clinicians can develop treatment strategies that address risks of disease recurrence or persistence and progression. The B-type Raf kinase (BRAF V600E) mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene has been noted to be a putative prognostic marker of the most prevalent form of thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)--a tumor type with high proclivity for recurrence or persistence. There has been a remarkable interest in determining the association of BRAF mutation with PTC recurrence or persistence. Using many new studies that have been published recently, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate correlations of BRAF mutation status with PTC prognosis, focusing on the recurrence or persistence of the disease after initial treatment. The study was based on published studies included in the PubMed and Embase databases addressing the BRAF mutation and the frequency of recurrence of PTC. We selected studies with data that enabled measurement of the risk ratio for recurrent disease. We also analyzed the factors that are classically known to be associated with recurrence. These factors included lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, distant metastasis, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages III/IV. We used 14 articles that included an analysis of these factors as well as PTC recurrence data, with a total of 2470 patients from 9 different countries. The overall prevalence of the BRAF mutation was 45%. The risk ratios in BRAF mutation-positive patients were 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-2.32; Z = 7.01; p < 0.00001) for PTC recurrence, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20-1.45; Z = 5.73; p < 0.00001) for lymph node metastasis, 1.71 (95% CI, 1.50-1.94; Z = 8.09; p < 0.00001) for extrathyroidal extension, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63-1.44; Z = 0.23; p = 0.82) for distant metastasis, and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.45-1.99; Z = 6.46; p < 0.00001) for advanced stage AJCC III/IV. Thus, in this meta-analysis, the BRAF mutation in PTC was significantly associated with PTC recurrence, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, and advanced stage AJCC III/IV. Patients with PTC harboring mutated BRAF are likely to demonstrate factors that are associated with an increased risk for recurrence of the disease, offering new prospects for optimizing and tailoring initial treatment strategies to prevent recurrence.",

The v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) substitution at codon 600 (BRAF(V600E)) is the most effective diagnostic/prognostic marker and is used mainly for papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Although BRAF(V600E) represents 95% of all BRAF mutations, uncommon BRAF mutations have been identified in thyroid carcinomas. For the current study, the authors evaluated morphologic (plump pink cells and sickle-shaped nuclei) anti-BRAF(V600E) antibody (VE1) immunocytochemical and molecular findings of BRAF mutations in PTCs and in the follicular variant of PTC (FVPC).;Between January 2013 and June 2014, there were 150 cytologic samples with surgical follow-up at the authors' institution. BRAF mutations, which were identified using liquid-based cytology, were classified into wild-type BRAF, BRAF(V600E), and uncommon BRAF mutations. All clinicopathologic correlations between BRAF and FVPCs were analyzed.;Forty-four of 150 samples were identified as benign histologic lesions, and the authors focused on the 106 cytologic samples from patients who had malignant outcomes (60 PTCs and 46 FVPCs). The series included 16 follicular neoplasms, 36 samples diagnosed as suspicious of malignancy, and 54 samples diagnosed as positive for malignancy. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 17.4% of FVPCs and in 66.6% of PTCs, whereas uncommon BRAF mutations were detected only in FVPCs. Plump pink cells and VE1 expression were not identified in samples that had uncommon BRAF mutations. VE1 immunocytochemistry yielded positive results in all 36 samples that had the BRAF(V600E) mutation.;Uncommon BRAF mutations were observed only in FVPCs and were linked to less aggressive behavior. Negative/weak VE1 expression was observed in both wild-type and uncommon BRAF mutations. The current investigation did not reveal any plump cells or morphologic BRAF findings in samples that had uncommon BRAF mutations. In the authors' experience, BRAF mutations detected by DNA methods were more accurate in identifying FVPCs.",

However, additional cellular effects caused by subcellular action of BRAF(V600E) remain to be identified.;To explore these effects, differences in the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant BRAF in thyroid cancer were investigated.;A significant proportion of endogenous and exogenous BRAF(V600E), but not wild-type BRAF, was detected in the mitochondrial fraction, similar to other BRAF mutants including BRAF(V600D), BRAF(V600K), BRAF(V600R), and BRAF(G469A), which showed elevated kinase activity and mitochondrial localization. Induced expression of BRAF(V600E) suppressed the apoptotic responses against staurosporine and TNFα/cycloheximide. Interestingly, the mitochondrial localization and antiapoptotic activities of BRAF(V600E) were unaffected by sorafenib and U0126 suppression of MAPK kinase (MEK) and ERK activities. Similarly, although the RAF inhibitor sorafenib effectively inhibited MEK/ERK activation, it did not block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E). In addition, inducible expression of BRAF(V600E) increased the glucose uptake rate and decreased O(2) consumption, suggesting that BRAF(V600E) reduces mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a signature feature of cancer cells. Again, these metabolic alterations resulted by BRAF(V600E) expression were not affected by the treatment of thyroid cells by sorafenib. Therefore, RAF and MEK inhibitors are unable to block the antiapoptotic activity of BRAF(V600E) or correct the high glucose uptake rate and glycolytic activity and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation induced by BRAF(V600E).;The mitochondrial localization observed in oncogenic BRAF mutants might be related to their altered responses to apoptotic stimuli and characteristic metabolic phenotypes found in thyroid cancer. The inability of MEK and RAF inhibitors, U0126 and sorafenib, respectively, to block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E) has additional therapeutic implications for BRAF(V600E)-positive thyroid cancers.",

However, it is controversial whether discrete nodules of PTC arise independently (multicentric occurrence) or are seeded from a single tumor via lymphatic channels (intraglandular metastasis). In order to determine the clonal origin of multiple PTCs, we examined X-chromosome inactivation patterns using a human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) and the BRAF mutation using allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) in 32 microdissected cancerous tissues from 14 Japanese women with multifocal PTC. All tumor foci were greater than 3 mm in size and met the criteria for microscopic classical PTC. Samples from 13 of the 14 patients were informative based on HUMARA. Tumor foci from two cases (15.4%) displayed a discordant X-chromosome inactivation pattern. Foci from the other 11 cases (84.6%) showed a concordant inactivation pattern of the X-chromosome. AS-PCR indicated that BRAF mutational status between the tumor foci was discordant in three (25%) and concordant in nine (75%) of 12 available cases. When the results of these two molecular analyses were combined, 28.6% of the cases were discordant in X-chromosome inactivation pattern and/or BRAF mutation, suggesting multicentric origin. Some of the remaining concordant cases also may be of multicentric origin. These results support a hypothesis that multicentric occurrence in multiple PTCs may be common, possibly greater than 30%.

Studies suggested that tumors with this mutation are especially sensitive to BRAF inhibitors-hence the need to reliably determine the BRAF status of tumor specimens. The present technologies used to screen for this mutation fail to address the problems associated with infiltrating stromal and immune cells bearing wild-type BRAF alleles and thus may fail to detect the presence of mutant BRAF(V600E) tumors. We have developed a rapid, inexpensive method of BRAF analysis that reduces the contamination of wild-type BRAF sequences from tumor biopsies. The protocol involves a series of PCR amplifications and restriction digestions that take advantage of unique features of both wild-type and mutant BRAF RNA at codon 600. Using this protocol, mutant BRAF can be detected in RNA from mixed populations with as few as 0.1 % BRAF(V600E) mutant containing cells.",

Morphologically, these malignancies have virtually always features of differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Although IM are in general considered of little clinical significance their potential malignant behavior cannot be ignored. BRAF(V600E) mutation has emerged as the most prevalent genetic alteration in PTC.;The incidence of BRAF(V600E) was studied in 85 microdissected cases of IM detected in two series of 334 and 398 patients operated on for benign thyroid disease in 2005 and in 2006, respectively. IM ranged in size from 0.5 to 4 mm and all featured cytology consistent with the diagnosis of PTC. Microdissected lesions were also evaluated for galectin-3 expression by immunohistochemistry.;BRAF(V600E) was identified in 15 out of 85 (17.6%) IM compared to 45% clinically evident PTCs (n = 91) and 38.3% preoperatively identified microcarcinomas (n = 47).;These data suggest that it is possible to find BRAF(V600E) in IM despite their extremely small (<1 mm) size.

Iodide uptake requires expression of critical genes that are involved in various steps of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. ERK signaling, which is markedly increased in thyroid cancer cells driven by oncogenic BRAF, represses the genetic program that enables iodide transport. Here, we determined that a critical threshold for inhibition of MAPK signaling is required to optimally restore expression of thyroid differentiation genes in thyroid cells and in mice with BrafV600E-induced thyroid cancer. Although the MEK inhibitor selumetinib transiently inhibited ERK signaling, which subsequently rebounded, the MEK inhibitor CKI suppressed ERK signaling in a sustained manner by preventing RAF reactivation. A small increase in ERK inhibition markedly increased the expression of thyroid differentiation genes, increased iodide accumulation in cancer cells, and thereby improved responses to RAI therapy. Only a short exposure to the drug was necessary to obtain a maximal response to RAI. These data suggest that potent inhibition of ERK signaling is required to adequately induce iodide uptake and indicate that this is a promising strategy for the treatment of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer.",

Identification of targetable aberrations may help identify novel treatment options for ATC. Herein, we report our experience with a 47-year-old patient with metastatic ATC who experienced recurrent, progressive disease and rapid clinical deterioration despite surgery, radiation therapy, and treatment with 2 different chemotherapy regimens. She was found to have a BRAF V600E mutation on CGP, and was started on targeted therapy with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. After 2 months of treatment, she showed a clinical and radiologic response. The patient remained on this combination for 9 months until evidence of disease progression.

Mutations in BRAF codons 600 and 601, and N, H, KRAS codons 12, 13, and 61 were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Of 132 cases, 81 (61.4 %) had a point mutation in one of the BRAF V600E, BRAF K601E, or RAS oncogenes; BRAF V600E in 43(32.6 %), BRAF K601E in three (2.3 %), and RAS in 35 (26.5 %) cases. All mutations were mutually exclusive. Of 78 cases with an FNA indeterminate category diagnosis, 51 (65.4 %) were positive for mutations: 24 for BRAF V600E, 3 for BRAF K601E, and 24 for the RAS gene. The KRAS mutation was more frequently found than the HRAS mutation, comprising 22.9 % of the RAS mutations, and all KRAS mutations were located at codon 61.

Over 40 different missense BRAF mutations have been found, but the vast majority (>90%) represent a single nucleotide change resulting in a valine-->glutamate mutation at residue 600 ((V600E)BRAF). In cells cultured in vitro, (V600E)BRAF is able to stimulate endogenous MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase] and ERK phosphorylation leading to an increase in cell proliferation, cell survival, transformation, tumorigenicity, invasion and vascular development. Many of these hallmarks of cancer can be reversed by treatment of cells with siRNA (small interfering RNA) to BRAF or by inhibiting MEK, indicating that BRAF and MEK are attractive therapeutic targets in cancer samples with BRAF mutations. In order to fully understand the role of oncogenic BRAF in cancer development in vivo as well as to test the in vivo efficacy of anti-BRAF or anti-MEK therapies, GEMMs (genetically engineered mouse models) have been generated in which expression of oncogenic BRaf is conditionally dependent on the Cre recombinase. The delivery/activation of the Cre recombinase can be regulated in both a temporal and spatial manner and therefore these mouse models can be used to recapitulate the somatic mutation of BRAF that occurs in different tissues in the development of human cancer. The data so far obtained following Cre-mediated activation in haemopoietic tissue and the lung indicate that (V600E)BRAF mutation can drive tumour initiation and that its primary effect is to induce high levels of cyclin D1-mediated cell proliferation. However, hallmarks of OIS (oncogene-induced senescence) are evident that restrain further development of the tumour.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer gender disparity in incidence, disease aggressiveness and prognosis has been observed in a variety of cancers. Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancer diagnoses worldwide. It is 2.9-times more common in women than men. The less aggressive histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer are more common in women, whereas the more aggressive histologic subtypes have similar gender distribution. The gender disparity in incidence, aggressiveness and prognosis is well established for thyroid cancer but the cause of the disparity is poorly understood. The aim of this article is to evaluate the current evidence on the cause of thyroid cancer gender disparity. Dietary and environmental factors do not appear to have a significant role in thyroid cancer gender disparity. Common somatic mutations in BRAF, rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas (RET/PTC) and neurotrophin receptor-tyrosine kinase (NTRK) also do not account for the gender disparity in thyroid cancer. While reproductive factors would seem a logical hypothesis to account for the gender disparity, there appears to be no conclusive effect on the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Recent studies on estrogen receptor status in thyroid cancer show a difference in the receptor subtypes expressed based on the histology of thyroid cancer. Moreover, the response to estrogen is dependent on the specific estrogen receptor expressed in thyroid cancer cells. However, what determines the tumor-specific sex hormone receptor expression is unclear. No established molecular factors appear to explain gender differences in thyroid cancer. Therefore, the application of high-throughput genomic and proteomic approaches to the study of thyroid cancer gender disparity could be helpful for better understanding the molecular basis for gender differences in thyroid and other cancers.",

In this study, we explored the possible role of these genes in the development of BSO and MSO.;Six paraffin-embedded cases of MSO with histopathologic features of PTC (4 follicular variants, 1 classic, and 1 metastasis of a classic) and 9 BSO were identified. BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS mutations were evaluated using a combination of polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, and automated sequencing. RET alterations were screened by fluorescence in situ hybridization with multicolor probes. Corresponding benign tissues were evaluated when available.;BRAF mutations were present in 4 of 6 MSO and none of 9 BSO. The BRAF mutations included V600E (2 cases), K601E, and a novel deletion/substitution TV599-600M. Neither MSO nor BSO contained alterations in NRAS, KRAS, or RET.;The development of MSOs with PTC features is associated with BRAF mutations of the type commonly observed in PTC, suggesting a common pathogenesis for all PTCs regardless of location. In contrast, mutations in the RET/RAS/RAF pathway are not found in BSO. The prognostic significance of BRAF mutation status in MSO remains to be determined.",

Activating mutations in the MAPK pathway, which includes the enzymes RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, result in constitutive signalling, leading to oncogenic cell proliferation and escape from apoptosis; therefore this pathway is a focus of crucial interest for the development of cancer drugs. In melanoma, the most commonly mutated gene is BRAF, with mutations usually occurring in about 50% of all tumours. The BRAF Val600Glu (V600E) mutation constitutes more than 90% of mutations in melanoma. V600E BRAF mutation shows a great dependency on MEK activity, and offers a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype. The use of vemurafenib and dabrafenib, agents that block MAPK signaling in patients with melanoma and the BRAF V600E mutation, has been associated with prolonged survival and progression-free survival. The frequency of V600E BRAF mutation in lung adenocarcinoma is 1.5% to 2.8%. Treatment of V600E BRAF-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with dabrafenib is under evaluation in a phase 2 trial, and could represent another milestone in individualized therapy for lung cancer patients. The next step will be a combination therapy of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib. ",

In particular, an important result could be in the short term reduction in the number of completion thyroidectomies following simple lobectomies.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer. Two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treatment of melanoma. Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.

The effects of dabrafenib, a selective inhibitor of the BRAFV600E kinase, and trametinib, a reversible inhibitor of MEK activity, were investigated. Dabrafenib strongly inhibited the viability in BRAF mutated cells by demonstrating G0/G1-arrest via the downregulation of MEK/ERK phosphorylation. Upregulated phosphorylation of MEK was observed in RAS mutated cells after dabrafenib treatment and caused VEGF upregulation, but was not related to the cellular proliferation. Trametinib inhibited the cellular viability to variable degrees in every cell by downregulating ERK phosphorylation. Dual blockade by both inhibitors demonstrated clear cytostatic effect in all the cells. OCUT-4 showed the weakest sensitivity to trametinib, no additional effect of either inhibitor in combination with the other, and an increase of SNAI1 mRNA expression after treatment with inhibitors, suggesting a mechanism for resistance.

For papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most characteristic gene expression profile is associated with the presence of BRAF mutation. BRAF-associated PTC differ profoundly from RET/PTC or RAS-associated cancers. Simultaneously, they retain many characteristic gene expression features common for all PTCs, induced by the alternative mutations activating MAPK pathway. Although the difference between papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is significant at the gene expression profile level, surprisingly, the RAS-related signature of FTC is not well specified. PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements, which occur in FTC as an alternative to the RAS mutation, are associated with specific changes in gene expression.

BRAF mutations were identified on preoperative cytologic samples (31 patients) or after thyroidectomy (75 patients). All 31 patients with BRAF-positive fine-needle aspiration (FNA) had PTC at thyroidectomy (specificity 100%). At short-term follow-up, 11/106 BRAF-positive patients have required reoperation for recurrent/persistent disease compared with 3 BRAF-negative patients (P = .04). Preoperative knowledge of BRAF mutation positivity could have productively altered initial PTC surgical management in 24% of patients.;In PTC, BRAF mutations are associated with cervical recurrence and with reoperation. Pre-operative cytologic identification of BRAF mutation has high specificity and may guide the initial extent of thyroidectomy and node dissection.",

These mutations have been identified in many human cancers, and fast, reliable BRAF mutation detection may one day facilitate directed therapy of BRAF-mutated tumors. Our fast, reliable mutation detection by CDH is based on the principle that competition among multiple fluorescent-labeled samples for binding to shared wild-type sequences should reduce nonspecific results and increase the positive signals of unshared mutated sequences. The positive signals can then be discriminated based on the labeling of each sample (ie, with Cy3, Cy5, or Alexa-594). For testing of this method, we developed a BRAF oligonucleotide microarray containing 65 mutation types (more than 95% of the known BRAF mutations) and validated this microarray with 20 colorectal cancer tissues/cancer cell lines with BRAF mutations and 60 BRAF-negative samples. In sum, we were able to screen up to nine cancer samples on a single BRAF microarray (three per CDH on three regions per slide), indicating that this method may dramatically decrease the experimental time, cost, and effort of mutation detection in BRAF and other genes amenable to microarray analysis.",

In this study we aim to better characterize molecular effects and efficacy of sorafenib against thyroid carcinoma cells with various histological origins and different BRAF mutational status. Analysis of different signaling pathways affected by sorafenib may contribute to assist a more specific therapy choice with fewer side effects. Twelve thyroid carcinoma cell lines derived from anaplastic, follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas with wildtype or mutationally activated BRAF were treated with sorafenib. Growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, cell death induction and inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways were then comprehensively analyzed.;Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay, and the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Cell death was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase liberation assays, caspase activity assays and subG1 peak determinations. Inhibition of intracellular pathways was analyzed in dot blot and western blot analyses.;Sorafenib inhibited proliferation of all thyroid carcinoma cell lines tested with IC50 values ranging between 1.85 and 4.2 μM. Cells derived from papillary carcinoma harboring the mutant BRAF (V600E) allele were slightly more sensitive to sorafenib than those harboring wildtype BRAF. Cell cycle analyses and caspase assays showed a sorafenib-dependent induction of apoptosis in all cell lines, whereas increased lactate dehydrogenase release suggested cell membrane disruption. Sorafenib treatment caused a rapid inhibition of various MAP kinases in addition to inhibiting AKT and receptor tyrosine kinases.;Sorafenib inhibited multiple intracellular signaling pathways in thyroid carcinoma cells, which resulted in cell cycle arrest and the initiation of apoptosis. Sorafenib was effective against all thyroid carcinoma cell lines regardless of their tumor subtype origin or BRAF status, confirming that sorafenib is therapeutically beneficial for patients with any subtype of dedifferentiated thyroid cancer. Inhibition of single intracellular targets of sorafenib in thyroid carcinoma cells may allow the development of more specific therapeutic intervention with less side effects.",

Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.",

Many tumor suppressor genes are aberrantly methylated in thyroid cancer, and some even in benign thyroid tumors, suggesting a role of this epigenetic event in early thyroid tumorigenesis. Methylation of some of these genes tends to occur in certain types of thyroid cancer and is related to specific signaling pathways. For example, methylation of PTEN and RASSF1A genes occurs mostly in follicular thyroid cancer, and its tumorigenic role may be related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, whereas methylation of genes for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, SLC5A8, and death-associated protein kinase occurs in papillary thyroid cancer and is related to the BRAF/MAPK kinase/MAPK pathway. Methylation of thyroid-specific genes, such as those for sodium/iodide symporter and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, is also common in thyroid cancer. Although its tumorigenic role is not clear, methylation, and hence silencing, of these thyroid-specific genes is a cause for the failure of clinical radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer. Unlike gene methylation, histone modifications have been relatively poorly investigated in thyroid tumors. Future studies need to emphasize the mechanistic aspects of these two types of epigenetic alterations to uncover new molecular mechanisms in thyroid tumorigenesis and to provide novel therapeutic targets for thyroid cancer.",

Ultrasonography (US) and US-guided biopsy remain cornerstones in the initial workup of thyroid cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy reserved for differentiated subtypes. Posttreatment surveillance of thyroid cancer is done with US of the thyroid bed as well as monitoring of tumor markers such as serum thyroglobulin and serum calcitonin. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT are used in the follow-up of patients with negative iodine 131 imaging and elevated tumor markers. Certain mutations, such as mutations of BRAF in papillary thyroid carcinoma and mutations in RET codons 883, 918, and 928, are associated with an aggressive course in medullary thyroid carcinoma, and affected patients need close surveillance. Treatment options for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer are limited. Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and RET kinases. Imaging plays an important role in assessment of response to these therapies, which can be atypical owing to antiangiogenic effects. A wide spectrum of toxic effects is associated with the molecularly targeted therapies used in thyroid cancer and can be detected at restaging scans. (©)RSNA, 2016. ",

Cell models able to recapitulate combinations of genetic aberrations are important to find drug-genotype interactions poorly affected by the heterogeneous genetics of human tumors. In order to identify novel pharmacogenomic relationships, we employed an isogenic cell panel that reconstructs cancer genetic scenarios. We screened a library of 43 compounds in human hTERT-HME1 epithelial cells in which PTEN or RB1 were silenced in combination with the targeted knockin of cancer-associated mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA oncogenes. Statistical analysis and clustering algorithms were applied to display similar drug response profiles and mutation-specific patterns of activity. From the screen, we discovered that proteasome inhibitors show selectivity toward BRAF V600E-mutant cells, irrespective of PTEN or RB1 expression. Preferential targeting of BRAF-mutant cells by proteasome inhibitors was corroborated in a second BRAF V600E isogenic model, as well as in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines by the use of the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. Notably, carfilzomib also showed striking in vivo activity in a BRAF-mutant human colorectal cancer xenograft model. Vulnerability to proteasome inhibitors is dependent on persistent BRAF signaling, because BRAF V600E blockade by PLX4720 reversed sensitivity to carfilzomib in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells. Our findings indicated that proteasome inhibition might represent a valuable targeting strategy in BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal tumors.",

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is frequently used as a diagnostic tool for risk stratification of thyroid nodules. Therefore, the authors evaluated the performance of immunostaining with the anti-BRAF antibody VE1 on FNA direct smears.;The authors identified 51 FNA specimens that had subsequent surgical resection specimens with a diagnosis of PTC. BRAF VE1 IHC was performed on the surgical specimens to determine their mutation status. The corresponding direct smears were then stained using the same VE1 stain to assess correlation.;Twenty-two of the 46 included surgical specimens were positive for BRAF mutations (47.8%) by IHC, consistent with the published rates. The paired cytologic smears from these cases revealed 65.3% concordance. The overall sensitivity of BRAF staining on cytologic smears was 63.6%, and the specificity was 58.3%. Concordance rates were highest in specimens that were diagnosed as malignant or suspicious for malignancy (75% and 85.7%, respectively). The negative predictive value increased to 77.8% when suspicious for follicular neoplasm/suspicious cases were combined.;Specimens that were malignant or suspicious on FNA were most likely to be BRAF concordant. Limitations to the interpretation of smears included low cellularity and obscuring blood, macrophages, or colloid. With further refinement, it is possible that BRAF immunocytochemistry can be applied prospectively to thyroid FNAs for risk stratification and to reduce false-negative rates.",

Similarly, BRAF mutations were positive only in PTC, but with a higher prevalence (24/43 positives, 55.8%). All but one BRAF mutation resulted in the prototypic substitution of valine 600 with a glutamic acid. In one case, a somatic in-frame insertion of three bases at codon 599 resulted in the insertion of an additional valine. RET/PTC expression and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Screening of the RAS gene allowed identification of oncogenic mutations in 1/3 (33.3%) FA and 3/4 (75%) FTC. None of the PTCs was positive for RAS.;These data indicate that BRAF mutations are the most frequent genetic event in PTC and that RAS mutations, besides being a genetic hallmark of follicular tumours, are rare or completely absent in PTC from our area.

In an immunocompetent orthotopic mouse model of ATC, combined PLX4720 and dasatinib treatment significantly reduced tumor volume relative to PLX4720 treatment alone. Immune cell infiltration was increased by PLX4720 treatment and this effect was maintained in mice treated with both PLX4720 and dasatinib. Further, combined treatment significantly increased caspase 3 cleavage in vivo relative to control or either treatment alone.

Colorectal cancer with V600E BRAF mutation has shown relative resistance to standard chemotherapy regimens, as well as lack of efficacy to vemurafenib in clinical trials. New treatments are needed for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. We report a case of a patient with BRAF-mutant metastatic colon cancer whose disease had progressed on FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and subsequent FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. Based on preclinical data published in Nature in 2012 suggesting that successful therapeutic targeting of BRAF in colorectal cancer may require concomitant targeting of the EGFR, we offered this patient without other attractive options the combination of sorafenib plus cetuximab, in off-label use with informed consent. Sorafenib and cetuximab therapy led to a mixed radiographic response with some areas showing dramatic improvement and other areas showing stable disease over a 7-month period which is a notably long period of progression-free survival for V600E BRAF mutated colon cancer. The cetuximab plus sorafenib therapy was very well-tolerated by the patient who remained on it long enough until another therapy option, regorafenib, was approved in September 2012. The patient was offered single agent regorafenib at the time of progression. At the time of progression on single agent regorafenib, panitumumab was combined with regorafenib and this was also well-tolerated and appeared to slow disease progression. Further study of these approaches in the clinic as personalized treatment of BRAF-mutant advanced colorectal cancer is warranted.",

Results were analyzed in the context of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA study) of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC).;Compared to PDTCs, ATCs had a greater mutation burden, including a higher frequency of mutations in TP53, TERT promoter, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway effectors, SWI/SNF subunits, and histone methyltransferases. BRAF and RAS were the predominant drivers and dictated distinct tropism for nodal versus distant metastases in PDTC. RAS and BRAF sharply distinguished between PDTCs defined by the Turin (PDTC-Turin) versus MSKCC (PDTC-MSK) criteria, respectively. Mutations of EIF1AX, a component of the translational preinitiation complex, were markedly enriched in PDTCs and ATCs and had a striking pattern of co-occurrence with RAS mutations. While TERT promoter mutations were rare and subclonal in PTCs, they were clonal and highly prevalent in advanced cancers. Application of the TCGA-derived BRAF-RAS score (a measure of MAPK transcriptional output) revealed a preserved relationship with BRAF/RAS mutation in PDTCs, whereas ATCs were BRAF-like irrespective of driver mutation.;These data support a model of tumorigenesis whereby PDTCs and ATCs arise from well-differentiated tumors through the accumulation of key additional genetic abnormalities, many of which have prognostic and possible therapeutic relevance. The widespread genomic disruptions in ATC compared with PDTC underscore their greater virulence and higher mortality.;This work was supported in part by NIH grants CA50706, CA72597, P50-CA72012, P30-CA008748, and 5T32-CA160001; the Lefkovsky Family Foundation; the Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering; the Byrne fund; and Cycle for Survival.",

Then, we used MASA 78 to analyze 78 archival thyroid tissues, including normal samples, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinomas and PTC.;The MASA assay proved to be a more sensitive method than SSCP and DNA sequencing of PCR products. BRAF mutation was found by MASA in 19/43 (44.2%) of PTC, including 14/31 (45.2%) classic forms and 5/12 (41.7%) follicular variants. No mutations of BRAF were detected in the normal thyroid tissues, nor in follicular adenomas or follicular carcinomas. No correlation was found between BRAF mutation and clinicopathologic features nor with recurrence during a postoperative follow-up period of 4-11 years. BRAF(V600E) significantly correlated with absence of node metastasis.;BRAF(V600E) is present in PTC, both in the classic form and in follicular variant with similar prevalence.

BRAF mutations have been detected in several tumors, including papillary thyroid carcinoma, but the precise role of B-Raf as a therapeutic target for thyroid carcinoma is still under investigation. We analyzed a panel of 93 specimens and 14 thyroid carcinoma cell lines for the presence of BRAF mutations and activation of the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. We also compared the effect of a B-Raf small inhibitory RNA construct and the B-Raf kinase inhibitor AAL881 on both B-Raf wild-type and mutant thyroid carcinoma cell lines. We found a high prevalence of the T1799A (V600E) mutation in papillary and anaplastic carcinoma specimens and cell lines. There was no difference in patient age, B-Raf expression, Ki67 immunostaining, or clinical stage at presentation between wild-type and BRAF(V600E) specimens. Immunodetection of phosphorylated and total forms of MEK and ERK revealed no difference in their phosphorylation between wild-type and BRAF(V600E) patient specimens or cell lines. Furthermore, a small inhibitory RNA construct targeting the expression of both wild-type B-Raf and B-Raf(V600E) induced a comparable reduction of viability in both wild-type and BRAF(V600E) mutant cancer cells. Interestingly, AAL881 inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation and induced apoptosis preferentially in BRAF(V600E)-harboring cells than wild-type ones, possibly because of better inhibitory activity against B-Raf(V600E). We conclude that B-Raf is important for the pathophysiology of thyroid carcinomas irrespective of mutational status.

The T1799A point mutation, responsible for a large majority of these alterations, results in an amino acid substitution (V600E) causing the constitutive activation of a protein kinase cascade. BRAF V600E in MLH1 deficient tumors implicates somatic tumor-only methylation of the MLH1 promoter region instead of a germline MLH1 mutation. BRAF V600E also predicts poor prognosis in microsatellite stable colorectal cancers and may be a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic disease. Currently, only molecular methods are available for assessing BRAF mutational status. An immunohistochemical approach is evaluated here. Colon cancers from 2008 to 2012 tested by pyrosequencing for BRAF V600E mutation were selected. A total of 31 tumors with (n = 14) and without (n = 17) the BRAF V600E mutation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a commercially available antibody specific to the V600E-mutated protein. All 14 colorectal carcinomas with the BRAF V600E mutation demonstrated cytoplasmic positivity in tumor cells with the anti-BRAF antibody. In a minority of cases, staining intensity for the mutated tumor samples was weak (n = 2) or heterogeneous (n = 4); however, the majority of cases showed diffuse, strong cytoplasmic positivity (8 of 14 cases).

Herein, we describe the design of a novel hybrid pharmacophore, 4-phenylaminopyrimidine urea, using the above two pharmacophores.

Once daily oral dosing of lead compound 3 demonstrated sustained antitumor efficacy in A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer xenograft model.

This mutation is also present in more than 60% of melanoma patients. BRAF inhibitors were developed and found to improve patient survival; however, most patients at the end of the track ultimately develop resistance to these inhibitors. Melanoma patients benefit from the combination of BRAF inhibitors with mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, among others. Unfortunately, colorectal patients do not respond much efficiently, which suggests different resistance mechanisms between the two cancer types.

However, criteria for selecting thyroid tumors that may benefit from sunitinib are lacking.;The effect of activating somatic mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes on the responsiveness to sunitinib was evaluated in a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines harboring wild-type KRAS and BRAF genes, the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, the G12R KRAS, or the V600E BRAF mutation.;Sunitinib was found to selectively inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell accumulation in the G0-G1 phase, and inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both KRAS/BRAF wild-type thyroid cancer cells and in tumor cells harboring the RET/PTC rearrangement, whereas it was completely ineffective in KRAS- or BRAF-mutated thyroid carcinoma cells. This differential antitumor activity of sunitinib did not correlate with the expression profile of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and cKIT genes. Of note, the constitutive activation of RAS/RAF/ERK signaling in KRAS/BRAF wild-type cells by transfection of the R12 HRAS or V600E BRAF mutants or stimulation with epithelial growth factor resulted in the loss of responsiveness to sunitinib, whereas pharmacological inhibition of MAPK kinase activity resulted in the resensitization of KRAS- or BRAF-mutated cells to the multikinase inhibitor.;The constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway may favor resistance to sunitinib in thyroid carcinoma cells.",

The BRAF V600E and BRAF V600V mutation were found in the initially diagnosed papillary thyroid carcinoma and the poorly differentiated foci of the recurring papillary thyroid carcinoma; however, only the BRAF V600V mutation was found in the anaplastic carcinoma. These results suggest that overexpression of p53 and Ki-67 contributed to the anaplastic transformation. We also found that the BRAF type changed during the tumor relapse. ",

In Korea, most thyroid cancer is the classic papillary type and the BRAF(V600E) mutation is highly prevalent.;To evaluate the role of pre-operative detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation in the FNAB specimens of thyroid nodules in a BRAF(V600E) mutation-prevalent geographical area.;In 137 specimens of FNAB (107 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC); 3 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC); 2 undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas; 25 benign lesions), both direct DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP were used for detecting the BRAF(V600E) mutation. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated. We analysed the association between BRAF(V600E) mutation and the clinico-pathological parameters.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was present in 93 (83%) of 112 thyroid cancers. Direct DNA sequencing showed a sensitivity of 83.0% and a specificity of 96.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR-RFLP were 78.6% and 80.0%, respectively. Among 25 cases with indeterminate FNAB cytology, 8 patients had malignant lesions (5 PTC and 3 FTC). Three (60%) of 5 PTCs and 1 out of 17 benign lesions had BRAF(V600E) mutation (only one false positive case and the definitive pathology showed atypical nodular hyperplasia that could be a premalignant lesion). The diagnostic accuracy of this molecular method in only the 25 indeterminate nodules was 76% (19/25). No mutation was found in 3 FTCs. Among 107 PTCs, there was no significant association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation with the known risk factors.;Detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in FNAB specimens refines the FNAB-cytology diagnosis, especially in a BRAF(V600E) mutation-prevalent area.

In this study, we compared immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a BRAF(V600E) mutation-specific MAB to Sanger sequencing on DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, in a well-characterized cohort of 101 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. For all cases, an IHC result was available; however, five cases failed Sanger sequencing. Of the 96 cases with molecular data, 68 (71%) were BRAF(V600E) positive by IHC and 59 (61%) were BRAF(V600E) positive by sequencing. Eleven cases were discordant. One case was negative by IHC and initially positive by sequencing. Repeat sequencing of that sample and sequencing of a macrodissected sample were negative for BRAF(V600E). Of ten cases positive by IHC but negative by sequencing on whole sections, repeat sequencing on macrodissected tissue confirmed the IHC result in seven cases (suggesting that these were false negatives of sequencing on whole sections). In three cases, repeat sequencing on recut tissue remained negative (including using massive parallel sequencing), but these cases demonstrated relatively low neoplastic cellularity.

BRaf is activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks allow bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR, and many receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2. It is this adaptive response to targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single-agent kinase inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all cancers treated with single-agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus, understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination therapies for durable clinical responses.",

BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements. Detected genetic alterations were verified by direct sequencing. Definitive histopathology was obtained in 93/290 lesions following surgery of the respective thyroid nodule.;While cytology alone diagnosed 13/30 malignancies (22 PTCs, 4 FTCs, 1 MTC, 1 UTC, 2 metastases), five additional malignancies were identified by supplementary mutation analysis. Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting.

Seventy-six PTCs (52.8%) showed unequivocal diffuse cytoplasmic expression of the mutated BRAF protein, and the T1799A point mutation was confirmed by sequencing analysis in selected cases. No statistical difference in V600E BRAF protein expression was seen between microcarcinomas and macrocarcinomas. Further, no significant correlation of V600E expression with clinicopathologic parameters of aggressiveness such as lymph node metastasis, peritumoral infiltration, or perithyroidal infiltration was found. BRAF V600E protein expression was significantly more common in tumors with tall cell or oncocytic features but was less common in tumors with follicular growth pattern. Diffuse sclerosing, solid and follicular variants did not show the mutated BRAF protein. Immunohistochemical detection of the mutated V600E BRAF protein in PTC may facilitate mutational analysis in the clinical setting. Our data show that the expression of the mutated BRAF V600 protein and thus the corresponding BRAF mutation seems not to be per se a marker of aggressiveness but is already seen in clinically indolent microcarcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3)K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade. All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 5' end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF (and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers. ",

The clinical challenge is to preoperatively identify those tumors that are more likely to recur.;To improve risk stratification and patient management, we sought to determine the prognostic value of BRAF V600E, NRAS or RET/PTC mutations in patients with PTC measuring <20  mm, mainly microPTC.;The prevalence of RET/PTC fusion genes was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61 mutations were determined by PCR sequencing. To further elucidate why some small PTC are less responsive to radioactive iodine treatment therapy, we explored if these genetic alterations may modulate the expression of iodine metabolism genes (NIS, TPO, TG, TSHR and PDS) and correlated with clinico-pathological findings that are predictors of recurrence.;This study shows that tumors measuring ≤20  mm exhibited higher prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation, which correlated with aggressive histopathological parameters, higher risk of recurrence, and lower expression of NIS and TPO.

Tumors were considered to be (18)F-FDG avid if the uptake was greater than that of the liver. (18)F-FDG uptake of PTCs was also analyzed semiquantitatively using SUVmax. The association between (18)F-FDG avidity and clinicopathologic variables (age, tumor size, perithyroidal extension, cervical lymph node status, and BRAF mutation status) was investigated.;Twenty-nine (52.7 %) of 55 patients had (18)F-FDG-avid PTCs. PTCs with the BRAF mutation showed higher (18)F-FDG avidity (24/38, 63.2 %) than those without (5/17, 29.4 %). The BRAF mutation (p = 0.025) and tumor size (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with (18)F-FDG avidity in univariate analysis, and the BRAF mutation status remained significant after adjusting for tumor size in multivariate analysis (p = 0.015). In the subgroup of tumor size ≥ 1 cm, the BRAF mutation was the only factor significantly associated with (18)F-FDG avidity (p = 0.021).

However, studies of lncRNAs are at a very early stage, our knowledge of the biological functions and clinical implications remains limited. To investigate the roles of lncRNAs in thyroid cancers, we verified 56 lncRNAs identified as potential cancer-promoting genes in a previous study that analyzed 2394 tumor SNP arrays from 12 types of cancer. Based on verified sequence information in NCBI and Ensembl, we ultimately selected three candidate lncRNAs for detailed analysis. One of the candidates, LOC100507661, was strongly upregulated in thyroid cancer tissues relative to paired contralateral normal tissue. LOC100507661 was easily detectable in papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines such as TPC1, BCPAP, C643, and 8505C, but not in the follicular thyroid cancer cell line FTC133. Stable overexpression of LOC100507661 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. Lymph node metastasis and BRAF V600E mutations were more frequent in papillary thyroid cancers with high LOC100507661 expression.

Upon the onset of puberty, the incidence of thyroid cancer increases in females only and declines again after menopause. Estrogen is a potent growth factor both for benign and malignant thyroid cells that may explain the sex difference in the prevalence of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. It exerts its growth-promoting effect through a classical genomic and a non-genomic pathway, mediated via a membrane-bound estrogen receptor. This receptor is linked to the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, these pathways may be activated either by a chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine receptor kinase TRKA, by RET/PTC genes, or by a BRAF mutation and, in addition, in females they may be stimulated by high levels of estrogen. Furthermore, estrogen is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis that are critical for the outcome of thyroid cancer.

Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1 %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1 %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5 %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1 %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1 %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3 years) than wildtype cases (58.2 years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1 %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status.

We report a novel case where a patient with RTH presented a differentiated thyroid cancer. A19 year-old female had been referred due to thyroid disease that disclosed features characteristic of a RTH. During the follow up it was detected a follicular tumor that led to the recommendation for thyroid surgical ablation, where an incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mPTC) was found. The increase of thyroglobulin (TG) levels following thyroid removal referred the patient for radioiodine treatment. Post-treatment, it was detected jugular adenopathies and the patient was subjected to cervical lymph node drainage where metastases of the mPTC were found. RTH syndrome was confirmed by the detection of a THRB germline mutation. A BRAF mutation was also found in the mPTC but not detected in the follicular adenoma or normal adjacent tissue. The young age of the patient, the rarity of BRAF mutations in childhood and the high dissemination of the malignancy, lead us to the speculation that increased TSH stimulation in a RTH background and oncogenic activation of BRAF could have served as (co) drivers and might have triggered an advanced stage of the neoplastic disease. These findings together with a review of published cases add novel information to the management of RTH patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. ",

Mutations leading to constitutive activation of MAP kinase effectors -the tyrosine receptor kinase RET and the intracellular signalling effectors RAS and BRAF- are essential for the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Besides this strong relationship between the histological phenotype and the pathway predominantly activated, the nature of the genetic event seems to determine the biological behaviour of the tumour and the ultimate clinical outcome of the patient. In this review we will summarise and discuss the main genetic events related to thyroid cancer initiation, the contribution of genomics and the convenience of using a new molecular classification of thyroid cancer, complementary to the clinicopathological classification. This may help us to predict more faithfully the clinical outcome of patients with thyroid cancer and to select more appropriately candidates for targeted therapies.",

Trends for down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression in epithelium and up-regulation in stroma from the classical via follicular to the solid variant were observed. The relation of WB and IHC results with clinicopathological parameters showed lower caveolin-1 tissue content in BRAF mutated tumors (P < .05), a positive correlation of epithelial caveolin-1 expression with lymph node metastasis (P < .05), and a negative association of stromal caveolin-1 expression with the degree of neoplastic infiltration and BRAF status.;Altered expression of caveolin-1 in the thyroid epithelial and stromal compartments may be involved in the pathogenesis of PTC.

A comprehensive analysis of his tumor revealed a previously undescribed, kinase-inactivating BRAF mutation ((Y472C)BRAF); no inactivating BRAF mutations were found in the nonresponding tumors taken from other patients. Cells transfected with (Y472C)BRAF exhibited CRAF, MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation-characteristics identical to signaling changes that occur with previously known kinase-inactivating BRAF mutants. Dasatinib selectively induced senescence in NSCLC cells with inactivating BRAF mutations. Transfection of other NSCLC cells with these BRAF mutations also increased these cells' dasatinib sensitivity, whereas transfection with an activating BRAF mutation led to their increased dasatinib resistance. The sensitivity induced by (Y472C)BRAF was reversed by the introduction of a BRAF mutation that impairs RAF dimerization. Dasatinib inhibited CRAF modestly, but concurrently induced RAF dimerization, resulting in ERK activation in NSCLC cells with kinase-inactivating BRAF mutations. The sensitivity of NSCLC with kinase-impaired BRAF to dasatinib suggested synthetic lethality of BRAF and an unknown dasatinib target. Inhibiting BRAF in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type BRAF likewise enhanced these cells' dasatinib sensitivity. Thus, the patient's BRAF mutation was likely responsible for his tumor's marked response to dasatinib, suggesting that tumors bearing kinase-impaired BRAF mutations may be exquisitely sensitive to dasatinib. Moreover, the potential synthetic lethality of combination therapy including dasatinib and BRAF inhibitors may lead to additional therapeutic options against cancers with wild-type BRAF.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine malignancy. Radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer and some inherited conditions are the most important predisposing factors for the development of thyroid cancer. Three mitogenic signalling pathways have been described in the thyroid cell, which are influenced by various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters. Various proto-oncogenes and oncogenes like ras, braf, trk, met and RET also play a role in the signal transduction systems. Two theories have been described in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, the foetal cell carcinogenesis theory and the more common, multistep carcinogenesis theory. The multistep carcinogenesis theory is now the accepted model in many human cancers, including thyroid cancer. The early events of tumour formation are the consequence of activation of either various growth factors or the proto-oncogenes like ras, met or ret. This results in the formation of differentiated thyroid cancers like the papillary, follicular or Hurthle cell cancers. The later stages of tumour formation involve further activation of proto-oncogenes and loss or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes like p53. Based on this theory, follicular carcinomas are generated from follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas from precursor cells generated from thyrocytes. Anaplastic carcinoma may develop from papillary or follicular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. In this review article, we highlight the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumours.",

Here, we correlated MUC1 expression in PTC with clinical and pathological features and with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation.;We performed a clinical and morphological analysis of 190 thyroid tumors (95 PTCs and 95 adenomas). MUC1 immunohistochemistry was carried out on a tissue microarray using different antibodies. The presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was investigated by pyrosequencing. MUC1 mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on a subset of PTC.;MUC1 expression was observed in 49% of PTCs and was found to correlate with the presence of papillary architecture, a stromal lymphoid infiltrate, aggressive histological subtypes, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, nuclear pseudoinclusions, lymphovascular invasion, and the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation (p<0.0001). MUC1 was abundant in nuclear pseudoinclusions. Multivariate analysis showed a strong association of MUC1 expression with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation and lymph node metastasis (p<0.0001).

Autophagy has a controversial role in cancer--both in protecting against tumor progression by isolation of damaged organelles, or by potentially contributing to cancer growth. The impact of autophagy in RAS induced transformation still remains to be further analyzed based on the differential effect of RAS isoforms and tumor cell context. In the present study, the effect of KRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA oncogenic pathways on the autophagic cell properties and on main components of the autophagic machinery like p62 (SQSTM1), Beclin-1 (BECN1) and MAP1LC3 (LC3) in colon cancer cells was investigated. This study provides evidence that BRAF oncogene induces the expression of key autophagic markers, like LC3 and BECN1 in colorectal tumor cells. Herein, PI3K/AKT/MTOR inhibitors induce autophagic tumor properties, whereas RAF/MEK/ERK signalling inhibitors reduce expression of autophagic markers. Based on the ineffectiveness of BRAFV600E inhibitors in BRAFV600E bearing colorectal tumors, the BRAF related autophagic properties in colorectal cancer cells are further exploited, by novel combinatorial anti-cancer protocols. Strong evidence is provided here that pre-treatment of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA followed by its combination with BRAFV600E targeting drug PLX4720 can synergistically sensitize resistant colorectal tumors. Notably, colorectal cancer cells are very sensitive to mono-treatments of another autophagy inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1. The findings of this study are expected to provide novel efficient protocols for treatment of otherwise resistant colorectal tumors bearing BRAFV600E, by exploiting the autophagic properties induced by BRAF oncogene.",

It is indeed now known that BRAF and RAS mutations and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements account for the majority of molecular alterations detected in differentiated thyroid cancers. Abnormal regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is also a promising way of research. The diagnostic utility and prognostic value of detecting these molecular events has been analyzed in several recent studies. BRAF mutation analysis improves the performance of fine-needle aspiration diagnosis by increasing specificity in \"indeterminate\" cytologies and sensitivity in false negatives. Testing for a \"panel of mutations\" (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ) improves the performance, detecting papillary carcinomas with non-classic histology. The specificity of these analyzes is excellent but their sensitivity is still insufficient. In the future, specific miRNAs expression profiles in thyroid carcinoma and identification of new mutations might provide interesting information. Several studies have found that BRAF mutations are associated with a more aggressive tumor behavior, a higher risk of recurrence and treatment failure. With regard to the other mutations and rearrangements, current data are conflicting and it seems premature to draw practical conclusions applicable in routine practice.

These mutations provide potentially valuable diagnostic, prognostic and treatment response prediction markers. A sensitive, specific, low-cost assay to detect these mutations is needed.;To detect BRAF V600E mutation in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, we developed a method using Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-PCR. This method was designed to amplify three products in a single reaction tube: a 200 bp common product serving as an amplification control, a 144 bp BRAF V600E specific product, and a 97 bp wild-type (wt) specific product. The sensitivity of this method was determined to be as low as 0.5% for the BRAF V600E allele in a wild-type background. This method was successfully validated in 72 thyroid tumors. It detected V600E mutation in 22 out of 33 (67%) of the conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 8 out of 12 (75%) of the tall-cell variant of PTC, whereas none of the 10 follicular variant of PTC showed BRAF V600E mutation. In addition, none of the 14 follicular adenomas and 3 follicular carcinomas had BRAF V600E mutation. As a comparison method, direct dideoxy sequencing found only 27 out of 30 (90%) mutations detected by ARMS-PCR method, suggesting that this ARMS-PCR method has higher sensitivity.;Our ARMS-PCR method provides a new tool for rapid detection of BRAF V600E mutation. Our results indicate that ARMS-PCR is more sensitive than automated dideoxy sequencing in detecting low BRAF V600E allele burdens in FFPE tumor specimen. The strategy of this ARMS-PCR design may be adapted for early detection of point mutations of a variety of biomarker genes.",

However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10% of all colon cancers), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.",

Recent clinical trials of combined RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK inhibition have produced improved efficacy, but patients ultimately develop resistance. To identify molecular alterations driving clinical acquired resistance, we performed whole-exome sequencing on paired pretreatment and postprogression tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer treated with RAF inhibitor combinations. We identified alterations in MAPK pathway genes in resistant tumors not present in matched pretreatment tumors, including KRAS amplification, BRAF amplification, and a MEK1 mutation. These alterations conferred resistance to RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK combinations through sustained MAPK pathway activity, but an ERK inhibitor could suppress MAPK activity and overcome resistance. Identification of MAPK pathway reactivating alterations upon clinical acquired resistance underscores the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and suggests therapeutic options to overcome resistance.;RAF inhibitor combinations represent promising approaches in clinical development for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Initial characterization of clinical acquired resistance mechanisms to these regimens identified several MAPK pathway alterations driving resistance by reactivating MAPK signaling, highlighting the critical dependence of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers on MAPK signaling and offering potential strategies to overcome resistance.",

In contrast, sensitivity of non-V600 BRAF mutations to these inhibitors is not documented. Non-V600 mutations can either increase or impair BRAF kinase activity. However, impaired BRAF kinases can still activate the ERK pathway in a CRAF-dependent manner. Herein, beyond describing a cohort of BRAF mutant NSCLC patients and functionally analyzing 13 tumor-derived BRAF mutations, we demonstrate that both types of non-V600 BRAF mutations can be sensitive to clinically relevant doses of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in HEK293T cells, in lung epithelial cellular model (BEAS-2B) and in human cancer cell lines harboring non-V600 BRAF mutations. ERK activity induced by both types of these mutations is further reduced by combinatorial drug treatment. Moreover, the combination leads to more prolonged ERK inhibition and has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cells harboring both types of non-V600 BRAF mutations.

We then investigated the role of methylation of these genes in the aggressiveness of PTC by examining the relationship of their aberrant methylation to clinicopathological characteristics and BRAF mutation in 231 primary PTC tumors. Methylation of TIMP3, SLC5A8 and DAPK was significantly associated with several aggressive features of PTC, including extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, multifocality and advanced tumor stages. Methylation of these genes was also significantly associated with BRAF mutation in PTC, either individually or collectively in various combinations. Methylation of these genes, either individually or collectively, occurred more frequently in more aggressive classical and tall-cell PTC subtypes than in less aggressive follicular-variant PTC, with the latter known to infrequently harbor BRAF mutation.

AIP protein expression was similar in neoplastic and normal cells, while AHR protein was expressed more in PTCs carrying BRAF mutations than in normal tissue, irrespective of acromegaly status.;The prevalence of DTC in acromegaly is around 11% and endocrinologists should bear this in mind, especially when examining elderly female patients with uninodular goiter.

The frequency of KRAS/BRAF mutations in conventional serous high-grade carcinomas (4.0% : 1/25) was significantly lower than that in the other histological type (32.3% : 10/31). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression was identified in 18 (38.2%) out of 45 ovarian carcinomas. KRAS/BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, II (P<0.001), and p-ERK1/2 (P<0.001). No significant correlations between KRAS/BRAF mutations or p-ERK1/2 expression and overall survival were found in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with platinum and taxane chemotherapy (P=0.2460, P=0.9339, respectively). Next, to clarify the roles of ERK1/2 activation in ovarian cancers harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations, we inactivated ERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells using CI-1040.

Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in CI-1040-treated cancer cells with mutations in either KRAS or BRAF in comparison with the ovarian cancer cells containing wild-type sequences. This was evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The findings in this study indicate that an activated ERK1/2 pathway is critical to tumour growth and survival of ovarian cancers with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the CI-1040-induced phenotypes depend on the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in ovarian cancers. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations may benefit from CI-1040 treatment.",

The most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) were dyspepsia (20 %), dry skin (18 %), rash (18 %), fatigue (16 %) and nausea (13 %), mainly grade 1. Three patients (7 %) developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Photosensitivity, arthralgia and increased liver enzyme levels were each observed in only one patient each. Of 44 evaluable patients, 14 (32 %) had a partial response (melanoma and thyroid cancer). At high dose levels (>1200 mg BID), 10 of 16 (63 %) patients had a partial response. A decrease in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on FDG-PET of ≥25 % was observed in 19 of 37 patients. On-treatment reductions in pERK were documented in eight of ten paired tumor samples.;RG7256 has a favorable safety profile compared to other BRAF inhibitors while maintaining clinical activity, and MTD was not reached.

Each case had a previous fine-needle aspiration diagnosis classified according to the British Thyroid Association Guidelines categorized as inadequate (Thy1) (n = 19), benign (Thy2) (n = 19), follicular lesion and follicular lesion with atypia (Thy3) (n = 109), suspicious of PTC (Thy4) (n = 29), or malignant (Thy5) (n = 11). The first 68 cases were selected for a morphological study by a quantitative analysis of four cytological features (grooves, intranuclear cytoplasmatic inclusions, number of cells per high power field (400 ×), and mean nuclear diameter) of the carcinomas.;The BRAF status of each tumor was correlated with the cytological classes. 54.5% and 27.6% of Thy5 and Thy4, respectively, were BRAF-mutated, against 12.1% of follicular lesions and 9.3% of follicular lesion with atypia (Thy3). This comparison was statistically significative (p = 0.0017). Among the 68 cases selected for the cyto-morphological study, the BRAF status frequency was similar to that of the total case series. No significant differences were found correlating the cytological classes with the number of cells, the number of grooves, and the mean cell diameters. Only the number of intranuclear cytoplasmatic inclusions were associated (p < 0.05) with the Thy5 cytological class.;BRAF is mutated in a low percentage of FVPTC, and most of these mutated cases are suspicious or positive on fine-needle aspiration.

The study's aim was to evaluate the BRAF mutations' incidence in an Italian regional population. Subjects and Methods. 70 Caucasian patients born in Liguria with indeterminate or suspicious cytological diagnoses. Results. A BRAF gene mutation was successfully analyzed in 56/70 patients. The mutation was BRAF V600E in 12/56 cases (21%) and BRAF K601E in 2/56 (4%). Of the BRAF mutated samples on cytological diagnosis (14/56 cases), 2/14 cases (14%) were benign on final histology and 12/14 (86%) were malignant. All BRAF-mutated cases on cytology that were found to be benign on histological examination carried the K601E mutation. Of the nonmutated BRAF cases (42/56, 75%) which were later found to be malignant on definitive histology, 5 cases were follicular carcinomas (36%), 3 cases were incidentally found to be papillary microcarcinomas (22%), 2 were cases papillary carcinomas (14%), 1 was case follicular variant of papillary carcinoma (7%), 1 was case medullary carcinoma (7%), 1 case was Hurtle cell tumor (7%), and 1 case was combined cell carcinoma and papillary oncocytic carcinoma (7%). Conclusions. The presence of the BRAF V600E mutation may suggest a more aggressive surgical approach. BRAF K601E mutation did not correlate with malignancy indexes. ",

In particular, gene instability caused by decreased expression of the hMLH1 gene, a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene, may be linked to the activating BRAF V600E point mutation in sporadic colon cancer. However, a consensus has not been established regarding the correlation between point mutations of KRAS or BRAF and carcinogenesis in patients with endometrial cancer, which is closely related to colon cancer. Therefore, we analyzed aberrant hypermethylation of the hMLH1 gene, microsatellite instability (MSI), and point mutations of KRAS and BRAF in 44 samples of sporadic endo-metrial cancer, with the aim of examining the mechanism of carcinogenesis in patients with endometrial cancer. Aberrant hMLH1 hypermethylation was found in 17 of the 44 cases (38.6%) and showed a significant positive correlation with MSI (p=0.02). This suggests that an abnormal MMR mechanism plays an important role in carcinogenesis of sporadic endometrial cancer. Point mutation of KRAS was found in 6 of the 44 cases (13.6%), but no BRAF V600E mutation was detected. These data suggest that the BRAF V600E mutation is not the target gene for abnormal MMR in carcinogenesis in patients with sporadic endometrial cancer, unlike in colon cancer. This is supported by the relatively few previous reports indicating a correlation between endometrial cancer and the BRAF V600E mutation.

Among these, the recently identified BRAF(V600E) mutation has been found at high frequency in adult patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the association between this mutation and radiation exposure in adult PTC is still unknown. In this study, we examined the BRAF(V600E) mutation in 64 PTCs among adult atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima, Japan, comprising 17 nonexposed (0 mGy) and 47 exposed patients who developed the carcinoma after the bombing, and assessed the association of BRAF(V600E) mutation with clinico-pathological and epidemiological variables. The median radiation dose in PTCs with the BRAF(V600E) mutation was significantly lower than that without the mutation (18.5 vs.156.9 mGy, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.022). A significant difference was found in the median latency period (years elapsed from atomic bombing to diagnosis) between exposed patients with and without BRAF(V600E) mutation (29 vs. 21 yr, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.014). These findings were further confirmed by logistic regression analysis with BRAF(V600E) mutation status as a dependent variable and taking into account possible interactions between the variables. We found that the log-transformed radiation dose and latency period were independently associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation (P=0.039 and P=0.010, respectively).

We report the detection of a novel BRAF triplet deletion in a case of PTC displaying a predominantly solid growth pattern. The deletion leads to the replacement of a valine and a lysine by a glutamate in the BRAF activation segment (BRAF(VK600-1E)), thus mimicking partially the 2 BRAF mutations previously described. Our study reinforces the existence of a close relationship between the occurrence of some types of BRAF mutation and some PTC histotypes.

Their coexistence with BRAF mutation was also frequent in PTC and ATC.;The data provide strong genetic implication that aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt pathway plays an extensive role in thyroid tumorigenesis, particularly in FTC and ATC, and promotes progression of BTA to FTC and to ATC as the genetic alterations of this pathway accumulate.

Standard therapy for most patients with localized differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) includes surgery, radioactive iodine, and thyroid hormone replacement. A minority of thyroid cancer patients requires systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic DTC do not usually benefit from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this review, we describe newly developed small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are being actively tested and used in the management of advanced thyroid cancer. The use of TKIs as a form of molecular targeted therapy is evolving based on understanding of the pathways involved in DTC. Disrupting tumor vascular supply by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling is the most commonly used approach to treat advanced/metastatic DTC. Other mechanisms include targeting BRAF, MAPK/ERK kinase, or mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Although TKIs appear to have superior efficacy compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy, they can cause substantial adverse effects; symptomatic management of adverse effects, dose adjustment, or cessation of therapy may be required.

Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic role of BRAF mutation, adjusting for clinical features, adjuvant chemotherapy arm, and MSI status.;Compared with 431 BRAF wild-type patients, 75 BRAF-mutated patients experienced significantly worse overall survival [OS; log-rank P = 0.015; multivariate HR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.05-2.63]. By assessing combined status of BRAF and MSI, it seemed that BRAF-mutated MSS (microsatellite stable) tumor was an unfavorable subtype, whereas BRAF wild-type MSI-high tumor was a favorable subtype, and BRAF-mutated MSI-high tumor and BRAF wild-type MSS tumor were intermediate subtypes. Among patients with BRAF-mutated tumors, a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS was observed for IFL versus FU/LV arm (multivariate HR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.25-1.10).

However, the relationship between these alterations and iodine intake is still controversial. To clarify the influence of iodine intake on the occurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinomas, we performed molecular analyses for two differentiated carcinomas, papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), from an iodine-rich country (Japan) and an iodine-deficient country (Vietnam). We examined 120 PTCs (67 Japanese and 53 Vietnamese) and 74 FTCs (51 Japanese and 23 Vietnamese). We carried out allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) for BRAF V600E, PCR and direct sequencing for RAS mutations (codon 12, 13, and 61 in NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS), and RT-PCR for RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3. BRAF V600E was present in 55/67 (82.1%) Japanese PTCs and 44/53 (83%) Vietnamese PTCs. RET/PTC1 was identified in only one PTC from each country, and no samples had RET/PTC3. NRAS mutation was found in 17/51 (33.3%) Japanese FTCs and 4/23 (17.4%) Vietnamese FTCs. NRAS mutation was cited in codon 61 (20 cases) and codon 12 (one case). None of FTCs had KRAS or HRAS mutations. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of BRAF V600E, RET/PTC, or RAS mutations between the two countries.

To determine if PTC-associated gene expression could predict lymph node involvement, a separate cohort of 130 primary PTC (54 metastatic and 76 nonmetastatic) was investigated.

Three genes (CST6, CXCL14, and DHRS3) are strongly associated with PTC. Immunohistochemical analysis of CXCL14 confirmed the qPCR data and showed protein expression in PTC epithelial cells. We also observed that CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 were associated with PTC lymph node metastasis, with CST6, CXCL14, and SPP1 being positively correlated with metastasis and DHRS3 being negatively correlated. Finally, we found a strong correlation between CST6 and CXCL14 expression and BRAF(V600E) mutational status, suggesting that these genes may be induced subsequently to BRAF activation and therefore may be downstream in the BRAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.;CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 may play a role in PTC pathogenesis and progression and are possible molecular targets for PTC therapy.",

We here analyzed tissue microarrays of a large cohort of biliary tract cancer (n=377) including 159 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 149 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 69 adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder for BRAF V600E mutation using a highly sensitive immunohistochemical screening approach implementing the BRAF V600E protein-specific antibody VE1. All VE1-positive cases as well as 42 VE1-negative cases were additionally analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In total, only 5 VE1-positive cases were detected (5/377; 1%). BRAF V600E mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases. All 5 mutated cases were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (5/159; 3%). None of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder were VE1 positive. Apart from the subtype restriction of BRAF V600E mutation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a female predominance (4 female, 1 male), no significant correlation with clinicopathological data and patient outcome was detected. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BRAF V600E mutation is a rare event in biliary tract cancer, accounting for only 1% of all subtypes, and is restricted to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a feasible approach to routinely screen for BRAF V600E mutation in biliary tract cancer patients, thereby facilitating the detection of rare patients who may benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies.",

(D594A)Braf lacks kinase activity but induces the related gene product Craf as well as the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway. Here, we show that the aneuploid phenotype is dependent on Craf. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 did not attenuate the emergence of aneuploidy but prevented the growth of aneuploid cells.

Here we explored the role of BRAF and NRAS mutations in influencing the immune phenotype based on a classification previously identified by our group.;One-hundred-thirteen melanoma metastases underwent microarray analysis and BRAF and NRAS genotyping.

However, it remains unclear whether oncogene-specific metabolic alterations are required for tumor development. Here we demonstrate a \"synthetic lethal\" interaction between oncogenic BRAF V600E and a ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL). HMGCL expression is upregulated in BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma and hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression of HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation and tumor growth potential of human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL through an octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading to increased intracellular levels of HMGCL product, acetoacetate, which selectively enhances binding of BRAF V600E but not BRAF wild-type to MEK1 in V600E-positive cancer cells to promote activation of MEK-ERK signaling. These findings reveal a mutation-specific mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF V600E \"rewires\" metabolic and cell signaling networks and signals through the Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis to selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.

Tubular and tubulovillous adenomas with features of the serrated neoplasia pathway have been described, and unlike sessile serrated adenomas, these lesions lack BRAF mutations. The contribution of these adenomas to sporadic MSI-H colon cancer is unclear. To this end, we conducted an analysis of right-sided sporadic MSI-H and microsatellite stable (MSS) colon cancer, with emphasis on precursor lesions. Overall 25% (19/75) of MSI-H colon cancer had a precursor, of which only 4 were recognized histologically as arising from a sessile serrated adenoma, and the remaining were best classified as adenomas. Of the 31 (of 89) MSS colon cancers with a precursor, only 1 was a sessile serrated adenoma (P=0.06). Histological analysis of the precursor adenomas to sporadic MSI-H colon cancer demonstrated a high frequency of crypt serrations compared with MSS colon cancer (93 vs 36%, P<0.001). BRAF mutations were found in 57/75 (76%) sporadic MSI-H and 10/89 (11%) MSS colon cancers (P<0.001). Molecular analysis demonstrated BRAF mutations in 11/12 adenoma and 3/3 sessile serrated adenoma precursors adjacent to BRAF-mutated MSI-H colon cancer. Similarly, all 4 precursors to BRAF-mutated MSS colon cancer were also BRAF mutated. The presence of BRAF mutations in these adenomatous precursors suggests that they represent sessile serrated adenomas with complete cytologic dysplasia. Finally, patients with sporadic MSI-H colon cancer were more likely to harbour synchronous sessile serrated adenomas (20 vs 8%; P=0.023). This is the largest study to rigorously evaluate the precursor and synchronous lesions in patients with right-sided colon cancer. Detailed molecular and histological analysis of these lesions confirms the importance of serrated precursors in the development of sporadic MSI-H colon cancer.",

Previous studies in pancreatic cancer have found little correlation between BRAF/KRAS mutation status and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that identifying biomarkers of MEK inhibitor response may be more challenging than previously thought. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of MEK inhibitor therapy for colorectal cancer and BRAF/KRAS mutation status and ERK1/2 activation as biomarkers for MEK inhibitor therapy. First, we found that MEK inhibitor treatment impaired the anchorage-independent growth of nearly all KRAS/BRAF mutant, but not wild-type, colorectal cancer cells. There was a correlation between BRAF, but not KRAS, mutation status and ERK1/2 activation. Second, neither elevated ERK1/2 activation nor reduction of ERK1/2 activity correlated with MEK inhibition of anchorage-independent growth. Finally, we validated our cell line observations and found that ERK1/2 activation correlated with BRAF, but not KRAS, mutation status in 190 patient colorectal cancer tissues. Surprisingly, we also found that ERK activation was elevated in normal colonic epithelium, suggesting that normal cell toxicity may be a complication for colorectal cancer treatment.

Herein, we tested 294 consecutive FNA samples from patients with thyroid nodules with the Real-Q BRAF V600E detection assay (Real-Q). These results were compared with an allele-specific PCR-based kit using dual-priming oligonucleotides (AS-PCR). Any discordant results between the two tests were also analyzed by mutant enrichment with 3'-modified oligonucleotide sequencing. A total of 128 cases were confirmed histologically; of these, 121 were diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The BRAF mutation was detected by Real-Q and AS-PCR testing in 80.2% (95% CI, 71.9%-86.9%) and 76.9% (95% CI, 68.3%-84.0%), respectively, of FNA specimens with PTC. Combining the BRAF V600E molecular assays (Real-Q and AS-PCR) with cytological diagnoses of malignant and suspicious for malignant cells, the detection rates (sensitivity) of Real-Q and AS-PCR for diagnosis of PTC increased to 94.2% (95% CI, 88.4%-97.6%) and 92.6% (95% CI, 86.4%-96.5%), respectively. In conclusion, the detection of BRAF V600E mutations in PTC by Real-Q is compatible to that of AS-PCR. ",

The transversion is frequently detected in the conventional type, Warthin-like and tall cell variants, but is rare in the follicular variant of PTC. Conventional PTC is often presented with tumors of mixed architecture, which besides the papillary structures also contain areas with follicular and solid morphology in which the details of BRAF mutational status are unknown. We set out to differentially investigate the presence of mutated BRAF in the individual structural components microdissected from 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTC tissues from 40 patients. The mutation was detected in at least 1 structural component in 23 tumors (52%). Different structural components of the same tumor had identical BRAF status in 41/44 tumors (93%). In 3 tumors the BRAF(T1799A) mutation was found only in the papillary, but not in the follicular component. Mutational patterns identical to those in the primary tumors were found in 11/12 lymph node metastases (92%, including both BRAF(T1799A)-positive and -negative cases). The high concordance of the BRAF mutational status in structurally distinct areas suggests a rather homogeneous distribution of neoplastic epithelial cells in a conventional PTC tumor in most cases. These results imply the reliability of preoperative molecular diagnosis of PTC regardless of the type of tumor component at the site of biopsy sampling and suggest that the majority of patients with BRAF mutation-positive PTC may benefit from the targeted pharmacotherapy.",

Although associations between certain genetic aberrations, such as BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability, and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), have been found, the mechanisms by which these associations are established are still unclear. We studied genome-wide DNA methylation differences between colorectal tumors carrying a BRAF mutation and BRAF wildtype tumors.;Using differential methylation hybridization on oligonucleotide microarrays representing 32,171 CpG-rich regions, we identified 1,770 regions with differential methylation between colorectal tumor and paired normal colon. Next, we compared the tumor/normal methylation ratios between different groups of patients. Related to CIMP, we identified 749 differentially methylated regions, of which 86% had a higher tumor/normal methylation ratio in the CIMP-positive group. We identified 758 regions with a BRAF mutation-specific methylation change, of which 96% had a higher tumor/normal methylation ratio in the BRAF mutant group. Among the genes affected by BRAF mutation-specific methylation changes, we found enrichment of several cancer-related pathways, including the PI3 kinase and Wnt signaling pathways. To focus on genes that are silenced in a tumor-specific rather than a lineage-specific manner, we used information on the epigenetic silencing mark H3K27me3 in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Among the genes showing BRAF mutation-specific promoter methylation but no H3K27me3 mark in ES cells were forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors associated with the PI3 kinase pathway, as well as MLH1 and SMO.

The oncogenicity of this mutation has been shown by some genetically engineered mouse models. However, in these mice, BRAF(V600E) is expressed in all the thyroid cells from the fetal periods, and suppresses thyroid function, thereby leading to TSH elevation, which by itself promotes thyroid tumorigenesis. To overcome these problems, we exploited 2 different approaches, both of which allowed temporally and spatially restricted expression of BRAF(V600E) in the thyroid glands. First, we generated conditional transgenic mice harboring the loxP-neo(R)-loxP-BRAF(V600E)-internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein sequence [Tg(LNL-BRAF(V600E))]. The double transgenic mice (LNL-BRAF(V600E);TPO-Cre) were derived from a high expressor line of Tg(LNL-BRAF(V600E)) mice and TPO-Cre mice; the latter expresses Cre DNA recombinase under the control of thyroid-specific thyroid peroxidase (TPO) promoter and developed PTC-like lesions in early life under normal serum TSH levels due to mosaic recombination. In contrast, injection of adenovirus expressing Cre under the control of another thyroid-specific thyroglobulin (Tg) promoter (Ad-TgP-Cre) into the thyroids of LNL-BRAF(V600E) mice did not induce tumor formation despite detection of BRAF(V600E) and pERK in a small fraction of thyroid cells. Second, postnatal expression of BRAF(V600E) in a small number of thyroid cells was also achieved by injecting the lentivirus expressing loxP-green fluorescent protein-loxP-BRAF(V600E) into the thyroids of TPO-Cre mice; however, no tumor development was again observed. These results suggest that BRAF(V600E) does not appear to induce PTC-like lesions when expressed in a fraction of thyroid cells postnatally under normal TSH concentrations. ",

Kinase assays carried out on BRAFV599Ins and BRAFV600E revealed a three- to five-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of both mutants with respect to BRAFWT. Similarly, evaluation of BRAF-induced phosphorylation of MEK, MAPK and RSK revealed a significant MAPK cascade activation in cells expressing BRAFV599Ins or BRAFV600E, but not in cells expressing BRAFWT. Molecular dynamic simulations showed a destabilization of the inactive conformation of the enzyme in both BRAFV599Ins and BRAFV600E mutants, but not in BRAFWT. The analysis of the interaction energies inside the catalytic site allowed to demonstrate the presence of repulsive electrostatic forces acting on the activation loop and moving from inward to outward of the mutant enzymes. Finally, focus assays in NIH-3T3 cells confirmed a high transformation rate in the cells transfected either with BRAFV599Ins or BRAFV600E.

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid nodules are a very frequent pathology among common population. Despite the vast majority of them are of benign origin, the incidence of thyroid cancer is currently rather rising. Although there are several risk factors of thyroid cancer and several clinical, ultrasound, biochemical and molecular diagnostic markers, the exact mechanisms of thyroid oncogenesis and the linkage between thyroid nodule ultrasound appearance and its biological character remain unclear. While ionizing radiation is the only one well-known risk factor for thyroid cancer, the significance of some others remains unclear. The aim of our review was to discuss some not completely known pathophysiological mechanisms involved in thyroid oncogenesis as hypothyroidism, mutations of genes regulating cell proliferation, thyroid autoimmunity and pregnancy and to describe pathophysiological background of some ultrasound markers of thyroid cancer (size, echogenicity, vascularization, calcifications and stiffness). Better knowledge in this field is crucial for development of novel diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches. For example, the analysis of BRAF, RAS and other mutations in cytological samples may help to distinction between follicular thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid adenoma and may significantly decrease the number of unnecessary surgery among patients with thyroid nodules. Alternatively, the different malign cells growth, angiogenesis, destructions of thyroid follicles, reparative changes, growth retardation, fibrosis and increased interstitial fluid pressure implicate the typical ultrasound appearance of papillary thyroid cancer (hypoechogenicity, irregular vascularization, microcalcifications, stiffness) which is essential to catch the suspicious nodules on the basis of their ultrasound appearance among large amount of benign nodules.

Seventy-seven cases (100 nodules) from Japan and 131 cases (137 nodules) from Kazakhstan were examined. There were 14 Japanese and 76 Kazakhstani cases of cytological malignant tumors from the examined samples. We detected 12 (85.7% of PTC) and 19 (25% of PTC) cases with BRAF(T1799A) among the Japanese and Kazakhstani cases, respectively. Of these cases, we found mutations in one cytologically \"suspicious\" case and even in two pathologically \"benign\" cases (after surgery in Kazakhstan). All of the BRAF mutation-positive cases, including those three, were confirmed as PTC by careful pathological examination, including immunohistochemical analysis. In summary, our PCR-RFLP method for BRAF(T1799A) detection using FNAB samples is useful not only for preoperative diagnosis of PTC but also as a complementary diagnostic tool for accurate pathological diagnosis, even after surgery.",

Therefore, this study was conducted to identify a relationship between specific miRNA molecules and BRAF mutation in CRCs and serrated lesions. miRNA array was used for the measurement of 760 miRNAs in 29 CRCs. To assess the identified miRNAs, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed on 721 CRCs, 381 serrated lesions and 251 non-serrated adenomas. Moreover, proliferation and invasion assays were conducted using cell lines. miRNA array analysis revealed that microRNA-31 (miR-31)-5p was the most up-regulated miRNA in CRCs with mutated BRAF (V600E) compared with CRCs possessing wild-type BRAF (including cases with KRAS mutation). High miR-31 expression was associated with BRAF and KRAS mutations and proximal location (P < 0.0001). High miR-31 expression was related to cancer-specific mortality [multivariate hazard ratio = 2.06, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.09, P = 0.0008]. Functional analysis demonstrated that miR-31 inhibitor decreased cell invasion and proliferation. With regard to serrated lesions, high miR-31 expression was less frequently detected in hyperplastic polyps compared with other serrated lesions. In conclusion, associations were identified between miR-31, BRAF and prognosis in CRC. Transfection of miR-31 inhibitor had an antitumour effect.

Although BRAF(V600E) is a driver oncoprotein and pharmacologic target in solid tumors such as melanoma, lung, and thyroid cancer, it remains unknown whether BRAF(V600E) is an appropriate therapeutic target in hematopoietic neoplasms. To address this critical question, we generated a mouse model expressing inducible BRAF(V600E) in the hematopoietic system, and evaluated the efficacy of pathway-targeted therapeutics against primary hematopoietic cells. In this model, BRAF(V600E) expression conferred cytokine-independent growth to monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors leading to aberrant in vivo and in vitro monocyte/macrophage expansion. Furthermore, transplantation of BRAF(V600E)-expressing bone marrow cells promoted an in vivo pathology most notable for monocytosis in hematopoietic tissues and visceral organs. In vitro analysis revealed that MAP-ERK kinase inhibition, but not RAF inhibition, effectively suppressed cytokine-independent clonal growth of monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors. However, combined RAF and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition effectively inhibited cytokine-independent colony formation, suggesting autocrine PI3K pathway activation. Taken together, these results provide evidence that constitutively activated BRAF(V600E) drives aberrant proliferation of monocyte-lineage cells.;This study supports the development of pathway-targeted therapeutics in the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-expressing hematopoietic neoplasms in the monocyte/histiocyte lineage.",

Since much enthusiasm surrounds the BRAF-oncogene as a molecular prognostic factor, a central focus of our consideration is to weigh the current arguments for and against applying BRAF mutation status of the tumor in clinical practice. The frequency of BRAF mutation in PTC is high-45% on average, with values over 70-80% in some populations. This will mean that implementing BRAF mutation as a factor of poor prognosis will shift many PTC patients, considered up to now as low risk ones, to the more extensive treatment. We estimate that 31% of all PTC patients and 39% of those diagnosed with stage I-II disease will face the risk of overtreatment if the decision will be based on the BRAF-positivity of their tumors. Also, the risk of undertreatment in the young patients with BRAF-negative tumors is evaluated with 26%. We think that, as of now, the evidence-based support for such consequences is still weak. Thus, there is urgent need to look for genes or gene signatures which will be helpful in the stratification of BRAF-positive tumors to specify these with poor prognosis with higher accuracy, needed for clinical decisions. Considering this, in the review we summarize the present status of knowledge on other prognosis-related gene expression changes in papillary and follicular cancer and relate them to he tumor's biology.",

Mutations in the PIK3CA have also been identified in thyroid cancers and, although relatively common in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, are uncommon in PTC.;The objective of the study was to investigate genetic alterations like PIK3CA gene mutation, PIK3CA amplification, RAS, and RAF mutations and to further explore the relationship of these genetic alterations with various clinicopathological characteristics in Middle Eastern PTC.;We used the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique for analysis of PIK3CA amplification from 536 PTC cases, and selected amplified samples were further validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Mutation analysis was done by direct DNA sequencing of PIK3CA, N2-RAS, and BRAF genes.;PIK3CA amplification was seen in 265 of 499 PTC cases analyzed (53.1%); PIK3CA gene mutations in four of 207 PTC (1.9%); N2-RAS mutations in 16 of 265 PTC (6%); and BRAF mutations in 153 of 296 PTC (51.7%). N-RAS mutations were-associated with an early stage (P = 0.0465) and lower incidence of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.027), whereas BRAF mutations were-associated with metastasis (P = 0.0274) and poor disease-free survival (P = 0.0121) in PTCs.;A higher incidence of PIK3CA alterations and the possible synergistic effect of PIK3CA alterations and BRAF mutations suggest their major role in Middle Eastern PTC tumorigenesis and argue for therapeutic targeting of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.",

Tissue microarray studies can produce genetic maps and proteomics, patterns of protein expression of TTM derived from preoperative biopsies and specimens. For instance, papillary and medullary thyroid cancers harbor RAS, RET, and BRAF genetic mutations. Follicular thyroid cancers harbor translocations and fusions of certain genes (PAX 8 and PPAR-gamma). Proteomic analysis from various tissue sources can provide useful information regarding the overall state of a thyroid cancer cell. Understanding the molecular events related to these genetic and protein alterations can potentially clarify thyroid cancer pathogenesis and guide appropriate molecular targeted therapies. However, despite the realization that these emerging technologies hold great promise, there are still significant obstacles to the routine use of TTM. These include equivocal thyroid nodule tissue morphologic interpretations, inadequate standardization of methods, and monetary costs. Interpretative shortcomings are frequently due to the relative scarcity of cellular material from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens.

One pathway through which mutant KRAS acts is an inflammatory pathway that involves the kinase IKK and activates the transcription factor NF-κB. BRAF, a kinase that is downstream of KRAS, is mutated in a subset of CRC and is predictive of poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance. We found that, in contrast to mutant KRAS, mutant BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) did not trigger NF-κB activation but instead triggered the phosphorylation of a proteolytic fragment of IKKα (p45-IKKα) in CRC cells. BRAF(V600E) CRC cells had a high abundance of phosphorylated p45-IKKα, which was decreased by a RAF inhibitor. However, the abundance and DNA binding of NF-κB in these cells were unaffected by the RAF inhibitor, and expression of BRAF(V600E) in human embryonic kidney-293T cells did not activate an NF-κB reporter. Moreover, BRAF-induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and BRAF-dependent transcription required phosphorylation of p45-IKKα. The kinase TAK1, which was associated with the endosomal compartment, phosphorylated p45-IKKα. Inhibition of endosomal vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) with chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 blocked p45-IKKα phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in BRAF-mutant CRC cells independent of autophagy. Treating mice with V-ATPase inhibitors reduced the growth and metastasis of BRAF(V600E) xenograft tumors in the cecum of mice. ",

A total of 23,620 somatic mutations generated by whole‑exome sequencing of 446 tumor/normal pairs of thyroid cancer were obtained from TCGA. Variant classification was conducted with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). OncodriveFM and Dendrix were applied to detect driver genes and pathways with statistical evidence. In addition, we analyzed DNA‑methylation status, copy number variation, expression levels and fusion genes among these driver candidates. In total, non‑synonymous mutations accounted for over 55% (13,091/23,620) of the total variants; 53 and 3 driver genes were determined by OncodriveFM and Dendrix, respectively, including 6 recurrently mutated driver genes, such as BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, EIF1AX, KRAS and 47 new genes. A total of 75 pathways with high function impact bias were identified by OncodriveFM. Two genes, FHOD3 and SRP72, were hypomethylated, overexpressed and involved in major deletions in thyroid cancer.

The statistical correlation between differentially expressed lncRNAs and clinicopathologic characteristics was analyzed, and potential lncRNA functions were predicted by examining annotations for the co-expressed mRNAs. Furthermore, the specific subgroup patterns of the PTC transcriptome remodeled by BRAF mutations were also analyzed.;A total of 188 lncRNAs and 505 mRNAs were differentially expressed in 50% or more of the PTC tissues (fold change >2; p < 0.05) as assessed by RNA-sequencing compared with paired normal adjacent tissues. Forty-seven lncRNAs and 39 mRNAs were verified in 31 pairs of PTC specimens using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with the RNA sequencing data.

However, a comprehensive evaluation of BRAF and K-RAS mutations and their specific clinicopathological features, histomorphological presentation and effect on protein expression have not been systematically analyzed. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinicopathological, histomorphological and protein expression profiles of BRAF- and K-RAS-mutated colorectal cancers and determine their impact on patient survival. Molecular analysis for microsatellite instability (MSI), K-RAS and BRAF was carried out on paraffin-embedded samples from 404 patients with primary colorectal cancer. Using tissue microarrays, 36 tumor-associated and 14 lymphocyte/inflammatory-associated markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. BRAF mutation was associated with right-sided tumor location (p < 0.001), higher tumor grade (p = 0.029), absence of peritumoral lymphocytic inflammation (p = 0.026) and MSI-H (p < 0.001). In right-sided tumors, loss of CDX2 expression was observed in 23 of 24 cases (95.8%). BRAF mutation was a poor prognostic indicator in patients with right-sided disease (p = 0.01). This result was maintained in multivariable analysis (p < 0.001; HR = 2.82; 95% CI: 1.5-5.5) with pT, pN and vascular invasion and independent of CDX2 expression. K-RAS mutation, in contrast, was not associated with any of the features analyzed. BRAF gene mutation is an adverse prognostic factor in right-sided colon cancer patients independent of MSI status and, moreover, in patients with lymph node-negative disease. These results indicate that molecular analysis for BRAF may be a useful biomarker for identifying patients with right-sided colon cancer with poor outcome who may benefit from a more individualized course of therapy.",

RKIP expression levels were significantly higher than the corresponding levels of BRAF (p < 0.001), whereas the two genes showed a negative correlation not only in AK and SCC, but in the adjacent phenotypically normal skin tissue, as well.

        "Doc_abstract":"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many cancers. Under normal physiologic conditions, the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) signalling cascade interaction is initiated by ligation of a receptor-linked tyrosine kinase by its cognate growth factor. It has been demonstrated in many systems that aberrant autocrine or paracrine stimulation of growth factor receptors is pathogenic in large part because of MAPK activation. As one of the key downstream effector pathways of mutated RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS), pharmacologic inhibition of components of the MAPK pathway has been pursued as a means to indirectly inhibit RAS, which remains a technical challenge for direct pharmacologic inhibition. RAF and MEK are the two non-membrane-bound, serine-threonine and tyrosine-threonine kinases, within the pathway that have been most extensively explored as drug targets. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in cancer clarified which cancer types and subsets of certain cancers are most dependent on activation of the MAPK pathway for growth and survival. Now, with the successful translation of selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors into validated therapies for BRAF mutant melanoma, the field seeks to resolve the role for these agents in cancers harbouring RAS mutations or those driven by aberrant growth factor receptor activation.",

Eighteen (58%) of the adult cases, but only one of the 35 cases aged less than 16 harboured a BRAF T1796A mutation. There was complete agreement between the two methods used, suggesting that the MALDI-TOF assay is a robust alternative to conventional mutation analysis. RET rearrangement was also examined in the young cohort. The overall frequency of RET rearrangement was 45.7%. Eight of the younger group of patients were born after 1 December 1986 and were therefore not exposed to radioiodine in fallout from Chernobyl. None of the PTCs from these eight patients were positive for BRAF mutation. The frequency of RET rearrangement was 44% in the 27 cases exposed to radiation and 50% in the eight not exposed.

Drugs designed to target BRAF have been developed, but it is difficult to prove that they mediate their antitumor effects by inhibiting BRAF rather than by working through off-target effects. We generated drug-resistant versions of oncogenic BRAF by mutating the gatekeeper residue. Signaling by the mutant proteins was resistant to the small-molecule inhibitor sorafenib, but sorafenib still inhibited the growth of tumors driven by the mutant protein. In contrast, both BRAF signaling and tumor growth were resistant to another RAF drug, PLX4720. These data provide unequivocal evidence that sorafenib mediates its antitumor effects in a manner that is independent of its ability to target oncogenic BRAF, whereas PLX4720 inhibits tumor growth by targeting oncogenic BRAF directly.",

To investigate the differences between the characteristics of childhood and adult PTCs, we analyzed both BRAF(T1796A) and RAS mutations in 31 Japanese and 48 post-Chernobyl Ukrainian thyroid carcinomas. In the 31 Japanese childhood cases, BRAF(T1796A) was found in only one instance (3.2%), and no RAS mutations were detected.

These in vitro cell lines originate from differentiated and dedifferentiated in vivo human thyroid tumors. However, it has been shown that mRNA expression profiles of these cell lines were closer to dedifferentiated in vivo thyroid tumors (anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, ATC) than to differentiated ones. Here an overview of the knowledge of these models was made. The mutational status of six human thyroid cancer cell lines (WRO, FTC133, BCPAP, TPC1, K1, and 8505C) was in line with previously reported findings for 10 genes frequently mutated in thyroid cancer. However, the presence of a BRAF mutation (T1799A: V600E) in WRO questions the use of this cell line as a model for follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Next, to investigate the biological meaning of the modulated mRNAs in these cells, a pathway analysis on previously obtained mRNA profiles was performed on five cell lines. In five cell lines, the MHC class II pathway was down-regulated and in four of them, ribosome biosynthesis and translation pathways were up-regulated. mRNA expression profiles of the cell lines were also compared to those of the different types of thyroid cancers. Three datasets originating from different microarray platforms and derived from distinct laboratories were used. This meta-analysis showed a significant higher correlation between the profiles of the thyroid cancer cell lines and ATC, than to differentiated thyroid tumors (i.e., PTC or FTC) specifically for DNA replication. This already observed higher correlation was obtained here with an increased number of in vivo tumors and using different platforms. In summary, this would suggest that some papillary thyroid carcinoma or follicular thyroid carcinoma (PTC or FTC) cell lines (i.e., TPC-1) might have partially lost their original DNA synthesis/replication regulation mechanisms during their in vitro cell adaptation/evolution.",

Recent studies have shown that an activating mutation of BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) is tightly associated with CIMP, raising the question of whether BRAF(V600E) plays a causal role in the development of CIMP or whether CIMP provides a favorable environment for the acquisition of BRAF(V600E). We employed Illumina GoldenGate DNA methylation technology, which interrogates 1,505 CpG sites in 807 different genes, to further study this association. We first examined whether expression of BRAF(V600E) causes DNA hypermethylation by stably expressing BRAF(V600E) in the CIMP-negative, BRAF wild-type COLO 320DM colorectal cancer cell line. We determined 100 CIMP-associated CpG sites and examined changes in DNA methylation in eight stably transfected clones over multiple passages. We found that BRAF(V600E) is not sufficient to induce CIMP in our system. Secondly, considering the alternative possibility, we identified genes whose DNA hypermethylation was closely linked to BRAF(V600E) and CIMP in 235 primary colorectal tumors. Interestingly, genes that showed the most significant link include those that mediate various signaling pathways implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis, such as BMP3 and BMP6 (BMP signaling), EPHA3, KIT, and FLT1 (receptor tyrosine kinases) and SMO (Hedgehog signaling). Furthermore, we identified CIMP-dependent DNA hypermethylation of IGFBP7, which has been shown to mediate BRAF(V600E)-induced cellular senescence and apoptosis. Promoter DNA hypermethylation of IGFBP7 was associated with silencing of the gene. CIMP-specific inactivation of BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence and apoptosis pathways by IGFBP7 DNA hypermethylation might create a favorable context for the acquisition of BRAF(V600E) in CIMP+ colorectal cancer. Our data will be useful for future investigations toward understanding CIMP in colorectal cancer and gaining insights into the role of aberrant DNA hypermethylation in colorectal tumorigenesis.",

Novel targeted therapies aimed at the inhibition of the mutated oncoprotein BRAF(V600E) have shown promise in vivo and in vitro but do not result in cellular apoptosis. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in a tumor-selective manner by activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Here, we show that a TRAIL-R2 agonist antibody, lexatumumab, induces apoptosis effectively in some thyroid cancer cell lines (HTh-7, TPC-1 and BCPAP), while more aggressive anaplastic cell lines (8505c and SW1736) show resistance. Treatment of the most resistant cell line, 8505c, using lexatumumab in combination with the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, PLX4720, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, (triple-drug combination) sensitizes the cells by triggering both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in vitro as well as 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumors in vivo. A decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins, pAkt, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and c-FLIP, coupled with an increase in the activator proteins, Bax and Bim, results in an increase in the Bax to Bcl-xL ratio that appears to be critical for sensitization and subsequent apoptosis of these resistant cells. Our results suggest that targeting the death receptor pathway in thyroid cancer can be a promising strategy for inducing apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells, although combination with other kinase inhibitors may be needed in some of the more aggressive tumors initially resistant to apoptosis.

In fetal cell carcinogenesis, thyroid tumor cells are assumed to be derived from three types of fetal thyroid cell which only exist in fetuses or young children, namely, thyroid stem cells (TSCs), thyroblasts and prothyrocytes, by proliferation without differentiation. Genomic alternations, such as RET/PTC and PAX8-PPARγ1 rearrangements and a mutation in the BRAF gene, play an oncogenic role by preventing thyroid fetal cells from differentiating. Fetal cell carcinogenesis effectively explains recent molecular and clinical evidence regarding thyroid cancer, including thyroid cancer initiating cells (TCICs), and it underscores the importance of identifying a stem cells and clarifying the molecular mechanism of organ development in cancer research. It introduces three important concepts, the reverse approach, stem cell crisis and mature and immature cancers. Further, it implies that analysis of a small population of cells in a cancer tissue will be a key technique in establishing future laboratory tests. In the contrary, mass analysis such as gene expression profiling, whole genomic scan, and proteomics analysis may have definite limitations since they can only provide information based on many cells.

In recent years, genome wide approaches have been exploited to find genetic alterations associated with complex diseases, including cancer. Here, we reviewed the comprehensive genetic alterations in ATC and recent approaches in the context of identifying genomic alterations associated with ATC.

Warthin-like variant is one of the rarest histologic variants of papillary thyroid cancer. A 36-year-old female sought consult for assessment of a painless right neck tumor. High-resolution neck ultrasound revealed a right hypoechoic, 1.71 × 1.05 cm thyroid nodule. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy report was a Bethesda grade III. Thyroid function tests showed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of papillae lined by cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear chromatin clearing, grooves, and pseudoinclusions and a characteristic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of the papillae cores. Extension into the perithyroidal soft tissue and 3 ipsilateral lymph nodes was found to be positive for cancer. Warthin-like variant is an uncommon and relatively unknown variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma that has been usually associated with an excellent prognosis. Interestingly, BRAF mutations have been reported to be present in up to 75% of the patients. It is frequently associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and presents unique morphological features that make it recognizable on histologic examination.

Differentiated thyroid cancer expresses a functional TSH receptor, and its growth and progression are positively regulated by TSH and cAMP signaling.;We aimed to analyze the expression of praja2 in a group of 36 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 14 benign nodules, and six anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC).;We measured praja2 mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR and praja2 expression by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Possible association between praja2 mRNA and the presence of known mutations was evaluated.;We found a statistical significant increase of mRNA levels in PTC tissue samples, compared with benign nodules and ATC. In particular, mRNA levels were maximal in differentiated thyroid cancer (PTC), progressively decreasing in more aggressive tumors, ATC having the lowest amount of praja2 mRNA. Accordingly, higher levels of praja2 protein were detected in lysates from PTC, compared with ATC. By immunohistochemistry, in PTC sections we observed a marked increase of cytoplasmic praja2 signal, which significantly decreased in less differentiated thyroid tumors, completely disappearing in ATC. Studies in cultured cells stably expressing RET/PTC1 oncogene or mutant BRAF revealed a direct correlation between praja2 mRNA levels and malignant phenotype of transformed cells. Similar results were obtained using thyroid cancer tissues carrying the same mutations.;praja2 is markedly overexpressed in differentiated thyroid cancer, and its levels inversely correlate with the malignant phenotype of the tumor.

Mutations in BRAF at codon 600 promote catalytic activity and are associated with 8% of all human (solid) tumors, including 8% to 10% of colorectal cancers (CRC). Here, we report the preclinical characterization of vemurafenib (RG7204; PLX4032; RO5185426), a first-in-class, specific small molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) in BRAF-mutated CRC cell lines and tumor xenograft models. As a single agent, vemurafenib shows dose-dependent inhibition of ERK and MEK phosphorylation, thereby arresting cell proliferation in BRAF(V600)-expressing cell lines and inhibiting tumor growth in BRAF(V600E) bearing xenograft models. Because vemurafenib has shown limited single-agent clinical activity in BRAF(V600E)-mutant metastatic CRC, we therefore explored a range of combination therapies, with both standard agents and targeted inhibitors in preclinical xenograft models. In a BRAF-mutant CRC xenograft model with de novo resistance to vemurafenib (RKO), tumor growth inhibition by vemurafenib was enhanced by combining with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). The addition of vemurafenib to capecitabine and/or bevacizumab, cetuximab and/or irinotecan, or erlotinib resulted in increased antitumor activity and improved survival in xenograft models. Together, our findings suggest that the administration of vemurafenib in combination with standard-of-care or novel targeted therapies may lead to enhanced and sustained clinical antitumor efficacy in CRCs harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.",

The sensitivity of the assays was validated in two cell lines, K1 and RO82-W-1, which were respectively positive and negative for the mutation. The method enabled detection of very low concentrations (~1%) of the mutation, with positive findings obtained in 119 of the 187 samples (63.6%).

The presence of the mutation was significantly associated with ages >45 years, the tumor-nodes-metastasis stage, region of metastasis, and clinical outcome (P < 0.05). Although no correlation was found between the mutation and lymph node metastasis, the proportions of patients carrying a mutation differed significantly between central and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also indicated the presence of mutation, tumor size, and cervical lymph node metastasis to be independent predictors for recurrence and distant metastasis.

Tumors with high MSI are characterized by a better prognosis. The BRAF oncogene has been linked to the MSI pathway in tumorogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine whether alterations in BRAF are related to MSI and whether they can result in differences in survival rates.;The study cohort comprised 351 patients diagnosed with sporadic colorectal cancer. MSI was determined in accordance with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) recommendations by means of PCR and sequence analyses. Mutational analysis of the BRAF gene was performed by real-time PCR and subsequent sequencing of the altered samples. The methylation pattern of the hMLH1 gene was determined using methylation-specific PCR analyses of bisulfite-treated DNA and the results confirmed by sequencing.;Of the patients tested, 6.9% showed high MSI and 3.7% showed a BRAF gene mutation. hMLH1 methylation was observed in 67.2% of the patients with MSI and/or the BRAF alteration. The BRAF mutation was related to the MSI genetic pathway (P < 0.0001) and with hMLH1 methylation. In the analysis of overall survival only MSI had an independent prognostic value for the risk of death. Patients with the BRAF mutation showed a higher risk of death, although this association was found not to be statistically significant.;There is a subgroup of carcinomas which develop via the MSI pathway that carry an alteration of the BRAF gene. This alteration confers a poorer outcome on these patients within the total group of patients with MSI who have a better prognosis. This hypothesis should be further investigated in a larger study population due to the low incidence of BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer.",

The functions of knockdown and ectopic expression of NrCAM in thyroid cancer cells were determine by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.;We found that NrCAM was highly expressed in PTCs, and demonstrated that NrCAM might be a potential marker for preoperative diagnosis of PTC. Moreover, NrCAM depletion dramatically inhibited thyroid cancer cell growth, invasiveness and tumorigenic potential in nude mice. On the other hand, ectopic expression of NrCAM significantly enhanced its tumor-promoting effects. Mechanically, NrCAM exerted its oncogenic function by activating MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways via its ectodomain shedding and binding to EGFR and α4β1 integrins. In turn, these two pathways were also responsible for NrCAM overexpression through GSK3β/β-catenin signaling axis in thyroid cancer cells.

Here, we undertook a comprehensive effort to define mechanisms underlying drug resistance with the goal of guiding development of therapeutic strategies to overcome this limitation. We generated a broad panel of BRAF-mutant resistant cell line models across seven different clinically relevant drug combinations. Combinatorial drug treatments were able to abrogate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in parental-sensitive cells, but not in their resistant counterparts, indicating that resistant cells escaped drug treatments through one or more mechanisms leading to biochemical reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Genotyping of resistant cells identified gene amplification of EGFR, KRAS, and mutant BRAF, as well as acquired mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and MAP2K1 These mechanisms were clinically relevant, as we identified emergence of a KRAS G12C mutation and increase of mutant BRAF V600E allele frequency in the circulating tumor DNA of a patient at relapse from combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. To identify therapeutic combinations capable of overcoming drug resistance, we performed a systematic assessment of candidate therapies across the panel of resistant cell lines. Independent of the molecular alteration acquired upon drug pressure, most resistant cells retained sensitivity to vertical MAPK pathway suppression when combinations of ERK, BRAF, and EGFR inhibitors were applied.

Inter-individual variability in treatment response and prognosis has been associated with genetic polymorphisms in specific genes: EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PTEN and TTF-1. Somatic mutations in EGFR and KRAS genes are reported at rates of 15-40% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in ethnically diverse populations. BRAF and PTEN are commonly mutated genes in various cancer types, including NSCLC, with PTEN mutations exerting an effect on the therapeutic response of EGFR/AKT/PI3K pathway inhibitors. TTF-1 is expressed in approximately 80% of lung adenocarcinomas and its positivity correlates with higher prevalence of EGFR mutation in this cancer type. To determine molecular markers for lung cancer in Brazilian patients, the rate of the predominant EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and PTEN mutations, as well as TTF-1 expression, was assessed in 88 Brazilian NSCLC patients. EGFR exon 19 deletions (del746-750) were detected in 3/88 (3·4%) patients. Activating KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 61 were noted in five (5·7%) and two (2·3%) patients, respectively.

As the drivers of this process, many genetic alterations activating the PI3K/Akt pathway have been identified in thyroid cancer in recent years.;This review summarizes the current knowledge on major genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. These include PIK3CA mutations and genomic amplification/copy gain, Ras mutations, PTEN mutations, RET/PTC and PPARgamma/Pax8 rearrangements, as well as amplification/copy gain of PIK3CB, PDK1, Akt, and various receptor tyrosine kinase genes. Most of these genetic alterations are particularly common in FTC and many of them are even more common in ATC; they are generally less common in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), in which the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway activated by the BRAF mutation instead plays a major role. Methylation and, thus, epigenetic silencing of PTEN, a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, occurs in close association with activating genetic alterations of the PI3K/Akt pathway, constituting a unique self-enhancement mechanism for this pathway. Many of these genetic alterations are mutually exclusive in differentiated thyroid tumors, but with increasing concurrence from benign tumors to FTC to ATC. RET/PTC, Ras, and receptor tyrosine kinase could dually activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Most cases of ATC harbor genetic alterations in these genes or other genetic combinations that can activate both pathways. It is proposed that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway promote thyroid cell transformation to FTC and that genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway promote cell transformation to PTC; accumulation of multiple genetic alterations that can activate both pathways promotes thyroid cancer aggressiveness and progression to ATC.;Genetic alterations are common in the PI3K/Akt pathway in thyroid cancer and play a fundamental role in the tumorigenesis and progression of this cancer. This provides a strong basis for the emerging development of novel genetic-based diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for thyroid cancer.",

A single amino acid substitution (V600E) accounts for the vast majority and results in constitutive activation of BRAF kinase function. Its expression is required to maintain the proliferative and oncogenic characteristics of BRAF(E600)-expressing human tumour cells. Although BRAF(E600) acts as an oncogene in the context of additional genetic lesions, in primary cells it appears to be associated rather with transient stimulation of proliferation. Eventually, BRAF(E600) signalling triggers cell cycle arrest with the hallmarks of cellular senescence, as is illustrated by several recent studies in cultured cells, animal models and benign human lesions. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of BRAF(E600) in benign and malignant human tumours and the implications for therapeutic intervention.",

Our previous limited data specifically suggested a possible pathogenic role of CCDC67 in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), but this has not been firmly established. The present study was to further investigate and establish this role of CCDC67 in PTC.;The expression of CCDC67, both at mRNA and protein levels, was sharply down-regulated in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissues. Lower CCDC67 expression was significantly associated with aggressive tumor behaviors, such as advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, as well as BRAF mutation. Introduced expression of CCDC67 in TPC-1 cells robustly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration, induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and increased cell apoptosis.;Primary PTC tumors and matched normal thyroid tissues were obtained from 200 unselected patients at the initial surgery for detection of CCDC67 mRNA and protein by RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses, respectively. Genomic DNA sequencing was performed to detect BRAF mutation in PTC tumors. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively reviewed for correlation analyses. PTC cell line TPC-1 with stable transfection of CCDC67 was used to investigate the functions of CCDC67.;This large study demonstrates down-regulation of CCDC67 in PTC, an inverse relationship between CCDC67 expression and PTC aggressiveness and BRAF mutation, and a robust inhibitory effect of CCDC67 on PTC cellular activities. These results are consistent with CCDC67 being a novel and impaired tumor suppressor gene in PTC, providing important prognostic and therapeutic implications for this cancer.",

Seven colon cancer cell lines and 116 colorectal tumors (34 adenomas and 82 adenocarcinomas) were analyzed. Genetic alterations in the BRAF and K-ras genes were examined using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing analyses. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of the FTI-277 RAS inhibitor in colon cancer cell lines were analyzed as well. An immunohistochemical study was also performed to investigate the correlations between the clinicopathologic parameters involved in the Ki-67 labeling index and the number of apoptotic bodies in tumor cells. FTI-277 did not suppress the proliferation of BRAF-mutant cells (WiDr and TCO), but remarkably inhibited the growth of K-ras mutant cells (LoVo). Interestingly, LoVo cells underwent apoptosis by FTI-277 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas WiDr cells were resistant to this agent. In tumor samples, BRAF mutations were found in 1 (3.0%) of 33 adenomas and 6 (7.2%) of 83 adenocarcinomas. No tumor exhibited mutations in both the BRAF and K-ras genes. Neither BRAF nor K-ras mutations correlated with the Ki-67 labeling index immunohistochemically. However, the number of apoptotic bodies was significantly decreased in the BRAF-mutant tumors. Mutation in the BRAF gene may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis by upregulating the antiapoptotic role of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.",

Several recent studies utilizing next generation sequencing techniques have shed lights on the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors, providing evidence to support a stepwise tumoral progression from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated, and finally to anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. While BRAF (V600E) and RAS mutations remain the main drivers in aggressive thyroid carcinoma, PDTC and ATC gains additional mutations, e.g., TERT promoter mutation, TP53 mutation, as well as frequent alterations in PIK3CA-PTEN-AKT-mTOR pathway, SWI-SNF complex, histomethyltransferases, and mismatch repair genes. RAS-mutated PDTCs are commonly associated with a histologic phenotype defined by Turin proposal, high frequency of distant metastasis, high thyroid differentiation score, and a RAS-like gene expression profile, whereas BRAF-mutated PDTCs are usually defined solely by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria with a propensity for nodal metastasis and are less differentiated with a BRAF-like expression signature. Such demarcation is largely lost in ATC which is characterized by genomic complexity, heavy mutation burden, and profound undifferentiation. Additionally, several molecular events, e.g., EIF1AX mutation, mutation burden, and chromosome 1q gain in PDTCs, as well as EIF1AX mutation, chromosome 13q loss, and 20q gains in ATCs, may serve as adverse prognostic markers predicting poor clinical outcome.

We performed cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, and a xenograft mouse model to determine the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of JQ1 in combination with Vemurafenib against BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. Further, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of combined treatment, we conducted antibody arrays of in vitro drug-treated cell lines and RNA sequencing of drug-treated xenograft tumors. The combination of JQ1 and Vemurafenib acted synergistically in BRAF-mutant cell lines, resulting in marked apoptosis in vitro, with upregulation of proapoptotic proteins. In vivo, combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either drug alone. RNA sequencing of tumor tissues revealed almost four thousand genes that were uniquely modulated by the combination, with several anti-apoptotic genes significantly down-regulated.

Compared to BRAF mutant melanoma cells, BRAF mutant CRC cells were less sensitive to vemurafenib, and P-ERK suppression was not sustained in response to treatment. Although transient inhibition of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib was observed in CRC, rapid ERK re-activation occurred through EGFR-mediated activation of RAS and CRAF. BRAF mutant CRCs expressed higher levels of phospho-EGFR than BRAF mutant melanomas, suggesting that CRCs are specifically poised for EGFR-mediated resistance. Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of MAPK signaling in BRAF mutant CRC cells and markedly improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings support evaluation of combined RAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAF mutant CRC patients.;BRAF valine 600 (V600) mutations occur in 10% to 15% of colorectal cancers, yet these tumors show a surprisingly low clinical response rate (~5%) to selective RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, which have produced dramatic response rates (60%–80%) in melanomas harboring the identical BRAF V600 mutation.

Here we demonstrate that human NSCLC cells with BRAF(V600E), but not other BRAF mutations, initially are sensitive to BRAF-inhibitor treatment. However, these BRAF(V600E) NSCLC cells rapidly acquire resistance to BRAF inhibition through at least one of two discrete molecular mechanisms: (i) loss of full-length BRAF(V600E) coupled with expression of an aberrant form of BRAF(V600E) that retains RAF pathway dependence or (ii) constitutive autocrine EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling driven by c-Jun-mediated EGFR ligand expression. BRAF(V600E) cells with EGFR-driven resistance are characterized by hyperphosphorylated protein kinase AKT, a biomarker we validated in BRAF inhibitor-resistant NSCLC clinical specimens. These data reveal the multifaceted molecular mechanisms by which NSCLCs establish and regulate BRAF oncogene dependence, provide insights into BRAF-EGFR signaling crosstalk, and uncover mechanism-based strategies to optimize clinical responses to BRAF oncogene inhibition.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in the Taiwanese population with colorectal cancer. This study was undertaken to identify BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in patients with colorectal cancer by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. HRM analysis is a new gene scan tool that quickly performs the PCR and identifies sequence alterations without requiring post-PCR treatment.;In the present study, DNAs were extracted from 182 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer samples for clinical KRAS mutational analysis by direct sequencing. All the samples were also tested for mutations within BRAF V600E and PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20) by HRM analysis.;The results were confirmed by direct sequencing. The frequency of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations is 1.1%, and 7.1%, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that nine patients (4.9%) with the KRAS mutation were coexistent with the PIK3CA mutation. Four patients (2.2%) without the KRAS mutation were existent with the PIK3CA mutation. Two patients (1.1%) without the KRAS mutation were existent with the BRAF mutation.;In the current study, we suppose that HRM analysis is rapid, feasible, and powerful diagnostic tool for the detection of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in a clinical setting.

We hypothesized that gene abnormality of negative modulators of these signaling pathways might be an important alternative genetic background for thyroid cancer.;By examining gene expression patterns of negative modulators of RAS signaling, we attempted to identify potential tumor suppressor genes. We then analyzed the methylation and mutation patterns of the identified gene in 101 thyroid tumors and tested its functions in vitro and in vivo to establish the tumor suppressor role in thyroid cancer.;Among 13 negative modulators of the RAS pathway screened, RASAL1, encoding a RAS GTPase-activating protein, was frequently hypermethylated in thyroid cancers, which was coupled to its silencing in thyroid cancer cells. We also, for the first time, identified the presence of RASAL1 mutations, with a prevalence of 4.88% (n = 2 of 41) in follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and 16.67% (n = 5 of 30) in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). RASAL1 displayed MAPK- and PI3K-suppressing and thyroid tumor-suppressing activities, which were all impaired by the mutations.

The diagnostic criteria remain inconsistent, and the role of a minor TC component is unclear. Molecular diagnostic markers are not available; however, there are two potential candidates: BRAF V600E and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. Using a novel approach, we enriched a collective with PTCs that harbored an adverse outcome, which overcame the limited statistical power of most studies. This enabled us to review 125 PTC patients, 57 of which had an adverse outcome. The proportion of TCs that constituted a poor prognosis was assessed. All of the tumors underwent sequencing for TERT promoter and BRAF V600E mutational status and were stained with an antibody to detect the BRAF V600E mutation. A 10% cutoff for TCs was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that TCs above 10% were the only significant factor for overall, tumor-specific, and relapse-free survival. Seven percent of the cases had a TERT promoter mutation, whereas 61% demonstrated a BRAF mutation. The presence of TC was significantly associated with TERT promoter and BRAF mutations. TERT predicted highly significant tumor relapse (P<0.001). PTCs comprised of at least 10% TCs are associated with an adverse clinical outcome and should be reported accordingly. BRAF did not influence patient outcome. Nevertheless, a positive status should encourage the search for TCs. TERT promoter mutations are a strong predictor of tumor relapse, but their role as a surrogate marker for TCs is limited. ",

However, various environmental factors, such as those associated with volcanic areas, cannot be excluded as risk factors. We evaluated thyroid cancer incidence in Sicily, which has a homogenous population and a province (Catania) that includes the Mt Etna volcanic area.;In a register-based epidemiological survey, we collected all incident thyroid cancers in Sicily from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2004. The age-standardized incidence rate for the world population (ASR(w)) was calculated and expressed as the number of thyroid cancer diagnoses per 100 000 residents per year. The association of thyroid cancer incidence rate with sex, age, tumor histotype, and various environmental factors was evaluated by modeling the variation of the ASR(w). All statistical tests were two-sided.;In 2002-2004, 1950 incident thyroid cancers were identified in Sicily (among women, ASR(w) = 17.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.9 to 18.7; and among men, ASR(w) = 3.7, 95% CI = 3.3 to 4.1). Although the percentage of thyroid cancers that were microcarcinomas (ie, < or = 10 mm) and ratio of men to women with thyroid cancer were similar in all nine Sicilian provinces, thyroid cancer incidence was statistically significantly higher in the province of Catania (among women, ASR(w) = 31.7, 95% CI = 29.1 to 34.3; and among men, ASR(w) = 6.4, 95% CI = 5.2 to 7.5) than in the rest of Sicily (among women, ASR(w) = 14.1, 95% CI = 13.2 to 15.0; and among men, ASR(w) = 3.0, 95% CI = 2.6 to 3.4) (all P values < .001). Incidence of papillary, but not follicular or medullary, cancers was statistically significantly increased in Catania province, and papillary tumors from patients in Catania more frequently carried the BRAF V600E gene mutation (55 [52%] of 106 tumors) than tumors from patients elsewhere in Sicily (68 [33%] of 205 tumors) (relative risk = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.8, P = .02). Cancer incidence was statistically significantly lower in rural areas than in urban areas of Sicily (P = .003). No association with mild iodine deficiency or industrial installations was found.

In the present study, an extensive characterization of BRAF and KRAS mutations has been performed in 264 epithelial and non-epithelial ovarian neoplasms. The epithelial tumours ranged from adenomas and borderline neoplasms to invasive carcinomas including serous, mucinous, clear cell, and endometrioid lesions. It is shown that BRAF mutations in ovarian tumours occur exclusively in low-grade serous neoplasms (33 of 91, 36%); these included serous borderline tumours (typical and micropapillary variants), an invasive micropapillary carcinoma and a psammocarcinoma. KRAS mutations were identified in 26 of 91 (29.5%) low-grade serous tumours, 7 of 49 (12%) high-grade serous carcinomas, 2 of 6 mucinous adenomas, 22 of 28 mucinous borderline tumours, and 10 of 18 mucinous carcinomas. Of note, two serous borderline tumours were found to harbour both BRAF and KRAS mutations.

Activating V600E mutation in BRAF gene has been linked with widespread methylation of CpG islands in sporadic colorectal cancers.

DNA from 110 unselected series of sporadic colorectal cancer patients was examined for BRAF V600E mutation by PCR-RFLP. Promoter methylation of genes in tumors was determined by methylation specific PCR. The frequency of APC2, E-CAD, and p14 methylation was 92.6%, 40.4% and 16.7%, respectively. But, no V600E mutation was identified in the BRAF gene in any sample. No association was found in cases showing epigenetic APC, ECAD, and p14 abnormality with the clinicopathological parameters under study. The association between KRAS mutations and the so called methylator phenotype was previously reported. Therefore, we also analyzed the association between the hot spot KRAS gene mutations in codons of 12 and 13 with genes' promoter hypermethylation in a subset of this group of patients. Out of 86 tumors, KRAS was mutated in 24 (28%) of tumors, the majority occurring in codon 12. KRAS mutations were not associated with genes' methylation in this tumor series.

Such mutations occur in approximately 70% of human malignant melanomas, and a single hyperactivating V600E mutation is found in the activation segment of the kinase domain and accounts for more than 90% of these mutations. Given this correlation, the molecular mechanism for BRAF regulation as well as oncogenic activation has attracted considerable interest, and activated forms of BRAF, such as BRAF(V600E), have become attractive targets for small molecule inhibition. Here we report on the identification and subsequent optimization of a potent BRAF inhibitor, CS292, based on an organometallic kinase inhibitor scaffold. A cocrystal structure of CS292 in complex with the BRAF kinase domain reveals that CS292 binds to the ATP binding pocket of the kinase and is an ATP competitive inhibitor. The structure of the kinase-inhibitor complex also demonstrates that CS292 binds to BRAF in an active conformation and suggests a mechanism for regulation of BRAF by phosphorylation and BRAF(V600E) oncogene-induced activation. The structure of CS292 bound to the active form of the BRAF kinase also provides a novel scaffold for the design of BRAF(V600E) oncogene selective BRAF inhibitors for therapeutic application.",

Multiple genetic surveys have been performed in PTCs, however, we are not aware of any such studies in aneuploid PTCs. In order to contribute to a better comprehension of the genetic basis of this neoplasm's more aggressive behaviour in 17 aneuploid PTCs we performed a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, studied the BRAF and RAS mutational status, searched for RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 rearrangements and determined their expression profile. Array results were validated by TaqMan and immunohistochemistry. CGH revealed multiple non-random chromosomal abnormalities. BRAFV600E and RAS mutations were found in 41.2% and 33% of the carcinomas respectively. None of the studied cases presented RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 rearrangement. When comparing array data with the chromosomal, mutational and clinical data we found that: a) loss of control of cellular transcription was of major relevance in this group of neoplasms, HMGA2 being one of the most overexpressed genes; b) gene expression correlated with the mutational status of PTCs, as in BRAF+ cases cMET and FN1 were concomitantly overexpressed; and c) death from disease and distant metastasis was associated to the overexpression of DDR2 and to the down-regulation of genes involved in immune, inflammatory response, signal transduction and cell adhesion processes. In conclusion we have identified in aneuploid PTCs a group of significantly altered molecules that may represent preferential targets for the development of new more efficient therapies in this type of cancer.",

The current review indicated that BRAF represents an important target in cancer, in part because it is present in 7% of all cancers and also because it represents the first intracellular signaling molecule that is activated by point mutations for which single-agent therapy appears to have efficacy. Therapy for advanced melanoma has progressed slowly over the past 3 decades, although significant advances have been made in other cancers with the application of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies. However, in melanoma, cytotoxic chemotherapies have severe limits, chemotherapy does not convincingly improve on the natural history of metastatic disease and has no role in the adjuvant setting, and cytokine therapy may have a niche in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings but confers only a modest benefit to a small proportion of patients at the cost of severe toxicity. Thus, there are few other cancers in which completely novel therapies are so highly prioritized in clinical research. Understanding network of signal-transduction pathways and how that network may adapt to BRAF inhibition or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition will point to the next generation of clinical trials investigating rational combination regimens. The current investigations in melanoma will create a set of hypotheses to be tested in each cancer that harbors BRAF mutations.",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common.

In FVPTCs, we observed ras mutation in 6 of 24 cases (25%), BRAF mutation in 1 of 13 cases (7.6%), and ret rearrangement in 5 of 12 cases (41.7%). In CPTCs, we found ras mutation in no case, BRAF mutation in 3 of 10 cases (30%), and ret rearrangement in 5 of 11 cases (45%). One FVPTC exhibited simultaneous ras mutation and ret/PTC1 rearrangement, and one CPTC harbored simultaneous BRAF mutation and ret/PTC3 rearrangement. Based on these findings, we concluded that ras mutation correlates with follicular differentiation of thyroid tumors whereas ret activation is associated with papillary nuclei but not with papillary architecture. ret activation is not exclusive of ras or BRAF mutation, whereas ras and BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive.

Both BRAF T1799A mutation and RET/PTC rearrangement were present in 6 (12.5%) cases of non-micro PTC. The level of PDGF-B expression in BRAF T1799A positive was higher than that in the negative, and the level of PDGF-B expression in RET/PTC3 was higher than that in RET/PTC1 (P < 0.05). The more advanced neoplasm stage was, the stranger PDGF-B expression was.;The incidence of BRAF T1799A mutation and RET/PTC rearrangement is higher in Qingdao. BRAF T1799A mutation and RET/PTC3 rearrangement in patients suggests a poorer prognosis than the negative one.

For PTCs, 29.4% and 35.3% had KRAS codon 12 GAT and GTT MF above the 95% upper confidence interval for the corresponding MFs in normal thyroid. The highest observed KRAS codon 12 GTT MFs were associated with tumors with follicular characteristics and relatively high levels of tumor necrosis.

Their effects in humans are not known.;We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib.;Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated. The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men. Nine patients had tumors with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had tumors with mutations of NRAS. Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations).

BRAFV600E is almost always found in PTC with a papillary or a mixed follicular/papillary architecture, being rarer in other subtypes of PTC.

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF(V600E) is the most common mutation found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB have been shown to play an important role in thyroid cancer. In particular, TIMP-1 binds its receptor CD63 on cell surface membrane and activates Akt signaling pathway, which is eventually responsible for its anti-apoptotic activity. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether interplay among these three factors exists and exerts a functional role in PTCs. To this purpose, 56 PTC specimens were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation, TIMP-1 expression, and NF-κB activation. We found that BRAF(V600E) mutation occurs selectively in PTC nodules and is associated with hyperactivation of NF-κB and upregulation of both TIMP-1 and its receptor CD63. To assess the functional relationship among these factors, we first silenced BRAF gene in BCPAP cells, harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation. We found that silencing causes a marked decrease in TIMP-1 expression and NF-κB binding activity, as well as decreased invasiveness. After treatment with specific inhibitors of MAPK pathway, we found that only sorafenib was able to increase IκB-α and reduce both TIMP-1 expression and Akt phosphorylation in BCPAP cells, indicating that BRAF(V600E) activates NF-κB and this pathway is MEK-independent. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BRAF(V600E) causes upregulation of TIMP-1 via NF-κB. TIMP-1 binds then its surface receptor CD63, leading eventually to Akt activation, which in turn confers antiapoptotic behavior and promotion of cell invasion. The recognition of this functional trilogy provides insight on how BRAF(V600E) determines cancer initiation, progression, and invasiveness in PTC, also identifying new therapeutic targets for the treatment of highly aggressive forms.",

In general, the factors involved in, and the mechanistic basis of, epigenetic silencing during cancer development are not well understood. We have recently described an epigenetic silencing pathway, directed by the oncogenic B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) variant BRAF(V600E), that mediates widespread epigenetic silencing in colorectal cancer (CRC). Notably, the BRAF(V600E) mutation is also present in 50-70% of melanomas. Here, we show that the same pathway we identified in CRC also directs epigenetic silencing of a similar set of genes in BRAF-positive melanoma. In both CRC and melanoma, BRAF(V600E) promotes epigenetic silencing through up-regulation of v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog G (MAFG), a transcriptional repressor with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. The elevated concentration of MAFG drives DNA binding on the promoter. Promoter-bound MAFG recruits a set of corepressors that includes its heterodimeric partner BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 1 (BACH1), the chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8), and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, resulting in hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing.

The tumors were genotyped for their common activating mutations: BRAF V600E point mutation, RET/PTC1 and 3 rearrangement and point mutations of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS. Principal component analysis based on the entire expression data set separated the PCs into three groups that were found to reflect tumor morphology and mutational status. By combining expression profiles with mutational status, we defined distinct expression profiles for the BRAF, RET/PTC and RAS mutation groups. Using small numbers of genes, a simple classifier was able to classify correctly the mutational status of all 40 tumors with known mutations. One tumor without a detectable mutation was predicted by the classifier to have a RET/PTC rearrangement and was shown to contain one by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Among the mutation-specific expression signatures were genes whose differential expression was a direct consequence of the mutation, as well as genes involved in a variety of biological processes including immune response and signal transduction. Expression of one mutation-specific differentially expressed gene, TPO, was validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and tissue arrays containing an independent set of tumors. The results demonstrate that mutational status is the primary determinant of gene expression variation within these tumors, a finding that may have clinical and diagnostic significance and predicts success for therapies designed to prevent the consequences of these mutations.",

Of them, only the BRAF V600E mutation has been validated independently as prognostic for overall survival and survival after relapse, while the prognostic value of KRAS mutation is still unclear. We investigated the prognostic value of BRAF and KRAS mutations in various contexts defined by stratifications of the patient population.;We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer from the PETACC-3 clinical trial (N = 1,423), by assessing the prognostic value of the BRAF and KRAS mutations in subpopulations defined by all possible combinations of the following clinico-pathological variables: T stage, N stage, tumor site, tumor grade and microsatellite instability status. In each such subpopulation, the prognostic value was assessed by log rank test for three endpoints: overall survival, relapse-free survival, and survival after relapse. The significance level was set to 0.01 for Bonferroni-adjusted p-values, and a second threshold for a trend towards statistical significance was set at 0.05 for unadjusted p-values. The significance of the interactions was tested by Wald test, with significance level of 0.05.;In stage II-III colorectal cancer, BRAF mutation was confirmed a marker of poor survival only in subpopulations involving microsatellite stable and left-sided tumors, with higher effects than in the whole population. There was no evidence for prognostic value in microsatellite instable or right-sided tumor groups. We found that BRAF was also prognostic for relapse-free survival in some subpopulations. We found no evidence that KRAS mutations had prognostic value, although a trend was observed in some stratifications. We also show evidence of heterogeneity in survival of patients with BRAF V600E mutation.;The BRAF mutation represents an additional risk factor only in some subpopulations of colorectal cancers, in others having limited prognostic value. However, in the subpopulations where it is prognostic, it represents a marker of much higher risk than previously considered. KRAS mutation status does not seem to represent a strong prognostic variable.",

We observed a low frequency of somatic alterations (relative to other carcinomas) and extended the set of known PTC driver alterations to include EIF1AX, PPM1D, and CHEK2 and diverse gene fusions. These discoveries reduced the fraction of PTC cases with unknown oncogenic driver from 25% to 3.5%. Combined analyses of genomic variants, gene expression, and methylation demonstrated that different driver groups lead to different pathologies with distinct signaling and differentiation characteristics. Similarly, we identified distinct molecular subgroups of BRAF-mutant tumors, and multidimensional analyses highlighted a potential involvement of oncomiRs in less-differentiated subgroups. Our results propose a reclassification of thyroid cancers into molecular subtypes that better reflect their underlying signaling and differentiation properties, which has the potential to improve their pathological classification and better inform the management of the disease.

The encapsulated form rarely metastasizes to lymph node, whereas infiltrative tumor often harbors nodal metastases. The molecular profile of the follicular variant was shown to be close to the follicular adenoma/carcinoma group of tumors with a high RAS and very low BRAF mutation rates. A comprehensive survey of oncogenic mutations in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma according to its encapsulated and infiltrative forms has not been performed. Paraffin tissue from 28 patients with encapsulated and 19 with infiltrative follicular variant were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in thyroid carcinomas: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1 and other related genes. There was no difference in age, gender, tumor size and angioinvasion between encapsulated or infiltrative tumors. Infiltrative carcinomas had a much higher frequency of extrathyroid extension, positive margins and nodal metastases than encapsulated tumors (P<0.05). The BRAF 1799T>A mutation was found in 5 of 19 (26%) of the infiltrative tumor and in none of the encapsulated carcinomas (P=0.007). In contrast, RAS mutations were observed in 10 of 28 (36%) of the encapsulated group (5 NRAS_Q61R, 3 HRAS_Q61, 1 HRAS_G13C and 1 KRAS_Q61R) and in only 2 of 19 (10%) of infiltrative tumors (P=0.09). One encapsulated carcinoma showed a PAX8/PPARgamma rearrangement, whereas two infiltrative tumors harbored RET/PTC fusions. Encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas have a molecular profile very close to follicular adenomas/carcinomas (high rate of RAS and absence of BRAF mutations). Infiltrative follicular variant has an opposite molecular profile closer to classical papillary thyroid carcinoma than to follicular adenoma/carcinoma (BRAF>RAS mutations). The molecular profile of encapsulated and infiltrative follicular variant parallels their biological behavior (ie, metastatic nodal and invasive patterns).",

Associations with cancer-specific survival (CSS) were explored by Cox proportional hazards regression, unadjusted and adjusted for age, TNM stage, differentiation grade, vascular invasion and microsatellite instability (MSI) status.;KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. KRAS mutations were found in 191/ 525 (36.4%) cases, 82.2% of these mutations were in codon 12, 17.3% were in codon 13, and 0.5% cases had mutations in both codons. BRAF mutations were found in 78/524 (14.9%) cases. Overall, mutation in KRAS codon 13, but not codon 12, was associated with a significantly reduced CSS in unadjusted, but not in adjusted analysis, and BRAF mutation did not significantly affect survival. However, in microsatellite stable (MSS), but not in MSI tumours, an adverse prognostic impact of BRAF mutation was observed in unadjusted, but not in adjusted analysis. While KRAS mutation status was not significantly associated with sex, BRAF mutations were more common in women. BRAF mutation was not prognostic in women; but in men, BRAF mutation was associated with a significantly reduced CSS in overall adjusted analysis (HR = 3.50; 95% CI = 1.41-8.70), but not in unadjusted analysis.

Evidence suggests that BRAF mutations, like KRAS mutations, result in uncontrolled, non-growth factor-dependent cellular proliferation. Similar to the rationale that KRAS mutation precludes effective treatment with anti-EGFR drugs. Recently, BRAF mutation testing has been introduced into routine clinical laboratories because its significance has become clearer in terms of effect on pathogenesis of CRC, utility in differentiating sporadic CRC from Lynch syndrome (LS), prognosis, and potential for predicting patient outcome in response to targeted drug therapy.

Additionally, a mouse anti-human BRAF monoclonal antibody was tested on 30 FFPE tumor samples with known BRAF status. KRAS immunostaining demonstrated both poor sensitivity (27%) and specificity (64%) in detecting KRAS mutation. Conversely, BRAF immunohistochemistry showed perfect sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) in detecting V600E mutation.

Here, we investigated the role of ARAF in cancer cell signaling and examined the role of ARAF in mediating paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in cells treated with RAF inhibitors. We show that two mutations that occur in ARAF in cancer inactivate the kinase. We also show that ARAF is not functionally redundant with CRAF and cannot substitute for CRAF downstream of RAS.

This study was to identify BRAF V600E-associated oncogenic pathways that predict resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We took in silico approaches to analyze the activities of 24 cancer-related pathways in melanoma cells and identify those whose activation was associated with BRAF V600E and used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We then experimentally confirmed the in silico findings. In a microarray gene expression dataset of 63 melanoma cell lines, we found that activation of multiple oncogenic pathways preferentially occurred in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. This finding was reproduced in 5 additional independent melanoma datasets. Further analysis of 46 melanoma cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation showed that 7 pathways, including TNFα, EGFR, IFNα, hypoxia, IFNγ, STAT3, and MYC, were significantly differently expressed in AZD6244-resistant compared with responsive melanoma cells. A SVM classifier built on this 7-pathway activation pattern correctly predicted the response of 10 BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in our experiments. We experimentally showed that TNFα, EGFR, IFNα, and IFNγ pathway activities were also upregulated in melanoma cell A375 compared with its sub-line DRO, while DRO was much more sensitive to AZD6244 than A375. In conclusion, we have identified specific oncogenic pathways preferentially activated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells and a pathway pattern that predicts resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, providing novel clinical implications for melanoma therapy.

Differences in the biology and clinical course of Dtc in children, when compared with adults, may be related both to pathogenesis as well as to clinical outcome of the disease. In childhood, the thyroid gland exhibits higher susceptibility to the carcinogenetic effect of ionizating radiation than in adulthood. Papillary thyroid cancer (Ptc) is more prevalent in children in comparison to adult patients. Among molecular events known to occur in papillary thyroid carcinoma, rEt/Ptc rearrangements exhibit higher prevalence in younger patients, while brAF mutations are very rare in this age group. cancer disease presents at a more advanced stage: 1) primary tumour at diagnosis is larger, especially in relation to the volume of the whole gland; 2) neck lymph node involvement is more commonly observed; 3) distant metastases are detected 3-4 times more frequently than in adults. the lungs are almost the sole distant metastatic site in children and pulmonary metastases are nearly always functional. Additionally, recurrence rates tend to be higher in children; nevertheless, cause-specific cancer mortality remains low. Up to now, thyroid cancer guidelines have been formulated on the basis of experience gained in the general population of patients. the peculiarities in childhood disease raise the question of whether it should be considered a distinct subtype, with specifically tailored therapy recommendations. A definitive answer to this question is not possible with the present state of knowledge. In the opinion of the authors, molecular analyses of childhood thyroid cancer may be crucial, as the clinical data have not satisfactorily answered this question.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of thyroid cancer in patients with acromegaly and to investigate the frequency of the BRAFV600E mutation in PTC patients with and without acromegaly.;We conducted a retrospective study of 60 patients with acromegaly. Thyroid ultrasonography (US) and US-guided fine needle aspiration were performed on nodules with sonographic features of malignancy. We selected 16 patients with non-acromegalic PTC as a control group. The BRAFV600E mutation was analyzed in paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of PTC by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and tumor specimens from patients with PTC were stained immunohistochemically with an antibody against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β (IGF-1Rβ).;Thyroid cancer was found in 15 (25.0%) patients. No differences in age, sex, initial growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 percentage of the upper limit of normal values or treatment modalities were observed between patients with and without PTC. Acromegaly was active in 12 of 15 patients at the time of PTC diagnosis; uncontrolled acromegaly had a significantly higher frequency in the PTC group (60%) than in the non-PTC group (28.9%) (p = 0.030). The BRAFV600E mutation was present in only 9.1% (1/11) of PTC patients with acromegaly, although 62.5% (10/16) of control patients with PTC had the mutation (p = 0.007). IGF-1Rβ immunostaining showed moderate-to-strong staining in all malignant PTC cells in patients with and without acromegaly. Significantly less staining for IGF-1Rβ was observed in normal adjacent thyroid tissues of PTC patients with acromegaly compared with those without (p = 0.014).;The prevalence of PTC in acromegalic patients was high (25%). An uncontrolled hyperactive GH-IGF-1 axis may play a dominant role in the development of PTC rather than the BRAFV600E mutation in patients with acromegaly.",

US features were categorized according to the internal components, echogenicity, margin, calcifications, and shape. Suspicious US features included markedly hypoechogenicity, noncircumscribed margins, micro or mixed calcifications, and nonparallel shape. Nodules were considered to have either concordant or discordant US features to benign cytology. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed for final cytopathology results and outcomes during follow-up.;Among the 22 nodules, 17 nodules were reviewed. Fifteen of 17 nodules were malignant, and 2 were benign.

The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of different mutations in pediatric WDTC and correlate the genotype with the clinical phenotype.;This is a single-center retrospective study. Thyroid tissue blocks from 42 consecutive pediatric WDTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy between 2001 and 2013 were analyzed at Quest Diagnostics for BRAF(V600E), RAS mutations (N,K,H), and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements, using validated molecular methods. Thyroid carcinomas included PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC).;Thirty-nine samples (29 females) were genotyped.

Mutations were noted in 21/39 (53.8%), with both BRAF(V600E) (n = 9), and RET/PTC (n = 6) detected only in PTC. Mutations were detected in 2/5 FTC (PAX8/PPARγ and NRAS) and 3/6 FVPTC cases (PAX8/PPARγ). Of 28 PTC patients, 57.1% had mutations: 32.1% with BRAF(V600E), 21.4% with RET/PTC, and 3.6% with NRAS. Of patients with BRAF(V600E), 77.8% were Hispanic and 88.9% were >15 years, while all RET/PTC-positive patients were ≤15 years (p = 0.003).

BRAF mutation status is determined by DNA-based methods, most commonly by sequencing.

A total of 47 intracerebral melanoma metastases and 21 primary papillary thyroid carcinomas were evaluated by direct sequencing of BRAF and by immunohistochemistry using the BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody clone VE1. Correlation of VE1 immunohistochemistry and BRAF sequencing revealed a perfect match for both papillary thyroid carcinomas and melanoma metastases. The staining intensity in BRAF V600E mutated tumor samples ranged from weak to strong. The generally homogenous VE1 staining patterns argue against a clonal heterogeneity of the tumors investigated. Caution is essential when only poorly preserved tissue is available for VE1 immunohistochemical analysis or when tissues with only little total BRAF protein are analyzed. Immunohistochemistry using antibody VE1 may substantially facilitate molecular analysis of BRAF V600E status for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes.",

This combination leads to efficient apoptosis specifically in KRAS- and BRAF-mutant but not wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer cells. This specific susceptibility results from TORC1/2 inhibition leading to suppression of MCL-1 expression in mutant, but not WT, colorectal cancers, leading to abrogation of BIM/MCL-1 complexes. This combination strategy leads to tumor regressions in both KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of colorectal cancer, but not in the corresponding KRAS-WT colorectal cancer models.

Treatment of GSR cells with GSK2118436 enhanced EGFR-mediated RAS activity, leading to the formation of BRAF-CRAF dimers and transactivation of CRAF. Interestingly, sustained activation of ERK1/2 was partly dependent on receptor-interacting protein kinase-2 (RIP2) activity, but not on MEK1/2 activity.

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

In the first patient, histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated an MTC in the one nodule and PTC in two additional lesions. Non-neoplastic thyroid parenchyma separated the three nodules. Metastasis from PTC was diagnosed in a regional lymph node. Genetic analysis of both tumour components showed a distinctive mutational pattern: in the MTC a Cys634Arg substitution in exon 11 of the RET gene and in the two PTC foci a Val600Glu substitution in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The other two patients are members of a large multigenerational family affected with familial MTC due to a germline mutation of the RET gene (Ala891Ser). Both patients harboured, besides medullary cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, distinct foci of papillary thyroid cancer, which was positive for Val600Glu BRAF mutation. Review of the literature disclosed 18 similar lesions reported and allowed the identification of different patterns of clinical presentation and biological behaviour. So far, the pathogenesis of these peculiar cases of thyroid malignancy has been completely unknown, but an underlying common genetic drive has been hypothesised. This is the first report in which two mutations, in the RET and BRAF genes, have been identified in three cases of MTC/PTC collision tumour, thus documenting the different genetic origin of these two coexisting carcinomas.",

We established a maximally selected cutoff to discriminate Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.

Mig-6 expression above the cutoff of 1.10 (2;-dCt[Mig6-GUS]) was associated with greater survival (P = .008). When this cutoff was applied in the cross-validation, high Mig-6 expression was associated with longer survival (P = .03) and disease-free survival (P = .07). Furthermore, high Mig-6 expression was independently predictive of greater disease-free survival in BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.;High Mig-6 expression in PTC is associated with favorable outcomes.

On the other hand, the MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway) and PI3K/Akt (lipid kinase phoshoinositid-3-kinase signaling pathway) play an important role in the transmission of cell signals. The genes, coding the signaling cascade proteins (RET, RAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN, AKT), are mutated or aberrantly expressed in thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyroid cells. Genetic and epigenetic alternations, concerning MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, contribute to their activation and interaction as a consequence of malignant follicular cell transformation. The understanding of this molecular mechanism provides access to novel molecular prognostic and therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the oncogenic activity of the signaling pathways. This ability to investigate tumour biology allows for the selection of different drugs. Nowadays the most relevant are treatments directed to tyrosine kinase receptors that bind for a wide variety of ligands and are frequently mutated and induce a constitutive activation such that a chimerical protein expression takes place in follicular cells in the domain of RET, as well as in other receptors. Many molecules such as: motesanib, sorafenib, vandetanib, sunitinib, XL-184, imatinib, axitinib, pazopanib, lenvatinib, combretastatin, gefitinib, cetuximab, bortezomib and thiazoldonedione have been developed. Some of them also can act in receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors. Information obtained through cytological or biopsy samples permits the study of complex metabolic or genetic pathways, thus providing researchers with a high throughput tool for elucidating changes in the global expression patterns seen in tumour cells and allowing for different therapeutic strategies in thyroid cancer which take into account the predominant altered pathways observed in these samples.",

Both mutations are able to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling transduction pathway leading to cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PD0325901 is a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor and therefore is a promising drug to treat thyroid cancers with either RET/PTC or BRAF mutation. In this study we tested the effects of PD0325901 on PTC cells harboring either mutation in vitro by growth curves and Western blots and in vivo using a murine orthotopic xenograft model. We found that 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) by PD0325901 was 11 nmol/L for the PTC cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement and 6.3 nmol/L for PTC cells with a BRAF mutation, with both concentrations readily achievable in serum. After 1 week of oral administration of PD0325901 (20-25 mg/kg/day) in mice, no tumor growth was detected in mice inoculated with PTC cells bearing a BRAF mutation. For PTC with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, the average tumor volume of the orthotopic tumor was reduced by 58% as compared with controls. In conclusion, our data suggested that PTC cells carrying a BRAF mutation were more sensitive to PD0325901 than were PTC cells carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Our findings support the clinical evaluation of PD0325901 for patients with PTC and potentially other carcinomas with BRAF mutations.",

ACT-SNAIL cells showed slightly but significantly enhanced tumor formation ability in an in vitro sphere assay (approximately 3-fold) but not an in vivo subcutaneous tumor growth assay, and showed comparable chemosensitivity compared with the parental ACT-1 cells. However, of interest, although the in vitro sphere-formation ability of ALDH(+) cells was almost unchanged after SNAIL induction, SNAIL overexpression induced much higher (approximately 14-fold) spheres in ALDH(-) cells.

Cells were incubated with IFNγ (1, 10, 100, and 1000 U/mL) alone or in combination with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 24 hours. CXCL8 and CXCL10 concentrations were measured in the cell supernatants. IFNγ inhibited in a dose-dependent and significant manner both the basal (ANOVA F: 22.759; p < 0.00001) and the TNFα-stimulated (ANOVA F: 15.309; p < 0.00001) CXCL8 secretions in BCPAP but not in TPC-1 cells (NS). On the other hand, IFNγ and IFNγ + TNF-α induced a significant secretion of CXCL10 in both BCPAP (p < 0.05) and TPC-1 (p < 0.05) cells. Transwell migration assay showed that (i) CXCL8 increased cell migration in both TPC-1 and BCPAP cells; (ii) IFNγ significantly reduced the migration only of BCPAP cells; and (iii) CXCL8 reverted the effect of IFNγ. These results constitute the first demonstration that IFNγ inhibits CXCL8 secretion and in turn the migration of a BRAF V600e mutated thyroid cell line. ",

Knowledge of the concordance between primary-metastasis pairs and the impact of BRAF(V600E) on outcome would also assist in optimal drug development. We selected primary CRCs from 525 patients (stages I-IV) evenly matched for age (<70 and ≥70), gender and tumor location (right, left and rectum), and 81 primary-metastasis pairs. BRAF(V600E), KRAS mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) were determined and correlated with clinical features and patient outcomes. In multivariate analyses, increasing patient age (p = 0.04), female gender (p = 0.0005) and right-sided tumor location (p < 0.0001) were independently associated with BRAF(V600E). The prevalence of BRAF(V600E) was considerably higher in older (age > 70) females with KRAS wild-type right-sided colon cancers (50%) compared to the unselected cohort (10%). BRAF(V600E) was associated with inferior overall survival in metastatic CRC (HR = 2.02; 95% CI 1.26-3.26), particularly evident in patients treated with chemotherapy, and is independent of MSI status. BRAF status was concordant in all primary tumors and matched metastases (79 wild-type pairs and two mutant pairs). Clinicopathological and molecular features can identify CRC patients with a higher prevalence of BRAF(V600E). Patients with BRAF(V600E) wild-type primary tumor do not appear to acquire the mutation in their metastases, and BRAF(V600E) is associated with poorer outcomes in metastatic patients.

Recently, let-7 microRNA was found to reduce RAS levels in lung cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor gene. Here, we report that RET/PTC3 oncogenic activation in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells markedly reduces let-7f expression. Moreover, stable transfection of let-7 microRNA in TPC-1 cells, which harbor RET/PTC1 rearrangement, inhibits MAPK activation. As a result, let-7f was capable of reducing TPC-1 cell growth, and this might be explained, at least in part, by decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell cycle stimulators such as MYC and CCND1 (cyclin D1) and increased P21 cell cycle inhibitor mRNA. In addition, let-7 enhanced transcriptional expression of molecular markers of thyroid differentiation such as TITF1 and TG. Thus, reduced expression of let-7f might be an essential molecular event in RET/PTC malignant transformation. Moreover, let-7f effects on thyroid growth and differentiation might attenuate neoplastic process of RET/PTC papillary thyroid oncogenesis through impairment of MAPK signaling pathway activation.

Yet how oncogenic alterations interact to control cellular hierarchies during tumor initiation and progression is largely unknown. We found that oncogenic BRAF modulates gene expression associated with cell differentiation in colon cancer cells. We therefore engineered a mouse with an inducible oncogenic BRAF transgene, and analyzed BRAF effects on cellular hierarchies in the intestinal epithelium in vivo and in primary organotypic culture. We demonstrate that transgenic expression of oncogenic BRAF in the mouse strongly activated MAPK signal transduction, resulted in the rapid development of generalized serrated dysplasia, but unexpectedly also induced depletion of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) pool. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that ISCs collectively converted to short-lived progenitor cells after BRAF activation. As Wnt/β-catenin signals encourage ISC identity, we asked whether β-catenin activity could counteract oncogenic BRAF. Indeed, we found that intestinal organoids could be partially protected from deleterious oncogenic BRAF effects by Wnt3a or by small-molecule inhibition of GSK3β. Similarly, transgenic expression of stabilized β-catenin in addition to oncogenic BRAF partially prevented loss of stem cells in the mouse intestine. We also used BRAF(V637E) knock-in mice to follow changes in the stem cell pool during serrated tumor progression and found ISC marker expression reduced in serrated hyperplasia forming after BRAF activation, but intensified in progressive dysplastic foci characterized by additional mutations that activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our study suggests that oncogenic alterations activating the MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways must be consecutively and coordinately selected to assure stem cell maintenance during colon cancer initiation and progression. Notably, loss of stem cell identity upon induction of BRAF/MAPK activity may represent a novel fail-safe mechanism protecting intestinal tissue from oncogene activation. ",

Investigating the cellular response to the expression of mutant BRAF in nontransformed epithelial cells is fundamental to the understanding of the roles of BRAF in cancer pathogenesis. In this study, we used two nontransformed cyst108 and RK3E epithelial cell lines as models in which to compare the phenotypes of cells expressing BRAF(WT) and BRAF(V600E). We found that transfection of the BRAF(V600E), but not the BRAF(WT), expression vector suppressed cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in both cell types. BRAF(V600E) generated reactive oxygen species, induced DNA double-strand breaks, and caused subsequent DNA damage response as evidenced by an increased number of pCHK2 and γH2AX nuclear foci as well as the up-regulation of pCHK2, p53, and p21. Because BRAF and KRAS (alias Ki-ras) mutations have been correlated with GLUT1 up-regulation, which encodes glucose transporter-1, we demonstrated here that expression of BRAF(V600E), but not BRAF(WT), was sufficient to up-regulate GLUT1. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into mutant BRAF-induced oncogenic stress that is manifested by DNA damage and growth arrest by activating the pCHK2-p53-p21 pathway in nontransformed cells, while it also confers tumor-promoting phenotypes such as the up-regulation of GLUT1 that contributes to enhanced glucose metabolism that characterizes tumor cells.",

This mutation results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 600 of the BRAF protein, which consequently becomes constitutively activated. The present study investigated the BRAF V600E mutation frequency and its clinical implications in a group of 77 primary cutaneous melanoma patients treated in a cancer reference center in Brazil. Mutation analysis was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and automated DNA sequencing. The chi-squared and Fischer exact tests were used for comparative analyses. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 54/77 (70.1%) melanoma subjects. However, no statistically significant association was found between the presence of the mutation and clinical or prognostic parameters. Our results demonstrated that the BRAF V600E mutation is a common event in melanomas, representing an important molecular target for novel therapeutic approaches in such tumors. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common adult thyroid malignancy and often presents with multiple anatomically distinct foci within the thyroid, known as multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (MPTC). The widespread application of the next-generation sequencing technologies in cancer genomics research provides novel insights into determining the clonal relationship between multiple tumours within the same thyroid gland. For eight MPTC patients, we performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted region sequencing to identify the non-synonymous point mutations and gene rearrangements of distinct and spatially separated tumour foci. Among these eight MPTCs, completely discordant mutational spectra were observed in the distinct cancerous nodules of patients MPTC1 and 5, suggesting that these nodules originated from independent precursors. In another three cases (MPTC2, 6, and 8), the distinct MPTC foci of these patients had no other shared mutations except BRAF V600E, also indicating likely independent origins. Two patients (MPTC3 and 4) shared almost identical mutational spectra amongst their separate tumour nodules, suggesting a common clonal origin. MPTC patient 7 had seven cancer foci, of which two foci shared 66.7% of mutations, while the remaining cancer foci displayed no common non-synonymous mutations, indicating that MPTC7 has multiple independent origins accompanied by intraglandular disease dissemination. In this study, we found that 75% of MPTC cases arose as independent tumours, which supports the field cancerization hypothesis describing multiple malignant lesions. MPTC may also arise from intrathyroidal metastases from a single malignant clone, as well as multiple independent origins accompanied by intrathyroidal metastasis.",

OBJECTIVES To define the relative risk of PTC in patients with CM, and vice versa, and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses by using a unique population research database; and to assess the rate of BRAF v600e mutation in a group of patients with both diagnoses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective rev iew using the Utah Population Database (which is linked to medical records and the Utah Cancer Registry from 1966 to 2011) and tissue analysis in a tertiary care facility. Included were 4460 patients diagnosed with PTC and 14 569 with CM in Utah between 1966 and 2011 and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses. These were compared at a 5:1 ratio with matched, population-based controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statistically significant increased risk of PTC in patients with CM, and vice versa, and any first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses; and a significantly higher rate of BRAF v600e mutation in patients with both PTC and CM than would be expected for each individual condition alone. RESULTS Patients with CM had a 2.3-fold increased risk (P < .001) of being diagnosed as having PTC compared with population-based matched controls. Conversely, patients with PTC had a 1.8-fold increased risk (P < .001) of developing CM. First- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses of patients with PTC or CM did not show a statistically significant increased risk. Eight patients with both cancer diagnoses had tissue specimens tested, of which 4 (50%) were found to be positive for the BRAF v600e mutation in either their PTC or CM specimen, and 3 (38%) were found positive in both. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with either PTC or CMhave an increased risk of developing the other cancer as a second primary malignant neoplasm. Tissue specimens from patients with both cancers show a high rate of BRAF v600e mutation. Translational studies are needed to better define the associated genetic predisposition between PTC and CM and to test the efficacy of and implementation techniques for treatment plans using BRAF mutation as a therapeutic target.",

We investigated BRAF(V600E) mutation in 631 patients with papillary carcinoma having median follow-up periods of 83 months. The prevalence of BRAF(V600E) mutation was 38.4%, and the rate was higher in carcinoma larger than 1.0 cm but did not successively increase with tumor size. Furthermore, the prevalence did not significantly increase in cases demonstrating high-risk biological features such as clinically apparent lymph node metastasis, massive extrathyroid extension, advanced age, distant metastasis at surgery, and advanced Stage. The disease-free survival of patients with BRAF(V600E) mutation did not differ from that of those without BRAF(V600E) mutation.

Although previous studies have shown synergistic activity when pan-PI3K inhibitors were combined with MAPK inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma exhibiting concurrent genetic abnormalities, overlapping adverse events in patients limit optimal dosing and clinical application. With the aim of specifically targeting PTEN-deficient cancers and minimizing the potential for on-target toxicity when inhibiting multiple PI3K isoforms, we developed a program to discover PI3Kβ-selective kinase inhibitors and identified SAR260301 as a potent PI3Kβ-selective, orally available compound, which is now in clinical development. Herein, we provide a detailed biological characterization of SAR260301, and show that this compound has outstanding biochemical and cellular selectivity for the PI3Kβ isoform versus the α, δ, and γ isoforms and a large panel of protein and lipid kinases. We demonstrate that SAR260301 blocks PI3K pathway signaling preferentially in PTEN-deficient human tumor models, and has synergistic antitumor activity when combined with vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) or selumetinib (MEK inhibitor) in PTEN-deficient/BRAF-mutated human melanoma tumor models. Combination treatments were very well tolerated, suggesting the potential for a superior safety profile at optimal dosing using selective compounds to inhibit multiple signaling pathways. Together, these experiments provide a preclinical proof-of-concept for safely combining inhibitors of PI3Kβ and BRAF or MEK kinase modulators to improve antitumor activity in PTEN-deficient/BRAF-mutant melanoma, and support the evaluation of SAR260301-based combinations in clinical studies.

Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy. In this study, 239 samples obtained from 215 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were tested for the presence of the seven most common mutations in the KRAS gene and the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Among the tested patients, 53.8% of patients had wt-KRAS genotype and 46.2% were KRAS mutants. Around five percent (5.1%) of the tested patients bore the V600E mutation in BRAF gene. All the patients showing to have the V600E mutation in BRAF were wt-KRAS. The concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status between primary and metastatic tumor tissue samples was 100%. We have shown that the proportions of mutated and non-mutated KRAS in Slovene patients, as well as the proportion of V600E mutations in BRAF is similar to genotyping results reported by other authors. The tested seven KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 were mutually exclusive with the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Summing up the results about the KRAS and the BRAF mutation carriers from our study, the portion of potentially non-responsive patients for the anti-EGFR treatment is 51.3%.",

The study was performed on 66 PTC patients who underwent surgical tumor resection between January and December 2012. Polymerase chain reaction-based DNA amplification was used to analyze extracted DNA from the tumor specimens in order to determine the prevalence of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis was employed in order to evaluate the protein expression of p53 in sections of tumor tissue. Furthermore, statistical analysis was performed in order to determine any associations among the BRAF (V600E) mutation prevalence, p53 overexpression and the clinicopathological features of PTC patients, including age, gender, tumor size, multiplicity, lymph node metastasis and extrathyroidal extension. The results revealed that the BRAF (V600E) mutation was observed in 50 (75.8%) of the 66 PTC patients and overexpression of p53 was found in 52 (78.8%) of 66 cases.

Using a conditional knock-in mouse model, we show that endogenous expression of (L597V)Braf leads to approximately twofold elevated Braf kinase activity and weak activation of the Mek/Erk pathway. This is associated with induction of RASopathy hallmarks including cardiac abnormalities and facial dysmorphia but is not sufficient for tumor formation. We combined (L597V)Braf with (G12D)Kras and found that (L597V)Braf modified (G12D)Kras oncogenesis such that fibroblast transformation and lung tumor development were more reminiscent of that driven by the high-activity (V600E)Braf mutant. Mek/Erk activation levels were comparable with those driven by (V600E)Braf in the double-mutant cells, and the gene expression signature was more similar to that induced by (V600E)Braf than (G12D)Kras. However, unlike (V600E)Braf, Mek/Erk pathway activation was mediated by both Craf and Braf, and ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors induced paradoxical Mek/Erk pathway activation. Our data show that weak activation of the Mek/Erk pathway underpins RASopathies, but in cancer, (L597V)Braf epistatically modifies the transforming effects of driver oncogenes.",

However, immunohistochemical results on ERK activation in such tumors differ greatly. Recently, using a highly optimized immunohistochemical method, we obtained evidence that high levels of ERK activation in rectal adenocarcinomas were associated with resistance to radiochemotherapy. In order to determine whether KRAS and/or BRAF mutations correlate to immunohistochemically detectable increases in phosphorylation of ERK (pERK), we stained biopsies from 36 CRC patients with activating mutations in the BRAF gene (BRAFV600E: BRAF(m)), the KRAS gene (KRAS(m)) or in neither (BRAF/KRAS(n)) with this optimized method. Staining was scored in blind-coded specimens by two observers. Staining of stromal cells was used as a positive control. BRAF(m) or KRAS(m) tumors did not show higher staining scores than BRAF/KRAS(n) tumors. Although BRAFV600E staining occurred in over 90% of cancer cells in all 9 BRAF(m) tumors, 3 only showed staining for pERK in less than 10% of cancer cell nuclei. The same applied to 4 of the 14 KRAS(m) tumors. A phophorylation-insensitive antibody demonstrated that lack of pERK staining did not reflect defect expression of ERK1/2 protein. Thus, increased staining for pERK does not correlate to BRAF or KRAS mutations even with a highly optimized procedure. Further studies are required to determine whether this reflects differences in expression of counterregulatory molecules, including ERK phosphatases. ",

We hypothesized that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the BRaf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta kinase, would decrease tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of ATC. The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined. To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily. Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied. Sorafenib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines. Sorafenib also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. As result, the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved. Sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the BRAF mutational status of thyroid tumors. Given the lack of curative options for patients with ATC, sorafenib warrants further study as a therapeutic agent against ATC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF functions in the RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Activation of this pathway is necessary to mediate the transforming potential of oncogenic BRAF, however, it may also cause a negative feedback that inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mitogen-inducible gene-6 (MIG-6) is a potent inhibitor of the EGFR and has been demonstrated to function as a tumor suppressor. As MIG-6 can be induced via RAS-ERK signaling, we investigated its potential involvement in this negative regulatory loop. Focus formation assays were performed and demonstrated that MIG-6 significantly reduces malignant transformation induced by oncogenic BRAF. Although this genetic interaction was mirrored by a physical interaction between MIG-6 and BRAF, we did not observe a direct regulation of BRAF kinase activity by MIG-6. Interestingly, a selective chemical EGFR inhibitor suppressed transformation to a similar degree as MIG-6, whereas combining these approaches had no synergistic effect. By analyzing a range of BRAF mutated and wildtype cell line models, we could show that BRAF V600E causes a strong upregulation of MIG-6, which was mediated at the transcriptional level via the RAS-ERK pathway and resulted in downregulation of EGFR activation. This feedback loop is operational in tumors, as shown by the analysis of almost 400 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Presence of BRAF V600E correlated with increased MIG-6 expression on the one hand, and with inactivation of the EGFR and of PI3K/AKT signaling on the other hand. Importantly, we also observed a more aggressive disease phenotype when BRAF V600E coexisted with low MIG-6 expression. Finally, analysis of methylation data was performed and revealed that higher methylation of MIG-6 correlated to its decreased expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that MIG-6 efficiently reduces cellular transformation driven by oncogenic BRAF by orchestrating a negative feedback circuit directed towards the EGFR. ",

Animal models that more faithfully recapitulate genotype-specific human pathology could improve the predictive value of these investigations. Here, a newly identified animal model for oncogenic BRAF-driven cancers is described. With 20,000 new cases in the United States each year, canine invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (InvTCC) is a common, naturally occurring malignancy that shares significant histologic, biologic, and clinical phenotypes with human muscle invasive bladder cancer. In order to identify somatic drivers of canine InvTCC, the complete transcriptome for multiple tumors was determined by RNAseq. All tumors harbored a somatic mutation that is homologous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation, and an identical mutation was present in 87% of 62 additional canine InvTCC tumors. The mutation was also detectable in the urine sediments of all dogs tested with mutation-positive tumors. Functional experiments suggest that, like human tumors, canine activating BRAF mutations potently stimulate the MAPK pathway. Cell lines with the mutation have elevated levels of phosphorylated MEK, compared with a line with wild-type BRAF. This effect can be diminished through application of the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor vemurafenib. These findings set the stage for canine InvTCC as a powerful system to evaluate BRAF-targeted therapies, as well as therapies designed to overcome resistance, which could enhance treatment of both human and canine cancers;This study demonstrates the activating BRAF mutation (V600E), which is found in multiple human cancers, is a driver of canine InvTCC, and highlights a urine-based test for quick diagnosis.",

In this study, we examined whether PTC without BRAF(T1799A) mutation and without RET/PTC rearrangement named PTC-ga(-) were distinguishable from PTC-ga(+) (with one or the other gene alteration) on the basis of gene expression characteristics. We analyzed the mutational state of 116 PTC and we compared gene expression profiles of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-) from data of a 200 gene macroarray and quantitative PCR. Seventy five PTC were PTC-ga(+) and 41 were PTC-ga(-). Unsupervised analyses of macroarray data by hierarchical clustering led to a complete segregation of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-). In a series of 42 genes previously recognized as PTC 'marker' genes, 22 were found to be expressed at a comparable level in PTC-ga(-) and normal tissue. Thyroid-specific genes, TPO, TG, DIO1, and DIO2 were under-expressed in PTC-ga(+) but expressed at a normal level in PTC-ga(-). A few genes including DUOX1 and DUOX2 were selectively dys-regulated in PTC-ga(-). Tumor grade of PTC-ga(-) was lower than that of PTC-ga(+). There was a strong association between the mutational state and histiotype of PTC; 81% of PTC follicular variants were corresponded to PTC-ga(-), whereas 84% of PTC of classical form were PTC-ga(+).

Furthermore, we tested the effects of two PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) against human thyroid cancer cells. PDE5 gene and protein expression were analyzed in two different cohorts of PTCs by real-time PCR using a TaqMan micro-fluid card system and Western blot. MTT and migration assay were used to evaluate the effects of PDE5 inhibitors on proliferation and migration of TPC-1, BCPAP, and 8505C cells. In a first series of 36 PTCs, we found higher expression levels of PDE5A in tumors versus non-tumor (normal) tissues. PTCs with BRAF mutation showed higher levels of mRNA compared with those without mutation. No significant differences were detected between subgroups with low and intermediate ATA risk. Upregulation of PDE5 was also detected in tumor tissue proteins. Similar results were obtained analyzing the second cohort of 50 PTCs. Moreover, all tumor tissues with high PDE5 levels showed reduction of Thyroglobulin, TSH receptor, Thyroperoxidase, and NIS transcripts. In thyroid cancer cells in vitro, sildenafil and tadalafil determined a reduction of proliferation and cellular migration. Our findings demonstrate for the first time an overexpression of PDE5 in PTCs, and the ability of PDE5 inhibitors to block the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells in culture, therefore, suggesting that specific inhibition of PDE5 may be proposed for the treatment of these tumors.

They are characterised by a high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and superficially resemble each other in that they are frequently located in the proximal colon and share features such as circumscribed tumour margins and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. However, significant differences can be demonstrated at the molecular level including widespread promoter hypermethylation and BRAF -activating mutations which occur significantly less often in HNPCC.;In this study, we sought to determine whether the presence of widespread promoter hypermethylation and BRAF mutations would exclude HNPCC.;We investigated the methylation status of four methylated in tumour markers (MINTs 1,2,12 and 31), and the promoter regions of 5 genes hMLH1, HPP1, MGMT, p16INK4A and p14ARF, in 21 sporadic MSI-H colorectal cancers and compared these with 18 cancers from HNPCC patients. The methylation status of CpG islands were determined by either methylation specific PCR (MSP) or combined bisulfite restricton analysis (COBRA). In addition we considered the BRAF mutation status of 18 HNPCC tumours and 19 sporadic MSI-H cancers which had been previously determined by RFLP analysis and confirmatory sequencing.;Methylation of the promoter regions in target genes occurred less frequently within the HNPCC tumours (27% of analyses), compared with the sporadic MSI-H tumours (59% of analyses) (P < 0.001). Methylation of MINTs 1, 2, 12 and 31 occurred in 4% of analyses for HNPCC tumours contrasted with 73% for sporadic MSI-H tumours (P < 0.001). BRAF mutations were detected in 74% of sporadic tumours but none of the HNPCC cancers tested.;The total number of genes and MINTs methylated in HNPCC was lower than in MSI-H colorectal tumours. No HNPCC tumour showed evidence of widespread promoter hypermethylation or BRAF mutation suggesting this feature could be used as a discriminator between familial and sporadic cases.",

We selected primary colon cancer from 171 patients operated on at our institution between 2007 and 2010. BRAF, KRAS mutation rates and microsatellite instability were determined and correlated with clinicopathological features and tumor location. MSI-h cancers were significantly associated with poor histological grade but a lower rate of distant metastases. KRAS-mutated tumors were linked to lower T-stage and better differentiation. Colon carcinomas with BRAF mutation were significantly associated with distant metastatic spread and poor histological grade. Furthermore, we found that MSI-h status, KRAS and BRAF mutation rates varied remarkably among the colonic subsites irrespective of right- and left-sided origin, respectively.

Currently, KRAS is the only potential biomarker for predicting the efficacy of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, a recent report suggested that the use of cetuximab was associated with survival benefit among patients with p.G13D-mutated tumors. Furthermore, although the presence of mutated BRAF is one of the most powerful prognostic factors for advanced and recurrent CRC, it remains unknown whether patients with BRAF-mutated tumors experience a survival benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR mAb. Thus, the prognostic or predictive relevance of the KRAS and BRAF genotype in CRC remains controversial despite several investigations. Routine KRAS/BRAF screening of pathological specimens is required to promote the appropriate clinical use of anti-EGFR mAb and to determine malignant phenotypes in CRC. The significance of KRAS/BRAF mutations as predictive or prognostic biomarkers should be taken into consideration when selecting a KRAS/BRAF screening assay. This article will review the spectrum of KRAS/BRAF genotype and the impact of KRAS/BRAF mutations on the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with CRC, particularly when differentiating between the mutations at KRAS codons 12 and 13. Furthermore, the predictive role of KRAS/BRAF mutations in treatments with anti-EGFR mAb will be verified, focusing on KRAS p.G13D and BRAF mutations.",

The goal of this study was to clarify the role of the BRAF mutation as a determinant for the operative extent in conventional PTC.;Histopathology and BRAF mutation status of 3,019 patients with conventional PTC were analyzed. With regard to the extent of surgery in PTC, focus was given to the factors of tumor bilaterality, central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), and lateral lymph node metastasis. In addition, the prognostic impact of BRAF mutation on loco-regional recurrence was investigated.;The BRAF mutation was found to be an independent indicator of tumor bilaterality (odds ratio [OR] 1.484, P = .010); however, it was not an independent indicator of CLNM (OR 1.167, P = .254) or lateral lymph node metastasis (OR 0.647, P = .384).

Since these two mutations rarely coexist, further analysis to dissect their function of transformation in colon cancer is required. Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were stably transfected with BRAF(V600E) (Caco-BR cells) or KRAS(G12V) (Caco-K cells) oncogenes. BRAF(V600E) is more efficient in transforming Caco-2 cells and altering their morphology. The dominant nature of BRAF(V600E) is evident by its ability to render Caco-2 cells tumorigenic in vivo all be it through selective extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2 phosphorylation and high levels of cyclin D1. As a consequence, the cell cycle distribution of parental cells is altered and microsatellite instability is introduced. Attenuated ERK activation observed correlated with KSR downregulation by BRAF(V600E) without further implications to signaling. Highly activated ERK in case of KRAS(G12V) (Caco-K cells) leads to mild transformation causing Caco-K cells to express premature senescence-related markers and acquire growth factor-dependent viability. Interestingly, BRAF(WT)gets equally activated by upstream KRAS mutations present in colon adenocarcinoma cells such as DLD-1 and SW620. Taken together, these results suggest that the two oncogenes have different transforming capability in colon cancer, although they both use the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway to carry out their effect. In general, BRAF(V600E) presents greater potential in mediating tumorigenic effect as compared to KRAS(G12V) both in vivo and in vitro. These findings may have implications in personalised diagnosis and targeted therapeutics.",

BRAF gene mutation analysis revealed V600E gene mutation in the classical variants of papillary carcinoma and in the Hürthle cell carcinoma. The focus of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma in the isthmus and a sample from normal thyroid tissue did not harbor BRAF mutations. This case is remarkable in being an unusual report of a follicular Hürthle cell carcinoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation and occurring in collision with multifocal papillary carcinoma. Documentation of such cases is important as it helps better understand the pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and radiologic findings of such rare lesions and to determine the optimal treatment modalities.

Approximately 20% of cases may progress through the \"serrated\" pathway characterized by BRAF mutation and high-level CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). A large subgroup are additionally microsatellite instable (MSI) and demonstrate significant loss of tumor suppressor Cdx2. The aim of this study is to determine the specificity of Cdx2 protein expression and CpG promoter hypermethylation for BRAF(V600E) and high-level CIMP in colorectal cancer. Cdx2, Mlh1, Msh2, Msh6, and Pms2 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a multi-punch tissue microarray (TMA; n = 220 patients). KRAS and BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis, CDX2 methylation and CIMP were investigated. Loss of Cdx2 was correlated with larger tumor size (P = 0.0154), right-sided location (P = 0.0014), higher tumor grade (P < 0.0001), more advanced pT (P = 0.0234) and lymphatic invasion (P = 0.0351). Specificity was 100% for mismatch repair (MMR)-deficiency (P < 0.0001), 92.2% (P < 0.0001) for BRAF(V600E) and 91.8% for CIMP-high. Combined analysis of BRAF(V600E)/CIMP identified Cdx2 loss as sensitive (80%) and specific (91.5%) for mutation/high status. These results were validated on eight well-established colorectal cancer cell lines. CDX2 methylation correlated with BRAF(V600E) (P = 0.0184) and with Cdx2 protein loss (P = 0.0028). These results seem to indicate that Cdx2 may play a role in the serrated pathway to colorectal cancer as underlined by strong relationships with BRAF(V600E), CIMP-high and MMR-deficiency. Whether this protein can only be used as a \"surrogate\" marker, or is functionally involved in the progression of these tumors remains to be elucidated.",

Increasing evidences indicate that miR-378-5p is dysregulated in numerous human cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC) which hypothesizes that miR-378-5p may play an important role in tumorigenesis. However, its role in CRC carcinogenesis remains poorly defined because of lacking target genes information. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the expression of miR-378-5p was down-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-378-5p suppressed cell proliferation, as indicated by CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that overexpression of miR-378-5p induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis in CRC cells. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that BRAF was a direct target of miR-378-5p. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that BRAF was significantly down-regulated by miR-378-5p in CRC cells. Moreover, miR-378-5p was negatively associated with BRAF in CRC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. These results demonstrate that down-regulation of miR-378-5p promotes CRC cells growth by targeting BRAF and restoration of their levels is a potentially promising therapeutic in CRC. ",

Of 160 patients, BRAF(V600) mutations were detected in 62 (39%) archival FFPE tumor samples and 47 (29%) plasma cfDNA samples. The two methods had overall agreement in 141 patients [88%; κ, 0.74; SE, 0.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.85]. Idylla had a sensitivity of 73% (95% CI, 0.60-0.83) and specificity of 98% (95% CI, 0.93-1.00). A higher percentage, but not concentration, of BRAF(V600) cfDNA in the wild-type background (>2% vs. ≤ 2%) was associated with shorter overall survival (OS; P = 0.005) and in patients with BRAF mutations in the tissue, who were receiving BRAF/MEK inhibitors, shorter time to treatment failure (TTF; P = 0.001). Longitudinal monitoring demonstrated that decreasing levels of BRAF(V600) cfDNA were associated with longer TTF (P = 0.045). In conclusion, testing for BRAF(V600) mutations in plasma cfDNA using the Idylla BRAF Mutation Test has acceptable concordance with standard testing of tumor tissue. A higher percentage of mutant BRAF(V600) in cfDNA corresponded with shorter OS and in patients receiving BRAF/MEK inhibitors also with shorter TTF. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(6); 1397-404. ©2016 AACR. ",

Significant differences in BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency were found: 14/16 (87.5%) in common acquired naevi (CANs), 9/12 (75%) in CMs, 0/26 in Spitz naevi and 3/25 (12%) in blue naevi (p < 0.01). We looked at whether Spitz and blue naevi showed a compensatory increase in BRAF exon 11 and/or NRAS exons 1 and 2 mutations to account for the low BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency. NRAS mutations were found in only 1/16 (6.3%) Spitz naevi and 0/15 blue naevi. In addition, NRAS mutations were found in 2/11 (18.2%) CANs and 3/12 (25%) CMs. None of the tumors showed BRAF exon 11 mutations. Despite their low combined BRAF and NRAS mutation frequency, Spitz naevi showed strong MAPK pathway activation as measured by cytoplasmic expression of dually phosphorylated ERK1/2, while blue naevi had weak pathway activation.

PubMed searches were the principal source of articles reviewed.

Several microarray studies have identified genes and pathways preferentially affected, and dysregulated microRNA profiles differ from differentiated thyroid cancers. Numerous proteins involving transcription factors, signaling pathways, mitosis, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, epigenetics, and protein degradation are affected. A variety of agents have been successful in controlling ATC cell growth both in vitro and in nude mice xenografts. While many of these new compounds are in cancer clinical trials, there are few studies being conducted in ATC.

The V599E mutation is highly prevalent in PTC with a papillary or mixed papillary follicular growth pattern, and the K600E mutation is apparently restricted to the follicular variant of PTC. It is usually accepted that thyroid malignancies may follow a progression path from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated (PDC) and undifferentiated (UC) carcinomas. One would expect that at least some of the less differentiated carcinomas would harbour the genetic alterations of pre-existing well-differentiated tumours. In order to find the prevalence of BRAF mutations in PDC and UC, we screened a series of 19 PDCs and 17 UCs, as well as 3 UC-derived cell lines, for both mutation types. The group of PDCs was restricted to the so-called insular and insular-like PDCs, thus excluding PTCs with solid, insular or trabecular foci of growth and PDCs displaying typical PTC nuclei. No BRAF mutations were detected in any of the 19 cases of PDC, whereas 6 of the UCs (35%) and one UC-derived cell line presented the BRAFV599E mutation. The BRAFK600E mutation was not detected in any case. We conclude that UC may progress from BRAFV599E-mutated PTC.

BRAF mutation by pyrosequencing was tested on preoperative FNAB specimens. The relationships between occult central lymph node metastasis and preoperative BRAF mutation or clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Additionally, we assessed the associations between preoperative BRAF mutation status and various clinicopathological characteristics of PTC revealed postoperatively.;The prevalence of the BRAF V600E mutation was 53.4%, and the rate of occult central lymph node metastasis was 25.7%. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size over 1 cm [P = 0.006; odds ratio (OR) = 3.559], perithyroidal invasion (P = 0.023; OR = 2.893), and preoperative positive BRAF mutation (P = 0.029; OR = 2.727) were independent risk factors for the presence of occult central lymph node metastasis. BRAF mutation examined in FNAB specimens, compared with the wild-type allele, strongly predicted perithyroidal invasion (48 vs. 29%; P = 0.017), extracapsular spread (65 vs. 45%; P = 0.017), occult central lymph node metastasis (35 vs. 15%; P = 0.004), and advanced TNM stage (44 vs. 28%; P = 0.035). In the multivariate analysis, patients with preoperative positive BRAF mutation were significantly more likely (P = 0.023; OR = 2.848) to have occult central lymph node metastasis.;Preoperative BRAF analysis by FNAB and primary tumor size based on ultrasonography may assist in predicting occult central lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC and clinically node-negative neck.",

Baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes were compared between patients with and without BRAF mutations. Wild-type controls consisted of patients with NSCLC without a somatic alteration in BRAF, KRAS, EGFR, and ALK. In vitro studies assessed the biologic properties of selected non-V600E BRAF mutations identified from patients with NSCLC.;Of 883 tumors screened, 36 (4%) harbored BRAF mutations (V600E, 18; non-V600E, 18) and 257 were wild-type for BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, and ALK negative. Twenty-nine of 36 patients with BRAF mutations were smokers. There were no distinguishing clinical features between BRAF-mutant and wild-type patients. Patients with advanced NSCLC with BRAF mutations and wild-type tumors showed similar response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) to platinum-based combination chemotherapy and no difference in overall survival. Within the BRAF cohort, patients with V600E-mutated tumors had a shorter PFS to platinum-based chemotherapy compared with those with non-V600E mutations, although this did not reach statistical significance (4.1 vs. 8.9 months; P = 0.297). We identified five BRAF mutations not previously reported in NSCLC; two of five were associated with increased BRAF kinase activity.;BRAF mutations occur in 4% of NSCLCs and half are non-V600E.

Archival tissues were analyzed for microsatellite instability, PTEN status, and 487-gene sequencing. Patient-derived xenografts were established from core biopsy samples.;Of 43 patients, five (12%) achieved a partial response or better, including one (2%) complete response, with duration of response > 36 months; 24 patients (56%) achieved stable disease as best confirmed response. Ten patients (23%) remained in the study > 6 months. All nine evaluable during-treatment biopsies had reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK relative to pretreatment biopsies (average decrease ± standard deviation, 47% ± 24%). Mutational analysis revealed that the patient achieving a complete response and two of three evaluable patients achieving a partial response had PIK3CA mutations. Neither PTEN loss nor microsatellite instability correlated with efficacy. Responses to dabrafenib plus trametinib were comparable in patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice and the biopsied lesions from each corresponding patient.;The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib has activity in a subset of patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was inhibited in all patients evaluated, but to a lesser degree than observed in BRAF-mutant melanoma with dabrafenib alone.

Previous studies have shown that 17-AAG/DMAG treatment induces the degradation of mutant BRAF (V600E) and inhibits the activation of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2). We have found, however, that HSP90 inhibition alone is not sufficient for efficient BRAF(V600E) degradation in some cells. HSP90 inhibitors structurally unrelated to geldanamycin, radicicol and novobiocin, while inducing the degradation of the HSP90 client protein RAF-1 fail to induce BRAF(V600E) degradation or inhibit MEK1/2 activation in HT29 human colon cancer cells. Moreover, after treatment with 17-DMAG, the kinase activity of residual, undegraded BRAF(V600E) was also lost. Incubation of cells with a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, partially restored kinase activity and also partially prevented BRAF(V600E) degradation due to 17-DMAG treatment. Conversely, treatment with the ROS producing drug menadione clearly inhibited MEK1/2 and reduced BRAF(V600E). These results suggest that in addition to direct inhibition of HSP90, the antitumor effect of geldanamycin and its derivatives is also mediated though the production of ROS, which may directly inactivate tumorigenic mutant BRAF(V600E).",

Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) represent more than 90% of all thyroid carcinomas and comprise the papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma subtypes. Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas correspond to less than 1% of all thyroid tumors and can arise de novo or by dedifferentiation of a differentiated tumor. The etiology of DTCs is not fully understood. Several genetic events have been implicated in thyroid tumorigenesis. Point mutations in the BRAF or RAS genes or rearranged in transformation (RET)/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) gene rearrangements are observed in approximately 70% of papillary cancer cases. Follicular carcinomas commonly harbor RAS mutations and paired box gene 8 (PAX8)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements. Anaplastic carcinomas may have a wide set of genetic alterations, that include gene effectors in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and/or β-catenin signaling pathways. These distinct genetic alterations constitutively activate the MAPK, PI3K and β-catenin signaling pathways, which have been implicated in thyroid cancer development and progression. In this context, the evaluation of specific genes, as well as the knowledge of their effects on thyroid carcinogenesis may provide important information on disease presentation, prognosis and therapy, through the development of specific tyrosine kinase targets.

Because the mutational status is unclear in pediatric solid neoplasms, we screened BRAF mutations comprehensively in our tumor series presented in childhood. Two pairs of primers were designed to amplify exons 11 and exon 15, respectively, and 181 tumor samples (65 neuroblastomas, 23 Wilms tumors, 19 hepatoblastomas, 16 teratomas, 17 rhabdomyosarcomas, 13 ganglioneuromas, etc.) were investigated by PCR-SSCP method. On agarose gel electrophoresis, amplified PCR fragments showed no size-altered changes in exons 11 and 15, and SSCP analysis revealed uniform band patterns in both exons. Subsequent direct sequencing of selected 10 samples confirmed only normal sequences without any nucleotide substitutions. The current study represents the first genetic analysis of the BRAF gene in pediatric solid tumors. Our data suggest that mutations of BRAF gene as a mechanism of tumorigenesis is unlikely to be associated with most childhood neoplasms.",

The prevalence of BRAF V600E was 5.0% in this population, and the mutation was more likely to be found in tumors from cases who were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [odds ratio (OR), 1.87; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.01-3.47], female (OR, 1.97; P = 1.17-3.31), and older (73.8 years versus 70.3 years; P < 0.001). These results were similar when restricting to only tumors with microsatellite instability. Whether smoking was associated with a BRAF somatic mutation depended on gender. Although men were less likely to have a tumor with a BRAF somatic mutation, men who smoked were much more likely to have a tumor with a somatic BRAF mutation (OR(interaction), 4.95; 95% CI, 1.18-20.83) than women who never smoked. We note the strong heterogeneity in the reported prevalence of the BRAF V600E mutation in studies of different ethnicities, with a lower prevalence in Israel than other Western populations but a higher prevalence among Jewish than non-Jewish Israeli cases.

OCCCs show a pattern of gene mutations different from other type I ovarian malignancies, notably a higher frequency of PIK3CA mutations. In low grade serous ovarian cancer, KRAS and BRAF mutations are frequent, but little data are available on the mutational status of these genes in OCCCs. To clarify this issue, we designed a clinicopathological study with the aim to establish the incidence of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF hot spot mutations in OCCC. Between December 2006 and June 2012, 22 patients with a proven diagnosis of OCCC were admitted to our Institutions. In all cases, final diagnosis was established according to FIGO and WHO criteria. All women received complete surgical staging. The PyroMark Q24 system (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used for pyrosequencing analysis of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF hot spot regions on 2.5-μm sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from primary OCCC. Pyrosequencing analysis of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF hot spot regions revealed the presence of mutations only at codon 12 in exon 2 of KRAS in 3 of 22 (14 %) cases. We found no mutations in the hot spot regions of NRAF (exons 2, 3, 4) or BRAF (exon 15). The median age of women with a KRAS mutated OCCC was 74 years. These OCCC were unilateral FIGO stage IA lesions in two cases associated with foci of endometriosis. We conclude that in 14 % of OCCCs, a KRAS mutation occurs in codon 2 exon 2.

Here, we show that lung-specific expression of the BRAF V600E mutant induces the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 (MAPK) pathway and the development of lung adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features in vivo. Deinduction of transgene expression led to dramatic tumor regression, paralleled by dramatic dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, implying a dependency of BRAF-mutant lung tumors on the MAPK pathway. Accordingly, in vivo pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK; MAPKK) using a specific MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, induced tumor regression associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in these de novo lung tumors. CI-1040 treatment also led to dramatic tumor shrinkage in murine lung tumors driven by a mutant KRas allele. Thus, somatic mutations in different signaling intermediates of the same pathway induce exquisite dependency on a shared downstream effector. These results unveil a potential common vulnerability of BRAF and KRas mutant lung tumors that potentially affects rational deployment of MEK targeted therapies to non-small-cell lung cancer patients.",

Previous studies have shown a strong association between BRAF V600E mutation and serrated polyps. This study aims to evaluate CIMP status of all the serrated polyp subtypes and its association with functionally important genes such as MLH1, p16, and IGFBP7. CIMP status and methylation were evaluated using the real-time based MethyLight assay in 154 serrated polyps and 63 conventional adenomas. Results showed that CIMP-high serrated polyps were strongly associated with BRAF mutation and proximal colon. CIMP-high was uncommon in conventional adenomas (1.59%), occurred in 8.25% of hyperplastic polyps (HPs), and became common in sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) (51.43%). MLH1 methylation was mainly observed in the proximal colon and was significantly associated with BRAF mutation and CIMP-high. The number of samples methylated for p16 and IGFBP7 was the highest in SSAs. The methylation panel we used to detect CIMP is highly specific for CIMP-high cancers. With this panel, we demonstrate that CIMP-high is much more common in SSAs than HPs. This suggests that CIMP-high correlates with increased risk of malignant transformation which was also observed in methylation of functionally important genes. ",

Through an RNAi screen, here we identify the transcriptional repressor MAFG as the pivotal factor required for MLH1 silencing and CIMP in CRCs containing BRAF(V600E). In BRAF-positive human CRC cell lines and tumors, MAFG is bound at the promoters of MLH1 and other CIMP genes, and recruits a corepressor complex that includes its heterodimeric partner BACH1, the chromatin remodeling factor CHD8, and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, resulting in hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. BRAF(V600E) increases BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling resulting in phosphorylation and elevated levels of MAFG, which drives DNA binding.

Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed melanoma biopsies were analyzed for the BRAF mutation status by independent, blinded observers using both conventional DNA molecular techniques and IHC with the novel BRAF V600E mutant-specific antibody, VE1. The antibody had a sensitivity of 97% (37/38) and a specificity of 98% (58/59) for detecting the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation. Of the BRAF-mutated cases, none of the non-V600E cases (including V600K) stained positive with the antibody (0/11). There were 5 cases with discordant BRAF mutation results. Additional molecular analysis confirmed the immunohistochemically obtained BRAF result in 3 cases, suggesting that the initial molecular testing results were incorrect. Two of these patients would not have received a BRAF inhibitor on the basis of the initial false-negative mutation testing result. Two cases remained discordant. The reported IHC method is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting V600E BRAF mutations in melanoma patients.

The clonality of tumors appearing simultaneously in both lobes or recurring in the contralateral lobe remains unknown. Accordingly, we examined 25 pairs of bilateral papillary thyroid carcinomas (synchronous or metachronous) and 15 matched metastatic lymph nodes. BRAF gene mutation analysis combined with X-chromosome inactivation was used to evaluate these tumors' clonal origins. Genomic DNA was prepared from paraffin-embedded tissues after microdissection. In total, 62 tumors yielded DNA of adequate quality. Eighteen (18/21, 85.7%) of 21 informative cases showed concordant BRAF status in tumors from both thyroid lobes, being either BRAF mutation positive (12 patients) or BRAF mutation negative (6 patients). Metastatic lymph nodes in 12 patients (12/15, 80%) had a complete concordance of BRAF state with their primaries. Of the 18 studied female patients, 11 were suitable for X-chromosome inactivation assay. Nine cases (9/11, 81.1%) showed the same pattern of inactivation in bilateral tumors. A close correlation was found between BRAF mutation and X-chromosome inactivation analysis. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that bilateral, recurrent, and metastatic papillary thyroid carcinomas often arise from a single clone and that intrathyroidal metastasis may play an important role in the development of bilateral tumors, as well as in the recurrence of this malignancy.",

Pyrosequencing is a nonelectrophoretic nucleotide extension sequencing technology that can be used for mutation testing.;The frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations was examined using a nonbiased database of 203 resected ESCCs and a high-throughput pyrosequencing assay.;The validity of the KRAS pyrosequencing method was initially demonstrated by detection of all 4 types of KRAS mutations [c.35G>T (codon 12 GGT>GTT), c.35G>A (codon 12 GGT>GAT), c.34G>T (codon 12 GGT>TGT), c.38G>A mutation (codon 13 GGC>GAC)], which had been previously diagnosed using Scorpion-ARMS technology, in 9 colon cancer tissues (9 of 9; 100 %). Similar results were demonstrated for BRAF mutational status in 3 colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, Colo201, and HT29), which were validated by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, the KRAS mutation was found to be extremely rare (1 of 203; 0.5 %), and the BRAF mutation was absent (0 of 203; 0 %), in the dataset of 203 ESCCs.;These results suggest that KRAS and BRAF mutations play a limited role in the development of ESCC and that mutation analysis is not useful as a screening test for sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy in ESCC.",

The number of patients visiting the clinic increased from 411 during 1962-1990 to 2900 during 2000-2009. Age at diagnosis increased from 39.6±12.9 to 48.6±12.4 years. The male to female ratio increased from 1:6 to 1:4.5. The proportion of small (<1 cm) tumors increased from 6.1% to 43.1%, and the proportion of cancers with lymph node (LN) involvement or extrathyroidal extension (ETE) decreased from 76.4% to 44.4% and from 65.5% to 54.8% respectively. Although there were decreases in the proportion of LN involvement and ETE, these decreasing rates were not proportional to the expected rates based on the decreased proportion of large tumors. The overall recurrence and mortality rates were 13.3% and 1.4%. The five-year recurrence rate significantly decreased (from 11% to 5.9%), and the five-year mortality also improved (from 1.5% to 0.2%).;The incidence of thyroid cancer has rapidly increased, with a decrease in tumors of large size, LN involvement, and ETE, although the decreasing rates of LN involvement and ETE were not as prominent as decreasing rates of large size tumors. The mortality and recurrence rates have also decreased. Future long-term follow-up of patients diagnosed in the most recent decade is needed to confirm the prognostic characteristics of Korean PTC patients.",

The V600E mutation accounts for most of the BRAF mutations in cancer, and KRAS mutations are predominantly encoded by nucleotide substitutions within codons 12 and 13. We designed novel pyrosequencing assays for the detection of the common \"hotspot\" mutations in these genes, which demonstrated analytical sensitivities of <or=10% in titrations of mutant cell lines. The KRAS pyrosequencing assay has the ability to simultaneously identify all potential nucleotide changes within the mutation cluster at codons 12 and 13, with a sequence output in the sense direction to facilitate results interpretation. These assays were used to determine the mutation status in a prospective series of 1198 sporadic colorectal cancers. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 13.2% of the colorectal cancers. The frequency of KRAS mutations in our cohort was 32.4%, with G>A transitions at position 2 of codons 12 and 13 being most prevalent. Both assays proved highly sensitive and specific when applied to clinical specimens, and were applicable to both fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues. These assays would serve as a suitable platform for large-scale mutation detection in cancer specimens where the facility for pyrosequencing is available.",

We examined the activity of AZD6244 in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer and a panel of cell lines representing many cancer types using in vitro growth assays. AZD6244 induced G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest in sensitive cell lines that primarily included cells containing the BRAF V600E mutation. In these cells, G(0)-G(1) arrest is accompanied by the up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p21(WAF1) and p27(Kip1) and down-regulation of cyclin D1. In the majority of cell lines tested, including those with K-ras or non-V600E BRAF mutations, AZD6244 induced the accumulation of phospho-MEK, an effect not observed in the most sensitive BRAF V600E-containing cells. Accumulation of phospho-MEK in non-V600E-containing cell lines is due to abrogation of negative feedback pathways. BRAF V600E disrupts negative feedback signaling, which results in enhanced baseline phospho-MEK expression. Exogenous expression of BRAF V600E disrupts feedback inhibition but does not sensitize cells to AZD6244. Specific suppression of endogenous BRAF V600E does not confer resistance to AZD6244 but enhances sensitivity to AZD6244. Thus, our findings show that BRAF V600E marks cells with an in vitro requirement for MAPK signaling to support proliferation. These cells are exquisitely sensitive to AZD6244 (IC(50), <100 nmol/L), have high baseline levels of phospho-MEK, and lack feedback inhibition between ERK and Raf. These data suggest an approach to identifying cells that may be sensitive to AZD6244 and other MEK inhibitors.",

It may metastasize and loose iodine uptake capability, preventing any radioiodine or surgical treatment. The main gene altered in PTC is BRAF, which is found altered in over 50 % of cases. Moreover MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways are greatly implicated in PTC development. Many target therapies for PTC are currently under investigation, unfortunately without the expected results. Aim of this study was to characterized the preclinical effectiveness of novel promising drugs, RAF265, SB590885 and ZSTK474 in 3 thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP, K1, 8505C). RAF265 and SB590885 target differentially BRAF, while ZSTK474 acts on PI3K. IC50 demonstrated high drug activities ranging from 0.1 to 6.2 μM, depending on drugs and cell type, while combination index revealed an interesting synergistic effect of combination regimen (RAF265 + ZSTK474 and SB590885 + ZSTK474) in almost all cell lines. Moreover this synergistic effect was particularly evident by Western blot, whereas dual MAPK and PI3K/Akt inhibition was detected. In addition, treating cells with SB590885 induced marked morphological changes, leading to massive vacuolization. This suggests an activation of apoptotic process, as underlined by Annexin V flow cytometry analysis. Also cell cycle was altered in treated cells, without evidence of a common pattern, but rather with a more specific effect relying on single drug or combination regimen used. Since beneficial effects of in vitro combination regimen (RAF265 + ZSTK474 and SB590885 + ZSTK474), it is recommended additional investigation. These data suggest the potential use of combination regimen in in vivo experiment or afterwards in human PTC. ",

We aimed to determine the malignancy rate in indeterminate lesions with negative mutation analysis.;A literature review established a mutation analysis model using the prevalence of BRAF, RET, RAS, and PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ mutations in indeterminate lesions. This model was applied retrospectively to a study cohort of 466 consecutive indeterminate lesions that underwent hemi- or total thyroidectomy for definitive diagnosis, to evaluate its accuracy for identifying malignancy.;Of 466 indeterminate lesions in the study, 30% (139) were malignant. These included 66 cases of papillary thyroid cancer, 45 cases of follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer, 18 cases of follicular thyroid cancer, and 10 others. The risk of malignancy was 42% when cytologic atypia was present vs 17% without. The mutation analysis model would correctly identify only 48 of 139 (34%) of malignant indeterminate lesions. Therefore, when mutation analysis is negative, the overall risk of malignancy would be 23%. When atypia is present, the risk of malignancy would be 31% vs 13% in lesions without.;Indeterminate lesions with a negative mutation analysis still carry a significant risk of malignancy, especially in the presence of atypia, requiring surgery for definitive diagnosis.",

Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient. By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system, we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer, which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells.",

Here, we show that melanoma cells that are driven by oncogenic BRAF are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of metformin because RSK sustains TORC1 activity even when AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated. We further show that AMPK targets the dual-specificity protein phosphatase DUSP6 for degradation and this increases ERK activity, which then upregulates the VEGF-A protein. Critically, this drives angiogenesis and accelerates the growth of BRAF-driven tumors in mice. Unexpectedly, however, when VEGF signaling is inhibited, instead of accelerating tumor growth, metformin inhibits tumor growth. Thus, we show that BRAF-driven melanoma cells are resistant to the antigrowth effects of AMPK and that AMPK mediates cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous effects that accelerate the growth of these cells in vivo.;Metformin inhibits the growth of most tumor cells, but BRAF-mutant melanoma cells are resistant to metformin in vitro, and metformin accelerates their growth in vivo.

The most common somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event. To investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used a BRAF(V600E) mouse model. In mice expressing BRAF(V600E) in their melanocytes, a single dose of UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. Here we show that sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB sun protection factor (SPF) 50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection. The UVR-exposed tumours showed increased numbers of single nucleotide variants and we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor in approximately 40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in human non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not thought to have a major role in melanoma. However, we show that, in mice, mutant Trp53 accelerated BRAF(V600E)-driven melanomagenesis, and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence of UVR-induced DNA damage in human melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans. Furthermore, we identify TP53/Trp53 as a UVR-target gene that cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to induce melanoma, providing molecular insight into how UVR accelerates melanomagenesis.

The BRAF exon 15 mutation was evaluated by direct sequencing. Furthermore, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the issue of whether the expression level of the iodide-metabolizing genes (NIS and TSHR) was correlated with BRAF mutational status was investigated.;A high prevalence of the BRAF mutation was found in PTC cases (48%). The BRAF mutation was found to be significantly associated with the classic variant of PTC (66%; P < .0001), although it was found in the follicular variant as well (21%). Subtype stratification demonstrated that the BRAF V600E mutation was associated with tumor size, extrathyroid invasion, the presence of lymph node metastasis and risk of disease recurrence, and mortality in patients with the classic variant of PTC. Moreover, the expression levels of NIS and TSHR were remarkably lower in PTCs harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.;These findings provide further evidence that BRAF might be associated with a more aggressive phenotype and less differentiated state due to decreased expression of iodide-metabolizing genes.

In contrast, colon cancers that harbour the same BRAF(V600E) mutation are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors, due to feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we show that 6 out of 16 melanoma tumours analysed acquired EGFR expression after the development of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using a chromatin-regulator-focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, we find that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) in melanoma causes activation of TGF-β signalling, thus leading to upregulation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), which confer resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Expression of EGFR in melanoma or treatment with TGF-β results in a slow-growth phenotype with cells displaying hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence. However, EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. In a heterogeneous population of melanoma cells having varying levels of SOX10 suppression, cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are rapidly enriched in the presence of drug, but this is reversed when the drug treatment is discontinued. We find evidence for SOX10 loss and/or activation of TGF-β signalling in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples. Our findings provide a rationale for why some BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma patients may regain sensitivity to these drugs after a 'drug holiday' and identify patients with EGFR-positive melanoma as a group that may benefit from re-treatment after a drug holiday.

We report a high prevalence of BRAF(V599E) mutation in sporadic PTC and in PTC-derived cell lines. The BRAF(V599E) mutation was detected in 23 of 50 PTC (46%) and in three of four PTC-derived cell lines. The prevalence of the BRAF(V599E) mutation in PTC is the highest reported to date in human carcinomas, being only exceeded by melanoma. PTC with RET/PTC rearrangement as well as the TPC-1 cell line (the only one harboring RET/PTC rearrangement) did not show the BRAF(V599E) mutation. BRAF(V599E) mutation was not detected in any of 23 nodular goiters, 51 follicular adenomas and 18 follicular carcinomas. A distinct mutation in BRAF (codon K600E) was detected in a follicular adenoma. Activating mutations in RAS genes were detected in 15% of FA, 33% of FTC and 7% of PTC. BRAF(V599E) mutation did not coexist with alterations in any of the RAS genes in any of the tumors. These results suggest that BRAF(V599E) mutation is frequent in the etiopathogenesis of PTC. The BRAF(V599E) mutation appears to be an alternative event to RET/PTC rearrangement rather than to RAS mutations, which are rare in PTC. BRAF(V599E) may represent an alternative pathway to oncogenic MAPK activation in PTCs without RET/PTC activation.",

Cytologic evaluation facilitates the diagnosis of thyroid lesions (TLs), but in 10-40% of cases the interpretation is indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate diagnoses are often treated with hemithyroidectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy, if cancer is found in the initial specimen. Exposing patients to multiple surgeries increases costs and morbidity. The American Thyroid Association states that a combination of molecular markers is likely to optimize the management of patients with indeterminate cytology. However, few studies have addressed the molecular alterations present in pediatric TL. Twenty-seven thyroid carcinomas from patients 10 to 19 years of age were tested for alterations common in adult TL, including BRAF V600E mutation, RET fusions, and TERT promoter mutations. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently analyzed with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutation panel to search for additional targets. Histologic diagnoses included 12 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 13 follicular variant PTCs, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and 1 follicular carcinoma. Fourteen cases showed lymph node involvement, and 13 cases demonstrated lymphovascular invasion. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 10/27 cases, and RET fusions were detected in 6/27 cases. No TERT promoter mutations were identified in any of the cases. The NGS panel revealed additional RET and CTNNB1 pathogenic missense mutations. Our results demonstrate that molecular abnormalities are common in pediatric TLs and suggest that incorporation of molecular testing will be helpful in optimizing patient management. ",

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer in the world, and African Americans show a higher incidence than other populations in the United States. We analyzed sporadic CRCs in Omani (of African origin, N = 61), Iranian (of Caucasian origin, N = 53) and African American (N = 95) patients for microsatellite instability, expression status of mismatched repair genes (hMLH1, hMSH2) and presence of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. In the Omani group, all tumors with BRAF mutations were located in the left side of the colon, and for African Americans, 88% 7 of tumors with BRAF mutations were found in the right side of the colon. In African Americans, 31% of tumors displayed microsatellite instability at two or more markers (MSI-H), while this rate was 26% and 13% for tumors in the Iranian and Omani groups, respectively. A majority of these MSI-H tumors were located in the proximal colon (right side) in African American and Iranian subjects, whereas most were located in the distal colon (left side) in Omani subjects. Defects in hMLH1 gene expression were found in 77% of MSI-H tumors in both African Americans and Iranians and in 38% of tumors in Omanis. BRAF mutations were observed in all subjects: 10% of tumors in African Americans (8/82), 2% of tumors in Iranians (1/53), and 19% of tumors in Omanis (11/59). Our findings suggest that CRC occurs at a younger age in Omani and Iranian patients, and these groups showed a lower occurrence of MSI-H than did African American patients. Our multivariate model suggests an important and significant role of hMLH1 expression and BRAF mutation in MSI-H CRC in these populations. The high occurrence of MSI-H tumors in African Americans may have significant implications for treatment, since patients with MSI-H lesions display a different response to chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil.",

The other oncogenic event recently identified in PTC is the BRAF V600E mutation. Because the role of TrkA was not completely elucidated in thyroid cancer ethiopathogenesis, we decided to study the expression of active, phosphorylated TrkA and of its coreceptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR) in a series of 92 PTC (37 lesions of conventional PTC, 28 of follicular variant of PTC [FVPTC], and 27 of other variants of PTC) as well as in 21 samples of normal thyroid and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions used as a controls. We observed neoexpression of p75 NTR in PTC, particularly in conventional PTC and in other variants of PTC displaying a papillary growth pattern, rather than in FVPTC. No immunoexpression of p75 NTR was observed in normal thyroid nor in nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. The cellular localization of p75 NTR immunoexpression was also significantly associated with the growth pattern of PTC, being much more frequently detected in an apical localization in PTC with papillary architecture than in PTC with a follicular or solid growth pattern. This apical localization of p75 NTR was significantly associated with the presence of BRAF V600E. No significant differences were detected between normal thyroid, nonneoplastic lesions, and PTC (or any PTC variant) regarding expression/activation of TrkA, thus suggesting that by itself and in contrast to p75 NTR, TrkA is not altered during PTC development.",

KRAS mutations account for approximately 30% to 40% patients who are not responsive. The serine-threonine kinase BRAF is the principal effector of KRAS. We hypothesized that, in KRAS wild-type patients, BRAF mutations could have a predictive/prognostic value. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed objective tumor responses, time to progression, overall survival (OS), and the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in 113 tumors from cetuximab- or panitumumab-treated metastatic CRC patients. The effect of the BRAF V600E mutation on cetuximab or panitumumab response was also assessed using cellular models of CRC. Results KRAS mutations were present in 30% of the patients and were associated with resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab (P = .011). The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 11 of 79 patients who had wild-type KRAS. None of the BRAF-mutated patients responded to treatment, whereas none of the responders carried BRAF mutations (P = .029). BRAF-mutated patients had significantly shorter progression-free survival (P = .011) and OS (P < .0001) than wild-type patients. In CRC cells, the introduction of BRAF V600E allele impaired the therapeutic effect of cetuximab or panitumumab. Treatment with the BRAF inhibitor sorafenib restored sensitivity to panitumumab or cetuximab of CRC cells carrying the V600E allele. CONCLUSION BRAF wild-type is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab and could be used to select patients who are eligible for the treatment. Double-hit therapies aimed at simultaneous inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and BRAF warrant exploration in CRC patients carrying the V600E oncogenic mutation.",

In normal cells, the activity of BRaf is tightly regulated. Gain-of-function mutations like those identified in melanoma frequently lead to enhanced cell-survival and unrestrained growth. The activating mutation of BRaf will also induce the cells to senesce. However, the mechanism by which the oncogenic BRaf induces the senescent barrier remains poorly defined. microRNAs have regulatory functions toward the expression of genes that are important in carcinogenesis. Here we show that expression of several microRNAs is altered when the oncogenic version of BRaf is introduced in cultured primary melanocytes and these cells undergo premature cellular senescence. These include eight microRNAs whose expression rates are significantly stimulated and three that are repressed. While most of the induced microRNAs have documented negative effects on cell cycle progression, one of the repressed microRNAs has proven oncogenic functions. Ectopic expression of some of these induced microRNAs increased the expression of senescence markers and induced growth arrest and senescence in primary melanocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that the change in microRNA expression rates may play a vital role in senescence induced by the oncogenic BRaf.",

Here, we use experimental and in silico structure-energy statistical analyses, to elucidate why the V600E mutation, but no other mutation at this, or any other positions in BRAF's hydrophobic pocket, is predominant. We find that BRAF mutation frequencies depend on the equilibrium between the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, the overall folding energy, the activation of the kinase and the number of bases required to change the corresponding amino acid. Using a random forest classifier, we quantitatively dissected the parameters contributing to BRAF AS cancer frequencies.

TBSRTC has well-defined and rational management algorithms with implicit risk of malignancy in each of the 6 diagnostic categories. Recently published data supports the clinical utility and wide acceptance of TBSRTC by both practicing pathologists and clinicians. The problematic category of 'indeterminate' cytopathologic diagnoses has led to the discovery and development of unique and useful molecular markers, such as BRAF, which have displayed promising potential in recently published studies.

We investigated the role of BRAF gene status in preoperative cytological samples, using manual macrodissection as an additional tool to improve the diagnostic accuracy of mPTC.;DNA was extracted directly from stained FNAC smears of 95 patients including 85 with histological diagnoses of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) ≤1 cm and 10 with goiters. The cytological diagnoses of the 95 cases included the following: 42 samples were suspicious for papillary carcinoma, 38 were PTCs, and 15 were indeterminate lesions. DNA was then extracted from the FNAC slides after performing a \"manual macrodissection\" procedure. The BRAF(V600E) mutational status was determined by sequence analysis in all the patients.;In this study, we showed that the BRAF(V600E) mutation was present with a high frequency in patients with mPTC (74%).

CFC is caused by alteration of activity through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway due to heterogeneous de novo germline mutations in B-Raf mutant proteins, MEK1 and MEK2. Approximately 75% of individuals with CFC have mutations in BRAF. In vitro functional studies demonstrate that many of these mutations confer increase activity upon the mutant protein as compared to the wildtype protein. However, as is seen cancer, some of the B-Raf mutant proteins are kinase impaired. Western blot analyses corroborate kinase assays as determined by mutant proteins phosphorylating downstream effectors MEK and ERK. Approximately 25% of individuals with CFC have mutations in either MEK1 or MEK2 that lead to increased MEK kinase activity as judged by increased phosphorylation of its downstream effector ERK. Unlike BRAF, no somatic mutations have ever been identified in MEK genes. The identification of novel germline BRAF and MEK mutations in CFC will help understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Furthermore, it will also provide insight to the normal function of B-Raf and MEK, and contribute to the knowledge of the role of the MAPK pathway in cancer.

HSP90 is an emerging therapeutic target of interest for the treatment of cancer and is responsible for modulating cellular response to stress by maintaining the function of signalling proteins. In this study, we have worked with B-CPAP, a thyroid papillary cancer cell line which is known to have BRAF V600E mutation. We have administered the flavonoid Quercetin, which is known to induce apoptosis by inhibiting HSP production on various cancer cell lines, at different concentrations (between 10 and 75µM) for 24hours. We have measured cell viability using WST-1 assay. We found that the viability decreases in a dose dependent manner. Then, we chose Quercetin concentrations between 10-75µM for 24hours, for the apoptosis and cell cycle analysis in flow cytometry by Annexin V and propidium iodide. We have also applied Hoechst stain to cancer cells for visualizing them on fluorescence microscopy and confirmed apoptosis with the presence of apoptotic signs in nuclei of cancer cells. Finally, we used Western blotting to compare HSP90 and Cleaved-PARP levels in cells treated with Quercetin and the control group. In the light of the obtained data, our results suggest that in future studies it would be useful to investigate the apoptotic mechanisms of Quercetin and use combinational therapies on BCPAP cells.

Fifty-three wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC patients were treated with cetuximab/irinotecan-based chemotherapy as a first- or third-line therapy. The mutational statuses of 10 EGFR pathway genes were analyzed in primary tumors using next-generation sequencing. BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS (exons 3 and 4), NRAS, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations were detected in 6, 6, 5, 4, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. Four of the BRAF mutations were non-V600 variants. Four tumors harbored multiple co-existing (complex) mutations. All patients with BRAF mutations or complex mutation patterns were cetuximab non-responders. All patients but one harboring KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutations were non-responders. Mutations in any one of these three genes were associated with a poor response rate (7.1%) and reduced survival (PFS = 8.0 months) compared to wild-type patients (74.4% and 11.6 months).

Further, their association to mismatch-repair-deficient tumors has suggested the involvement of the RAS/RAF pathway in the tumorigenesis of microsatellite-unstable colon cancers, and that RAS and RAF mutations are alternative genetic events. We determined whether colorectal mismatch-repair-deficient tumors with BRAF mutations show a specific genotype when compared with tumors with wild-type BRAF, and whether they can be associated with a particular clinicopathological feature. Here, we report a striking association of BRAF, but not of APC, KRAS2, AXIN2, and TP53 mutations, with proximal mismatch-repair-deficient colon tumors and MLH1 hypermethylation.

Recently, seminal clinical trials have provided indisputable evidence that BRAF inhibitors improve response rate, progression free and overall survival in BRAFV600 mutated metastatic melanoma patients, thus representing the novel standard of care. Dermatological \"off target\" effects of these so-called 'targeted therapies' have to be considered, however, and among them the most intriguing are cutaneous adverse reactions. Skin toxicity is of relevance for at least three reasons: (1) it worsens the patient's quality of life and may be difficult to manage, (2) its heterogeneous clinical presentation differs from the clinico-pathological pictures observed in patients who do not receive BRAF inhibitors, and; (3) onset of skin cancer represents a model of carcinogenesis which may help to better understand the potential visceral tumorigenesis induced by BRAF inhibitors. This manuscript summarizes and critically reviews the state of the art of skin toxicity associated with BRAF inhibitors. Special attention will be paid to clinical presentation and histopathological findings, as well as related challenges for clinicians, pathologists, and basic scientists. ",

However, until now, rearrangements have only been detected in fresh FNA material and the number of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) was rather low in previous studies. We aimed at investigating the impact of point mutations and rearrangement detection in a set of routine air-dried FNA smears with a higher percentage of FTCs.;RNA and DNA was extracted from 310 FNAs (164 indeterminate, 57 malignant, 89 benign) and corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (156 follicular adenomas [FAs], 32 FTCs, 44 papillary thyroid carcinomas [PTCs], 9 follicular variant PTCs, and 69 goiters). PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by qPCR, BRAF and RAS mutations by high-resolution melting PCR and by pyrosequencing.;Forty-seven mutations were detected in the FNAs: 22 BRAF, 13 NRAS, and 3 HRAS mutations, 8 PAX8/PPARG, and one RET/PTC-rearrangement. While the presence of a BRAF and RET/PTC mutation was associated with cancer in 100% of samples each, the presence of a RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutation was associated with cancer in only 12% and 50% of samples, respectively. In the indeterminate group 4 of 25 carcinomas were identified by molecular FNA screening, which increased the sensitivity from 67% (cytology alone) to 75% (cytology plus molecular screening).;Molecular screening for point mutations and rearrangements is feasible in air-dried FNAs. Although the impact of detecting point mutations and rearrangements in FNAs has most likely been overestimated in previous studies, molecular FNA analyses improve presurgical diagnostics. The detection of BRAF mutations in FNA may improve the choice of surgery and postsurgical treatment. Further data are necessary to elucidate the true impact of detecting RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutations in FNAs. The inclusion of additional rare somatic mutations and miRNA markers might further improve the impact of molecular FNA diagnostics.",

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway. Also under investigation is the use of vemurafenib in other solid tumours with BRAF mutations, such as papillary thyroid cancer.",

The genes, coding the signaling cascade proteins (RET, RAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN, AKT), are mutated or aberrantly expressed in thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyroid cell. Genetic and epigenetic alternations, concerning MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, contribute to their activation and interaction in consequence of malignant follicular cell transformation. Moreover, it is additionally pointed out that genetic, as well as epigenetic DNA changing via aberrant methylation of several tumor suppressor and thyroid-specific genes is associated with tumor aggressiveness, being a jointly responsible mechanism for thyroid tumorigenesis. In the present manuscript the currently developed diagnostic and prognostic genetic/epigenetic markers are presented; the understanding of this molecular mechanism provides access to novel molecular therapeutic strategies.",

Site-specific methylation in CRC regulates expression of tumor-associated genes. Right-sided colon tumors more frequently have BRAF (p.V600E) mutations and have higher methylation grades when compared to left-sided malignancies. The aim of this study was to identify DNA methylation changes associated with BRAF (p.V600E) mutation status. We performed methylation profiling of colon tumor DNA, isolated from frozen sections enriched for epithelial cells by macro-dissection, and from paired healthy tissue. Single gene analyses comparing BRAF (p.V600E) with BRAF wild type revealed MEIS1 as the most significant differentially methylated gene (log2 fold change: 0.89, false discovery rate-adjusted P-value 2.8*10(-9)). This finding was validated by methylation-specific PCR that was concordant with the microarray data. Additionally, validation in an independent cohort (n=228) showed a significant association between BRAF (p.V600E) and MEIS1 methylation (OR: 13.0, 95% CI: 5.2 - 33.0, P<0.0001). MEIS1 methylation was associated with decreased MEIS1 gene expression in both patient samples and CRC cell lines. The same was true for gene expression of a truncated form of MEIS1, MEIS1 D27 , which misses exon 8 and has a proposed tumor suppression function. To trace the origin of MEIS1 promoter methylation, 14 colorectal tumors were flow-sorted. Four out of eight BRAF (p.V600E) tumor epithelial fractions (50%) showed MEIS1 promoter methylation, as well as three out of eight BRAF (p.V600E) stromal fractions (38%). Only one out of six BRAF wild type showed MEIS1 promoter methylation in both the epithelial tumor and stromal fractions (17%). In conclusion, BRAF (p.V600E) colon tumors showed significant MEIS1 promoter methylation, which was associated with decreased MEIS1 gene expression. ",

Three ATCs harbored the common BRAF mutation V600E. Using array-comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH), several distinct recurrent copy number alterations were revealed including gains in 16p11.2, 20q11.2, and 20q13.12. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed recurrent locus gain of UBCH10 in 20q13.12 and Cyclin D1 (CCND1) in 11q13. The detection of a homozygous loss encompassing the CDKN2A locus in 9p21.3 motivated the examination of p16 protein expression, which was undetectable in 24/27 ATCs (89%).

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling plays an essential role in the progression of many cancers, including melanoma and colon cancers. However, no single miRNA is reported to directly target multiple components of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We performed a miRNA PCR array screening with various MAPK/ERK signaling activities. The miRNA array data revealed that the expression of miR-524-5p was decreased in cells with an active MAPK/ERK pathway and confirmed that the expression of miR-524-5p is inversely associated with the activity of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We demonstrated that miR-524-5p directly binds to the 3'-untranslated regions of both BRAFandERK2 and suppresses the expression of these proteins. Because BRAF and ERK2 are the main components of MAPK signaling, the overexpression of miR-524-5p effectively inhibits MAPK/ERK signaling, tumor proliferation, and melanoma cell migration. Moreover, tumors overexpressing miR-524-5p were significantly smaller than those of the negative control mice. Our findings provide new insight into the role of miR-524-5p as an important miRNA that negatively regulates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that miR-524-5p could be a potent therapeutic candidate for melanoma treatment.

The ability to characterize pediatric thyroid nodules has improved with the use of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) classification system, and expanded molecular testing. Nevertheless, stratification criteria to predict thyroid malignancy in children are poorly defined. Our objective was to determine if clinical presentation and molecular genetics could predict malignancy in pediatric thyroid nodules.;Retrospective chart review of patients ≤18 years of age at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with the diagnosis of a thyroid nodule from January 2007 to January 2012 was conducted. Eighty-nine subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 1) thyroid nodule ≥0.8 cm and biopsy (n=76), or 2) thyroid nodule ≥0.8 cm, no biopsy, and ultrasound follow-up for at least 2 years (n=13).;Twenty-four (27%) of 89 patients were diagnosed with thyroid cancer (50% papillary thyroid carcinoma [PTC], 50% follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma [FVPTC]). Features associated with malignancy included larger nodule size, palpable nodule, or palpable lymphadenopathy. There were no differences in presenting features between patients with PTC and those with FVPTC. Thyroid malignancy was diagnosed in all nine patients with a molecular abnormality (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, PAX8/PPARγ).;Clinical features, FNA cytology, and molecular genetics are valuable tools to discriminate benign from malignant nodules in pediatric patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Patients suspected on clinical grounds to have hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) may be offered laboratory testing in order to confirm the diagnosis and to facilitate screening of pre-symptomatic family members. Tumours from an affected family member are usually pre-screened for microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of immunohistochemical expression of mismatch repair (MMR) genes prior to germline MMR gene mutation testing. The efficiency of this triage process is compromised by the more frequent occurrence of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) showing high levels of MSI (MSI-H) due to epigenetic loss of MLH1 expression. Somatic BRAF mutations, most frequently V600E, have been described in a significant proportion of sporadic MSI-H CRC but not in HNPCC-associated cancers. BRAF mutation testing has therefore been proposed as a means to more definitively identify and exclude sporadic MSI-H CRC cases from germline MMR gene testing. However, the clinical validity and utility of this approach have not been previously evaluated in a familial cancer clinic setting. Testing for the V600E mutation was performed on MSI-H CRC samples from 68 individuals referred for laboratory investigation of suspected HNPCC. The V600E mutation was identified in 17 of 40 (42%) tumours showing loss of MLH1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry but in none of the 28 tumours that exhibited loss of MSH2 expression (P < 0.001). The assay was negative in all patients with an identified germline MMR gene mutation. Although biased by the fact that germline testing was not pursued beyond direct sequencing in many cases lacking a high clinical index of suspicion of HNPCC, BRAF V600E detection was therefore considered to be 100% specific and 48% sensitive in detecting sporadic MSI-H CRC amongst those cases showing loss of MLH1 protein expression, in a population of patients with MSI-H CRC and clinical features suggestive of HNPCC. Accordingly, we recommend the incorporation of BRAF V600E mutation testing into the laboratory algorithm for pre-screening patients with suspected HNPCC, whose CRCs show loss of expression of MLH1. In such tumours, the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation indicates the tumour is not related to HNPCC and that germline testing of MLH1 in that individual is not warranted. We also recommend that in families where the clinical suspicion of HNPCC is high, germline testing should not be performed on an individual whose CRC harbours a somatic BRAF mutation, as this may compromise identification of the familial mutation.",

In contrast with BRAF-mutant (MT) melanoma, inhibition of the MAPK pathway is ineffective in the majority of BRAFMT colorectal cancer patients. Therefore, identification of novel therapies for BRAFMT colorectal cancer is urgently needed.;BRAFMT and wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer models were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Small-molecule inhibitors of MEK1/2, MET, and HDAC were used, overexpression and siRNA approaches were applied, and cell death was assessed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, cell viability, and caspase activity assays.;Increased c-MET-STAT3 signaling was identified as a novel adaptive resistance mechanism to MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in BRAFMT colorectal cancer models in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MEKi treatment resulted in acute increases in transcription of the endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIPL in BRAFMT cells, but not in BRAFWT cells, and inhibition of STAT3 activity abrogated MEKi-induced c-FLIPL expression. In addition, treatment with c-FLIP-specific siRNA or HDAC inhibitors abrogated MEKi-induced upregulation of c-FLIPL expression and resulted in significant increases in MEKi-induced cell death in BRAFMT colorectal cancer cells. Notably, combined HDAC inhibitor/MEKi treatment resulted in dramatically attenuated tumor growth in BRAFMT xenografts.;Our findings indicate that c-MET/STAT3-dependent upregulation of c-FLIPL expression is an important escape mechanism following MEKi treatment in BRAFMT colorectal cancer. Thus, combinations of MEKi with inhibitors of c-MET or c-FLIP (e.g., HDAC inhibitors) could be potential novel treatment strategies for BRAFMT colorectal cancer.",

Uni- and multivariate regression models for node sampling were adjusted for clinical, pathological and molecular features. Of 204 patients, 67% had an adequate harvest (≥ 12 nodes). Adequate harvest was highest in patients whose tumors exhibited MSI (79%; odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.9; P = 0.007) or were located in the proximal colon (73%; 2.8, 1.5-5.3; P = 0.002). In multiple linear regression, MSI was a significant predictor of the total LN count (P = 0.02). Total node count was highest for cancers with MSI and no KRAS/BRAF mutations. The independent association between MSI and a high LN count persisted for stage I and II cancers (P = 0.04). Tumor location in the proximal colon was the only significant predictor of an adequate LN harvest (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.9; P = 0.01).

To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase functioning as a RAS effector frequently mutated in CFCS, subjects with a diagnosis of NS (N=270), LS (N=6), and CFCS (N=33), and no mutation in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAF1, MEK1, or MEK2, were screened for the entire coding sequence of the gene. Besides the expected high prevalence of mutations observed among CFCS patients (52%), a de novo heterozygous missense change was identified in one subject with LS (17%) and five individuals with NS (1.9%). Mutations mapped to multiple protein domains and largely did not overlap with cancer-associated defects. NS-causing mutations had not been documented in CFCS, suggesting that the phenotypes arising from germline BRAF defects might be allele specific. Selected mutant BRAF proteins promoted variable gain of function of the kinase, but appeared less activating compared to the recurrent cancer-associated p.Val600Glu mutant.

The BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with multifocality, aggressive variant, absence, or infiltration of the tumoral capsule. BRAF(V600E)-mutated PTC also required a higher number of radioiodine courses to obtain disease-free status. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was the only prognostic factor predicting the persistence of the disease in these patients after 5 yr of follow-up.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor for the persistence of the disease independent from other clinical-pathological features in low-risk intrathyroid PTC patients. It could be useful to search for the BRAF(V600E) mutation in the workup of low-risk PTC patients to distinguish those who require less or more aggressive treatments. In particular, the high negative predictive value of the BRAF(V600E) mutation could be useful to identify, among low-risk PTC patients, those who could avoid 131-I treatment.",

Our objective was to assess the performance of molecular cytology on preoperative thyroid nodule fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) across a broad range of variables, including independent collection sites, clinical practices, and anatomic pathology interpretations.;Single-pass FNAs were prospectively collected from 806 nodules 1 cm or larger by ultrasonography at five independent sites across the United States. Specimens were shipped in a nucleic acid stabilization solution and tested at a centralized clinical laboratory. Seventeen genetic alterations (BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS mutations, PAX8-PPARG and RET-PTC rearrangements) were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and liquid bead array cytometry in 769 FNAs that met inclusion criteria. Cytology, histology, and clinical care followed local procedures and practices. All results were double-blinded.;Thirty-two specimens (4.2%) failed to yield sufficient nucleic acid to generate molecular data. A single genetic alteration was detected in 80% of cytology malignant cases, 21% of indeterminate, 7.8% of nondiagnostic, and 3.5% of benign cases. Among 109 nodules with surgical histology reference standard, oncogenic mutations were present in 50% of malignant nodules missed by cytology. There were 14 cancers not identified by cytology or molecular tests, including 5 carcinomas with histologic sizes less than 1 cm (3 multifocal) and 8 noninvasive follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (4 encapsulated). No mutations were detected in 89% of the nodules benign by histopathology with 6 false-positive molecular results in 5 adenomas (2-5.5 cm) and 1 cystic nodule with an incidental papillary microcarcinoma (0.15 cm). The posttest probability of thyroid cancer was 100% for nodules positive for BRAF or RET-PTC, 70% for RAS or PAX8-PPARG, and 88% for molecular cytology overall.;Centralized and standardized molecular testing for genetic alterations associated with a high risk of malignancy efficiently complements the local cytopathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodule aspirates in the clinical setting. Actionable molecular cytology can improve the personalized surgical and medical management of patients with thyroid cancers, facilitating one-stage total thyroidectomy and reducing the number of unnecessary diagnostic surgeries.",

Regarding the previous studies in literature predominant mutations take place in KRAS, BRAF, and EGFR genes in special types of cancers. In this research, we attempt to identify the prevalence and significant role of the possible mutations in EGFR exons 18-21, KRAS codon 12, 13, and 61, and BRAF codon 600 mutations in tumoral tissue specimens from patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, in this research, it has been attempted to investigate the molecular characteristics of these genes in terms of bioinformatic aspects.;A total of 35 prostatic adenocarcinoma fresh tissue samples, enriched in neoplastic cells, were obtained from the Cancer Institute of Iran. The presence of mutations at codons 12, 13 and 61 of KRAS, codon 600 of BRAF and EGFR exons 18-21 were determined by direct Sanger sequencing. To evaluate the molecular features, structure, and post-translation modification of those genes, a bioinformatics survey was performed using the SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) and NetPhos 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) Server. Also, using bioinformatics software, the phylogeny tree of the mutations was drawn.;Mutations of codons 12 and 13 of KRAS were found in 2 of the 35 prostatic adenocarcinomas. Two cases carried homozygous mutations on exon 2 in codon 12 (G12V) and codon 13 (G13D). Also, no mutation was detected at BRAF codon 600 and EGFR exons 18-21 in any of the samples.;Based on the group of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma, our research shows that the mutations in codons 12 and 13 of KRAS are the most common in prostate carcinomas. Noting these results and the molecular pathway of this gene, there is a possible more perceptible role for this gene in the pathogenesis of prostatic carcinoma. However, according to our finding, as in previous studies, the role of BRAF and EGFR gene mutations in prostate adenocarcinoma are less than in the KRAS gene and, therefore, we assume that these common mutations of the KRAS gene can be used as an early determining marker for early diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma. In the future, due to the complexity of etiological parameters in prostate cancer development, the case specific tumor molecular identification and treatment for each affected subject are urgently needed.",

The most common missense mutation of BRAF (mainly V600E) contributes to the incidence of various cancers, including Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). BRAF inhibitors molecularly targeting the V600E mutation have been developed to counteract the effect of the mutation. To ensure the administration of effective pharmacotherapy, it is therefore imperative to develop an effective assay to screen LCH patients for the V600E mutation. However, tumor tissues of LCH typically contain many inflammatory cells which make a correct judgement of the mutation status difficult in the DNA sequence analysis.;In this study, we present a new, highly sensitive analyzing method combining PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, and a sequencing assay using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens. TspRI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves the sequence encompassing the wild-type BRAF codon 600 into two fragments, which cannot be used as a template for subsequent BRAF PCR amplification. We therefore evaluated the sensitivity of BRAF V600 mutation detection by amplifying the primary PCR product digested with TspRI and sequencing the secondary PCR products. The V600E mutation was detected in FFPE tissue samples from 32 LCH patients; our assay was able to identify mutations in four samples that gave inconclusive results, and ten that were negative, according to standard PCR and sequencing.;We presented a new and highly sensitive method to detect BRAF V600 mutations.

A microtracer study approach, in which a 50 µg radiolabeled intravenous (IV) microdose of dabrafenib was given concomitantly with a 150 mg oral dose, was used to simultaneously recover IV and oral pharmacokinetic parameters. The least squares mean (90% CI) absolute bioavailability of dabrafenib (HPMC capsules) was 94.5% (81.3%, 109.7%). Median T(max) after oral administration was 2.0 hours and the geometric mean terminal half-life was 4.8 hours. The geometric mean clearance and volume of distribution after IV administration were 12.0 L/h and 45.5 L, respectively. Human clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were in agreement with predictions made using allometric scaling of pharmacokinetic parameters from four preclinical species.

We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Altogether, these results suggest that plasmatic mutant BRAF DNA is a prognostic factor of OS, correlated with tumor burden. In addition, it represents an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations before treatment. ",

However, we identified anecdotal discordance between VE1 IHC and sequencing results and therefore analyzed VE1 staining by two different IHC methods (Leica Bond and Ventana BenchMark) in whole tissue sections from 480 colorectal carcinomas (323 BRAF wild-type, 142 BRAF V600E mutation, and 15 BRAF non-V600E mutation). We also compared the results with melanomas and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). With the Bond method, among 142 BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal carcinomas, 77 (54%) had diffuse VE1 staining and 48 (33%) had heterogeneous staining, but 17 (12%) were negative. Among 323 BRAF wild-type colorectal carcinomas, 196 (61%) were negative, but 127 (39%) had staining, including 7 with diffuse staining. When positivity was defined as staining in ≥ 20% of tumor cells, VE1 IHC had sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 93% for BRAF V600E mutation. With the Ventana method, among 57 BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal carcinomas, 36 (63%) had diffuse VE1 staining, whereas 6 (11%) had no or weak (<20% of tumor cells) staining. Among 33 BRAF wild-type colorectal carcinomas, 16 (48%) had no or weak staining, whereas 15 (45%) had heterogeneous staining. In contrast with colorectal carcinoma, Bond and Ventana VE1 IHC in melanoma and PTC were highly concordant with sequencing results. We conclude that VE1 IHC produces suboptimal results in colorectal carcinoma and should not be used to guide patient management.",

A series of 342 precursor lesions were removed from 155 patients during colonoscopy. After morphologic classification, molecular analysis was performed in 103 precursor lesions, and their genetic profile compared with 47 sporadic CRCs. Adenomas were the main precursor lesions (70.2%). Among the serrated polyps, the main precursor lesion was hyperplastic polyps (HPs) (82.4%), followed by sessile serrated adenomas (12.7%) and traditional serrated adenomas (2.0%). KRAS mutations were detected in 13.6% of the precursor lesions, namely in adenomas and in HPs, but in no serrated adenoma. BRAF mutations were found in 9 (8.7%) precursor lesions, mainly associated with serrated polyps and absent in adenomas (P<0.001). High MSI (MSI-H) was absent in precursor lesions. In the 47 CCR cases, 46.8% exhibited KRAS mutation, 6.5% BRAF mutations and 10.6% MSI-H. This study confirms the role of KRAS and BRAF mutations in CRC carcinogenesis, a crucial step in implementing CRC screening strategies. ",

These results indicate that the methylation status of lesions with BRAF mutation is strongly associated with their location, histological findings and neoplastic pathways.

BRAF and H-, N- and K-RAS mutations were also screened in the 27 lesions and patients. Linkage analysis in seven informative families showed no evidence for the involvement of any of the four candidate regions, supporting a genetic heterogeneity for FNMTC.

Here, we demonstrate a novel role of the activated MAPK pathway in immune evasion by melanoma cells with the mutation of BRAF, which encodes a MAPKKs, (BRAF(V600E)). MEK inhibitor U0126 or RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF(V600E) decreased production of the immunosuppressive soluble factors interleukin (IL)-10, VEGF, or IL-6 from melanoma cells to levels comparable to those after signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 inactivation. The suppressive activity of the culture supernatants from the melanoma cells on the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha by dendritic cells upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation was markedly reduced after transduction with BRAF(V600E) RNAi, comparable to the effects observed with STAT3 RNAi transduction. No additive or synergistic effects were observed by the simultaneous transduction of RNAi for both BRAF(V600E) and STAT3. Furthermore, specific DNA binding and transcriptional activity of STAT3 were not affected by down-regulation of the MAPK signaling with the BRAF RNAi. These results indicate that the MAPK signal, along with the STAT3 signal, is essential for immune evasion by human melanomas that have constitutively active MAPK signaling and is a potential molecular target for overcoming melanoma cell evasion of the immune system.",

BRAF mutations were found in 4 of the MSI-H tumors. Patients with MSI-H CRC had lower recurrence rate (log rank test; P = 0.04) than MSS/L group. Patients with MSI-H tumor and BRAF mutation had worse DFS than MSI-H tumors without this mutation (log rank test; P = 0.01). Most of the clinicopathologic characteristics of MSI-H CRC in Serbian patients are similar to those reported in previous studies. Patients with MSI tumor phenotype had favourable prognosis, but in those with BRAF mutation higher recurrence rate was observed.",

Currently, we are able to use KRAS mutational status as a guide to therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Other molecular features under research include BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylation. These three molecular features are often associated with tumors that have overlapping phenotypes and can be present simultaneously in the same tumor. However, they carry different prognostic and predictive qualities, making analysis of their interaction relatively complex. Much research thus far has examined the clinical relevance of microsatellite instability in helping determine prognosis and the predictive value of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy in stages II and III colon cancers. BRAF mutation appears to be a biomarker for poor prognosis. CpG island methylation is tightly associated with microsatellite instable tumors and BRAF mutation, but its clinical utility remains uncertain. Hereby, we examine preclinical and clinical data that supports the utilization of all three phenotypes in future research applied to clinical practice.",

However, almost all of the previous studies were limited by small sample sizes. In addition, previous data on the KRAS mutation and clinical outcomes in PC remain inconclusive. To clarify these data, we examined the mutation status of 126 PC patients and its relationship to clinical outcome. The frequencies of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations were determined from a non-biased database of 126 resected PCs and a high-throughput pyrosequencing assay. KRAS mutations were detected in 109 (86.5 %) of the 126 cases; the most common mutation was c.34G > T (p.G12C), which was present in 80 tumors, followed by c.35G > T (p.G12V) in 52 tumors. The KRAS mutation was not associated with any clinical or pathological features (p > 0.05 in all cases). In addition, the KRAS mutation was unrelated to overall survival (log rank p = 0.21) and cancer-specific survival (log rank p = 0.27). Importantly, the influence of KRAS mutation on patient outcome was not modified by any of the clinical or pathological variables (p for all interactions >0.05). Only one PIK3CA mutation (0.8 %) was detected on exon 9 RS3 (c.1633G > A, p.E545K). The BRAF mutation was not detected in PC. KRAS mutations appear to be unrelated to clinical outcome in PC. BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were extremely rare in PC, suggesting that they play a limited role in PC development. ",

Individual tumors were given an expression score (max 300) by multiplying the percent positive tumor cells by the intensity score (range 0-3). The higher expression of HBME-1 and claudin-1 distinguished BRAF-like phenotype from RAS-like phenotype. The same correlation was also retained for both markers when comparing BRAF-like phenotype with non-invasive and invasive RAS-like phenotypes. The expression scores and positivity rates for both markers did not yield any statistical difference among BRAF-like PTCs. Except the higher positivity rate of HBME-1, invasive RAS-like tumors were not statistically different than their non-invasive counterparts with respect to the positivity rate of claudin-1 and the expression scores of both markers. A central lymph node dissection or selective lymph node sampling was available in 20 specimens. The absence of claudin-1 expression has not been a feature of lymph node metastasis in this series. Despite the limited number of nodal sampling, BRAF-like phenotype and claudin-1 positivity status have been considered the best determinants of positive predictive value and negative predictive value in the prediction of lymph node metastasis among variables, respectively. Adoption of the simplified architectural classification approach to PTCs showed distinct biomarker expression profile in this series; however, immunohistochemistry for HBME-1 and claudin-1 does not seem to be useful in the distinction of invasive RAS-like PTCs from their non-invasive counterparts. Given the overlapping molecular signatures within the RAS-like phenotype, further studies with additional biomarkers are still needed to identify distinct protein expression signatures of non-invasive RAS-like phenotype as this diagnostic category still remains a surgical diagnosis at this time.

NIS expression was lower in DTC patients over 45 years old and in tumours larger than 2 cm. There was a tendency for lower NIS expression in advanced stages and patients presenting recurrences. All 13 DTC patients who succumbed to the disease were NIS negative at immunohistochemistry and had very low mRNA expression. NIS expression was lower in PTC presenting BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, neither NIS immunohistochemical analysis nor NIS mRNA quantified expression could identify individuals with poor prognosis.;Our data suggest that NIS expression may help characterize patients' risk and individuals with a poor response to therapy, but is not useful as a diagnostic or prognostic marker, reinforcing the current concept that an appropriate management of DTC patient is the most important and modifiable prognostic factor.",

HPV E7 Type-specific PCR was used for HPV-16 and -18 status.;KRAS mutations were found in 16 adenocarcinomas (13.9%), while BRAF mutations were found in 5 (4.3%). RASSF1A methylation was found in 27 adenocarcinomas (23.5%) and inversely correlated with KRAS and/or BRAF mutation (p=0.002) in cervical adenocarcinoma. In cervical squamous cell carcinomas, KRAS mutations were detected only in 1 (0.7%) cases and RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected in 2 (1.4%).

Neither KRAS mutation nor RASSF1A methylation were associated with HPV status. RASSF1A hypermethylation and KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations are inversely correlated and play an important role in the development of adenocarcinomas.;These results are suggesting that these two histological types of cervical cancer arise through different molecular pathways in tumor development.

Here, we investigated the role of aberrant DNA methylation in the development of well-differentiated thyroid tumors. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in the largest well-differentiated thyroid tumor series reported to date, comprising 83 primary tumors as well as 8 samples of adjacent normal tissue. The epigenetic profiles were closely related to not only tumor histology but also the underlying driver mutation; we found that follicular tumors had higher levels of methylation, which seemed to accumulate in a progressive manner along the tumorigenic process from adenomas to carcinomas. Furthermore, tumors harboring a BRAF or RAS mutation had a larger number of hypo- or hypermethylation events, respectively. The aberrant methylation of several candidate genes potentially related to thyroid carcinogenesis was validated in an independent series of 52 samples. Furthermore, through the integration of methylation and transcriptional expression data, we identified genes whose expression is associated with the methylation status of their promoters. Finally, by integrating clinical follow-up information with methylation levels we propose etoposide-induced 2.4 and Wilms tumor 1 as novel prognostic markers related to recurrence-free survival. This comprehensive study provides insights into the role of DNA methylation in well-differentiated thyroid cancer development and identifies novel markers associated with recurrence-free survival. ",

Higher expression of its pro-death receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5) attenuates higher sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and represents a marker for better cancer prognosis and treatment. Since receptor availability can be analogous to ligand efficacy, we performed RT-PCR analysis of DR4 and DR5 in 51 colon cancer biopsy specimens and respective normal mucosa, while 11 of these tumors were determined immunohistochemically for protein expression. Transcriptional analysis showed that DR4 and DR5 were significantly upregulated in 37 and 47% of the tumor samples respectively, while both DR4 and DR5 were coinstantaneously upregulated in 31% of the samples analyzed. Positive transcriptional regulation of DRs was recorded as early as Dukes' A stage. Furthermore, protein expression analysis yielded results comparable to DR4 and DR5 increased mRNA levels. Possible contributing events to DR upregulation involve presence of frequent oncogenic mutations in the MAPK pathway, and was investigated by direct sequencing in all 51 tumors. Samples (6/8) hosting either a KRAS(G12V) or BRAF(V600E) mutation, significantly amplified the upregulated expression of DR4 and DR5, showing strong inter-relation between overexpression and presence of oncogenic KRAS/ BRAF mutations. In the light of recent data concerning TRAIL receptor distribution, we contribute further by presenting DR5 as the most frequently upregulated DR in colon cancer. Furthermore, oncogenic mutations may directly or indirectly enhance DR expression, potentially sensitizing these tumors to TRAIL-based therapies.",

Among the genetic aberrations described in PTC, the BRAF V600E mutation and ret/PTC activation occur most commonly. Several studies have investigated the genetic alteration status of multifocal thyroid tumours, with discordant results. To address the question of clonality this study examined disparate geographical and morphological areas from a single PTC (classic PTC, insular and anaplastic foci, and tumour cells adjacent to vascular invasion and lymphocytic infiltrate) for the presence of ret/PTC 1 or BRAF mutations. Moreover, we wanted to investigate the consistency of miRNA signatures within disparate areas of a tumour, and geographical data was further correlated with expression profiles of 330 different miRNAs. Putative miRNA gene targets were predicted for differentially regulated miRNAs and immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections in an effort to investigate phenotypic variations in microvascular density (MVD), and cytokeratin and p53 protein expression levels.;All of the morphological areas proved negative for ret/PTC 1 rearrangement. Two distinct foci with classic morphology harboured the BRAF mutation. All other regions, including the insular and anaplastic areas were negative for the mutation. MiRNA profiles were found to distinguish tumours containing the BRAF mutation from the other tumour types, and to differentiate between the more aggressive insular & anaplastic tumours, and the classic variant. Our data corroborated miRNAs previously discovered in this carcinoma, and additional miRNAs linked to various processes involved in tumour growth and proliferation.;The initial genetic alteration analysis indicated that pluriform PTC did not necessarily evolve from classic PTC progenitor foci. Analysis of miRNA profiles however provided an interesting variation on the clonality question. While hierarchical clustering analysis of miRNA expression supported the hypothesis that discrete areas did not evolve from clonal expansion of tumour cells, it did not exclude the possibility of independent mutational events suggesting both phenomena might occur simultaneously within a tumour to enhance cancer progression in geographical micro-environments within a tumour.",

This study aimed at evaluating CPSF2 protein expression as a prognostic marker for PTC in a region with a high prevalence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, Korea.;This study included 159 patients with classical PTC who underwent a total thyroidectomy and received ablative doses of (131)I. The expression of CPSF2 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and graded semi-quantitatively. The presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was evaluated by direct sequencing.;Negative protein expression of CPSF2 was observed in 34 (21.3%) of the 159 PTCs. In multivariate analysis, negative CPSF2 expression was significantly associated with cervical lymph node metastasis (odds ratio [OR]=2.56, p=0.28), and distant metastasis (OR=3.48, p=0.02). After adjusting for age, sex, tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and the BRAF(V600E) mutation, the CPSF2-negative group had a significantly lower recurrence-free survival compared to the CPSF2-positive group (hazard ratio=2.14, p=0.03).;Negative protein expression of CPSF2 is independently associated with a poor clinical outcome in PTC.

The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with both papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and HT show aggressive features, by investigating the clinicopathological features of HT in patients with PTC.;A database of patients with PTC who underwent thyroidectomy between October 2008 and August 2012 was collected and reviewed. All 2464 patients were offered a thyroidectomy, and DNA was extracted from the atypical cells in the surgical specimens for detection of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. Clinical and pathological characteristics were also investigated.;Four hundred and fifty-two of 1945 (23.2%) patients were diagnosed with HT, and of these, 119 (72.1%) had a BRAF (V600E) mutation. HT was not significantly associated with the BRAF (V600E) mutation (P < 0.001) and extrathyroidal extensions (P = 0.005) but was associated with a low stage (P = 0.011) and female predominance (P < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis for gender, HT was associated with a low probability of BRAF (V600E) mutations in both genders (P < 0.001 for both females and males). Also, recurrence was significantly associated with HT (OR 0.297, CI 0.099-0.890, P = 0.030), lymph node ratio (OR 2.545, CI 1.092-5.931, P = 0.030), and BRAF (V600E) mutation (OR 2.075, CI 1.021-4.217, P = 0.044). However, there was no relationship with clinicopathological factors or with death.;Our results show that HT in patients with PTC is associated with a low probability of BRAF (V600E) mutations.

The histologic cell type was serous in 21 cases, endometrioid in 30 cases, clear cell in 31 cases, and mucinous in 22 cases. Additional clinical and pathological information was abstracted from patient records, and pathology review was performed for all cases. Direct sequence analysis of exon 2 of the KRAS gene, containing codon 12, was performed using DNA isolated from all tumor specimens. Sequence analyses of exons 11 and 15 of the BRAF gene were performed for the 22 cases of mucinous ovarian carcinoma.;Activating KRAS mutations were more common in mucinous tumors (50%) than in all other histologic types combined (5%; P < 10(-7)). Mutation of KRAS was more common in stage I tumors than in advanced stage tumors (P = 0.0004). Of the 11 mucinous tumors with KRAS mutations, 6 were of Mullerian (endocervical) type and 5 were of gastrointestinal type. No mucinous tumor was found to harbor a BRAF mutation.;These data indicate that KRAS oncogene mutations exist in several histologic types of invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma, especially stage I tumors, but are common only in tumors of mucinous histology. Mutations are equally prevalent in mucinous ovarian cancers of Müllerian and gastrointestinal types.

Nine months after initial diagnosis, radiographic studies revealed multiple pulmonary metastases. A dermatologic examination showed a solitary 1.2-cm chest nodule. Skin biopsy from this nodule revealed infiltrative dermal spindle cells arranged in poorly formed fascicles. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the tumor cells to be PAX-8 (+), pancytokeratin (+, focally), TTF-1 (-) and SOX-10 (-). Comparison with the patient's primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma revealed focal areas of poorly differentiated spindle cells morphologically similar to the malignant spindle cells in the skin biopsy. Together, these findings confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma metastatic to skin. Cutaneous metastasis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma composed exclusively of spindle cells broadens the histologic differential diagnosis of cutaneous spindle cell malignancies and presents further diagnostic challenges.

In the present study, we analyzed the expression of SHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI1 in 31 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTA), 8 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), and 51 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) by immunohistochemical staining. More than 65% of FTA, PTC, and ATC specimens stained positive for SHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI. However, the expression of the genes encoding these four molecules did not correlate with any clinicopathologic parameters, including the age, gender, the status of BRAF gene mutation, tumor stage, local invasion, and metastasis. Three thyroid tumor cell lines (KAT-18, WRO82, and SW1736) all expressed the genes encoding these four molecules. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling and MTT cell proliferation assays revealed that cyclopamine (CP), an inhibitor of the SHH pathway, was able to inhibit the proliferation of KAT-18 and WRO82 cells more effectively than SW1736 cells. CP led to the arrest of cell cycle or apoptosis. Knockdown of SHH and GLI expression by miRNA constructs that target SHH or GLI mRNA in KAT-18 and SW1736 cells led to the inhibition of cell proliferation.

Intriguingly, we found that well-known cancer driver genes such as BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, and TP53 were often co-occurred with other driver genes and FMGSs size peaked at an itemset size of 3~4 genes. Besides, the number and constitution of FMGS and ARs differed greatly among different cancers and stages. In addition, FMGS and ARs were rare in endocrine-related cancers such as breast carcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, but abundant in cancers contact directly with external environments such as skin melanoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we observed more rules in stage IV than in other stages, indicating that distant metastasis needed more sophisticated gene regulatory network.",

Grade 3 toxicities included keratoacanthomas, rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. Of the 21 patients treated, one patient had a confirmed partial response (5%; 95% CI, 1% to 24%) and seven other patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Patterns of concurrent mutations, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylation status, PTEN loss, EGFR expression, and copy number alterations were not associated with clinical benefit. In contrast to prior expectations, concurrent KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected at low allele frequency in a subset of the patients' tumors (median, 0.21% allele frequency) and were apparent mechanisms of acquired resistance in vemurafenib-sensitive patient-derived xenograft models.;In marked contrast to the results seen in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib did not show meaningful clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E mutant CRC.

This relatively selective shared genetic vulnerability raises the possibility that these 2 tumors are connected through a common undisclosed pathogenic mechanism. To assess for possible associations between these 2 genetically related tumors at the population level, we calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for thyroid cancer (TC) among cutaneous melanoma (CM) survivors and CM among TC survivors using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) database. Between 1973 and 2000, there were 73,274 and 27,138 cases of CM and TC cases, respectively. Overall, we found a 2.17-fold increase (p < 0.0000001) in the risk of TC after a diagnosis of CM. This augmented risk of TC is somewhat higher for males, for those diagnosed more recently and for the first 3 years after the CM diagnosis. We also detected a considerably smaller and borderline significant increased risk of CM (25%, p = 0.063) among the post-TC survivors. Of note, TC patients who received radiation therapy had a 57% increased risk of a subsequent CM (p = 0.034). Our study documents a strong unilateral risk of TC after CM.

The highly selective BRAF(V600) inhibitor, vemurafenib, was identified initially through a large-scale drug screen.;Here we examine vemurafenib's journey from discovery to clinical use in metastatic melanoma. Topics covered include preclinical data, single agent Phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials, resistance issues and mechanisms, adverse effects including the development of squamous cell cancers, and combination trials.;Due to its tolerance, low toxicity profile, rapid tumor response, and improved outcomes in melanoma patients with BRAF(V600) mutations, vemurafenib was advanced rapidly through clinical trials to receive FDA approval in 2011. While its efficacy is well documented, durability has become an issue for most patients who experience therapeutic resistance in approximately 6-8 months. In addition, a concerning toxicity observed in patients taking the drug include development of localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). It is hypothesized that drug resistance and SCC development result from a similar paradoxical activation of protein signaling pathways, specifically MAPK.

We have proposed a molecular test based on the expression level of a series of 19 genes, capable of discriminating malignant from benign tumors [15]. A prospective study aiming at the clinical validation of the molecular test has been performed on a cohort of 730 patients with a thyroid nodule. In patients subjected to tumor resection (≈ 220), the preoperative molecular diagnosis (generated on FNAB material from analyses of the expression level of the 19 genes) was compared to the postoperative diagnosis given by the pathologist (used as reference). Treatment and follow-up of the serious forms of thyroid cancer should benefit by the early identification of tumors with a metastatic potential using molecular characteristics differentiating invasive and non-invasive thyroid carcinomas. We have performed genetic and genomic analyses on a series of 200 papillary thyroid carcinomas (non-invasive or NI-PTC, 50%; invasive or I-PTC, 50%). BRAF(V600E) mutation or/and RET/PTC gene rearrangement have been detected in less than 25% of NI-PTC but in more than 75% of I-PTC.

We and others have recently demonstrated that c-SRC is a key mediator of growth, invasion, and metastasis, and therefore represents a promising therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. However, clinically, Src inhibitor efficacy has been limited, and therefore further insights are needed to define resistance mechanisms and determine rational combination therapies. We have generated four thyroid cancer cell lines with a greater than 30-fold increase in acquired resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Upon acquisition of dasatinib resistance, the two RAS-mutant cell lines acquired the c-SRC gatekeeper mutation (T341M), whereas the two BRAF-mutant cell lines did not. Accordingly, Src signaling was refractory to dasatinib treatment in the RAS-mutant dasatinib-resistant cell lines. Interestingly, activation of the MAPK pathway was increased in all four of the dasatinib-resistant cell lines, likely due to B-Raf and c-Raf dimerization. Furthermore, MAP2K1/MAP2K2 (MEK1/2) inhibition restored sensitivity in all four of the dasatinib-resistant cell lines, and overcame acquired resistance to dasatinib in the RAS-mutant Cal62 cell line, in vivo Together, these studies demonstrate that acquisition of the c-SRC gatekeeper mutation and MAPK pathway signaling play important roles in promoting resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. We further demonstrate that up-front combined inhibition with dasatinib and MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors drives synergistic inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis, indicating that combined inhibition may overcome mechanisms of survival in response to single-agent inhibition.

We previously reported Rap1GAP was highly expressed in normal human thyroid cells and decreased in five papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs).;To confirm the significance of these findings, we analyzed Rap1GAP expression in a larger set of benign tumors (adenomas and hyperplastic nodules) and PTCs. We determined whether the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation or allelic loss of Rap1GAP related to changes in Rap1GAP protein expression. To determine the consequences of Rap1GAP loss, we targeted Rap1GAP in culture using small interfering RNA.;A highly specific Rap1GAP antibody was applied to sections of 55 human thyroid tissues. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, and loss of Rap1GAP. Rap1GAP expression in rat thyroid cells was abolished using small interfering RNA.;We observed that down-regulation of Rap1GAP in benign lesions and PTCs was common. Rap1GAP expression was more severely decreased in PTCs. Loss of Rap1GAP expression was observed in multiple histological variants of PTCs. Approximately 20% of PTCs and adenomas exhibited allelic loss of Rap1GAP. Loss of Rap1GAP was not associated with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In vitro, loss of Rap1GAP was sufficient to increase Rap1 activity in thyroid cells.;These data indicate that loss of Rap1GAP is a frequent event in PTC. The more frequent and greater down-regulation of Rap1GAP in PTCs compared with adenomas suggests a role for Rap1GAP depletion in the progression of human thyroid tumors, possibly through unrestrained Rap activity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gain-of-function mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes are found in up to 50% of colorectal cancers. These mutations result in the activation of the BRAF/MEK signaling pathway culminating in the stimulation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Upon activation, ERK1/2 translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This process has been shown to be required for the induction of many cellular responses, although the molecular mechanisms regulating ERK nuclear function, especially under oncogenic stimulation, remain to be explored. Herein, we examined the spatiotemporal regulation of ERK1/2 activity upon oncogenic activation of KRAS(G12V) and BRAF(V600E) in normal intestinal epithelial crypt cells (IECs). Results demonstrate that expression of these oncogenes markedly stimulated ERK1/2 activities and morphologically transformed IECs. Importantly however, ERK phosphorylation was not observed in the nucleus, but restricted to the cytoplasm of KRAS(G12V)- and BRAF(V600E)-transformed IECs. The absence of nuclear ERK phosphorylation was due to a vanadate-sensitive phosphatase activity. Nuclear ERK dephosphorylation was found to be tightly correlated with the rapid expression of DUSP4 phosphatase induced in an MEK-dependent manner. In addition, MEK-dependent phosphorylation of T361, T363, S390 and S395 residues highly stabilized DUSP4 protein. Finally, in human colorectal cancer cells, ERK1/2 activities were also confined to the cytoplasm and treatment with pervanadate reactivated ERK1/2 in the nucleus. Accordingly, DUSP4 mRNAs were found to be highly expressed, in an MEK-dependent manner, in all colorectal cancer cells analyzed. These findings indicate that DUSP4 functions as part of a negative feedback mechanism in the control of the duration and magnitude of nuclear ERK activation during intestinal tumorigenesis.",

However, the presence of mutated KRAS alleles in cancer is a predictive marker of anti-EGFR drug resistance. Similarly, alterations of other members of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway may also be such predictive markers, especially the BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer. Therefore, the identification of KRAS and BRAF mutations may be important in predicting resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. We looked at the Tm analysis for simultaneous detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations using a quenching probe. The oligonucleotide probes modified with certain fluorescent dyes at 5'-end cytosine are quenched by their interaction with a uniquely positioned guanine. When the probe is hybridized with target DNA, its fluorescence is quenched by the guanine in the target DNA. However, as the temperature is raised, perfect match probes and miss match probes dissociate at different temperatures. Dissociated probes generate fluorescence.

The BRAF V600E mutation and 5 CpG island markers (MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, p16 and hMLH1) were assessed in 1154 cases of colon cancer. We hypothesized that dietary factors involved in DNA methylation, cruciferous vegetables and use of aspirin/NSAIDs would be associated with CIMP-high tumors. Dietary folate, vitamins B(6) and B(12), methionine and alcohol were not associated with increased likelihood of colon tumors with the CIMP-high (2 or more markers methylated) phenotype. Dietary fiber, physical activity and aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were inversely associated with both CIMP-low and CIMP-high tumors. Our results also suggested non-CIMP pathways as well. Obese individuals were at 2-fold increased risk of having a CIMP-low tumor. Alcohol was associated with an increased risk of tumors that were MSI+ and CIMP-low. In the presence of smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day, use of NSAIDs did not protect against a BRAF mutation.

A 4-year-old, female patient with a high risk adrenal NB was found to have a 2.9-cm, right thyroid nodule on surveillance chest computed tomography (CT) 6 months after completion of her NB treatment (induction chemotherapy, tumor resection, autologous stem cell transplantation, external beam radiation to the abdominal tumor site, immunotherapy, and retinoic acid). Posttreatment surveillance included iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans and CT scans. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule diagnosed a follicular neoplasm, which was negative for BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, PAX8/PPARg, and RET/PTC mutations, without evidence of metastatic NB. Nodule histology demonstrated an encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC). Next-generation sequence analysis for a 46 cancer-gene profile was performed on both tumors with subsequent peripheral blood DNA testing. A heterozygous missense mutation in STK11 (F354L) was identified in both the NB and FVPTC. This mutation was also detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two additional heterozygous somatic missense mutations of uncertain significance were identified: KDR/VEGF receptor 2 (Q472H) on chromosome 4 and MET (N375S) on chromosome 7. To our knowledge, this is the shortest reported duration from completion of NB treatment to detection of thyroid cancer.

HRMA revealed abnormal melting profiles in 65 CRCs (56.0%), 16 of them harboring mutations in 2 different genes simultaneously. The frequency of mutations was 17.2% for PIK3CA (11.2% in exon 9 and 6.0% in exon 20), 43.1% for KRAS exon 2, and 9.5% in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. We found a significant association between PIK3CA and KRAS mutations (P = .008), whereas KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive (P = .001).

        "Doc_abstract":"The BRAFT1799A mutation is the most common genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). It is also found in a subset of papillary microcarcinomas, consistent with a role in tumor initiation. PTCs with BRAFT1799A are often invasive and present at a more advanced stage. BRAFT1799A is found with high prevalence in tall-cell variant PTCs and in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas arising from PTCs. To explore the role of BRAFV600E in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, we targeted its expression to thyroid cells of transgenic FVB/N mice with a bovine thyroglobulin promoter. Two Tg-BRAFV600E lines (Tg-BRAF2 and Tg-BRAF3) were propagated for detailed analysis. Tg-BRAF2 and Tg-BRAF3 mice had increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (>7- and approximately 2-fold, respectively). This likely resulted from decreased expression of thyroid peroxidase, sodium iodine symporter, and thyroglobulin. All lines seemed to successfully compensate for thyroid dysfunction, as serum thyroxine/triiodothyronine and somatic growth were normal. Thyroid glands of transgenic mice were markedly enlarged by 5 weeks of age. In Tg-BRAF2 mice, PTCs were present at 12 and 22 weeks in 14 of 15 and 13 of 14 animals, respectively, with 83% exhibiting tall-cell features, 83% areas of invasion, and 48% foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma. Tg-BRAF3 mice also developed PTCs, albeit with lower prevalence (3 of 12 and 4 of 9 at 12 and 22 weeks, respectively). Tg-BRAF2 mice had a 30% decrease in survival at 5 months. In summary, thyroid-specific expression of BRAFV600E induces goiter and invasive PTC, which transitions to poorly differentiated carcinomas. This closely recapitulates the phenotype of BRAF-positive PTCs in humans and supports a key role for this oncogene in its pathogenesis.",

The aim of this review is to critically analyse the features of this entity. A search of the literature revealed 25 clinicopathological studies with in-depth analysis of features of DSVPTC. Overall, the prevalence of DSVPTC varies from 0.7-6.6% of all papillary thyroid carcinoma. Higher prevalence of DSVPTC was noted in paediatric patients and in patients affected by irradiation. DSVPTC tends to occur more frequently in women and in patients in the third decade of life. Macroscopically, DSVPTC can involve the thyroid gland extensively without forming a dominant mass. Microscopic examination of DSVPTC revealed extensive fibrosis, squamous metaplasia and numerous psammoma bodies. The latter pathological feature can aid in the pre-operative diagnosis of the entity by fine needle aspiration and ultrasound. Compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma, DSVPTC had a higher incidence of lymph node metastases at presentation. Distant metastases were noted in approximately 5% of the cases. Patients with DSVPTC were recommended to be managed by aggressive treatment protocols. It is likely that as a result of this, the prognosis of the patients with DSVPTC was noted to be similar to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. Overall, cancer recurrence and cancer related mortality have been reported in 14% and 3%, respectively, of patients with DSVPTC. In immunohistochemical studies, DSVPTC showed different expression patterns of epithelial membrane antigen, galectin 3, cell adhesion molecules, p53 and p63 when compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. On genetic analysis, the occurrence of BRAF and RAS mutations are uncommon events in DSVPTC and activation of RET/PTC rearrangements are common. To conclude, DSVPTC has different clinical, pathological and molecular profiles when compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. ",

A strong association of CLN metastasis and BRAF mutation with disease recurrence/persistence was revealed on Kaplan-Meier analysis and BRAF mutation strongly predicted CLN metastasis. CLN metastases found on CND are closely associated with disease recurrence/persistence of PTC, which are both strongly predicted by BRAF mutation.

PRDM5 has not been extensively investigated in specific subtypes of colorectal cancers. We hypothesized it would be more commonly methylated and inactivated in serrated pathway colorectal cancers that are hallmarked by a BRAF V600E mutation and a methylator phenotype, compared to traditional pathway cancers that are BRAF wild type.;Cancer (214 BRAF mutant, 122 BRAF wild type) and polyp (59 serrated polyps, 40 conventional adenomas) cohorts were analysed for PRDM5 promoter methylation using MethyLight technology. PRDM5 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in cancers and polyps. Mutation of PRDM5 was analysed using cBioPortal's publicly available database.;BRAF mutant cancers had significantly more frequent PRDM5 promoter methylation than BRAF wild type cancers (77/214,36% vs 4/122,3%; p<0.0001). Serrated type polyps had a lower methylation rate than cancers but were more commonly methylated than conventional adenomas (6/59,10% vs 0/40,0%). PRDM5 methylation was associated with advanced stages of presentation (p<0.05) and the methylator phenotype (p=0.03). PRDM5 protein expression was substantially down-regulated in both BRAF mutant and wild type cancer cohorts (92/97,95% and 39/44,89%). The polyp subgroups showed less silencing than the cancers, but similar rates were found between the serrated and conventional polyp cohorts (29/59, 49%; 23/40, 58% respectively). Of 295 colorectal cancers, PRDM5 was mutated in only 6 (2%) cancers which were all BRAF wild type.;Serrated pathway colorectal cancers demonstrated early and progressive PRDM5 methylation with advancing disease. Interestingly, PRDM5 protein expression was substantially reduced in all polyp types and more so in cancers which also indicates early and increasing PRDM5 down-regulation with disease progression. Methylation may be contributing to gene silencing in a proportion of BRAF mutant cancers, but the large extent of absent protein expression indicates other mechanisms are also responsible for this.

We aimed at determine the frequency of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in the process of colorectal tumourigenesis using a series of colorectal polyps and carcinomas. In the series of polyps CIMP, MLH1 methylation and MSI were also studied.;Mutation analyses were performed by PCR/sequencing. Bisulfite treated DNA was used to study CIMP and MLH1 methylation. MSI was detected by pentaplex PCR and Genescan analysis of quasimonomorphic mononucleotide repeats. Chi Square test and Fisher's Exact test were used to perform association studies.;KRAS, PIK3CA or BRAF occur in 71% of polyps and were mutually exclusive. KRAS mutations occur in 35% of polyps. PIK3CA was found in one of the polyps. V600E BRAF mutations occur in 29% of cases, all of them classified as serrated adenoma. CIMP phenotype occurred in 25% of the polyps and all were mutated for BRAF. MLH1 methylation was not detected and all the polyps were microsatellite stable. The comparison between the frequency of oncogenic mutations in polyps and CRC (MSI and MSS) lead us to demonstrate that KRAS and PIK3CA are likely to precede both types of CRC. BRAF mutations are likely to precede MSI carcinomas since the frequency found in serrated polyps is similar to what is found in MSI CRC (P = 0.9112), but statistically different from what is found in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours (P = 0.0191).;Our results show that BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations occur prior to malignant transformation demonstrating that these oncogenic alterations are primary genetic events in colorectal carcinogenesis. Further, we show that BRAF mutations occur in association with CIMP phenotype in colorectal serrated polyps and verified that colorectal serrated polyps and MSI CRC show a similar frequency of BRAF mutations. These results support that BRAF mutations harbour a mild oncogenic effect in comparison to KRAS and suggest that BRAF mutant colorectal cells need to accumulate extra epigenetic alterations in order to acquire full transformation and evolve to MSI CRC.",

We found that suppression of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) confers sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors in colon cancer. Mechanistically, we found that inhibition of PTPN11 blocks signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway. PTPN11 suppression is lethal to cells that are driven by activated RTKs and prevents acquired resistance to targeted cancer drugs that results from RTK activation. Our findings identify PTPN11 as a drug target to combat both intrinsic and acquired resistance to several targeted cancer drugs. Moreover, activated PTPN11 can serve as a biomarker of drug resistance resulting from RTK activation.",

Aberrant expression of the transcription factor SOX2 has recently been observed in several cancer types, but its role in CRC has not been fully elucidated. Here we studied the expression of SOX2 in 441 CRC patients by immunohistochemistry and related the expression to clinicopathological and molecular variables and patient prognosis. SOX2 was expressed in 11% of the tumors and was significantly associated to BRAFV600E mutation, but not to KRAS mutations (codon 12 and 13). SOX2 positivity was correlated to poor patient survival, especially in BRAFV600E mutated cases. In vitro studies showed that cells expressing the constitutively active BRAFV600E had increased SOX2 expression, a finding not found in cells expressing KRASG12V. Furthermore, blocking downstream BRAF signalling using a MEK-inhibitor resulted in a decreased expression of SOX2. Since SOX2 overexpression has been correlated to increased migration and invasion, we investigated the SOX2 expression in human CRC liver metastasis and found that a SOX2 positive primary CRC also had SOX2 expression in corresponding liver metastases. Finally we found that cells overexpressing SOX2 in vitro showed enhanced expression of FGFR1, which has been reported to correlate with liver metastasis in CRC. Our novel findings suggest that SOX2 expression is partly regulated by BRAF signalling, and an increased SOX2 expression may promote CRC metastasis and mediate a poor patient prognosis. ",

The authors studied mutations of the BRAF and K-ras genes, RASSF1A promoter methylation, and p53 overexpression in 43 polypoid-type and 30 flat-type early-stage colorectal cancers. No tumor simultaneously showed any combination of K-ras mutations, BRAF mutations, and RASSF1A promoter methylation. Three of the 73 tumors (4.1%) had BRAF mutations. All BRAF mutation-positive tumors were flat-type cancers, not associated with coexisting adenoma or p53 overexpression. RASSF1A promoter methylation was detected in 12 out of 73 tumors (16.4%), and the proportion of positive cases was similar in polypoid-type and flat-type cancers. BRAF mutations, K-ras mutations, and RASSF1A promoter methylation independently participate in early-stage colorectal carcinogenesis. BRAF mutations are involved only in flat-type cancers, whereas RASSF1A promoter methylation is involved in both polypoid-type and flat-type cancers.

Moreover, a trend toward a higher prevalence of local metastases was observed in ER- and PR-expressing tumors, which possibly indicates a more aggressive behavior. Interestingly, the occurrence of the 'receptor conversion' phenomenon, which has already been reported to have a negative prognostic effect in breast cancer, was demonstrated for the first time in thyroid tumors. Indeed, almost all of the ERα-positive primary tumors analyzed had ERα-negative metastatic lymph nodes. At the genetic analyses, BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 23.2% of the tumors and had a higher prevalence in larger tumors and in those with a stronger ERα or PR staining.;The whole of the findings reported in the present study argue for an association between ERα and PR sex hormone receptor expression and a more aggressive presentation.

The molecular mechanism that contributes to low NIS expression is not well understood. Activated NIS gene expression is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone-mediated cAMP/protein kinase A signaling through a NIS upstream enhancer (NUE). The cAMP pathway is also stimulated by forskolin. In the current work, we studied the mechanism of transcriptional activation of NIS in normal thyroid cells and thyroid cancer cells. We identified the cAMP response element modulator (CREM) activator as a new component of the transcription complex that is important for NIS gene expression. The CREM complex is seen in the normal thyroid cells and BRAF (V600E) thyroid cancer cells (BHP 17-10) but is missing in rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma-1 rearrangement thyroid cancer cells (BHP 2-7). This complex is believed to be responsible for the loss of NUE activity and reduced NIS expression in the BHP 2-7 cell line. In BHP 2-7 cells, forskolin stimulated the thyroid-specific transcription factor Pax 8, but CREM activator mRNA did not increase, and this produced a small increase in NUE activity. Ectopic expression of CREM activator enhanced activity of the NUE, indicating that CREM is an essential regulator of NIS gene expression.",

Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

Patients were enrolled at university hospitals or private cancer centres in Europe and the USA. The three arms were: twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for NRAS-mutated melanoma, twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma, and twice-daily MEK162 60 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors was permitted, but previous MEK inhibitor therapy was not allowed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an objective response (ie, a complete response or confirmed partial response). We report data for the 45 mg groups. We assessed clinical activity in all patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 and in patients assessable for response (with two available CT scans).

On the other hand, some reports say KRAS codon 13 mutation (p.G13D) has lower resistance against anti-EGFR antibodies, thus there is a substantial need for detection of specific KRAS mutations. We have established a state-of-the-art measurement system using QProbe (QP) method that allows simultaneous measurement of KRAS codon 12/13, p.G13D and BRAF mutation, and compared this method against Direct Sequencing (DS) using 182 specimens from colon cancer patients. In addition, 32 biopsy specimens were processed with a novel pre-treatment method without DNA purification in order to detect KRAS/BRAF. As a result of KRAS mutation measurement, concordance rate between the QP method and DS method was 81.4% (144/177) except for the 5 specimens that were undeterminable. Among them, 29 specimens became positive with QP method and negative with DS method. BRAF was measured with QP method only, and the mutation detection rate was 3.9% (6/153). KRAS measurement using a simple new pre-treatment method without DNA extraction resulted in 31 good results out of 32, all of them matching with the DS method. We have established a simple but highly sensitive simultaneous detection system for KRAS/BRAF.

In this study, we explored these features in BSCC.;A database of 502 esophageal cancers was used to evaluate the clinical and molecular characteristics of BSCC. KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations and LINE-1 methylation were analyzed by pyrosequencing.;Of 502 tumors, 22 (4.4 %) were pathologically diagnosed as BSCC, and 440 (87 %) as SCC. No prognostic differences between BSCC and SCC cases were identified (p = 0.41). KRAS or BRAF mutations were not observed in BSCCs. While 23 % of SCC tumors harbored a PIK3CA mutation, all BSCC cases were wild-type for PIK3CA (p = 0.002), and there were no differences in p53 expression between BSCCs and SCCs (p = 0.57), as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, BSCC tissues exhibited significantly lower levels of LINE-1 methylation than SCC tissues (p < 0.0001).;These findings imply that esophageal BSCC and SCC retain different cellular phenotypes with distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations; thus, tailored therapeutic strategies should be developed against each cancer type.",

Our aim was to assess clinico-pathological and prognostic correlations of these PTC-specific gene alterations, with a particular emphasis on the BRAF mutation, in a group of 266 Serbian PTC patients, for the first time. The reference center-based retrospective cohort included 201 (75.6%) females and 65 (24.4%) males aged 48.0±16.1 years (8-83 years old, range) diagnosed and treated for PTC during 1993-2008. Follow-up period was 53.1±41.6 months (7-187 months, range). BRAF and RAS mutations were determined by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RET/PTC rearrangements were analyzed by RT-PCR/Southern blotting. Genetic alterations were detected in 150/266 tumors (56.4%). One tumor displayed two genetic alterations. The BRAF(V600E) was found in 84/266 (31.6%) cases, RAS mutations in 11/266 (4.1%) and RET/PTC in 55/266 (20.7%; 42/266 (15.8%) RET/PTC1 and 13/266 (4.9%) RET/PTC3). On multivariate analysis BRAF(V600E) was associated with the classical papillary morphology (P = 0.05), the higher pT category (P = 0.05) and advanced clinical stage (P = 0.03). In a proportional hazard model, BRAF(V600E) did not appear to be an independent risk factor for the faster recurrence (P = 0.784). We conclude that under the extensive thyroid surgery and limited application of radioiodine ablation BRAF(V600E) may not be an indicator of poorer disease-free survival during the short to middle follow-up period. However, it has a potential to contribute to patients stratification into high- and low-risk groups.",

These tumors are very sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), which causes loss of D-cyclin expression, hypophosphorylation of Rb, and G(1) arrest. Growth arrest is followed by differentiation or senescence and, in a subset of BRAF mutant tumors, by apoptosis. The former effects result in so-called \"stable disease\" and, in patients with cancer, can be difficult to distinguish from indolent tumor growth. The profound G(1) arrest induced by MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant tumors is associated with a marked decline in thymidine uptake and is therefore potentially detectable in vivo by noninvasive 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In SKMEL-28 tumor xenografts, MEK inhibition completely inhibited tumor growth and induced differentiation with only modest tumor regression. MEK inhibition also resulted in a rapid decline in the [(18)F]FLT signal in V600E BRAF mutant SKMEL-28 xenografts but not in BRAF wild-type BT-474 xenografts. The data suggest that [(18)F]FLT PET can effectively image induction of G(1) arrest by MEK inhibitors in mutant BRAF tumors and may be a useful noninvasive method for assessing the early biological response to this class of drugs.",

Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.",

When comparing the efficacy of detection methods, the results of real time PCR analysis revealed 56 of 97 (57.7%) CRC cases with KRAS mutations, whereas Sanger sequencing revealed 49 cases (50.5%).;KRAS mutations were found in 54.5% of advanced CRC patients.

Despite the utility of current genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of lung cancer, most do not allow temporal dissociation of the cardinal events involved in lung tumor initiation and cancer progression. Here we describe a novel two-switch GEM model for BRAF(V600E)-induced lung carcinogenesis allowing temporal dissociation of these processes. In mice carrying a Flp recombinase-activated allele of Braf (Braf(FA)) in conjunction with Cre-regulated alleles of Trp53, Cdkn2a, or c-MYC, we demonstrate that secondary genetic events can promote bypass of the senescence-like proliferative arrest displayed by BRAF(V600E)-induced lung adenomas, leading to malignant progression. Moreover, restoring or activating TP53 in cultured BRAF(V600E)/TP53(Null) or BRAF(V600E)/INK4A-ARF(Null) lung cancer cells triggered a G1 cell-cycle arrest regardless of p19(ARF) status. Perhaps surprisingly, neither senescence nor apoptosis was observed upon TP53 restoration. Our results establish a central function for the TP53 pathway in restricting lung cancer development, highlighting the mechanisms that limit malignant progression of BRAF(V600E)-initiated tumors.",

Our purpose has been to identify genetic alterations in members of these pathways in prostate cancer. A total of 102 prostate tumors, 79 from prostate cancer alone (group G1) and 23 from bladder and prostate cancer patients (G2), are the subject of this study. In 20 of these 23, the bladder tumors were also analyzed. PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF and AKT1 mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing, and BRAF also by pyrosequencing. PIK3CA quantitative mRNA expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) gains were tested in 25 and 32 prostate tumors from both groups (G1 and G2), respectively. Immunohistochemistry for pAKT was performed in 55 prostate tumors. Of 25 prostate tumors, 10 (40%) had PIK3CA mRNA overexpression that was statistically associated with Gleason score ≥ 7 (P=0.018). PIK3CA copy gain was detected in 9 of 32 (28%) prostate tumors. Of 20 bladder tumors, 3 (15%) displayed mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS and AKT1, the corresponding prostate tumors being wt. We also detected a previously not reported PIK3CA polymorphism (IVS9+91) in two prostate tumors. In all, 56% of prostate tumors overexpressed pAKT. There is a statistical association (P<0.0001) of strong pAKT immunostaining with high Gleason score, and with PIK3CA alterations (mRNA overexpression and/or FISH gains). PIK3CA gene is deregulated by mRNA overexpression and DNA gain in ∼ 40 and 28% of prostate tumors, respectively. High-grade prostate tumors are associated with PIK3CA mRNA overexpression, but not with FISH status. PIK3CA, BRAF, KRAS and AKT1 mutations are very infrequent events in prostate tumors. However, PI3K signaling pathway is activated by PIK3CA FISH gain and/or mRNA overexpression, leading to an increased pAKT protein expression.",

This inspires the effort to reverse this resistance or to uncover new vulnerabilities in such resistant cancers. IPA3 has been originally identified as a small molecule inhibitor of p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1), a candidate therapeutic target in human malignancies. We have tested a battery of melanoma and colon carcinoma cell lines that carry mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KRAS genes and have observed that those with NRAS and KRAS mutations are more sensitive to killing by IPA3. Genetic manipulations suggest that the differential response depends not just on these oncogenes, but also on additional events that were co-selected during tumor evolution. Furthermore, sublethal doses of IPA3 or ectopic expression of dominant-negative PAK1 sensitized Ras-mutated cells to GDC-0897 and AZD6244, which otherwise have reduced efficiency against cells with activated Ras. Dominant-negative PAK1 also reduced the growth of NRAS-mutated cells in confluent cultures, but, unlike IPA3, caused no significant toxicity. Although it remains to be proven that all the effects of IPA3 are exclusively due to inhibition of PAK1, our findings point to the existence of selective vulnerabilities, which are associated with Ras mutations and could be useful for better understanding and treatment of a large subset of tumors.",

Our previously described inhibitors with a tripartite A-B-C system (where A is a hinge binding pyrido[4,5-b]imidazolone system, B is an aryl spacer group, and C is a heteroaromatic group) were potent against purified (V600E)BRAF in vitro but were less potent in accompanying cellular assays. Substitution of different aromatic heterocycles for the phenyl based C-ring is evaluated herein as a potential means of improving the cellular potencies of these inhibitors. Substituted pyrazoles, particularly 3-tert-butyl-1-aryl-1H-pyrazoles, increase the cellular potencies without detrimental effects on the potency on isolated (V600E)BRAF. Thus, compounds have been synthesized that inhibit, with low nanomolar concentrations, (V600E)BRAF, its downstream signaling in cells [as measured by the reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)], and the proliferation of mutant BRAF-dependent cells.

Methylation of RASSF1A was present in 16 of 31 (52%) sporadic MSI colorectal and 11 of 25 (44%) MSI gastric carcinomas, and in six of 20 (30%) HNPCC carcinomas. Nearly 36% of MSI sporadic colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) had RASSF1A methylation and activating mutations at KRAS and/or BRAF. In contrast, only 10 and 8% of HNPCC and sporadic gastric carcinomas, respectively, had concomitant KRAS mutations and RASSF1A methylation. The MSI sporadic gastric and CRCs with RASSF1A methylation were preferentially poorly differentiated (P=0.03, 0.05, respectively). We show that the profile of alterations RASSF1A, KRAS/BRAF is different among the three groups of MSI gastrointestinal tumours. Further, we demonstrate that MSI sporadic CRCs accumulated significantly more epigenetic/genetic alterations in RASSF1A, KRAS/BRAF than MSI sporadic gastric or HNPCC carcinomas (P=0.016). These results are likely to have therapeutic implications in the near future, due to the possibilities of using specific kinase inhibitors alone or in association with demethylating agents in MSI tumour types harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations and RASSF1A methylation.",

Recently, clinical trials with targeted therapies have advanced the outlook of these patients, and inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis has led to the approval of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for first-line treatment of radioiodine refractory disease. In addition to approved therapies (sorafenib and lenvatinib), other multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are commercially available have been recognized as viable treatment options for RAI-R DTC. Our preference is to initially use lenvatinib, given the dramatic progression-free survival (PFS) improvement versus placebo, with the caveat that 24 mg daily is not often tolerated and lower doses often used. In patients with BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF inhibitors are now considered for treatment, especially if patients are at high risk from antiangiogenic therapy. Research is continuing to evolve in identifying mechanisms related to radioiodine refractoriness, and trials are evaluating therapeutic molecules to overcome this resistance. Clinical care of patients with RAI-R DTC requires careful consideration of both patient and disease characteristics. Many patients with asymptomatic and indolent disease can be followed for years without treatment while others with high volume or rapidly progressive disease merit early intervention.",

Both mutations are able to activate the MEK/ERK signaling transduction pathway and result in the activation of transcription factors that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY 43-9006) is a multikinase inhibitor, and in this study, we tested its effects on PTC cells carrying either mutation.;The effects of sorafenib on cell proliferation and signaling were evaluated in vitro on PTC cells using growth curves, cell cycle analysis, and immunoblotting. Using an orthotopic mouse model, we determined the antitumor effects of sorafenib in vivo.;The concentration needed for 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) by sorafenib was 0.14 mumol/L for the PTC cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, and 2.5 mumol/L for PTC cells with a BRAF mutation, both readily achievable serum concentrations. After 3 weeks of oral administration of sorafenib (80 mg/kg/d) in mice, small (94% reduction compared with controls) or no tumor growth was detected in mice inoculated with PTC cells bearing the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, whereas the tumor volume of the orthotopic tumor implants of PTC cells with a BRAF mutation was reduced 53% to 54% (as compared with controls).;PTC cells carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement were more sensitive to sorafenib than PTC cells carrying a BRAF mutation. Because RET/PTC rearrangements are unique to thyroid carcinomas, our findings support the clinical evaluation of sorafenib for patients with PTC and the identification of patients most likely to respond to sorafenib treatment.",

We further demonstrate dose-dependent effects of oncogenic signaling, with physiologic Braf(V600E) expression being sufficient for hyperplasia induction, but later stage intensified Mapk-signaling driving both tumor progression and activation of intrinsic tumor suppression. Such phenomena explain, for example, the inability of p53 to restrain tumor initiation as well as its importance in invasiveness control, and the late stage specificity of its somatic mutation.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) obtained non-invasively from peripheral blood could serve as a tumor proxy. Using a label-free CTC enrichment strategy that we have established, we aimed to develop sensitive assays for qualitative assessment of tumor genotype in patients. Blood consecutively obtained from 44 patients with local and advanced colorectal cancer and 18 healthy donors were enriched for CTCs using a size-based microsieve technology. To screen for CTC mutations, we established high-resolution melt (HRM) and allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) KRAS-codon 12/13- and BRAF-codon 600- specific assays, and compared the performance with pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. For each patient, the resulting CTC genotypes were compared with matched tumor and normal tissues. Both HRM and ASPCR could detect as low as 1.25% KRAS- or BRAF-mutant alleles. HRM detected 14/44 (31.8%) patients with KRAS mutation in CTCs and 5/44 (11.3%) patients having BRAF mutation in CTCs. ASPCR detected KRAS and BRAF mutations in CTCs of 10/44 (22.7%) and 1/44 (2.3%) patients respectively. There was an increased detection of mutation in blood using these two methods. Comparing tumor tissues and CTCs mutation status using HRM, we observed 84.1% concordance in KRAS genotype (p = 0.000129, Fishers' exact test; OR = 38.7, 95% CI = 4.05-369) and 90.9% (p = 0.174) concordance in BRAF genotype.

Furthermore, the two common genetic alterations characteristic for PTC, the V600E mutation of the BRAF gene and RET/PTC 1 and 3 rearrangements, were determined in all HTTs. All miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in PTCs, whereas all miRNAs in HTT, normal thyroid tissue, adenomas, and MNGs were down-regulated. Calculating relative changes in gene expression, a 510-fold change of miRNA 146b between PTC and HTT could be observed followed by fold changes between 6.4 and 29 in the remaining miRNAs (P < 0.001). All HTTs lacked BRAF mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements.;Our findings do not support the concept that a high proportion of HTT represents a variant of PTC. It is suggested that HTTs lacking both a miRNA expression pattern characteristic for PTC and RET/PTC rearrangements are re-designated as 'hyalinizing trabecular adenomas'.",

Patients failing vemurafenib are often given ipilimumab, an immunomodulator, at $150,000 per course. Assessment of cost-effectiveness is a valuable tool to help navigate the transition toward targeted cancer therapy.;We performed a cost-utility analysis to compare three strategies for patients with BRAF+ metastatic melanoma using a deterministic expected-value decision tree model to calculate the present value of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy. We performed sensitivity analyses on all variables.;In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vemurafenib compared with dacarbazine was $353,993 per QALY gained (0.42 QALYs added, $156,831 added). The ICER for vemurafenib followed by ipilimumab compared with vemurafenib alone was $158,139. In sensitivity analysis, treatment cost had the largest influence on results: the ICER for vemurafenib versus dacarbazine dropped to $100,000 per QALY gained with a treatment cost of $3600 per month.;The cost per QALY gained for treatment of BRAF+ metastatic melanoma with vemurafenib alone or in combination exceeds widely-cited thresholds for cost-effectiveness.

The mechanism underlying the intrinsic resistance to MEKi in KRas-mutant cells is under intensive investigation. Here, we pursued this mechanism by live imaging of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activities in oncogenic KRas or BRaf-mutant cancer cells. We established eight cancer cell lines expressing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors for ERK activity and S6K activity, which was used as a surrogate marker for mTORC1 activity. Under increasing concentrations of MEKi, ERK activity correlated linearly with the cell growth rate in BRaf-mutant cancer cells, but not KRas-mutant cancer cells. The administration of PI3K inhibitors resulted in a linear correlation between ERK activity and cell growth rate in KRas-mutant cancer cells. Intriguingly, mTORC1 activity was correlated linearly with the cell growth rate in both BRaf-mutant cancer cells and KRas-mutant cancer cells. These observations suggested that mTORC1 activity had a pivotal role in cell growth and that the mTORC1 activity was maintained primarily by the ERK pathway in BRaf-mutant cancer cells and by both the ERK and PI3K pathways in KRas-mutant cancer cells. FRET imaging revealed that MEKi inhibited mTORC1 activity with slow kinetics, implying transcriptional control of mTORC1 activity by ERK. In agreement with this observation, MEKi induced the expression of negative regulators of mTORC1, including TSC1, TSC2 and Deptor, which occurred more significantly in BRaf-mutant cells than in KRas-mutant cells. These findings suggested that the suppression of mTORC1 activity and induction of negative regulators of mTORC1 in cancer cells treated for at least 1 day could be used as surrogate markers for the MEKi sensitivity of cancer cells.

This study investigated the spectrum and frequency of mutations in BRAF and KRAS2 in endometrial carcinomas on the basis of mismatch repair status.;Four hundred forty-one patients with endometrial cancer were staged properly and graded and evaluated for mismatch repair status. These patients were then stratified to groups by the degree of microsatellite instability that was observed in their tumors. One hundred forty-six of the selected tumors were then evaluated for KRAS2 and BRAF mutations on the basis of their microsatellite instability.;One hundred forty-six endometrioid endometrial cancers were evaluated for KRAS2 and BRAF mutations. Thirty-five cancers (24%) had activating KRAS2 mutations, but only a single BRAF mutation was identified in an microsatellite instability-positive cancer. Twenty-four of 81 microsatellite instability high cancers (29.6%) in which the MLH1 repair gene was methylated had KRAS2 mutations. When compared with the other groups, this finding approached statistical significance (P=.06). KRAS2 mutation status was associated with increasing age at diagnosis (P=.02).;Despite many similarities between colon and endometrial cancers, the mechanism of the development of endometrial cancers appears to be different from colon cancers in that BRAF is not affected by a mismatch repair problem, because only KRAS2 mutations were seen.

Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

Seventeen alterations of BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PAX8, and RET genes were evaluated using a single validated technology platform. Following verification of analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and precision in model and surgical specimens, 152 molecular positive results were generated in lesions representing multiple stages of progression and epithelial differentiation as well as rare subtypes of primary, secondary, or recurring tumors. Single mutations were found in 58% of primary malignant lesions and 12% of benign (P < .001). In the blinded validation set, mutation distribution and frequency were distinct across variants of follicular and papillary carcinomas. BRAF or RET-PTC was detected exclusively in malignant lesions but not in follicular carcinomas (P < .001).

These data substantiate the diagnostic utility of molecular testing for oncogenic mutations and validate its performance in a variety of surgical specimens.

Alterations in KRAS, BRAF, or mismatch repair (MMR) genes may determine therapeutic response or define a hereditary cancer syndrome. Correlation of DNA studies with clinical findings will further clarify the clinical utility of these markers.;A retrospective study was performed on 111 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens submitted for microsatellite instability (MSI) testing based on clinical history or histologic examination, or both. DNA samples were screened for 7 KRAS mutations and the BRAF p.V600E mutation using fluorescent allele-specific polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis. Clinical data were collected through chart review.;Fifty-eight male and 53 female patients were studied. The incidence of KRAS and BRAF mutations was 49.5% and 7.2%, respectively. Dideoxy sequencing verified KRAS mutation status in 46 of 49 specimens tested. There was a trend toward significance of individual KRAS mutations on survival (P = .003). Dually positive KRAS and MSI tumors exclusively demonstrated p.G12D and p.G13D mutations (G>A transitions). BRAF-mutated tumors were predominantly right-sided and associated with a borderline worse prognosis. Forty-eight percent of tumors with MSI were present in the left colon or rectum.;Allele-specific PCR is an accurate and convenient method to assess KRAS and BRAF mutations and may detect mutations not identified by dideoxy sequencing. KRAS mutation status, in conjunction with morphologic or clinical parameters, may be useful in determining whether a tumor should be tested for MSI. MSI testing should not be considered exclusively in right-sided lesions. BRAF analysis may not be useful in rectal adenocarcinomas and should be evaluated in larger studies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is variable because of intra-tumor heterogeneity at the genetic level, and consequently, it is important to develop sensitive and selective assays to predict patient responses to therapy. Low-abundance BRAF V600E mutations are associated with poor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors. We developed a method for the detection of BRAF V600E mutations in mCRC using real-time wild-type blocking PCR (WTB-PCR), in which a chimera composed of locked nucleic acids and DNA is incorporated to amplify the mutant allele at high efficiency while simultaneously inhibiting the amplification of wild-type alleles. Mixing experiments showed that this method is exquisitely sensitive, with detection of the mutated allele at a mutant/wild-type ratio of 1:10,000. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach for mCRC patients, we assessed the V600E mutations in 50 clinical cases of mCRC by real-time WTB-PCR. The percentage of patients with V600E mutation as determined by WTB-PCR (16%, 8/50) was higher than by traditional PCR (10%, 5/50), suggesting an increased sensitivity for WTB-PCR. By calculating the ΔC q for real-time traditional PCR, which amplifies all BRAF alleles, versus WTB-PCR, which selectively amplifies mutant BRAF, we demonstrated that among the V600E-positive mCRC patient samples, the percentage of BRAF DNA with the V600E mutation ranged from 0.05 to 52.32%. In conclusion, WTB-PCR provides a rapid, simple, and low-cost method to detect trace amounts of mutated BRAF V600E gene.",

Patients were divided into three groups according to the time of tumor diagnosis in respect of pregnancy. Group 1, diagnosis of DTC at least 2 years after delivery; group 2, diagnosis during pregnancy or within the second year after delivery; and group 3, nulliparous patients at the time of diagnosis.

We also analyzed the gene expression of NIS (SLC5A5) and the prevalence of BRAF(V600E) mutations.;Persistence/recurrence of disease was significantly higher in group 2 patients than control groups (P=0.023). No significant differences were observed in other clinical parameters. Furthermore, no differences among the groups were recorded about ER pattern, NIS expression, and BRAF mutations.;Persistence/recurrence of DTC is significantly higher in pregnant patients, suggesting that pregnancy could really exert a negative prognostic role in patients with DTC.

Cytology and molecular analysis, including BRAF V600E, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, were conducted simultaneously.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

As such, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer, including melanomas, which frequently harbour activating mutations in the NRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations, we show that ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome formation, as well as the translation of growth-related messenger RNAs containing a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth in mice. Our findings indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of tumours characterized by deregulated MAPK signalling, such as melanoma.",

Since limited data are available on different histological types of colorectal polyps, we compared the pattern and the frequency of promoter methylation, CIMP-H, MSI, KRAS and BRAF V600E mutations and the relationship among these molecular parameters and the clinicopathologic characteristics in 110 serrated polyps (48 hyperplastic polyps, 32 sessile serrated adenomas and 30 serrated adenomas) and 32 tubular adenomas using 7 commonly used tumor-associated gene loci. No significant difference in the frequency of overall methylation frequency (86% vs. 100%) and CIMP-H (39% vs. 28%) between serrated polyps and tubular adenomas was observed, but proximally located serrated polyps showed more frequent methylation at 5 of 7 loci examined, and were more likely to be CIMP-H (62% vs. 22%). MGMT methylation was more common in tubular adenomas while MLH1 and HIC1 were more frequently methylated in serrated polyps. BRAF mutation was frequently present in all types of serrated polyps (80%), but was absent in tubular adenomas and was not associated with CIMP or MSI status. These results show comparable frequencies of promoter methylation of tumor-associated genes and CIMP-H, but distinct differences in gene-specific or colonic site-specific methylation profiles occur in serrated polyps and tubular adenomas. BRAF mutation occurs independently of CIMP and MSI in all types of serrated polyps and may serve as a marker of serrated pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis.",

Thus, here we report the identification of somatic mutations for Chinese PTC using 402 tumor-normal pairs (Discovery: 91 pairs via exome sequencing; validation: 311 pairs via Sanger sequencing). We observed three distinct mutational signatures, evidently different from the two mutational signatures among Caucasian PTCs. Ten significantly mutated genes were identified, most previously uncharacterized. Notably, we found that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GAS8-AS1 is the secondary most frequently altered gene and acts as a novel tumor suppressor in PTC. As a mutation hotspot, the c.713A>G/714T>C dinucleotide substitution was found among 89.1% patients with GAS8-AS1 mutations and associated with advanced PTC disease (P = 0.009). Interestingly, the wild-type lncRNA GAS8-AS1 (A713T714) showed consistently higher capability to inhibit cancer cell growth compared to the mutated lncRNA (G713C714). Further studies also elucidated the oncogene nature of the G protein-coupled receptor LPAR4 and its c.872T>G (p.Ile291Ser) mutation in PTC malignant transformation. The BRAF c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu) substitution was present in 59.0% Chinese PTCs, more frequently observed in patients with lymph node metastasis (P = 1.6 × 10(-4)). Together our study defines a exome mutational spectrum of PTC in the Chinese population and highlights lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and LPAR4 as potential diagnostics and therapeutic targets. ",

To characterize the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions. Supporting its classification as a \"driver\" mutation in the cells in which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase domain mutations in EGFR.",

The associations between clinicopathological characteristics, including disease recurrence at follow-up (median 5.1 yr) and the percentage of mutant BRAF alleles were assessed.;The observed prevalence of BRAF(V600E) was higher when using pyrosequencing then when using BigDye Terminator sequencing (53.6 vs. 36.9%). In the PTC positive for BRAF(V600E), the percentage of mutant alleles ranged from 5.1 to 44.7% of the total BRAF alleles, with a median of 20.6%. The presence or the percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles did not correlate significantly with sex, multicentricity, lymph node metastasis, or tumor stage. The percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles directly correlated with age at diagnosis and tumor volume (R(2) = 0.223, P = 0.039, and R(2) = 0.166, P < 0.001, respectively).

Initially described in melanoma, colon and papillary thyroid carcinoma, these alterations have also been observed in primary nervous system tumors albeit at a low frequency. We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF (V600E) mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (p = 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33%). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF (V600E) mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities.

KRAS gene mutations were analyzed successfully from small biopsy or cytology specimens. Although some surgical specimens could not be evaluated by cycleave PCR, corresponding biopsy specimens could be used instead. This PCR failure observed for some biopsy specimens may have been a result of the use of formalin fixation, as overfixation of surgical specimens by formalin impaired PCR amplification.

The frequency of p53 mutations increased from 15% for stage A to 48% for stage D and was highest in near-diploid (DI < 1.4 and DI does not equal 1) and high-aneuploid (DI > 1.6) tumors. A similar correlation between gene mutations and DI values was observed for KRAS. The simultaneous presence of KRAS and p53 mutations was observed in only 11% of cases. Moreover, the co-occurrence of p53 and KRAS mutations was only observed in near-diploid and high-aneuploid tumors.;Our findings suggest that KRAS and p53 gene mutations, which are rarely simultaneous and are associated with specific DI aneuploid values, do not represent a synergistic evolutionary pathway but may influence mechanisms of chromosomal instability.",

Additionally, it has been shown that BRAF mutations in colorectal cancers are mutually exclusive of KRAS mutation. We evaluated 14 cases of colorectal cancer with MSI that were BRAF wild type but demonstrated a KRAS mutation. The codon 12/13 region in exon 2 of the KRAS oncogene and the codon 600 region in exon 15 of the BRAF gene were analyzed with standard PCR methods. MSI was evaluated by using the Bethesda panel of markers. The methylation status of the mismatch repair system was ascertained using the SALSA(®) MS-MLPA(®) methylation-specific DNA detection. The mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. A total of 530 colorectal cancers were studied for MSI and KRAS gene mutation. Fourteen (2.6%) cancers with both MSI and a KRAS mutation were identified, and all cancers were BRAF wild type. Methylation was present in 7 (50%), 5 demonstrated methylation of MLH1, 1 showed methylation of MGMT, and 1 showed methylation of MSH2. Four patients had simultaneous cancers, some of which showed different genetic changes. Immunohistochemical staining suggested a germ line mutation for 4 of 10 cases with complete staining information. KRAS mutation may occur with MSI in colorectal cancers with wild-type BRAF. If a mutation in KRAS co-exists with MSI, then strong methylation of the MLH1 gene is unlikely. These tumors demonstrate that a small number of colorectal cancers will develop with atypical patterns of molecular genetic changes, suggesting that a specific pattern of genetic changes may not be as crucial as the overall accumulation of changes, consistent with the 'unique tumor principle'.",

Genomic DNA was isolated from tissue sections and screened for mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes by automated DNA sequencing.;Overall, KRAS tumour mutation rate was 30% (145/478 positive cases). Distribution of mutation carriers was surprisingly different within the island: 87/204 (43%) in North Sardinia vs. 58/274 (21%) in Middle-South Sardinia (p<0.001). Among 384 CRC cases whose DNA was available, only one (0.3%) patient carried a mutation in BRAF gene; PIK3CA was found mutated in 67 (17%) patients. A significant inverse distribution of PIK3CA mutation rates was observed within Sardinian population: 19/183 (10%) cases from northern vs. 48/201 (24%) cases from central-southern island (p<0.001). This heterogeneity in frequencies of KRAS/PIK3CA somatic mutations is consistent with already-reported discrepancies in distribution of germline mutations for other malignancies within Sardinian population. Preliminary clinical evaluation of 118 KRAS wild-type patients undergoing anti-EGFR-based treatment indicated lack of role for PIK3CA in predicting response to therapy.;Our findings support the hypothesis that differences in patients' origins and related genetic backgrounds may contribute to even determine the incidence rate of somatic mutations in candidate cancer genes.",

One such strategy is to extend the paradigm of individually tailored, molecularly targeted therapy into a broader spectrum of melanoma patients, particularly those bearing tumors without commonly recognized therapeutic targets, as well as having failed or were ineligible for immunotherapy. In this nontreatment pilot study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were utilized, including whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing, to identify molecular aberrations in patients with non-V600 BRAF metastatic melanoma. This information was then rationally matched to an appropriate clinical treatment from a defined pharmacopeia. Five patients with advanced non-V600 BRAF metastatic melanoma were enrolled.

In support of pediatric cancer development, a nonclinical juvenile rat toxicity study was conducted in which females had early vaginal opening (VO). It was hypothesized that the early VO was not indicative of sexual maturation, but a result of a local effect on the vagina. An investigative study was conducted that mimicked the definitive study design, with rats given DAB or vehicle orally from Postnatal Day (PND) 7 to 35 and with necropsy subsets just before VO, at the first and second estrus, along with age-matched controls. Histopathology was performed on reproductive tissues, including immunohistochemistry for BRAF expression. VO occurred earlier in DAB females than in controls (PND 27.2 vs. 31.5); however, the timing of the first estrus was unaffected (PND 34.0 vs. 33.0). DAB-treated females evaluated just before VO (PND 22.0) had mostly immature reproductive tracts with no evidence of ovulation, similar to age-matched controls; however, DAB-treated females had keratinized and histologically open vaginas. Also, there was raised skin around the urogenital area, which correlated with hyperplasia/keratosis of the vulvar skin and keratinization of the distal vagina. BRAF expression (evaluated in controls) was localized to these tissues. Thus, early VO in rats given DAB likely represents a local effect accelerating vaginal keratinization to become open and not accelerated sexual maturation. ",

We found that loss of PTEN combined with Braf activation resulted in higher viability in narrow microchannels. In addition, Braf conferred increased resistance to the microtubule-stabilizing drug Taxol in narrow confinement. Similarly, survival of D54-EGFRvIII cells was unaffected following treatment with Taxol, whereas the viability of D54 cells was reduced by 75% under these conditions. Taken together, our data suggests key targets for anticancer drugs based on cellular genotypes and their specific survival phenotypes during confined migration. ",

Their role has previously been described in colorectal cancer, as well as in gastric, breast, thyroid, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, glioma, liver, leukemia and many other cancers. In a previous study, we have described protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, M, Z1 and Q genes (PTPRT, PTPRM, PTPRZ1 and PTPRQ) hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer. Thus, in this study, we examined the relation of unbalanced chromosomal alterations within regions covering these four protein tyrosine phosphatase genes with this cancer. One hundred and two cancer tissues were molecularly characterized, including analysis of the BRAF and K-ras mutations and methylator phenotype. The analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed using Comparative Genomic Hybridization. We observed amplification of three regions containing genes coding for PTPs, such as PTPRZ1 (7q31.3, amplified in 23.5% of cases), PTPRQ (12q21.2, amplified in 5.9% of cases), PTPRT (20q12, amplified in 29.4% of cases), along with deletions in the region of PTPRM (18p11.2, deleted in 21.6% of cases). These data may suggest that in sporadic colorectal cancer PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRQ probably act as oncogenes, while PTPRM acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Our study also revealed that gains on chromosome 20q12 and losses on chromosome 18p11.2 are connected with the absence of the BRAF mutation and the conventional adenocarcinoma pathway. ",

This study investigated the impact of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA and TP53 status on outcome of elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients enrolled in TEGAFOX-E (cetuximab, oxaliplatin and oral uracil/ftorafur--UFT) phase II study. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and all were evaluable for safety and activity. Twenty-three specimens were analysed for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PI3KCA and TP53 mutational status by means of polymerase chain reaction and correlated with objective response, progression-free survival and overall survival. An evident increase of response rate was noted in KRAS/NRAS wild-type cases (70 versus 33%, P = 0.198). KRAS/NRAS wild-type status showed an independent association with a longer progression-free survival (44 versus 9 weeks, P = 0.009). Considering the combined assessment of BRAF, KRAS/NRAS and TP53, a trend towards an increase of response rate was noted in patients without mutations (83 versus 33%, P = 0.063). Moreover, patients with all wild-type genes had significantly longer progression-free survival than patients with any mutation (48 versus 10 weeks, P = 0.007).

Among them are RAS and BRAF mutations, which rarely coexist in the same tumour. Individual members of the Rho (Ras homology) GTPases contribute with distinct roles in tumour cell morphology, invasion and metastasis. The aim of this study is to dissect cell migration and invasion pathways that are utilised by BRAFV600E as compared to KRASG12V and HRASG12V oncoproteins. In particular, the role of RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A), Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) and Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42) in cancer progression induced by each of the three oncogenes is described.;Colon adenocarcinoma cells with endogenous as well as ectopically expressed or silenced oncogenic mutations of BRAFV600E, KRASG12V and HRASG12V were employed. Signalling pathways and Rho GTPases were inhibited with specific kinase inhibitors and siRNAs. Cell motility and invasion properties were correlated with cytoskeletal properties and Rho GTPase activities.;Evidence presented here indicate that BRAFV600E significantly induces cell migration and invasion properties in vitro in colon cancer cells, at least in part through activation of RhoA GTPase. The relationship established between BRAFV600E and RhoA activation is mediated by the MEK-ERK pathway. In parallel, KRASG12V enhances the ability of colon adenocarcinoma cells Caco-2 to migrate and invade through filopodia formation and PI3K-dependent Cdc42 activation. Ultimately increased cell migration and invasion, mediated by Rac1, along with the mesenchymal morphology obtained through the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) were the main characteristics rendered by HRASG12V in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, BRAF and KRAS oncogenes are shown to cooperate with the TGFβ-1 pathway to provide cells with additional transforming properties.;This study discriminates oncogene-specific cell migration and invasion pathways mediated by Rho GTPases in colon cancer cells and reveals potential new oncogene-specific characteristics for targeted therapeutics.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the signal transduction leading to Erk activation in PTC cells. In normal thyroid cells, CaMKII and Erk were in the inactive form in the absence of stimulation. In primary PTC cultures and in PTC cell lines harboring the oncogenes RET/PTC-1 or BRaf(V600E), CaMKII was active also in the absence of any stimulation. Inhibition of calmodulin or phospholipase C (PLC) attenuated the level of CaMKII activation. Expression of recombinant RET/PTC-3, BRaf(V600E), or Ras(V12) induced CaMKII activation. Inhibition of CaMKII attenuated Erk activation and DNA synthesis in thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC-1), a cell line harboring RET/PTC-1, suggesting that CaMKII is a component of the Erk signal cascade in this cell line. In conclusion, PTCs contain an active PLC/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signal inducing constitutive activation of CaMKII. This kinase is activated by BRaf(V600E), oncogenic Ras, and by RET/PTC. CaMKII participates to the activation of the Erk pathway by oncogenic Ras and RET/PTC and contributes to their signal output, thus modulating tumor cell proliferation.",

In human melanomas containing an activating BRAF mutation (BRAF-positive melanomas), IGFBP7 is epigenetically silenced, which seems to be a critical step in melanoma genesis. Restoration of IGFBP7 function by the addition of recombinant IGFBP7 (rIGFBP7) induces apoptosis in BRAF-positive human melanoma cell lines, and systemically administered rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses the growth of BRAF-positive primary tumors in xenografted mice. Here we further evaluate the role of IGFBP7 in the treatment of BRAF-positive melanoma and other malignancies. We find that in human metastatic melanoma samples IGFBP7 is epigenetically silenced and at an even higher frequency than that found in primary melanomas. Using a murine experimental metastasis assay, we show that systemic administration of rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses the growth of metastatic disease and prolongs survival. An analysis of the NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines reveals that in addition to melanoma, IGFBP7 induces apoptosis in several other cancer types, in particular colorectal cancer cell lines. In general, IGFBP7 induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines that have an activating mutation in BRAF or RAS, and that are sensitive to chemical inhibition of BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling. Significantly, systemically administered rIGFBP7 blocks the growth of colorectal tumors containing an activating RAS or BRAF mutation in mouse xenografts. The results presented here, in conjunction with those from previous studies, justify the further development of IGFBP7 as an anticancer agent.",

However, this therapy is poorly effective or ineffective in unselected patients. Mutations in KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes have recently emerged as the best predictive factors of low/absent response to EGFR-targeted therapy. Due to the need for efficacious treatment options for mCRC patients bearing these mutations, in this short report we examined the antitumoral activity of the protease inhibitor gabexate mesilate, alone and in combination with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, in a panel of human CRC cell lines harbouring a different expression pattern of wild-type/mutated KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes. Results obtained showed that gabexate mesilate significantly inhibited the growth, invasive potential and tumour-induced angiogenesis in all the CRC cells employed in this study (including those ones harbouring dual KRAS/PIK3CA or BRAF/PIK3CA mutation), while cetuximab affected these parameters only in CRC cells with KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA wild-type. Notably, the antitumoral efficacy of gabexate mesilate and cetuximab in combination was found to be not superior than that observed with gabexate mesilate as single agent. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that gabexate mesilate could represent a promising therapeutic option for mCRC patients, particularly for those harbouring KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, either as mono-therapy or in addition to standard chemotherapy regimens. Further studies to better elucidate gabexate mesilate mechanism of action in CRC cells are therefore warranted.",

PTC typically exhibits a diploid karyotype sometimes with inv10(q11.2q21.2), leading to rearranged RET gene. Follicular thyroid carcinomas are often aneuploid and may exhibit t(2;3)(q13;p25), resulting in PAX8-PPARgamma1 gene fusion. Isolated trisomy 17 has rarely been reported in thyroid lesions, and its significance is unknown.;Our objective was to determine whether isolated trisomy 17 corresponds to a specific histological or molecular thyroid tumor subset. Nine cases with isolated trisomy 17 were critically reviewed and investigated for RAS and BRAF mutations and for RET and PAX8-PPARgamma1 rearrangements.;All nine cases were noninvasive, exhibited follicular growth pattern, and showed PTC-NCs focally defined within the nodule: four were PTCs follicular variant within larger tumors, and five were follicular-patterned nodules with incomplete cytological features of papillary carcinoma (variable proportion of cells with PTC-NCs scattered inside the lesion). RAS, BRAF V600E mutation, RET or PAX8-PPARgamma1 rearrangements were not identified. One case had BRAF K601E mutation. Only two of the 53 control cases showed focal PTC-NCs.;Isolated trisomy 17 is associated with focal papillary carcinoma changes in follicular-patterned thyroid nodules and may be a marker for this subset of thyroid lesions that are often difficult to classify.",

Although indolent, MPC may be locally aggressive with recurrent disease. The pathogenesis and diagnostic biomarkers of MPC are poorly understood. We discovered that 15% of benign MPCs (thyroid, skin; 3 of 20 samples) harbored BRAF(WT/V600E); 33.3% (1 of 3 samples) of BRAF(WT/V600E)-MPCs were multifocal/infiltrative/recurrent. Patient-MPC and primary MPC cells harbored BRAF(WT/V600E), were clonal and expressed pericytic-differentiation biomarkers crucial for its microenvironment. BRAF(WT/V600E)-positive thyroid MPC primary cells triggered in vitro (8.8-fold increase) and in vivo (3.6-fold increase) angiogenesis. Anti-BRAF(V600E) therapy with vemurafenib disrupted angiogenic and metabolic properties (~3-fold decrease) with down-regulation (~2.2-fold decrease) of some extracellular-matrix (ECM) factors and ECM-associated long non-coding RNA (LincRNA) expression, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-pericytes. Vemurafenib also inhibited (~3-fold decrease) cell viability in vitro and in BRAF(WT/V600E)-positive thyroid MPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice (n = 5 mice per group). We established the first BRAF(WT/V600E)-dependent thyroid MPC cell culture. Our findings identify BRAF(WT/V600E) as a novel genetic aberration in MPC pathogenesis and MPC-associated biomarkers and imply that anti-BRAF(V600E) agents may be useful adjuvant therapy in BRAF(WT/V600E)-MPC patients. Patients with BRAF(WT/V600E)-MPC should be closely followed because of the risk for multifocality/recurrence. ",

We evaluated immunohistochemically the expression of the hypoxia marker hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) as well as extracellular matrix protein tenascin C as a marker of stroma remodelling in a cohort of 160 PTCs. Expression of HIF-1α was seen focally accentuated in 100 of the 160 tumours (62.5 %) including 16 cases with equivocal staining (faint staining or only single-cell staining) and 84 cases with unequivocal staining. HIF-1α expression correlated with the degree of desmoplastic stromal reaction as well as with the expression of tenascin C (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively). Moreover, expression of HIF-1α was significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) as well as signs of invasion, namely, peritumoural and extrathyroidal invasion as well as angioinvasion (p = 0.024, p < 0.001, p = 0.017, Mann-Whitney test, respectively). Additionally, PTC with unequivocal HIF-1α nuclear staining was a larger tumour than PTC with negative (-) or equivocal HIF-1α expression (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Interestingly, the expression of HIF-1α was not significantly associated with BRAF V600E status (p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test).

However, in xenograft assays, TKI258 equally delayed the growth of tumors induced by both cell lines. TUNEL assays showed that the apoptotic index was unchanged following TKI258 treatment, but staining for Ki-67 and CD31 was substantially reduced in both xenografts, implying an anti-angiogenic effect of the drug. TKI258 treatment was effective in delaying CRC tumor growth in vivo regardless of the KRAS and BRAF mutation status.;Our results identify FGFRs as potential targets in CRC treatment and suggest that combined targeting of multiple RTKs with TKI258 might serve as a novel approach to improve outcome of patients with CRC.",

Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321.;We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response.

We analysed genomic DNA from 127 malignant melanomas (77 patients) and 389 tumours from 141 colorectal cancer patients (383 liver metastases and 6 primary tumours) by Sanger sequencing and a single probe-based high-resolution melting assay (LightMix). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from a subset of these lesions (n = 77 and 304, respectively) was analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the V600E-specific antibody VE1. In a dilution series of V600E-mutated DNA in wild-type DNA, the detection limit for the LightMix assay was 1:1000 mutated alleles while it was 1:10 for Sanger sequencing. In line with this, we detected 15 additional mutated melanoma samples and two additional mutated metastatic colorectal cancer samples by the LightMix assay compared to Sanger sequencing. For the melanoma samples, we observed high concordance between DNA-based methods and analysis by IHC. However, in colorectal samples, IHC performed poorly with 12 samples being scored as V600E positive exclusively by IHC and nine samples being scored as V600E negative exclusively by IHC. In conclusion, the VE1 antibody is not recommendable for clinical tests of colorectal cancer samples. For melanoma samples, IHC may be useful as a screening tool guiding further analytical approaches.",

MLH1 promoter methylation is reportedly correlated with tumour BRAF V600E mutation status. No systematic review has been undertaken to assess the value of BRAF V600E mutation and MLH1 promoter methylation tumour markers as negative predictors of germline MMR mutation status. A literature review of CRC cohorts tested for MMR mutations, and tumour BRAF V600E mutation and/or MLH1 promoter methylation was conducted using PubMed. Studies were assessed for tumour features, stratified by tumour MMR status based on immunohistochemistry or MSI where possible. Pooled frequencies and 95% CIs were calculated using a random effects model. BRAF V600E results for 4562 tumours from 35 studies, and MLH1 promoter methylation results for 2975 tumours from 43 studies, were assessed. In 550 MMR mutation carriers, the BRAF V600E mutation frequency was 1.40% (95% CI 0.06% to 3%). In MMR mutation-negative cases, the BRAF V600E mutation frequency was 5.00% (95% CI 4% to 7%) in 1623 microsatellite stable (MSS) cases and 63.50% (95% CI 47% to 79%) in 332 cases demonstrating MLH1 methylation or MLH1 expression loss. MLH1 promoter methylation of the 'A region' was reported more frequently than the 'C region' in MSS CRCs (17% vs 0.06%, p<0.0001) and in MLH1 mutation carriers (42% vs 6%, p<0.0001), but not in MMR mutation-negative MSI-H CRCs (40% vs 47%, p=0.12). Methylation of the 'C region' was a predictor of MMR mutation-negative status in MSI-H CRC cases (47% vs 6% in MLH1 mutation carriers, p<0.0001). This review demonstrates that tumour BRAF V600E mutation, and MLH1 promoter 'C region' methylation specifically, are strong predictors of negative MMR mutation status. It is important to incorporate these features in multifactorial models aimed at predicting MMR mutation status.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Most anti-angiogenic therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials targetvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway; however, the tumor vasculature can acquire resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy by shifting to other angiogenesis mechanisms. Therefore, other potential therapeutic agents that block non-VEGF angiogenic pathways need to be evaluated. Here we identified BRAF kinase inhibitor, vemurafenibas an agent with potential anti-angiogenic and anti-breast cancer activities. Vemurafenib demonstrated inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). In ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis assays, vemurafenib suppressed bFGF-induced microvessel sprouting of rat aortic rings and angiogenesis in vivo. To understand the underlying molecular basis, we examined the effects of vemurafenib on different molecular components in treated endothelial cell, and found that vemurafenib suppressed bFGF-triggered activation of FGFR2 and protein kinase B (AKT). Moreover, vemurafenib directly inhibited proliferation and blocked the oncogenic signaling pathways in breast cancer cell. In vivo, using xenograft models of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, vemurafenib showed growth-inhibitory activity associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Taken together, our results indicate that vemurafenib targets the FGFR2-mediated AKT signaling pathway in endothelial cells, leading to the suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis. ",

Indeed, about 40% of PTCs harbor mutations in BRAF gene, whereas RET rearrangements (RET/PTC oncogenes) are present in about 20% of cases. Finally, RAS mutations and TRK rearrangements account for about 5% each of these malignancies. We used RNA-Sequencing to identify fusion transcripts and mutations in cancer driver genes in a cohort of 18 PTC patients. Furthermore, we used targeted DNA sequencing to validate identified mutations. We extended the screening to 50 PTC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using this approach we identified new missense mutations in CBL, NOTCH1, PIK3R4 and SMARCA4 genes. We found somatic mutations in DICER1, MET and VHL genes, previously found mutated in other tumors, but not described in PTC. We identified a new chimeric transcript generated by the fusion of WNK1 and B4GALNT3 genes, correlated with B4GALNT3 overexpression. Our data confirmed PTC genetic heterogeneity, revealing that gene expression correlates more with the mutation pattern than with tumor staging. Overall, this study provides new data about mutational landscape of this neoplasia, suggesting potential pharmacological adjuvant therapies against Notch signaling and chromatin remodeling enzymes.

CIMP is associated with microsatellite instability but is also found in BRAF mutant microsatellite stable cancers that are associated with poor prognosis. The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene causes CIMP in glioma due to an activating mutation that produces the 2-hydroxyglutarate oncometabolite. We therefore examined IDH1 alteration as a potential cause of CIMP in colorectal cancer. The IDH1 mutational hotspot was screened in 86 CIMP-positive and 80 CIMP-negative cancers. The entire coding sequence was examined in 81 CIMP-positive colorectal cancers. Forty-seven cancers varying by CIMP-status and IDH1 mutation status were examined using Illumina 450K DNA methylation microarrays. The R132C IDH1 mutation was detected in 4/166 cancers. All IDH1 mutations were in CIMP cancers that were BRAF mutant and microsatellite stable (4/45, 8.9%). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified an IDH1 mutation-like methylation signature in approximately half of the CIMP-positive cancers. IDH1 mutation appears to cause CIMP in a small proportion of BRAF mutant, microsatellite stable colorectal cancers. This study provides a precedent that a single gene mutation may cause CIMP in colorectal cancer, and that this will be associated with a specific epigenetic signature and clinicopathological features.

Among these surgical patients, 425 (19.2%) had bilateral PTCs, and 1786 had unilateral PTCs. The patients who had unilateral PTCs were subdivided into a group with unilateral-multifocal PTCs (210 patients) and a group with solitary PTCs (1576 patients). The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were calculated to compare the prognosis between groups. B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation status was examined by direct DNA sequencing.;Patients who had bilateral PTCs were likely to have larger tumors, higher rates of extrathyroid extension and lymph node metastasis, and more advanced tumor stage than those who had unilateral-multifocal PTCs. Multivariate analysis identified only lymph node metastasis as an independent risk factor for PTC recurrence (P < .001). The 10-year DFS rate for patients with bilateral PTCs was much lower than that for those with unilateral-multifocal and solitary PTCs (78.8% vs 85.7% and 89.3%, respectively; P = .005). It is noteworthy that patients who had bilateral PTCs with lymph node metastasis had the worst prognosis in terms of DFS. Incidence of the BRAF V600E mutation (valine to glutamic acid mutation at position 600) was higher in the bilateral PTC group than that in the unilateral and unilateral-multifocal PTC groups.;The current results provide initial evidence that bilateral PTCs are more aggressive than unilateral-multifocal PTCs, and patients who have bilateral disease have more advanced stage and shorter DFS. The poorer outcome of patients with bilateral PTCs may be caused in part by their high incidence of lymph node metastasis. Cancer 2016;122:198-206. © 2015 American Cancer Society.",

However, it has been shown that activating BRAF mutations are almost never found in tumors from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer patients. To evaluate the role of oncogenic BRAF mutations in non-hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer/non-familial adenomatous polyposis familial colorectal cancer, we did a mutation screening of the most common BRAF mutation, the V600E mutation, in 194 colorectal tumors from patients with a positive family history of the disease. The BRAF-V600E mutation was identified in 100% (8 of 8) of microsatellite-unstable tumors and in 9.7% (18 of 186) of microsatellite-stable tumors. Interestingly, families with extracolonic tumors showed a much higher mutation frequency (17.5%) compared with families with colonic cancer only (3.5%; P = 0.009). In addition, we studied colonoscopic results from 448 family members who had been under colonoscopic surveillance for several years. Subjects from families where the V600E mutation was identified had less adenomas compared with those from families where no BRAF mutation had been found (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-64.6). These findings indicate that adenomas might be less important in the cancer development in the group of families with BRAF-V600E mutations and indirectly support a previous hypothesis that tumors might develop through the hyperplastic polyp-serrated adenoma pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that BRAF-V600E mutations are mainly involved in colorectal cancer families characterized by an increased risk of other common malignancies.",

Activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene are present in >70% of melanomas, 90% of which produce active mutant BRAF(V600E) protein. To define the impacts of oncogenic BRAF on the melanocyte transcriptome, massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on genetically matched normal human melanocytes with and without BRAF(V600E) expression. To enhance potential disease relevance by verifying expression of altered genes in BRAF-driven cancer tissue, parallel RNA-seq was also undertaken of two BRAF(V600E)-mutant human melanomas. BRAF(V600E) regulated expression of 1027 protein-coding transcripts and 39 annotated lncRNAs, as well as 70 unannotated, potentially novel, intergenic transcripts. These transcripts display both tissue-specific and multi-tissue expression profiles and harbor distinctive regulatory chromatin marks and transcription factor binding sites indicative of active transcription. Coding potential analysis of the 70 unannotated transcripts suggested that most may represent newly identified lncRNAs. BRAF-regulated lncRNA 1 (BANCR) was identified as a recurrently overexpressed, previously unannotated 693-bp transcript on chromosome 9 with a potential functional role in melanoma cell migration. BANCR knockdown reduced melanoma cell migration, and this could be rescued by the chemokine CXCL11.

He underwent thyroidectomy and debulking of metastatic disease. The resected thyroid showed bilateral MTC and a 1-cm PTC. His lymph node metastases were predominantly MTC along with a small focus of metastatic PTC. Molecular testing using peripheral blood revealed a germline RET point mutation (Val804Met). Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1.

Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels.

Primary tumour tissues of 41 KRAS wild-type mCRC patients receiving cetuximab-based chemotherapy were investigated for PI3K, PTEN, KRAS and BRAF mutations. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) periods were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model was used. PTEN and PI3K expressions were 63 and 42 %, respectively. BRAF mutation was observed as 9.8 % among patients. Tumours with BRAF mutation had statistically lower response rates (RR) for cetuximab-based treatment than tumours with BRAF wild type (0 vs. 58 %, p = 0.02). PTEN expressing tumours had statistically higher RR for cetuximab-based treatment than tumours with PTEN loss (42 vs. 12 %, p = 0.04). PI3K expression had worse significant effect on cetuximab RR than PI3K non-expressed tumours (15 vs. 44 %, p = 0.023). Median PFS was significantly longer in patients with PTEN expression (14 months) than in patients with PTEN loss (5 months) (HR, 0.4; p = 0.028). Median PFS was significantly longer in patients with PI3K non-expression (15.2 months) than in patients with PI3K expression (4.1 months) (HR, 0.31; p = 0.001). Significant difference in PFS and OS between patients with BRAF mutated and BRAF wild-type tumours was not detected. However, patients with PTEN expression had significantly longer OS (15.1 months) than patients with PTEN loss tumour (9.9 months) (HR, 0.34; p = 0.008). Patients without PI3K expression had significantly longer OS (18.2 months) than patients with PI3K expression (10.1 months) (HR, 0.27; p = 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that PTEN expression (HR, 0.48; p = 0.02) and absence of PI3K expression (HR, 0.2; p = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for increased PFS. Similarly, PTEN overexpression (HR, 0.62; p = 0.03) and absence of PI3K expression (HR, 0.27; p = 0.005) were independent prognostic factors for increased OS. In PTEN loss, PI3K expression may be used as biomarkers to further select KRAS wild-type patients undergoing anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment.",

Recent advances in targeted therapeutics have provided ATC patients with previously unavailable treatment options, which may improve clinical outcomes in the coming years.

All patients underwent next-generation sequencing using an institutional tissue-based DNA platform (50 genes) and a commercially available cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) platform (70 genes).;Sequencing data were successfully obtained for both platforms on all patients. The most commonly mutated genes noted on both platforms were TP53 (15/23; 65%) and BRAF (11/23; 48%). Concordance between the tumor and cfDNA data was high for BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, and PTEN and moderate for TP53. Concordance was highest in patients who underwent dual-platform sequencing prior to initiation of definitive treatment, and lowest in patients who underwent cfDNA analysis following treatment. Nineteen patients had treatment at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center following cfDNA sequencing. One patient was observed, and three patients opted for hospice. At the time of last contact, 15/23 (65%) patients were alive.;Next-generation sequencing platforms offer clinicians an opportunity to identify targetable oncogenic events in ATC. To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest sequential cohort of ATC patients who have undergone targeted genomic profiling. Based on these data, utilization of both tumor-based and cfDNA analysis in the context of clinical-trial development and application is recommended.

Owing to the lack of effective treatment options, ATC has a mortality rate of ∼100% and median survival of less than 5 months. RNAi nanotechnology represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy through nanoparticle (NP) -mediated delivery of RNAi agents (e.g., siRNA) to solid tumors for specific silencing of target genes driving growth and/or metastasis. Nevertheless, the clinical success of RNAi cancer nanotherapies remains elusive in large part because of the suboptimal systemic siRNA NP delivery to tumors and the fact that tumor heterogeneity produces variable NP accumulation and thus, therapeutic response. To address these challenges, we here present an innovative theranostic NP platform composed of a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent polymer for effective in vivo siRNA delivery to ATC tumors and simultaneous tracking of the tumor accumulation by noninvasive NIR imaging. The NIR polymeric NPs are small (∼50 nm), show long blood circulation and high tumor accumulation, and facilitate tumor imaging. Systemic siRNA delivery using these NPs efficiently silences the expression of V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) in tumor tissues and significantly suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of ATC. These results suggest that this theranostic NP system could become an effective tool for NIR imaging-guided siRNA delivery for personalized treatment of advanced malignancies. ",

The patients presented either transient elevation of serum TSH during infancy or growing giant goiters from childhood. Among 15 patients who were born after initiation of neonatal screening in 1979, 13 patients were identified by high serum TSH. In contrast, the major manifestation in patients born before 1979 is persistent growth of goiters with euthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism. Among 25 mutations, Cys1264Arg and Cys1077Arg are hot spots. The Cys1264Arg patients were found all over Japan, but the Cys1077Arg patients were confined to a small village of a southern island in Japan. The occurrence of the thyroglobulin mutations in the general population is 1/67,000. The pathogenesis of abnormal thyroglobulin is defective intracellular transport. The histological findings include empty colloid in the follicles and distended ER filling the entire cytoplasm of the thyrocytes.

Promising results obtained in other solid tumors, both squamous and non-squamous, have revealed that an increase in the EGFR gene copy number may predict the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies, while the presence of mutations in downstream members of the EGFR pathway may confer resistance.

        "Doc_abstract":"p21 (CDKN1A/CIP1/WAF1), one of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle and is transcriptionally regulated by p53. Down-regulation of p21 is caused by TP53 mutations in colorectal cancer. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) appears to be a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer with concordant methylation of multiple gene promoters and is associated with a high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and BRAF mutations. However, no study to date has evaluated the relationship between p21 expression and CIMP in colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the inter-relationships between p21, p53, CIMP, MSI and KRAS/BRAF status in colorectal cancer. We utilized 737 relatively unbiased samples of colorectal cancers from two large prospective cohort studies. Using quantitative real-time PCR (MethyLight), we measured DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), CRABP1, MLH1 and NEUROG1]. CIMP-high (>or=4/5 methylated promoters) was diagnosed in 118 (16%) of the 737 tumours. We also assessed expression of p21 and p53 by immunohistochemistry. Among the 737 tumours, 371 (50%) showed p21 loss. Both p21 loss and p53 positivity were inversely associated with CIMP-high, MSI-H and BRAF mutations. The associations of p21 with these molecular features were still present after tumours were stratified by p53 status. In contrast, the associations of p53 positivity with the molecular features were no longer present after tumours were stratified by p21 status. When CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high tumours were stratified by MSI or KRAS/BRAF status, CIMP-high and MSI-H (but not BRAF mutations) were still inversely associated with p21 loss. In conclusion, down-regulation of p21 is inversely correlated with CIMP-high and MSI-H in colorectal cancer, independent of TP53 and BRAF status.",

After progression during or post immunotherapy, these patients were given BRAF inhibitor therapy and developed rapid CRs. Based on the concomitant presence of autoimmune manifestations (including vitiligo and hypophysitis), we postulated that there was a synergistic effect between the prior immune therapy and the BRAF targeting agents. Accordingly, the inhibitors were gradually weaned off beginning at 3 months and were stopped completely at 9-12 months. The three patients remain well and in CR off of all therapy at up to 15 months radiographic follow-up. The institution of the BRAF therapy was associated with development of severe rheumatoid-like arthritis in 2 patients which persisted for months after discontinuation of therapy, suggesting it was not merely a known toxicity of BRAF inhibitors (arthralgias). On immunologic analysis, these patients had high levels of non-T-regulatory, CD4 positive effector phenotype T-cells, which persisted after completion of therapy. Of note, we had previously reported a similar phenomenon in patients with metastatic melanoma who failed high dose interleukin-2 and were then placed on a finite course of temozolomide with rapid complete responses that have remained durable for many years after discontinuation of temozolomide. We postulate that a finite course of cytotoxic or targeted therapy specific for melanoma given after apparent failure of prior immunotherapy can result in complete and durable remissions that may persist long after the specific cytotoxic or targeted agents have been discontinued suggesting the existence of sequence specific synergism between immunotherapy and these agents. Here, we discuss these cases in the context of the literature on synergy between conventional or targeted cytotoxic therapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment. ",

An Ampliseq Custom Panel, including 11 crucial full length genes involved in melanoma carcinogenesis and therapy response pathways, was created and used to analyze 25 MM patients.

Patients with previous BRAF or MEK inhibitor treatment were ineligible. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enrol only if the lesions were asymptomatic, untreated (or stable more than 3 weeks after local therapy if treated), and measured less than 1 cm.

At least 4 nuclear features were found in each tumor, with nuclear pseudoinclusions being the least frequent finding in all mutation groups. BRAF mutations were associated with older patient age, typical papillary appearance or the tall cell variant, a higher rate of extrathyroidal extension, and more advanced tumor stage at presentation. RET/PTC rearrangements presented at younger age and had predominantly typical papillary histology, frequent psammoma bodies, and a high rate of lymph node metastases.

We examined 13 cases of struma ovarii to determine if these lesions can exhibit histological, immunohistochemical, and/or molecular features of follicular variant PTC. Ten of these had atypical histology, cytologic features of PTC, and all ten showed diffuse positivity for CK19; eight of these were also positive for HMBE-1. Mutational analysis for BRAF identified no V600E mutations. However, seven of the ten cases with features of follicular variant PTC exhibited a rearranged in transformation (RET)/PTC rearrangement by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The three cases considered to be benign based on histologic and cytologic criteria were negative for CK19 and HBME-1 by immunohistochemistry, and had no evidence of BRAF mutation or ret/PTC-1 and ret/PTC-3 rearrangements. These results indicate that follicular variant PTC can occur in struma ovarii and that such lesions exhibit the same morphologic and immunohistochemical profile as follicular variant PTC in thyroid.

As an approach to aid interpretation of the DC results, the mutations were also quantified in normal breast tissue. Overall, the mutations were prevalent in normal breast and DCs, with 9/9 DCs having measureable levels of at least three of the five mutations. HRAS G12D was significantly increased in DCs as compared to normal breast. The most frequent point mutation reported in DC by DNA sequencing, PIK3CA H1047R, was detected in all normal breast tissue and DC samples and was present at remarkably high levels (mutant fractions of 1.1 × 10(-3) to 4.6 × 10(-2)) in 4/10 normal breast samples. In normal breast tissue samples, PIK3CA mutation levels were positively correlated with age. However, the PIK3CA H1047R mutant fraction distributions for normal breast tissues and DCs were similar. The results suggest PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells have a selective advantage in breast, contribute to breast cancer susceptibility, and drive tumor progression during breast carcinogenesis, even when present as only a subpopulation of tumor cells.

Over the past 15 years, the application of molecular technologies to the study of these neoplasms has elucidated critical genetic pathways associated with the development of specific thyroid tumor types. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), genetic events involve RET and TRK (rearrangements) and BRAF and RAS (mutations), although RAS mutations are uncommon except in the follicular variant of PTC. These genetic alterations, which rarely overlap in the same tumor, result in signaling abnormalities in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, genetic alterations in follicular carcinomas include PAX8-PPARgamma translocations and RAS mutations while mutations of CTNNB1 and p53 have been implicated in the development and progression of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas. Germline mutations of RET are responsible for the development of heritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) while somatic mutations of this oncogene are found in a significant proportion of sporadic MTCs. The results of these studies not only have provided additional approaches to thyroid tumor classification, but also have stimulated the development of novel approaches to tumor diagnosis and additional parameters for prognostic assessment and potential biologic therapeutic strategies.",

Moreover, identification of molecular markers as well as a better understanding of thyroid carcinogenesis will help develop innovative targeted therapies, particularly in patients with metastatic iodo-resistant thyroid carcinoma. To date, four types of somatic genetic alterations are known to hold potential interest for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas: BRAF and RAS mutations, and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of the KRAS-LCS6 variant allele in different cancer types that included patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer (BC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain tumour patient subgroups from the Czech Republic. The occurrence of this genetic variant was correlated with the presence of selected somatic mutations representing predictive biomarkers in the respective tumours.;DNA of tumour tissues was isolated from 428 colorectal cancer samples, 311 non-small cell lung cancer samples, 195 breast cancer samples and 151 samples with brain tumour. Analysis of SNP (rs61764370) was performed by the PCR+RFLP method and direct sequencing. KRAS, BRAF and EGFR mutation status was assessed using real-time PCR. The status of the HER2 gene was assessed using the FISH method.;The KRAS-LCS6 TG genotype has been detected in 16.4% (32/195) of breast cancer cases (in HER2 positive breast cancer 3.3%, in HER2 negative breast cancer 20.1%), in 12.4% (53/428) of CRC cases (KRAS/BRAF wild type CRC in 10.6%, KRAS mutant CRC in 10.1%, BRAF V600E mutant CRC in 18.5%), in 13.2% (41/311) of NSCLC samples, (EGFR mutant NSCLC patients in 8%, EGFR wild type NSCLC in 12.9%), and 17.9% (27/151) of brain tumour cases. The KRAS-LCS6 TG genotype was not significantly different across the studied tumours. In our study, the GG genotype has not been found among the cancer samples.;Based on the findings, it is concluded that the occurrence of the KRAS-LCS6 TG genotype was statistically significantly different in association with status of the HER2 gene in breast cancer.

Dasatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets EphA2 and other kinases. However, reliable predictive markers and a better understanding of the mechanisms of response to this agent are needed.;The effects of dasatinib on human uterine cancer cell lines were examined using a series of in vitro experiments, including MTT, Western blot analysis, and plasmid transfection. In vivo, an orthotopic mouse model of uterine cancer was utilized to identify the biologic effects of dasatinib. Molecular markers for response prediction and the mechanisms relevant to response to dasatinib were identified by using reverse phase protein array (RPPA), immunoprecipitation, and double immunofluorescence staining.;We show that high levels of CAV-1, EphA2 phosphorylation at S897, and the status of PTEN are key determinants of dasatinib response in uterine carcinoma. A set of markers essential for dasatinib response was also identified and includes CRaf, pCRaf(S338), pMAPK(T202/Y204) (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway), pS6(S240/244), p70S6k(T389) (mTOR pathway), and pAKT(S473). A novel mechanism for response was discovered whereby high expression level of CAV-1 at the plasma membrane disrupts the BRaf/CRaf heterodimer and thus inhibits the activation of MAPK pathway during dasatinib treatment.;Our in vitro and in vivo results provide a new understanding of EphA2 targeting by dasatinib and identify key predictors of therapeutic response.

The BRAF gene codes for a protein in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. All mutations identified to date are within the kinase domain, with a single missense mutation (V599E) accounting for 80%. We investigated the hypothesis that this common somatic BRAF mutation (V599E) would contribute to melanoma predisposition in familial and polygenic malignant melanoma if occurring as a germ-line mutation. We performed comprehensive mutational screening of exon 15 of BRAF using DHPLC (denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography) and DNA sequencing techniques. No V599E mutation could be detected in 172 melanoma patients comprising 46 familial cases, 21 multiple melanoma patients and 106 cases with at least one first-degree relative suffering from other cancers. We therefore conclude that the common somatic BRAF mutation V599E does not contribute to polygenic and familial melanoma predisposition.",

The presence of oncogenic deregulation of different members of EGFR downstream signaling or crosstalk molecules could predict the lack of response in these patients. In this study, 40 wild type KRAS and BRAF colorectal tumors were analyzed to elucidate whether PML-RARa bcr1 fusion gene may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Specifically we want to determine if this fusion could be responsible for the inability to respond to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Here, for the first time it is reported, that PML-RARa bcr1 fusion is not responsible for colorectal tumor development and also, this translocation is not predicting the lack of efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies in wild type KRAS and BRAF colorectal cancer patients.

The immunohistochemical calcitonin stain identified CCs easily, both inside SCNs and dispersed in islets at the periphery. For the characterization of MCs, we added the utility of p40 to p63. The use of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) helped in their identification, as MCs did not react with this marker; the combination of TTF-1 and p40 or p63 IHC stains was useful for the characterization of cystic SCNs of both types 3 and 4.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of molecular testing in false-negative FNA has not yet been evaluated.;In total, 1347 consecutive papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) with both cytological and histological diagnoses were collected from the same center. A blinded revision of the false-negative cases was performed. An analysis of the BRAF and Ras genes in the false-negative cases was then performed.;The false-negative rate at the time of primary FNA diagnosis was 4.8% (65 of 1347 cases). False-negative cases were 15 follicular variant PTCs, 2 classical variant, and 1 solid variant that lacked peculiar PTC cytomorphological features. Adequate cellular material for molecular analysis was available only in 54 of the 65 false-negative cases. Mutations were found in 6 cases (11%), and Ras alterations were present in 16 cases (29.6%). The addition of molecular analysis decreased the false-negative rate to 0.4% (5 of 1347 cases).;The results of the current study confirm the feasibility of BRAF and Ras analysis in routine FNA.

In this study, we identify constitutively activated ERK in almost all melanoma cell lines and in tumor tissues tested, which is in contrast to normal melanocytes and several early stage radial growth phase melanoma lines where ERK can be activated by serum or growth factors. Constitutive activation of ERK is preceded by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and c-RAF. In all of the melanoma cell lines tested, Ras is constitutively activated without underlying mutations. On the contrary, activating mutations in the kinase domain of BRAF are present in the majority of the cell lines tested. Furthermore, ERK activation can be partially inhibited from the cell surface using inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor but not interleukin 8 signaling pathways.

BRAF(V600E) induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAF(V600E). Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAF(V600E) stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAF(V600E) signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAF(V600E) signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that targeting the oncogenic BRAF and S281-phosphorylated Mps1, especially when used in combination could potentially provide great therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.",

In this study, we have reviewed the cytological features of metastatic PTC to the liver, tested the BRAF V600E status of these lesions, and discussed potential diagnostic pitfalls. The pathological archives at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were searched for metastatic PTC. A total of 247 cases were identified; four cases were found to have metastases to the liver. Three of these cases were available for molecular testing to determine BRAF V600E status. All patients were female with ages ranging from 39- to 66-years old. Local lymph node involvement was found in all patients at the time of thyroidectomy. The average time of liver metastasis discovery following thyroidectomy was 16 years. The cytomorphology revealed predominantly microacini or two-dimensional clusters. Tumor cells were small-to-intermediate in size with oval nuclei, fine chromatin, nuclear grooves, rare intranuclear pseudoinclusions, and mitoses. In all cases, immunohistochemical stains for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) were positive. All these tested cases were negative for the BRAF V600E mutation. The differential diagnosis includes adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine neoplasms. The most important morphologic features for diagnosing PTC are the presence of pale finely granular chromatin, nuclear grooves, and intranuclear pseudoinclusions. A thorough review of the patient's clinical history and the use of appropriate IHC stains are essential in reaching an accurate diagnosis. Further molecular characterization is necessary to identify the changes most strongly associated with distant metastasis.",

The aim of the present multicenter open-label Phase II study was to explore the efficacy and safety of biweekly administration of cetuximab and mFOLFOX-6 or XELOX as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.;Sixty-two patients with previously untreated KRAS/BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer were recruited to the study between April 2010 and May 2011. Patients received one of two treatment regimens, either cetuximab plus mFOLFOX-6 (FOLFOX + Cmab) or cetuximab plus biweekly XELOX (XELOX + Cmab), according to their own preference. Treatment was continued until disease progression or the appearance of intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate; secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, disease control rate, dose intensity, conversion rate to surgical resection, and safety.;The response rates in the FOLFOX + Cmab (n = 37) and XELOX + Cmab (n = 25) groups were 64.9 % (24/37) and 72.0 % (18/25), respectively. The median PFS in the FOLFOX + Cmab and XELOX + Cmab groups was 13.1 months (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12.1-17.5) and 13.4 months (95 % CI 10.1-17.9), respectively. Neutropenia was the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse event in both groups (33.9 %), followed by anorexia, acneiform eruption, skin fissure and paronychia. A waterfall plot of tumor diameter showed prominent shrinkage of the tumors in 88.7 % of patients.;The results of the present study indicate that biweekly cetuximab plus mFOLFOX-6/XELOX is an effective and tolerable treatment regimen. Biweekly administration of cetuximab requires only one hospital visit every 2 weeks, and may become a convenient treatment option for patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.;This study is registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN 000003253 ).

Earlier, they have been regarded as variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), hyperplastic lesions, and follicular neoplasms. Eighteen EPONs were retrieved from our surgical pathology files and reviewed for defining morphologic features. Cases having the typical nuclear features of PTC were excluded. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CK19, HBME1, and CD56 was carried out. Microdissection, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of exon 15 of the BRAF gene were completed. Cases were evaluated for rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma RET/PTC rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The majority of the tumors exhibited a distinctive histologic appearance. They were composed of true papillae lined by a single layer of predominantly cuboidal cells with oncocytic cytoplasm; hobnailing was typically prominent. Three tumors showed taller cells with uniformly apical nuclei and no hobnailing. Ten of 18 cases showed vascular and/or capsular invasion; hence, if the diagnostic criteria used to evaluate follicular neoplasms are applied, more than half of the tumors would be considered minimally invasive carcinomas. No cases were immunoreactive with antibodies to HBME1, whereas only 1 of 13 was immunoreactive for CK19. Six of 7 interpretable cases were immunoreactive for CD56. No BRAF point mutations or RET/PTC rearrangements were identified in the examined cases. All patients were alive at the time of last follow-up and no locally recurrent disease had been reported; however, 1 case was remarkable for a lymph node metastasis. Our results confirm that EPONs are histologically, immunohistochemically, and molecularly distinct from papillary thyroid carcinoma and seem to be most related to follicular neoplasms.",

Its origins can either be sporadic or inherited, being Lynch syndrome the most common form of hereditary CRC. The activation of BRAF oncogene, inactivation of mismatch repair genes by methylation of CpG islands, and microsatellite instability (MSI) have been reported to be involved in CRC development. The goal of the study was to characterize CRC tumors using clinical and molecular criteria through association and cluster analysis. Amsterdam II and Bethesda guidelines and molecular variables were analyzed in 77 patients from Brazil. The replication error (RER) status, based in microsatellite instability, showed association with metachronous tumor, MLH1 gene methylation and inverse association with left-sided and synchronous tumors. The PMS2 gene was considered the best predictor for differentiating levels of methylation and the mononucleotide were considered the best markers to evaluate RER status. The cluster 1 was characterized of individuals over 60 years of age, female, right-sided tumor, high microsatellite instability, and metachronous or synchronous tumors. The individuals in cluster 2 were younger than 45 years of age, male and showed left sided or rectum tumors, and microsatellite stability. Even though it was not observed a significant association, a higher number of individuals with family history of cancer and tumors without promoter methylation were found in cluster 2.

Galectin-3 immunostaining and molecular analyses for BRAF and three RAS genes (NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS) were performed.;FNAC diagnoses of FVPTC included benign (5%), atypia of undetermined significance (19%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (14%), suspicious for PTC (29%), and PTC (34%). Galectin-3 immunostaining was positive in 50% of FNAC specimens. A BRAF mutation was found only in 14 (24%) tumors with the FNAC diagnosis of PTC or suspicious for PTC: 13 cases with the usual c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation and 1 case with a 3 base-pair deletion (c.1799_1801delTGA), resulting in a deletion of lysine at codon 601 and a deletion c.1799_1801delTGA that results in a valine-to-glutamate substitution at codon 600 (p.V600_K601>E) while preserving the reading frame. A BRAF K601E mutation was not found. RAS mutations were observed in 18 (33%) tumors (NRAS, 22%; HRAS, 6%; KRAS, 6%). Mutations of the three RAS genes were detected in codon 61 but not in codons 12 and 13. There was a decreasing trend of RAS mutation rates associated with an increasing risk of malignancy in the FNAC diagnostic categories. The triage efficacy of FNAC to make a recommendation for surgery was 73% for encapsulated tumors and 79% for infiltrative tumors. Addition of galectin-3 or the BRAF test to FNAC showed no significant improvement in the triage efficacy. However, RAS mutations significantly improved the triage efficacy of FNAC. There was no significant difference in the triage efficacy of FNAC, galectin-3 expression, and the prevalence of somatic mutations between encapsulated and infiltrative tumors.;Thyroid FNAC has a low sensitivity for the detection of FVPTC regardless of histologic subtype. Encapsulated FVPTC and infiltrative FVPTC have similar molecular profiles and rates of galectin-3 expression. RAS mutational analysis is more useful than BRAF testing to improve the triage efficacy of FNAC for FVPTC.",

We have recently shown a positive correlation between MSI/CIMP and loss of nuclear p27. However, no study has examined cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization in relation to CIMP and MSI in colorectal cancer. Using MethyLight assays, we quantified DNA methylation in 8 CIMP-specific gene promoters (CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1) in 853 colorectal cancer samples obtained from 2 large prospective cohorts. We assessed expressions of nuclear and cytoplasmic p27 and nuclear p53 by immunohistochemistry. Cytoplasmic p27 expression was inversely associated with loss of nuclear p27 (P < .0001), CIMP-high (P < .0001), MSI-H (P < .0001), and BRAF mutations (P < .0001). The inverse association of cytoplasmic p27 with CIMP-high (or MSI-H) was independent of MSI (or CIMP) status. In addition, the inverse association of cytoplasmic p27 with CIMP-high was independent of KRAS/BRAF status. BRAF and CDKN2A (p16) methylation were not correlated with cytoplasmic p27 after stratification by CIMP status. The inverse associations of cytoplasmic p27 with MSI-H and CIMP-high were much more pronounced in p53-negative than p53-positive tumors. In conclusion, cytoplasmic p27 expression is inversely associated with MSI-H and CIMP-high, particularly in p53-negative tumors, suggesting interplay of functional losses of p27 and p53 in the development of various molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.",

This case report describes a patient with a synchronous metastatic high-grade sarcoma who was treated with BRAF-targeted therapy with resolution of his metastatic lesions. To our knowledge, this exceptional response has not been described in sarcoma literature. The patient presented with a large anterior abdominopelvic wall mass. Biopsy showed a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. Staging scans confirmed two pulmonary metastases. He was initiated on combination chemotherapy with mixed results. He received 50 Gy of radiation to the primary tumor followed by two additional cycles of combination chemotherapy, with an interval increase in the size of the pulmonary metastases.  Molecular testing revealed a BRAF V600E mutation in the primary tumor. The patient was initiated on dabrafenib/trametinib with a dramatic response and resolution of his pulmonary metastases. The patient underwent surgical resection of his primary mass, and pathology confirmed no evidence of residual disease.  Detailed genetic characterization of STS coupled with novel therapeutic strategies, including molecular targeted therapy, may have the potential to transform the care of patients diagnosed with sarcoma.

Targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. These agents offer the possibility of greater efficacy and less toxicity than current therapies for tumors driven by oncogenic mutations in the MAPK pathway. Early clinical results with the BRAF-selective inhibitor PLX4032 suggest that this strategy will prove successful in a select group of patients whose tumors are driven by V600E BRAF. Relief of physiologic feedback upon pathway inhibition may, however, attenuate drug response and contribute to the development of acquired resistance. An improved understanding of the adaptive response of cancer cells to MAPK pathway inhibition may thus aid in the identification of those patients most likely to respond to targeted pathway inhibitors and provide a rational basis for tailored combination strategies.",

The patient was a 48-year-old female with a right thyroid nodule and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right neck. It was not possible to make a definitive diagnosis of malignancy on fine-needle aspiration cytology and intraoperative frozen section. She underwent total thyroidectomy with right modified radical neck dissection. The surgical specimen showed a 2.5 × 1.5 × 10 cm, well-circumscribed macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right lobe and multiple central and right lateral neck lymph node metastases. Molecular testing for BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS was all negative. We then reviewed the demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of 71 patients with the macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The cytologic or histopathologic diagnosis of macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma can be difficult. Extensive lymph node metastases caused by the macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma may occur even in the absence of capsular or lymphovascular invasion.

The relative mRNA expression of the five target genes was determinate by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR).;Expression of all genes was significantly higher in NTTs than in PTCs, and it was not age dependent in the NTT group. Among PTCs, the mean expression of PDS, TPO and TSH-R was significantly lower in group II than in group I. PDS, TPO and Tg expression was significantly lower in classic PTCs than in FVPTCs.

We used cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and structural equation modeling (SEM), a novel strategy, to decipher the correlation structure of CpG island hypermethylation. Using a database of 861 colon and rectal cancers, DNA methylation at 16 CpG islands [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16/ink4a), CHFR, CRABP1, HIC1, IGF2, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT-1, MINT-31, MLH1, NEUROG1, p14 (CDKN2A/arf), RUNX3, SOCS1, and WRN] was quantified by real-time PCR. Tumors were categorized into three groups: Group 1 with wild-type KRAS/BRAF (N = 440); Group 2 with mutant KRAS and wild-type BRAF (N = 308); and Group 3 with wild-type KRAS and mutant BRAF (N = 107). Tumors with mutant KRAS/BRAF (N = 6) were excluded. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, all but six markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, RUNX3, MGMT, MINT-1, and SOCS1) were differentially clustered with CIMP-high and CIMP-low according to KRAS and BRAF status. In SEM, the correlation structures between CIMP, locus-specific CpG island methylation, and MSI differed according to KRAS and BRAF status, which was consistent with PCA results. In conclusion, KRAS and BRAF mutations appear to differentially influence correlation structure of CpG island methylation.

MLH1 methylation status was evaluated by MethyLight and methylation-specific MLPA (MS-MLPA) in tumor DNA from 73 colorectal cancer patients with loss of MLH1 protein expression. These tumors were analyzed for BRAF V600E mutations, and genetic testing for germline MLH1 mutations was performed in all corresponding patients. Ten patients had germline mutations in MLH1 and none of their tumors showed significant MLH1 methylation or BRAF V600E mutation. MLH1 genetic testing excluded patients by MethyLight in 47 patients (64%), by MS-MLPA in 49 (67%), and BRAF V600E mutation in only 25 patients (34%) (chi(2) P = 0.00001). Specificity was 75% for MethyLight, 78% for MS-MLPA and 40% for BRAF V600E mutation. The use of MethyLight or MS-MLPA instead of BRAF mutation resulted in a cost reduction of 41% and 45%, respectively, per every MLH1 mutation detected.

CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a phenotype of colorectal cancer with extensive promoter methylation, and associated with high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and BRAF mutations. We have recently shown that both CIMP and MSI-H are inversely associated with downregulation of p21 (CDKN1A or CIP1), another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. However, no study to date has examined relationship between p27 and CIMP status in colorectal cancer. Using MethyLight assays, we measured DNA methylation in five CIMP-specific gene promoters {CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, MLH1 and NEUROG1} in 706 colorectal cancer samples obtained from two large prospective cohorts. Among the 706 tumors, 112 (16%) were CIMP-high tumors with >or=4/5 methylated promoters. We assessed p27 and p53 expressions by immunohistochemistry. Loss of nuclear p27 expression {observed in 231 tumors (33%)} was significantly associated with CIMP-high, MSI-H and BRAF mutations, and these associations were much more pronounced among p53-negative tumors than p53-positive tumors. When CIMP-high and non-CIMP-high tumors were stratified by MSI status (or KRAS and BRAF status), CIMP-high and MSI-H (but not BRAF mutations) were still significantly associated with nuclear p27 loss. Nuclear p27 loss did not appear to be directly related to CDKN2A (p16) methylation. We conclude that downregulation of nuclear p27 is associated with CIMP-high and MSI-H in colorectal cancer. These associations are stronger among p53 wild-type tumors, implying important interplay of p27 and p53 functions (or dysfunctions) in the development of various molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer.",

This is illustrated by the frequent genetic alteration of several key players from these pathways in a wide variety of human cancers. Here, we report a detailed sequence analysis of the PTEN, PIK3CA, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, and BRAF genes in a collection of 40 human breast cancer cell lines. We identified a surprisingly large proportion of cell lines with mutations in the PI3K or RAS pathways (54% and 25%, respectively), with mutants for each of the six genes. The PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutation spectra of the breast cancer cell lines were similar to those of colorectal cancers. Unlike in colorectal cancers, however, mutational activation of the PI3K pathway was mutually exclusive with mutational activation of the RAS pathway in all but 1 of 30 mutant breast cancer cell lines (P = 0.001). These results suggest that there is a fine distinction between the signaling activators and downstream effectors of the oncogenic PI3K and RAS pathways in breast epithelium and those in other tissues.",

Systematic approaches to identify efficacious drug combinations for cancer are not well established, especially in the context of genotype. To address this, we have tested pairwise combinations of an array of small-molecule inhibitors on early-passage melanoma cultures using combinatorial drug screening. Results reveal several inhibitor combinations effective for melanomas with activating RAS or BRAF mutations, including mutant BRAF melanomas with intrinsic or acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Inhibition of both EGF receptor and AKT sensitized treatment-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cultures to vemurafenib. Melanomas with RAS mutations were more resistant to combination therapies relative to BRAF mutants, but were sensitive to combinations of statins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. These results show the use of combinatorial drug screening for discovering unique treatment regimens that overcome resistance phenotypes of mutant BRAF- and RAS-driven melanomas.;We have used drug combinatorial screening to identify effective combinations for mutant BRAF melanomas, including those resistant to vemurafenib, and mutant RAS melanomas that are resistant to many therapies. Mechanisms governing the interactions of the drug combinations are proposed, and in vivo xenografts show the enhanced benefit and tolerability of a mutant RAS -selective combination, which is currently lacking in the clinic.",

In contrast, the frequency of PTC cases with point mutations (mainly BRAF(V600E)) was significantly lower in patients with relatively higher radiation exposure than those with lower radiation exposure. We also found that among ABS, the frequency of PTC cases with no detectable gene alterations in RET, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1), BRAF, or RAS was significantly higher in patients with relatively higher radiation exposure than those with lower radiation exposure. However, in ABS with PTC, the relationship between the presence of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fused with other gene partners and radiation exposure has received little study. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the relative frequency of rearranged ALK in ABS with PTC, and with no detectable gene alterations in RET, NTRK1, BRAF, or RAS, would be greater in those having relatively higher radiation exposures.;The 105 subjects in the study were drawn from the Life Span Study cohort of ABS of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were diagnosed with PTC between 1956 and 1993. Seventy-nine were exposed (>0 mGy), and 26 were not exposed to A-bomb radiation. In the 25 ABS with PTC, and with no detectable gene alterations in RET, NTRK1, BRAF, or RAS, we examined archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTC specimens for rearrangement of ALK using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE).;We found rearranged ALK in 10 of 19 radiation-exposed PTC cases, but none among 6 patients with PTC with no radiation exposure. In addition, solid/trabecular-like architecture in PTC was closely associated with ALK rearrangements, being observed in 6 of 10 PTC cases with ALK rearrangements versus 2 of 15 cases with no ALK rearrangements. The six radiation-exposed cases of PTC harboring both ALK rearrangements and solid/trabecular-like architecture were associated with higher radiation doses and younger ages at the time of the A-bombing and at diagnosis compared to the other 19 PTC with no detectable gene alterations.;Our findings suggest that ALK rearrangements are involved in the development of radiation-induced adult-onset PTC.",

However, this view does not fully reflect the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. We have analyzed both genetic (mutations of BRAF, KRAS, and p53 and microsatellite instability) and epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation of 27 CpG island promoter regions) in 97 primary colorectal cancer patients. Two clustering analyses on the basis of either epigenetic profiling or a combination of genetic and epigenetic profiling were performed to identify subclasses with distinct molecular signatures. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the DNA methylation data identified three distinct groups of colon cancers named CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) 1, CIMP2, and CIMP negative. Genetically, these three groups correspond to very distinct profiles. CIMP1 are characterized by MSI (80%) and BRAF mutations (53%) and rare KRAS and p53 mutations (16% and 11%, respectively). CIMP2 is associated with 92% KRAS mutations and rare MSI, BRAF, or p53 mutations (0, 4, and 31% respectively). CIMP-negative cases have a high rate of p53 mutations (71%) and lower rates of MSI (12%) or mutations of BRAF (2%) or KRAS (33%). Clustering based on both genetic and epigenetic parameters also identifies three distinct (and homogeneous) groups that largely overlap with the previous classification. The three groups are independent of age, gender, or stage, but CIMP1 and 2 are more common in proximal tumors. Together, our integrated genetic and epigenetic analysis reveals that colon cancers correspond to three molecularly distinct subclasses of disease.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently, it was shown that the oncogenic activation of BRAF, a member of the RAS/RAF family of kinases, by the V600E mutation is characteristic for sporadic colon tumors with microsatellite instability. Further, it was shown to associate with the silencing of the mismatch repair (MMR) gene MLH1 by hypermethylation. Moreover, BRAF mutations proved to be absent in tumors from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) families with germline mutations in the MMR genes MLH1 and MSH2. These data suggest that the oncogenic activation of BRAF is involved only in sporadic colorectal tumorigenesis. In order to further support this hypothesis, we have extended the analysis of the BRAF gene to a different subset of HNPCC families without germline mutations in MLH1 and MSH2. BRAF-V600E mutations were analysed by automatic sequencing in 38 tumors from HNPCC families with germline mutations in the MSH6 gene and also in HNPCC (suspected) families that do not have mutations in the MMR genes MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. All patients belong to different families. No mutations were detected in 14 tumors from HNPCC patients with germline mutations in MSH6. Further, no mutations of BRAF were found in tumors from 23 MMR-negative families, from which 13 fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria (HNPCC) and 10 were suspected for HNPCC as they were positive for the Bethesda criteria. Overall, our data reinforce the concept that BRAF is not involved in the colorectal tumorigenesis of HNPCC. The detection of a positive BRAF-V600E mutation in a colorectal cancer suggests a sporadic origin of the disease and the absence of germline alterations of MLH1, MSH2 and also of MSH6. These findings have a potential impact in the genetic testing for HNPCC diagnostics and suggest a potential use of BRAF as exclusion criteria for HNPCC or as a molecular marker of sporadic cancer.",

Secondary end points included response correlation with serum thyroglobulin (Tg); functional imaging; tumor genotype; and signaling inhibition in tumor biopsies. Using a Simon minimax two-stage design, 16 or 25 chemotherapy-naïve metastatic PTC patients were to be enrolled in arm A (accessible tumor for biopsy). Arm B patients had other subtypes of thyroid carcinoma or prior chemotherapy, and did not require tumor biopsies. Patients received 400 mg orally twice per day of sorafenib. Response was assessed every 2 months using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).;Of 41 PTC patients, six patients had a partial response (PR; 15%; 95% CI, 6 to 29) and 23 patients (56%; 95% CI, 40 to 72) had stable disease longer than 6 months. Median duration of PR was 7.5 months (range, 6 to 14). Median progression-free survival was 15 months (95% CI, 10 to 27.5). In 14 (78%) of 18 Tg-assessable PTC patients, Tg declined more than 25%. Common grade 3 adverse events included hand-foot skin reaction, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. BRAF mutation was detected in 17 (77%) of 22 PTCs analyzed. Four of 10 paired tumor biopsies from PTC patients showed a reduction in levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor phosphorylation, ERK phosphorylation, and in VEGF expression during sorafenib therapy. No PRs were noted among non-PTC patients.;Sorafenib is reasonably well-tolerated therapy with clinical and biologic antitumor activity in metastatic PTC.",

However, new biomarkers that might improve the accuracy of FNAB come along with the discovery of more and more details of the molecular etiology of thyroid tumors. So far molecular testing for somatic mutations is most promising (e.g., BRAF), since the proposed biomarkers from mRNA- and miRNA-expression studies need further evaluation, especially in FNAB samples.

The linearity and non-linearity of molecular relations along subsites were statistically tested by multivariate logistic or linear regression analysis.;The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations gradually increased from the rectum (<2.3%) to ascending colon (36-40%), followed by falls in the caecum (12-22%). By linearity tests, these molecular relations were significantly linear from rectum to ascending colon (p<0.0001), and there was little evidence of non-linearity (p>0.09). Caecal cancers exhibited the highest frequency of KRAS mutations (52% vs 27-35% in other sites; p<0.0001).;The frequencies of CIMP-high, MSI-high and BRAF mutations in cancer increased gradually along colorectum subsites from the rectum to ascending colon.

The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+), in which discrete genes throughout the genome are simultaneously methylated, and long-range epigenetic silencing, whereby multiple genes within contiguous chromosomal regions are methylated, have been described in subsets of colorectal cancer. We previously reported the concurrent methylation of the mismatch repair gene MLH1 with a cluster of flanking genes in chromosome region 3p22 in sporadic colorectal carcinoma exhibiting microsatellite instability and the BRAF V600E mutation. Herein, we aimed to determine whether methylation of MLH1 and neighbouring 3p22 genes, singly or concomitantly, correlate with the germline c.-93G>A SNP within the MLH1 promoter, CIMP+ and other clinicopathological and molecular features of the tumours. By studying a cohort of 946 sporadic colorectal cancer cases, we show a strong association between concordant methylation of ≥ 3 of five 3p22 genes with CIMP+ and the BRAF V600E mutation (P<0.001). These associations were independent of microsatellite instability, as concomitant methylation of 3p22 genes other than MLH1 was found in microsatellite stable cancers. These findings show that long-range epigenetic silencing across 3p22 occurs in the context of CIMP+ and the BRAF V600E mutation, and only gives rise to microsatellite instability when this process encompasses MLH1. Furthermore, the strong relationship between long-range epigenetic silencing of 3p22 and CIMP+ provides further evidence that these two purportedly distinct epigenetic phenotypes represent a single entity with a common aetiology. Low-level methylation of MLH1 and flanking 3p22 genes, as well as the BRAF V600E mutation, were detected in the apparently normal colonic mucosa of a small number of cases whose tumours showed a similar molecular profile, suggesting that these concurring genetic and epigenetic events can occur as a field defect in neoplastic development.",

Efforts to target endogenous MAPKs are challenged by the fact that these kinases are required for viability in mammals. Additionally, the effectiveness of new inhibitors of mutant BRAF has been diminished by acquired tumor resistance through selection for BRAF-independent mechanisms of ERK1/2 induction. Furthermore, recently identified ERK1/2-inducing mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2) MAPK genes in melanoma confer resistance to emerging therapeutic MEK inhibitors, underscoring the challenges facing direct kinase inhibition in cancer. MAPK scaffolds, such as IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), assemble pathway kinases to affect signal transmission, and disrupting scaffold function therefore offers an orthogonal approach to MAPK cascade inhibition. Consistent with this, we found a requirement for IQGAP1 in RAS-driven tumorigenesis in mouse and human tissue. In addition, the ERK1/2-binding IQGAP1 WW domain peptide disrupted IQGAP1-ERK1/2 interactions, inhibited RAS- and RAF-driven tumorigenesis, bypassed acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032) and acted as a systemically deliverable therapeutic to significantly increase the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice.

In patients with advanced disease, there is significant variability in individual patient outcomes. To improve understanding of tumor behavior, markers such as KRAS and BRAF mutation status are increasingly utilized. Additionally, newer surrogates of tumor biology, such as telomerase activity and the prevalence of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA, have generated increasing interest due to clinical potential. While the extent to which these newer markers can predict outcome and guide therapy is yet to be determined, KRAS mutation status is currently used to guide systemic therapy in selected patients. Furthermore, advances in our understanding of various tumorigenic pathways (such as the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway) have enabled newer targeted agents, including BRAF inhibitors. Interestingly, although inhibition of BRAF in patients has not translated into improved outcomes, characterization of BRAF mutations led to an association with microsatellite instability. A unique histologic characteristic of certain tumors in patients with microsatellite instability is the infiltration by lymphocytes at the tumor-stromal interface. This feature highlights the biology of the tumor in its microenvironment and underlies the efficacy of the programmed-death inhibitor, pembrolizumab, in patients with microsatellite unstable metastatic colorectal cancer. With an increasing number of prognostic markers and therapeutic options in metastatic colorectal cancer, the multidisciplinary approach becomes critical for appropriate treatment decisions. ",

Our primary objective was to study the relationship between clinical and histological features of individuals with colorectal cancer and the mutational status of codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene (7 validated mutations), in order to find a histopathological marker to mutated tumors. The secondary objective was to determine how many patients had additional mutations in codons 15 and 61 of the KRAS gene, and codon 600 of the BRAF gene, which could modify the tumor phenotype. Sixty individuals with colorectal cancer (30 wild-type subjects and 30 with validated mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene) were selected. Exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene, and exon 15 of the BRAF gene were amplified and sequenced. The data collected were reviewed by a descriptive, univariate and/or multivariate analysis, as appropriate. In conclusion, no relation was found between clinical and histological features of individuals with colorectal cancer and their mutational status for codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. This suggests that those easily available data do not allow predicting the response to anti-EGFR therapy. In patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinomas and KRAS wild-type status, further study of codon 600 of the BRAF gene could be required.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent studies have uncovered molecular pathways of colorectal cancer, including the chromosomal instability pathway and microsatellite pathway. In addition, according to genetic and epigenetic profiles, colorectal cancer can be subclassified into 3 distinct groups, named the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) 1, CIMP2, and CIMP negative. CIMP1 is characterized by MSI and BRAF mutations and rare KRAS and p53 mutations. CIMP2 is associated with KRAS mutations and rare MSI, BRAF, or p53 mutations. CIMP negative cases have a high rate of p53 mutations and lower rates of MSI or mutations of BRAF or KRAS. Regarding genetic testing for personalized medicine for colorectal cancer, uridine disphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1(UGT1) and KRAS tests are available. Irinotecan is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The prodrug irinotecan is biotransformed by carboxylesterase into its active metabolite SN-38, which is inactivated by UGT1 into the inactive compound SN-38G. Here we discuss UGT1A1 gene polymorphism as a predictor of toxicity. The epidermal growth factor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. KRAS serves as a mediator between extracellular ligand binding and intracellular transduction of signals from EGFR to the nucleus. Activating KRAS mutations has been identified as a predictor of resistance to EGFR-directed antibodies such as cetuximab. Here we discuss the current understanding of KRAS mutations and the therapeutic effect of cetuximab.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previous studies detecting mutations in thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration (FNA) material differed with respect to the cytologic grading applied to the FNAs, the type of FNA material used, and the prevalence of mutations observed in the samples. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate these differences as possible reasons for the discrepant sensitivities and specificities reported for the \"ruling-in\" approach between the previous studies.;RNA and DNA was extracted from 347 routine air-dried FNA smears with available histology. PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while BRAF and RAS mutations were detected by pyrosequencing.;BRAF mutations were associated with a carcinoma in 100% of samples; RAS mutations were associated with a carcinoma in 57% of samples. Forty-nine percent of the carcinomas were identified by molecular testing in the group of follicular lesions, which increased the sensitivity from 60% to 80% compared to cytologic FNA evaluation alone. While follicular lesion FNAs had a 28% risk of malignancy, the risk increased to 71% for mutation-positive follicular lesions, and decreased to 18% for mutation-negative follicular lesions.;Molecular testing of air-dried FNA samples improves presurgical diagnosis. Discrepant sensitivities and specificities reported previously are most likely related to the use of different grading schemes resulting in different compositions of the cytologic categories, interobserver variability to diagnose follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas and a different prevalence of RAS mutations in follicular carcinomas. The knowledge of the molecular testing might support the histologic identification of minimally invasive follicular carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Geldanamycin is a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic that manifests anti-cancer activity through the inhibition of HSP90-chaperone function. The HSP90 molecular chaperone is expressed at high levels in a wide variety of human cancers including melanoma, leukemia, and cancers in colon, prostate, lung, and breast. In cancer cells dependent upon mutated and/or over-expressed oncogene proteins, HSP90 is thought to have a critical role in regulating the stability, folding, and activity of HSP90-associated proteins, so-called \"client proteins\". These client proteins include the growth-stimulating proteins and kinases that support malignant transformation. Recently, oncogenic activating BRAF mutants have been identified in variety of cancers where constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling pathway is the key for tumorigenesis, and they have been shown to be client proteins for HSP90. Accordingly, HSP90 inhibition can suppress certain cancer-causing client proteins and therefore represents an important therapeutic target. The molecular mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effect of HSP90 inhibition is complicated. Geldanamycin and its derivatives have been shown to induce the depletion of mutationally-activated BRAF through several mechanisms. In this review, we will describe the HSP90-inhibitory mechanism, focusing on recent progress in understanding HSP90 chaperone structure-function relationships, the identification of new HSP90 client proteins and the development of HSP90 inhibitors for clinical applications.",

However, the clinical, pathological, molecular and prognostic features of IGF2BP3-positive colorectal cancers remain uncertain.;We evaluated IGF2BP3 expression by immunohistochemistry in 671 rectal and colon cancer cases that form part of a molecular pathological epidemiology database. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compute mortality hazard ratio (HR), adjusting for clinical, pathological and molecular features, including microsatellite instability, the CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation and KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations.;Among 671 colorectal cancers, 234 (35%) tumours were positive for IGF2BP3. In contrast, normal colorectal epithelium was negative for IGF2BP3 in all 403 specimens of normal mucosa adjacent to carcinoma. IGF2BP3 positivity was associated with poor differentiation (p=0.0003), stage III-IV disease (p=0.0081), BRAF mutation (p=0.031), and LINE-1 hypomethylation (p=0.020). IGF2BP3 positivity was significantly associated with shorter colorectal cancer-specific [log-rank p<0.0001; multivariate HR, 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.84] and overall survival (log-rank p=0.0004; multivariate HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.66).;IGF2BP3 expression in colorectal cancer is associated with adverse clinical outcome.

Here, we identified and characterized the small molecule SBI-0640756 (SBI-756), a first-in-class inhibitor that targets eIF4G1 and disrupts the eIF4F complex. SBI-756 impaired the eIF4F complex assembly independently of mTOR and attenuated growth of BRAF-resistant and BRAF-independent melanomas. SBI-756 also suppressed AKT and NF-κB signaling, but small-molecule derivatives were identified that only marginally affected these pathways while still inhibiting eIF4F complex formation and melanoma growth, illustrating the potential for further structural and functional manipulation of SBI-756 as a drug lead. In the gene expression signature patterns elicited by SBI-756, DNA damage, and cell-cycle regulatory factors were prominent, with mutations in melanoma cells affecting these pathways conferring drug resistance. SBI-756 inhibited the growth of NRAS, BRAF, and NF1-mutant melanomas in vitro and delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of Nras/Ink4a melanomas in vivo. Furthermore, combining SBI-756 and a BRAFi attenuated the formation of BRAFi-resistant human tumors. Taken together, our findings show how SBI-756 abrogates the growth of BRAF-independent and BRAFi-resistant melanomas, offering a preclinical rationale to evaluate its antitumor effects in other cancers.",
