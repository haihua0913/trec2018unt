The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab is a backbone of most therapeutic regimens; however, biomarkers predicting its activity are not known. We report two cases of mCRC with a Q61K NRAS mutation that had a favorable response to bevacizumab and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid. In contrast, none of ten patients with wild-type NRAS or unknown NRAS status and mutated KRAS (NRAS and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive) responded to the same regimen.

The aim of this study was to screen for mutations in these genes in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and to explore their correlations with certain clinicopathological parameters. We tested mutations in the KRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4), PIK3CA (exon 20) and BRAF (exon 15) genes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing in a large cohort of 1,110 Chinese CRC patients who underwent surgical resection at one of three major teaching hospitals located in different regions of China. The prevalence rates of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were 45.4%, 3.9%, 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. Mutant KRAS was associated with the mucinous subtype and greater differentiation, while mutant BRAF was associated with right-sided tumors and poorer differentiation. Our results revealed differences in the genetic profiles of KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF at mutation hotspots between Chinese CRC patients and those of Western countries, while some of these gene features were shared among patients from other Asian countries.

However, little is known about the role of the rarer NRAS mutations as a mechanism of primary resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab in wild-type KRAS mCRC. Using isogenic mCRC cells with a heterozygous knock-in of the NRAS activating mutation Q61K, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which mutant NRAS blocks cetuximab from inhibiting mCRC growth. NRASQ61K/+ cells were refractory to cetuximab-induced growth inhibition. Pathway-oriented proteome profiling revealed that cetuximab-unresponsive ERK1/2 phosphorylation was the sole biomarker distinguishing cetuximab-refractory NRASQ61K/+ from cetuximab-sensitive NRAS+/+ cells. We therefore employed four representative MEK1/2 inhibitors (binimetinib, trametinib, selumetinib, and pimasertib) to evaluate the therapeutic value of MEK/ERK signaling in cetuximab-refractory NRAS mutation-induced mCRC. Co-treatment with an ineffective dose of cetuximab augmented, up to more than 1,300-fold, the cytotoxic effects of pimasertib against NRASQ61K/+ cells. Simultaneous combination of MEK1/2 inhibitors with cetuximab resulted in extremely high and dose-dependent synthetic lethal effects, which were executed, at least in part, by exacerbated apoptotic cell death. Dynamic monitoring of real-time cell growth rates confirmed that cetuximab synergistically sensitized NRASQ61K/+ cellsto MEK1/2 inhibition. Our discovery of a synthetic lethal interaction of cetuximab in combination with MEK1/2 inhibition for the NRAS mutant subgroup of mCRC underscores the importance of therapeutic intervention both in the MEK-ERK and EGFR pathways to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy against NRAS-mutant mCRC tumors.",

Neuroendocrine differentiation was significantly less concordant than KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA/TP53 mutational status in primary tumor/lymph node metastases pairs (65% versus 88%-99%; P < 0.0001) and primary tumor/distant metastases pairs (64% versus 83%-100%; P = 0.027 and P < 0.0001, respectively). According to these data, therapeutic targeting of neuroendocrine tumor cells can be considered only for a subset of CRC patients and biopsies from the metastatic site should be used to guide therapy. A possible importance of lacking neuroendocrine differentiation for progression of KRAS mutant CRC should be further investigated. ",

The clinicopathologic features and gene expression profiles of this latter subpopulation of RAS-mutant colorectal tumors have not yet been clearly defined but in general are treated similarly to those with KRAS 12 or 13 mutations.;Records of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center between December 2000 and August 2012 were reviewed for RAS (KRAS or NRAS) and BRAF mutation status, clinical characteristics, and survival outcomes. To study further with an independent cohort, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed to define a gene expression signature for patients whose tumors feature these atypical RAS mutations and explore differences with KRAS 12/13-mutated colorectal tumors.;Among the 484 patients reviewed, KRAS 12/13, KRAS 61/146, NRAS, and BRAF mutations were detected in 47.7%, 3.0%, 4.1%, and 7.4%, respectively, of patients who were tested for each of these aberrations.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether the location of a driver mutation within an affected gene impacts the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer.;DNA was collected from 165 randomly selected specimens of patients who underwent margin-negative resection of colorectal liver metastases with curative intent. Sequenom analysis and Sanger sequencing were used to evaluate mutations in K/NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and TP53.;BRAF mutation was associated with early recurrence and death, whereas no impact of TP53 or PIK3CA mutation was identified. Although K/NRAS mutation was associated with worse survival in this cohort, this difference was no longer evident when those who had received anti-EGFR therapy were excluded. When stratifying patients according to the exon on which K/NRAS was mutated, there were dramatic differences in both survival and pathologic features. Exon 4 mutations were associated with large, solitary metastases occurring at long disease-free intervals compared with exon 3 mutations, which presented with small, numerous lesions. Patients who had exon 4 mutations recurred infrequently and had significantly longer survival compared with those who had wild type or other mutations.;By using this model of curative-intent, margin-negative resection in patients at high risk of recurrence, the authors were able to establish a link between mutation location within the K/NRAS gene and the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer.

We sought to identify pharmacological agents to block the RAS oncogenic signaling by a distinct mechanism. Since the biological activity of RAS proteins rely upon lipid modifications and RAS regulates lipid metabolisms in cancer cells, we screened a bioactive lipid library using a RAS specific cell viability assay. We report the discovery of a new class of inhibitors for RAS transformation. Compounds in the class represented by endocannabinoid N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) can induce cell oncosis, independent of its ability to engage cannabinoid receptors. Further analyses show that NADA is more active in inhibiting the NRAS transformation and signaling than that of KRAS4B. Mechanistically, NADA blocks the plasma membrane translocation of NRAS, but not that of KRAS4B. In addition, NADA inhibits the plasma membrane translocation and neoplastic transformation of oncogenic KRAS4A. Interestingly, NADA also redistributes the cytoplasmic NRAS to the Golgi apparatus in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. The results indicate that NADA inhibits NRAS and KRAS4A plasma membrane translocation by targeting a novel molecular process. The new findings would help to develop novel targeted therapies for a broad range of human cancers.",

By screening the progeny of the injected animals, two strains stably expressing the NRAS transgene were identified: Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(1) and Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(2). Stable expression of this transgene results in hyperpigmented fish displaying a complete ablation of the normal pigment pattern. Although oncogenic NRAS expression alone was found to be insufficient to promote tumor formation, loss of functional p53 was found to collaborate with NRAS expression in the genesis of melanoma. The tumors derived from these animals are variably pigmented and closely resemble human melanoma. Underscoring the pathological similarities between these tumors and human disease and suggesting that common pathways are similar in these models and human disease, gene set enrichment analysis performed on microarray data found that the upregulated genes from zebrafish melanomas are highly enriched in human tumor samples.

Activating germline mutations of KRAS and HRAS cause severe developmental abnormalities leading to Noonan, cardio-facial-cutaneous, and Costello syndrome, but activating germline mutations of NRAS have not been reported. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is the most common genetic disease of lymphocyte apoptosis and causes autoimmunity as well as excessive lymphocyte accumulation, particularly of CD4(-), CD8(-) alphabeta T cells. Mutations in ALPS typically affect CD95 (Fas/APO-1)-mediated apoptosis, one of the extrinsic death pathways involving TNF receptor superfamily proteins, but certain ALPS individuals have no such mutations. We show here that the salient features of ALPS as well as a predisposition to hematological malignancies can be caused by a heterozygous germline Gly13Asp activating mutation of the NRAS oncogene that does not impair CD95-mediated apoptosis. The increase in active, GTP-bound NRAS augments RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, which markedly decreases the proapoptotic protein BIM and attenuates intrinsic, nonreceptor-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Thus, germline activating mutations in NRAS differ from other p21 Ras oncoproteins by causing selective immune abnormalities without general developmental defects. Our observations on the effects of NRAS activation indicate that RAS-inactivating drugs, such as farnesyltransferase inhibitors should be examined in human autoimmune and lymphocyte homeostasis disorders.",

In melanoma, aberrant neuroblastoma-RAS (NRAS) signaling fuels tumor progression in about 20% of patients. Current therapeutics for NRAS-driven malignancies barely affect overall survival. To date, pathway interference downstream of mutant NRAS seems to be the most promising approach. In this study, data revealed that mutant NRAS induced Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) expression, and pharmacologic inhibition of Plk1 stabilized the size of NRAS mutant melanoma xenografts. The combination of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and Plk1 inhibitors resulted in a significant growth reduction of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro, and regression of xenografted NRAS mutant melanoma in vivo. Independent cell cycle arrest and increased induction of apoptosis underlies the synergistic effect of this combination. Data further suggest that the p53 signaling pathway is of key importance to the observed therapeutic efficacy. This study provides in vitro, in vivo, and first mechanistic data that an MEK/Plk1 inhibitor combination might be a promising treatment approach for patients with NRAS-driven melanoma. As mutant NRAS signaling is similar across different malignancies, this inhibitor combination could also offer a previously unreported treatment modality for NRAS mutant tumors of other cell origins.

Treatment options are dependent on the stage of the disease, the performance status of the patient, and increasingly the molecular makeup of the tumor. In countries with surveillance programs, the incidence rate as well as the mortality rate has gone down because of the earlier stages at which the tumors are detected. For rectal cancer, standard of care differs from that of colon cancer with regard to perioperative treatment. In the metastatic setting, treatment options are uniform for colorectal cancer. Over the years, treatment options have emerged from single-agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment to combination regimens using 5-FU and oxaliplatin or irinotecan or both. Treatment efficacy in the metastatic setting has been increased with the introduction of targeted substances. These include (a) the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor-A (anti-VEGF-A) antibody bevacizumab, (b) the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, (c) the anti-angiogenic multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib, and (d) the anti-angiogenic compound aflibercept. Anti-EGFR antibodies have shown efficacy only in the subpopulations of tumors that do not have any mutation in KRAS and NRAS exon 2, 3, 4. Physicians have the choice in the first line to use anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy based on treatment goals and patient performance.

In this study, the authors tested the prognostic significance and clinicopathologic correlations of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations in patients with metastatic melanoma.;Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively on melanoma patients who were clinically tested for BRAF (exon 15) and NRAS (exons 1 and 2) mutations at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Analyses were performed to identify significant associations of mutations with tumor and patient characteristics and with survival from the diagnosis of stage IV disease.;The genotypes of the full cohort (n = 677) were 47% BRAF mutation, 20% NRAS mutation, and 32% wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (\"WT\"). Tumor mutation status was associated (P = .008) with the risk of central nervous system involvement at the diagnosis of stage IV disease, with a higher prevalence observed in BRAF-mutant (24%) and NRAS-mutant (23%) patients than in WT patients (12%). Among patients with nonuveal melanoma who underwent mutation testing within 6 months of stage IV diagnosis (n = 313), patients with NRAS mutations had a median survival of 8.2 months from stage IV diagnosis, which was shorter than the median survival of WT patients (15.1 months; P = .004). Multivariate analysis of this population incorporating age, sex, metastases (M1) category, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and mutation status confirmed that NRAS mutations are associated independently with decreased overall survival (vs WT; P = .005; hazard ratio, 2.05).;Patients with BRAF or NRAS mutations were more likely than WT patients to have central nervous system involvement at the time they were diagnosed with distant metastatic disease. NRAS mutation status was identified as an independent predictor of shorter survival after a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma.",

Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

We present performance characteristics of a next-generation sequencing assay designed to detect such mutations. In this retrospective quality assessment study, we analyzed mutation detected in the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA genes by a clinically validated next-generation sequencing assay in 310 colorectal cancer specimens. Tumor cellularity and mutant allele frequency were analyzed to identify tumor heterogeneity and mutant allele-specific imbalance. Next-generation sequencing showed precise measurement of mutant allele frequencies and detected 23% of mutations with 2-20% mutant allele frequencies. Of the KRAS mutations detected, 17% were outside of codons 12 and 13. Among PIK3CA mutations, 48% were outside of codons 542, 545, and 1047. The percentage of tumors with predicted resistance to anti-EGFR therapy increased from 40% when testing for only mutations in KRAS exon 2 to 47% when testing for KRAS exons 2-4, 48% when testing for KRAS and NRAS exons 2-4, 58% when including BRAF codon 600 mutations, and 59% when adding PIK3CA exon 20 mutations. Right-sided colorectal cancers carried a higher risk of predicted anti-EGFR resistance. A concomitant KRAS mutation was detected in 51% of PIK3CA, 23% of NRAS, and 33% of kinase-impaired BRAF-mutated tumors. Lower than expected mutant allele frequency indicated tumor heterogeneity, while higher than expected mutant allele frequency indicated mutant allele-specific imbalance. Two paired neuroendocrine carcinomas and adjacent adenomas showed identical KRAS mutations, but only PIK3CA mutations in neuroendocrine carcinomas. Next-generation sequencing is a robust tool for mutation detection in clinical laboratories. It demonstrates high analytic sensitivity and broad reportable range, and it provides simultaneous detection of concomitant mutations and a quantitative measurement of mutant allele frequencies to predict tumor heterogeneity and mutant allele-specific imbalance.

One of the compounds identified, GNF-7, potently and selectively inhibited NRAS-dependent cells in preclinical models of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Mechanistic analysis revealed that its effects were mediated in part through combined inhibition of ACK1/AKT and of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2 (germinal center kinase).

Whereas cells expressing oncogenic N-Ras(G12D) formed cytokine-independent colonies and were hypersensitive to GM-CSF, mutations within the N-Ras hypervariable region induced N-Ras mislocalization and attenuated aberrant progenitor growth.

In contrast, among patients without RAS mutations, there was no difference in RFS or overall survival between the adjuvant UFT group and surgery-alone group. We detected deficient DNA MMR in 23/304 (8%) patients. The MMR status was neither prognostic nor predictive for adjuvant chemotherapy. An interaction analysis showed that there was better RFS among patients treated with UFT with RAS mutations, but not for those without RAS mutations.

We studied 21 patients with 43 synchronous and 2 metachronous adenocarcinomas of the colorectum (n = 20) and stomach (n = 1). Five patients had liver metastases and one had a distant lymph node metastasis. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected tumor tissue. The DNA was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing. Fifty-seven different neoplastic lesions were genotyped, showing 18 (31.6%) KRAS, 2 (3.5%) NRAS, and 7 (12.3%) BRAF mutations, distributed among 10 (47.6%), 1 (4.8%), and 5 (23.8%) of the patients. An identical genotype of all synchronous primary CRCs was found only in 7 (35%) of the patients; the remainder had dissimilar genotypes in various combinations. Interestingly, a single patient had an unknown KRAS genotype (c.37_39dupGGC). Six patients with 13 primary carcinomas had distant metastases. In three of these patients, the metastasis shared the genotype only with one of the primary tumors, because the other primary tumors had another genotype.

Here, we aim to describe novel genetic findings and explain possible mechanisms resulting in the most severe form of neurocutaneous melanocytosis. Detailed histological (biopsy and post-mortem) studies, tissue culture, and high-resolution cytogenetic analysis, including chromosome and array comparative genomic hybridization, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, and Sanger sequencing, were performed on tissues from a white male who succumbed at 17 months of age to congenital melanoma associated with a bathing-trunk nevus. We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the biology of congenital melanocytic proliferations, showing that amplification of mutated NRAS seems to represent a new genetic mechanism leading to melanoma in the context of neurocutaneous melanocytosis.

We systematically reviewed the benefits and harms of EGFR-related pharmacogenetic testing of molecular targets downstream to KRAS in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. We searched five electronic databases from January 2000 through November 2010, and conducted separate grey literature and conference abstracts searches. Two reviewers independently assessed all articles for relevance and quality. We identified 27 studies, primarily fair- to marginal-quality, small retrospective, and single-arm cohort studies with significant overlap in patient populations. We identified seven studies that studied BRAF in independent patient populations, one that studied NRAS, four that studied PIK3CA, eight that studied PTEN expression, and five that studied AKT expression. The best evidence for BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA comes from the largest retrospective study (n=649) of chemorefractory patients from seven European countries. In this study, BRAF mutation was present in 6.5% of KRAS wild-type tumors. Only 8.3% of persons with BRAF mutations, compared to 38% of persons without BRAF mutations (p=0.0012), responded to chemotherapy with cetuximab. Clinical sensitivity and the false positive fraction (1- specificity) were estimated at 9.8% (95% CI 6.3, 14.5) and 1.6% (95% CI 0.2, 5.6), respectively. BRAF mutation was also associated with worse median progression-free survival (absolute difference 18 weeks, p<0.0001), and overall survival (absolute difference 28 weeks, p<0.0001). In the only study comparing outcomes in persons who did (n=227) and did not (n=332) receive cetuximab with combination chemotherapy, those with BRAF mutation had worse survival outcomes regardless of whether or not they received cetuximab. Although NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were also associated with worse outcomes compared to persons without these mutations, evidence is based on a small number of identified mutations. Evidence for protein expression of PTEN and AKT is more sparse and limited by variable methods for assessing protein expression. Low-quality evidence addressing clinical validity of pharmacogenetic testing in metastatic colorectal cancer patients suggests that BRAF mutations are associated with poorer treatment response and survival outcomes, although this association may be independent of treatment with EGFR inhibitors.",

The advent of EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies panitumumab and cetuximab has generated promise for the treatment of mCRC and has largely improved patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). However, treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies is only effective in a subset of mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS. This indicates that there are other factors affecting the efficacy of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Existing studies have demonstrated that among colorectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS, harboring mutations of BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, or PTEN-null may demonstrate resistance to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy, and biomarkers detection can provide better-personalized treatment for mCRC patients. How to identify and reverse the secondary resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy is also another great challenge to improve the anti-EGFR efficacy in wild-type KRAS mCRC patients. Finally, both of the molecular mechanisms of response and acquired resistance would be important for the directions of future research. This review focuses on how to further improve the predictive value of anti-EGFR therapies and how to also try and avoid futile treatment for wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer patients. ",

A number of genetic and epigenetic alterations have been identified in bladder tumorigenesis, including activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and RAS family genes. In this study, we have analysed the mutational spectrum of FGFR3 and RAS genes (HRAS, NRAS and KRAS). We have also studied the relationship between mutations. A total of 234 patients with different stages and grades were included in the present study (58 superficial low-grade, 53 superficial high-grade and 123 muscle-invasive tumours). Mutations in exons 1 and 2 of HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes were screened by PCR and direct sequencing. The hot spot mutations in exons 7, 10 and 15 of the FGFR3 oncogene were studied by multiplex PCR and the SNaP-shot protocol. Overall, 8.97% (21/234) of samples were mutant for one of the RAS genes. Among these mutations 47.61% were detected in KRAS, 33.33% in HRAS and only 19.04% most frequent RAS mutations were KRAS p.G12C and p.G12D. The correlation between RAS mutations and tumour subgroups does not report a statistical significant association (p=0.876). The FGFR3 mutations were detected in 31.19% (73/234) of bladder tumours and were associated with low stages and grades. The study of relationship between RAS and FGFR3 genes revealed that FGFR3 mutations were mutually exclusive with RAS ones (p=10(-4)). In conclusion we retain that activated RAS and FGFR3 do not appear to be drivers in bladder cancer but the mutually exclusive relationship between RAS and FGFR3 mutations indicates a possible clonal advantage of modified signaling via a common pathway.",

Therefore, in recent years the search for new molecules that inhibit these proteins has been intensified. After many years with no new treatments for melanoma, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved vemurafenib. However, many patients have already acquired resistance and have experienced severe side effects. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate a new set of compounds including allylic isothiouronium salts (1, 2 and 3), N-phenyl-substituted analog (4) and isothiosemicarbazide salts (5 and 6) for their potential antimelanoma activity. To this end, viability assay, cell cycle analysis, expression of NRAS and BRAF, as well as migration and invasion assay were performed with different melanoma cell lines. Isothiouronium salts 1-3 presented CC50 (concentration required to reduce the cell number by 50%) in a range of 7-28 μM. Furthermore, salt 1 significantly decreased the expression of NRAS. However, cells incubated with these salts did not disturb the cell cycle phases; instead, an increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed. Regarding potential antiinvasion effects, both 1 and 2 prevented cell migration as well as cell invasion. Finally, when salts 1 and 2 were associated with vemurafenib, a marked decrease in cell viability was observed when compared to the compounds incubated alone. Briefly, the salts exhibited interesting results, especially 1, which decreased the expression of NRAS, increased apoptotic cells and, when combined with vemurafenib, resulted in a synergistic effect. Therefore, we intend to test compound 1 in pre-clinical studies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Molecular analysis of colon cancers currently requires multiphasic testing that uses various assays with different performance characteristics, adding cost and time to patient care. We have developed a single, next-generation sequencing assay to simultaneously evaluate colorectal cancers for mutations in relevant cancer genes (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) and for tumor microsatellite instability (MSI). In a sample set of 61 cases, the assay demonstrated overall sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% for identifying cancer-associated mutations, with a practical limit of detection at 2% mutant allele fraction. MSIplus was 97% sensitive (34 of 35 MSI-positive cases) and 100% specific (42 of 42 MSI-negative cases) for ascertaining MSI phenotype in a cohort of 78 tumor specimens. These performance characteristics were slightly better than for conventional multiplex PCR MSI testing (97% sensitivity and 95% specificity), which is based on comparison of microsatellite loci amplified from tumor and matched normal material, applied to the same specimen cohort. Because the assay uses an amplicon sequencing approach, it is rapid and appropriate for specimens with limited available material or fragmented DNA. This integrated testing strategy offers several advantages over existing methods, including a lack of need for matched normal material, sensitive and unbiased detection of variants in target genes, and an automated analysis pipeline enabling principled and reproducible identification of cancer-associated mutations and MSI status simultaneously.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

Most prevalent in colorectal cancer are KRAS exon 2 mutations (40% prevalence); lower prevalence is observed for KRAS exon 3 and 4 mutations (6%) and NRAS exon 2, 3, and 4 mutations (5%). The Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Test on the molecular diagnostics Idylla™ platform is a simple (<2 minutes hands-on time), highly reliable, and rapid (approximately 2 hours turnaround time) in vitro diagnostic sample-to-result solution. This test enables qualitative detection of 21 mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146 of the KRAS oncogene being clinically relevant according to the latest clinical guidelines. Here, the performance of the Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay, for Research Use Only, was assessed on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections by comparing its results with the results previously obtained by routine reference approaches for KRAS genotyping. In case of discordance, samples were assessed further by additional methods. Among the 374 colorectal cancer FFPE samples tested, the overall concordance between the Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay and the confirmed reference routine test results was found to be 98.9%. The Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay enabled detection of 5 additional KRAS-mutated samples not detected previously with reference methods. As conclusion the Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Test can be applied as routine tool in any clinical setting, without needing molecular infrastructure or expertise, to guide the personalized treatment of colorectal cancer patients.",

A variety of small molecule inhibitors as well as their combinations was tested in order to find beneficial inhibitory modalities in NRASQ61mutant lung cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines.

Our study provides evidence that NRAS mutant cancers share signaling similarities across different malignancies. We demonstrate that dual pathway inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway synergistically reduces cell viability in NRAS mutant cancers regardless of their tissue origin.

We found that α-Mangostin significantly enhances Sorafenib pharmacological efficacy against an NRAS mutant melanoma cell line. The synergistic effects of α-Mangostin and Sorafenib were associated with enhanced inhibition of activated AKT and ERK, induced ER stress, and reduced autophagy, eventually leading to apoptosis. The structure of α-Mangostin resembles several inhibitors of the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). MITF expression, which is regulated by RXR, was modulated by α-Mangostin. Molecular docking revealed that α-Mangostin can be accommodated by the ligand binding pocket of RXR and may thereby compete with RXR-mediated control of MITF expression.

Melanomas from both groups of bigenic RXRα(ep-/-) mice are larger in size with higher proliferative capacity, and exhibit enhanced angiogenic properties and increased expression of malignant melanoma markers. Analysis of tumor adjacent normal skin from these mice revealed altered expression of several biomarkers indicative of enhanced melanoma susceptibility, including reduced expression of tumor suppressor p53 and loss of PTEN, with concomitant increase in activated AKT. Loss of epidermal RXRα in combination with UVB significantly enhances invasion of melanocytic cells to draining lymph nodes in bigenic mice expressing oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) compared with controls with functional RXRα.

Beyond standard diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, such as those used for Lynch syndrome, mutations in KRAS exon 2 are well established as predictive for lack of response to the antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapies panitumumab and cetuximab. Recent studies have extended these findings by demonstrating that mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4 and in NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 (with all KRAS and NRAS mutations collectively referred to as RAS) are also predictive for treatment outcomes among patients with mCRC receiving panitumumab and cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy. Consequently, evaluation of these additional loci has been incorporated into current clinical guidelines, and pathologists will need to develop testing procedures and algorithms to reliably and rapidly evaluate RAS status. With the increased number of mutations that must be examined to evaluate the status of RAS and other emerging biomarkers, next-generation sequencing technologies are likely to become increasingly important in mCRC testing. This review describes new considerations for pathologists that have arisen as a consequence of the incorporation of additional biomarker testing into clinical practice for mCRC. ",

The morphological steps in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence have been elucidated at a molecular level, which has been facilitated by identification of the genes responsible for familial intestinal cancer. However, apart from early detection of familial forms of CRC and its use in genetic counseling, until recently such detailed molecular knowledge has had little impact on clinical management of the disease. This has dramatically changed in the last decade. With drugs specifically targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) having been shown effective in CRC, mechanisms responsible for resistance have been explored. The finding that KRAS mutated cancers do not respond to anti-EGFR treatment has had a profound impact on clinical management and on molecular diagnostics of CRC. Additional genetic tests for mutations in NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA contribute to determining who to treat, and others will follow. New therapies effective in patients with advanced CRC are under investigation. Remaining burning questions for optimal management are which patients will relapse after resection of the primary tumor and which patients will respond to the standard 5FU-oxaliplatin adjuvant treatment regimen. Predictive tests to address these issues are eagerly awaited. New classifications of CRC, based on molecular parameters, are emerging, and we will be confronted with new subtypes of CRC, for which the definition is based on combinations of gene expression patterns, chromosomal alterations, gene mutations and epigenetic characteristics. This will be instrumental in designing new approaches for therapy but will also be translated into molecular diagnostics. Both will contribute to improved clinical management of CRC. ",

At present, testing for specific mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of KRAS and NRAS has become accepted practice to select patients for treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents. Additionally, testing for the BRAF V600E mutation is used to refine decisions based on patient prognosis. The presence of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) *28 polymorphism is associated with toxicity from irinotecan, although it has not been universally applied. Nonetheless, molecular markers to predict response and toxicity of cytotoxic therapy are evolving. While the development of selection biomarkers for anti-angiogenic treatments has not proved fruitful to date, improved development strategies and novel targeted agents are anticipated to revolutionize the approach to treatment of advanced CRC in the near future.

However, pooled analysis of randomized controlled studies in Western countries in patients treated with cetuximab has suggested that patients with tumors showing the KRAS p.

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple genetic alterations have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Research has been mainly focused on driver mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PI3K. However, recent evidence suggests a crucial role for non-genetic mechanisms in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Specifically, the HER3 receptor is capable of heterodimerizing with multiple EGFR family members resulting in downstream activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Monoclonal antibodies targeted against the HER3 receptor are being investigated in clinical trials; however, preliminary data has shown limited clinical activity. Thus, given the relevance of the HER3 receptor in activating downstream effector pathways and in conferring resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, the therapeutic targeting of HER3 in combination with primary drivers of the tumor is also being investigated. Here, we review the role of HER3 as a promoter of clinical resistance to EGFR therapy and discuss therapeutic approaches that could potentially overcome this resistance. ",

To unravel the role of microRNAs (miRs) during malignancy, we analyzed miR expression in 77 primary breast carcinomas and identified 16 relapse-associated miRs that correlate with survival and/or distinguish tumor subtypes in different datasets. Among them, miR-148b, down-regulated in aggressive breast tumors, was found to be a major coordinator of malignancy. In fact, it is able to oppose various steps of tumor progression when overexpressed in cell lines by influencing invasion, survival to anoikis, extravasation, lung metastasis formation, and chemotherapy response. miR-148b controls malignancy by coordinating a novel pathway involving over 130 genes and, in particular, it directly targets players of the integrin signaling, such as ITGA5, ROCK1, PIK3CA/p110α, and NRAS, as well as CSF1, a growth factor for stroma cells. Our findings reveal the importance of the identified 16 miRs for disease outcome predictions and suggest a critical role for miR-148b in the control of breast cancer progression.",

The intention here is to provide a synopsis of current progress in this developing area by reviewing existing publications and ongoing clinical trials. While bevacizumab plus anti-EGFR agents exhibit detrimental effects in first-line setting , a combination of bevacizumab with erlotinib has been suggested as an effective maintenance therapy. Dabrafenib plus panitumumab in combination with trametinib and encorafenib plus cetuximab in combination with alpelisib, are very promising combination treatments and are currently being developed in clinical trials for patients with BRAF mutant-type tumors. An earlier nonclinical trial suggested that a combination of panitumumab plus trametinib was effective in patients who were resistant to anti- EGFR agents but developing KRAS- or NRAS-mutated tumors. The HERACLES trial further indicated that a combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib showed promising antitumor effects in patients with emerging HER2 amplification. Other reports suggest that irinotecan and cetuximab in combination with tivantinib were more effective than a combination of irinotecan and cetuximab alone for patients with MET amplification, although further research is needed for this application, as results were based upon the analysis of subgroups. It is clear that data arising from both primary research and clinical trials support the combined use of molecular-targeted drugs in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. As clinical trials progress, it is likely that such treatment combinations will become recognized as standard therapies. ",

All patients underwent a baseline (18)F-FDG PET/CT within a median time interval of 27 days of tumour tissue sampling, which was performed before any treatment. Standardized uptake values (SUVs), volume-based parameters and texture analysis were studied. We retrospectively performed KRAS genotyping on codons 12, 13, 61, 117 and 146, NRAS genotyping on codons 12, 13 and 61 and BRAF on codon 600. Associations between PET/CT parameters and the mutational status were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis.;83 (55%) patients had an RAS mutation: 74 KRAS and 9 NRAS, while 68 patients had no mutation (wild-type tumours). No patient had BRAF mutation. First-order features based on intensity histogram analysis were significantly associated with RAS mutations: maximum SUV (SUVmax) (p-value = 0.002), mean SUV (p-value = 0.006), skewness (p-value = 0.049), SUV standard deviation (p-value = 0.001) and SUV coefficient of variation (SUVcov) (p-value = 0.001). Both SUVcov and SUVmax showed an area under the curve of 0.65 with sensitivity of 56% and 69%, respectively, and specificity of 64% and 52%, respectively. None of the volume-based (metabolic tumour volume and total lesion glycolysis), nor local or regional textural features were associated with the presence of RAS mutations.;Although rectal cancers with KRAS or NRAS mutations display a significantly higher glucose metabolism than wild-type cancers, the accuracy of the currently proposed quantitative metrics extracted from (18)F-FDG PET/CT is not sufficiently high for playing a meaningful clinical role.;RAS-mutated rectal cancers have a significantly higher glucose metabolism.

Twenty patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts were then treated with TAK-733 in vivo. Tumor growth inhibition index (TGII) was assessed to evaluate the sensitivity of the CRC explants to TAK-733 while linear regression was utilized to investigate the predictive effects of genotype on the TGII of explants.;Fifty-four CRC cell lines were exposed to TAK-733, while 42 cell lines were deemed sensitive across a broad range of mutations. Eighty-two percent of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutant, whereas 80% of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were PIK3CA WT. Twenty patient-derived human tumor CRC explants were then treated with TAK-733. In total, 15 primary human tumor explants were found to be sensitive to TAK-733 (TGII ≤ 20%), including 9 primary human tumor explants that exhibited tumor regression (TGII > 100%). Explants with a BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutant and PIK3CA wild-type genotype demonstrated increased sensitivity to TAK-733 with a median TGII of -6%.

Initial data suggested EGFR-targeted mAb treatment should be limited to patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type (WT) tumours, but the availability of tumour samples from large phase III studies permitted evaluation of additional potential biomarkers of activity for these agents. Subsequent analyses further refined the target population to those patients whose tumours were WT for KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 (i.e., those with RAS WT status). Here, we review key clinical data for panitumumab in mCRC across the lines of treatment, assessing in detail the impact of more comprehensive RAS selection on patient outcomes.

In the extended analysis of RAS wild-type tumours (n=87), objective response was significantly improved by addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4 (58% versus 29%; odds ratio 3.33 [95% confidence interval 1.36-8.17]; P=0.0084); although limited by population size, there also appeared to be trends favouring the cetuximab arm in terms of PFS and overall survival in the RAS wild-type group compared with the RAS evaluable group. There was no evidence that patients with other RAS mutations benefited from cetuximab, but small numbers precluded precise estimations of treatment effects. In the combined population of patients with any RAS mutation (KRAS exon 2 or other RAS), a clear detrimental effect was associated with addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4.;Patients with RAS-mutant mCRC, as defined by mutations in KRAS and NRAS exons 2-4, derive no benefit and may be harmed by the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4. Restricting cetuximab administration to patients with RAS wild-type tumours will further tailor therapy to maximise benefit.",

The exon 9 reverse PCR primer was designed to avoid amplifying a pseudogene in chromosome 22 that has >95% homology with exons 9 through 13 in PIK3CA. Two hundred colorectal cancers from FFPE tissue previously characterized for KRAS mutation status were evaluated for PIK3CA mutations. In KRAS-mutated samples, 20% had an additional mutation in PIK3CA. The mutation rate in KRAS wild-type samples was 7.5%. When using our assay, pseudogene was not observed in any of these samples. In addition, pseudogene- and gene-specific amplification was performed on DNA from 40 additional colorectal cancers. Sequencing of these PCR products yielded the expected gene or pseudogene sequence in all cases.

Here we explored the role of BRAF and NRAS mutations in influencing the immune phenotype based on a classification previously identified by our group.;One-hundred-thirteen melanoma metastases underwent microarray analysis and BRAF and NRAS genotyping.

When testing gene lists discriminative of BRAF, NRAS and MAPK alterations, we found that 112 BRAF-specific transcripts were able to distinguish the two immune-related phenotypes already described in melanoma, with the poor phenotype associated mostly with BRAF mutation. Noteworthy, such association was stronger in samples displaying low BRAF mRNA expression.

It is recommended that both NRAS and KRAS mutation testing to be performed before a CRC is considered RAS wild-type. Given that mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been shown to be sensitive and specific for the detection of NRAS mutations in melanoma, we assessed the specificity of NRAS mutation-specific IHC in CRC. IHC was performed on tissue microarrays containing 2823 consecutive CRC undergoing surgery with curative intent using a novel mutation-specific antibody to the protein produced by the NRAS mutation (clone SP174). Tissue microarrays were assessed by 2 observers and all IHC-positive or equivocal cases were repeated on whole sections to confirm the result. Positive cases then underwent molecular testing by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight polymerase chain reaction. In total, 22 of 2823 (0.8%) CRCs demonstrated confirmed positive staining with complete interobserver concordance. RAS mutations were confirmed in all IHC-positive CRCs. In total, 11 cases harbored the NRASQ61R mutation. Surprisingly, 11 cases demonstrated the KRASQ61R mutation. We conclude that mutation-specific IHC with this currently available NRASQ61R antibody is highly specific for the presence of either NRASQ61R or KRASQ61R mutations in CRC. We caution that we did not assess the sensitivity of IHC and that this antibody does not detect other RAS mutations. Therefore, negative staining does not exclude a clinically significant RAS mutation.

The importance of RAS signaling as a potential target in cancer is emphasized not only by the prevalence of RAS mutations, but also by the high number of RAS activators and effectors identified in mammalian cells that places the RAS proteins at the crossroads of several, important signaling networks. Ras proteins are crucial crossroads of signaling pathways that link the activation of cell surface receptors with a wide variety of cellular processes leading to the control of proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Furthermore, oncogenic ras proteins interfere with metabolism of tumor cells, microenvironment's remodeling, evasion of the immune response, and finally contributes to the metastatic process. After 40 years of basic, translational and clinical research, much is now known about the molecular mechanisms by which these monomeric guanosine triphosphatase-binding proteins promote cellular malignancy, and it is clear that they regulate signaling pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival, and invasiveness.

Surgical experience has clarified that in this setting pneumonectomy should only be performed in carefully selected patients showing favorable prognostic profiles (defined by low carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels pre-thoracotomy), solitary and completely resectable pulmonary metastasis, and long disease-free intervals. In the few long-term survivors after pneumonectomy for late-recurrent colorectal cancer, the disease has a relatively indolent metastatic course and genetic and epigenetic profiling may provide further insight regarding tumor evolution.;We describe a rare case of late hilar-endobronchial and lymph nodal recurrence of rectal cancer, sequential to hepatic metastasectomy, that we successfully treated with pneumonectomy and chemotherapy (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin regimen); the patient achieved 7-year relapse-free survival after lung metastasectomy and 24-year overall survival after primary rectal cancer resection. To our knowledge, this is the longest survival reported after sequential liver resection and pneumonectomy for recurrent colorectal cancer. In our case the primary rectal cancer and its recurrences showed identical immunohistochemical patterns. The primary rectal cancer and the matched metastases (hepatic, pulmonary and lymph nodal) demonstrated no KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, a microsatellite stable phenotype, and no tumor protein p53 alterations or recurrent copy number alterations on chromosome 8. High genetic concordances between the paired primary tumor and metastases suggest that the key tumor biological traits remained relatively conserved in the three metastatic sites. Minor differences in gene specific hypermethylation were observed between the primary tumor and lung and nodal metastases. These differences suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may be causally involved in the microenvironmental regulation of cancer metastasis.;The exceptionally long survival of the patient in our case study involving favorable clinical features was related to an excellent response to surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; however, genetic or epigenetic factors that remain unidentified cannot be excluded as contributory factors. Our findings support the concept of a common clonal origin of the primary cancer and synchronous and late metastases, and suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may regulate tumor dormancy mechanisms.",

By contrast, the addition of anti-EGFR therapy to the treatment regime of resistant patients may lead to worse progression-free survival and overall survival. Therefore, identifying sensitive and resistant patients prior to targeted therapy of metastatic colorecal cancer is a key point during the initial decision making process. Previous research shows that primary resistance to EGFR blockade is in most cases caused by constitutive activation of signaling pathways downstream of EGFR. Of all relevant factors (mutation of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressors PTEN and TP53, amplification of EGFR and HER2, and expression of epiregulin and amphiregulin, mikroRNA miR-31-3p, and miR-31-5p), only evaluation of KRAS and NRAS mutations has entered routine clinical practice. The role of the other markers still needs to be validated. The ongoing benefit of anti-EGFR therapy could be indicated by specific clinical parameters measured after the initiation of targeted therapy, including early tumor shrinkage, the deepness of the response, or hypomagnesemia. The accuracy of predictive dia-gnostic tools could be also increased by examining a combination of predictive markers using next generation sequencing methods. However, unjustified investigation of many molecular markers should be resisted as this may complicate interpretation of the results, particularly in terms of their specific clinical relevance.;The aim of this review is to describe current possibilities with respect to predicting responses to EGFR blockade in the context of the EGFR pathway, and the utilization of such results in routine clinical practice.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer mortality in Western countries, mostly due to metastasis. Understanding the natural history and prognostic factors in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is essential for the optimal design of clinical trials. The main prognostic factors currently used in clinical practice are related to tumor behavior (e.g., white blood counts, levels of lactate dehydrogenase, levels of alkaline phosphatase) disease extension (e.g., presence of extrahepatic spread, number of organs affected) and general functional status (e.g., performance status as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). However, these parameters are not always sufficient to establish appropriate therapeutic strategies. First-line therapy in mCRC combines conventional chemotherapy (CHT) (e.g., FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, CAPOX) with a number of agents targeted to specific signaling pathways (TA) (e.g., panitumumab and cetuximab for cases KRAS/NRAS WT, and bevacizumab). Although the response rate to this combination regime exceeds 50%, progression of the disease is almost universal and only less than 10% of patients are free of disease at 2 years. Current clinical trials with second and third line therapy include new TA, such as tyrosin-kinase receptors inhibitors (MET, HER2, IGF-1R), inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, PI3K, AKT, mTORC, NOTCH and JAK1/JAK2, immunotherapy modulators and check point inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 and anti- PD1). Despite the identification of multiple prognostic and predictive biomarkers and signatures, it is still unclear how expression of many of these biomarkers is modulated by CHT and/or TA, thus potentially affecting response to treatment. In this review we analyzed how certain biomarkers in tumor cells and microenvironment influence the response to new TA and immune-therapies strategies in mCRC pre-treated patients. ",

Genome-wide analyses of SVs in large sample series with well-documented clinical information are still scarce. Consequently, the impact of SVs on carcinogenesis and patient outcome remains poorly understood. This study aimed to perform a systematic analysis of genes that are affected by CNA-associated chromosomal breaks in colorectal cancer (CRC) and to determine the clinical relevance of recurrent breakpoint genes.;Primary CRC samples of patients with metastatic disease from CAIRO and CAIRO2 clinical trials were previously characterized by array-comparative genomic hybridization. These data were now used to determine the prevalence of CNA-associated chromosomal breaks within genes across 352 CRC samples. In addition, mutation status of the commonly affected APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, SMAD4, BRAF and NRAS genes was determined for 204 CRC samples by targeted massive parallel sequencing. Clinical relevance was assessed upon stratification of patients based on gene mutations and gene breakpoints that were observed in >3% of CRC cases.;In total, 748 genes were identified that were recurrently affected by chromosomal breaks (FDR <0.1). MACROD2 was affected in 41% of CRC samples and another 169 genes showed breakpoints in >3% of cases, indicating that prevalence of gene breakpoints is comparable to the prevalence of well-known gene point mutations. Patient stratification based on gene breakpoints and point mutations revealed one CRC subtype with very poor prognosis.;We conclude that CNA-associated chromosomal breaks within genes represent a highly prevalent and clinically relevant subset of SVs in CRC.",

Deep targeted genotyping was done using a semiconductor-based sequencing platform and a self-designed panel of 30 CRC-related genes. Additionally, microsatellite status (MS) was determined. Ninety-seven percent of tumor samples were suitable for sequencing and in 88% MS could be assessed. The minimal drop-out rates of 6 and 25 cases, respectively were due to too low amounts or heavy degradation of DNA. Of 557 nonsynonymous mutations, 90 (16%) have not been described in COSMIC at the time of data query. Forty-three cases (22%) had double- or triple mutations affecting a single gene. Sixty-four percent had genetic alterations influencing oncological therapy. Eight percent of patients (MSI phenotype: 6%; mutated POLE: 2%) were potentially eligible for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Of 56% of KRASwt CRC that potentially qualified for anti-EGFR treatment, 30% presented with mutations in BRAF/NRAS. Mutated PIK3CA was detected in 21%.

However, the specific functions of these pathways in AML are unclear, thwarting the rational application of targeted therapeutics. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we used a murine model that harbors Mll-AF9 and a tetracycline-repressible, activated NRAS (NRAS(G12V)). Using computational approaches to explore our gene-expression data sets, we found that NRAS(G12V) enforced the leukemia self-renewal gene-expression signature and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9- and Myb-dependent leukemia self-renewal gene-expression program. NRAS(G12V) was required for leukemia self-renewal independent of its effects on growth and survival. Analysis of the gene-expression patterns of leukemic subpopulations revealed that the NRAS(G12V)-mediated leukemia self-renewal signature is preferentially expressed in the leukemia stem cell-enriched subpopulation. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling, Mac-1(Low) cells, which harbor leukemia stem cells, were preferentially sensitive to NRAS(G12V) withdrawal. NRAS(G12V) maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies. Together, these experimental results define a RAS oncogene-driven function that is critical for leukemia maintenance and represents a novel mechanism of oncogene addiction. ",

Significant differences in BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency were found: 14/16 (87.5%) in common acquired naevi (CANs), 9/12 (75%) in CMs, 0/26 in Spitz naevi and 3/25 (12%) in blue naevi (p < 0.01). We looked at whether Spitz and blue naevi showed a compensatory increase in BRAF exon 11 and/or NRAS exons 1 and 2 mutations to account for the low BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency.

The monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab, directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), undoubtedly represent a major step forward in the treatment of mCRC, given the relevant efficacy in terms of progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, and quality of life observed in several phase III clinical trials among different lines of treatment. However, the anti-EGFR moAbs were shown only to be effective in a subset of patients. For instance, KRAS and NRAS mutations have been identified as biomarkers of resistance to these drugs, improving the selection of patients who might derive a benefit from these treatments. Nevertheless, several other alterations might affect the response to these drugs, and unfortunately, even the responders eventually become resistant by developing secondary (or acquired) resistance in approximately 13-18 mo. Several studies highlighted that the landscape of responsible alterations of both primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR drugs biochemically converge into MEK-ERK and PIK3CA-AKT pathways.

Mutations in RAS genes (KRAS/NRAS exons 2, 3, or 4) predict a lack of clinical benefit when anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are added to chemotherapy. Genetic events in additional nodes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways that bypass EGFR signaling, such as BRAF or PIK3CA mutations or KRAS, ERBB2, or MET amplifications, also may confer resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab. Polymorphisms that block antibody binding as a result of EGFR extracellular domain mutations have been reported. Nongenetic mechanisms, including compensatory activation of receptor tyrosine kinases HER3 and MET, together with high expression of the ligands amphiregulin, transforming growth factor alpha heregulin, and hepatocyte growth factor in the tumor microenvironment also are thought to be involved in resistance. In one-third of the samples, more than one genetic event can be found, and nongenetic events most likely coexist with gene alterations. Furthermore, activation of a gene expression signature of epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been associated with reduced cellular dependence on EGFR signaling. Collectively, this body of work provides convincing evidence that the molecular heterogeneity of CRC plays an important role in the context of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Herein, we discuss how this knowledge has been translated into drug development strategies to overcome primary and acquired anti-EGFR resistance, with rational combinations of targeted agents in genomically selected populations, second-generation EGFR inhibitors, and other agents expected to boost the immune response at the tumor site.

Patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC) have excellent survival, however two-thirds develop recurrences. Tumor specific mutations can be used to detect recurrences in urine assays, presenting a more patient-friendly diagnostic procedure than cystoscopy.;To address these issues, we developed a mutation assay for the simultaneous detection of 19 possible mutations in the HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes. With this assay and mutation assays for the FGFR3 and PIK3CA oncogenes, we screened primary bladder tumors of 257 patients and 184 recurrences from 54 patients. Additionally, in primary tumors p53 expression was obtained by immunohistochemistry. Of primary tumors 64% were mutant for FGFR3, 11% for RAS, 24% for PIK3CA, and 26% for p53. FGFR3 mutations were mutually exclusive with RAS mutations (p = 0.001) and co-occurred with PIK3CA mutations (p = 0.016).

This inspires the effort to reverse this resistance or to uncover new vulnerabilities in such resistant cancers.

We have tested a battery of melanoma and colon carcinoma cell lines that carry mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KRAS genes and have observed that those with NRAS and KRAS mutations are more sensitive to killing by IPA3. Genetic manipulations suggest that the differential response depends not just on these oncogenes, but also on additional events that were co-selected during tumor evolution. Furthermore, sublethal doses of IPA3 or ectopic expression of dominant-negative PAK1 sensitized Ras-mutated cells to GDC-0897 and AZD6244, which otherwise have reduced efficiency against cells with activated Ras. Dominant-negative PAK1 also reduced the growth of NRAS-mutated cells in confluent cultures, but, unlike IPA3, caused no significant toxicity. Although it remains to be proven that all the effects of IPA3 are exclusively due to inhibition of PAK1, our findings point to the existence of selective vulnerabilities, which are associated with Ras mutations and could be useful for better understanding and treatment of a large subset of tumors.",

Our clinical application of broad-based mutational profiling for patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal malignancy has led to the novel discovery of mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in tumors from a subset of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 287 tumors from gastrointestinal cancer patients (biliary tract, colorectal, gastroesophageal, liver, pancreatic, and small intestine carcinoma) were tested during routine clinical evaluation for 130 site-specific mutations within 15 cancer genes. Mutations were identified within a number of genes, including KRAS (35%), TP53 (22%), PIK3CA (10%), BRAF (7%), APC (6%), NRAS (3%), AKT1 (1%), CTNNB1 (1%), and PTEN (1%). Although mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 were rare in the other common gastrointestinal malignancies in this series (2%), they were found in three tumors (25%) of an initial series of 12 biliary tract carcinomas. To better define IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status, an additional 75 gallbladder and bile duct cancers were examined. Combining these cohorts of biliary cancers, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found only in cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (nine of 40, 23%) and in none of the 22 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and none of the 25 gallbladder carcinomas. In an analysis of frozen tissue specimens, IDH1 mutation was associated with highly elevated tissue levels of the enzymatic product 2-hydroxyglutarate. Thus, IDH1 mutation is a molecular feature of cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin. These findings define a specific metabolic abnormality in this largely incurable type of gastrointestinal cancer and present a potentially new target for therapy.",

Genotoxic agent diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatic cancer model was induced in male mice and recorded the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma by morphological and histological changes in the liver. It was observed that mRNA expressions of IQGAP1, Hras, Kras, Nras, Mras, Caspase3, and BAX genes were highly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma cells when compared with normal liver cells, additionally their expressions increased by concentrating the dose of DEN. While, the expressions of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 were significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma cells when compared with normal liver cells, as well as their expressions decreased more with increasing the dose of DEN.

The 3 patients that did not complete follow-up were censored from the study. KRAS and NRAS were analyzed using allele-specific PCR primers and pyrosequencing in exons 2, 3 and 4. Multivariate survival analysis using Cox's regression model was used for affecting of variables on overall survival (OS). The mean age at diagnosis for patients was 57.7 (range, 18 to 80 years) and 61.4% were male. There was no significant different between prognostic factors and KRAS mutation with wild-type. Also, There was no significant different between KRAS mutation and KRAS wild-type for survival, but there was a significant different between KRAS 12 and 13 mutations for survival (HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.66, P=0.01). In conclusion, the prevalence of KRAS mutations in CRC patients was below 50% but higher than in other studies in Iran.

The growth of small polyps (6-9 mm) that were first identified during routine screening of patients was monitored over time by interval imaging with CT colonography. Mutations in these lesions with known growth rates were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing. The timing of mutational events was estimated using computer modelling and statistical inference considering several parameters including allele frequency and fitness.;The mutational landscape of small polyps is varied both within individual polyps and among the group as a whole but no single alteration was correlated with growth behaviour. Polyps carried 0-3 pathogenic mutations with the most frequent being in APC, KRAS/NRAS, BRAF, FBXW7 and TP53. In polyps with two or more pathogenic mutations, allele frequencies were often variable, indicating the presence of multiple populations within a single tumour. Based on computer modelling, detectable mutations occurred at a mean polyp size of 30±35 crypts, well before the tumour is of a clinically detectable size.;These data indicate that small colon polyps can have multiple pathogenic mutations in crucial driver genes that arise early in the existence of a tumour. Understanding the molecular pathway of tumourigenesis and clonal evolution in polyps that are at risk for progressing to invasive cancers will allow us to begin to better predict which polyps are more likely to progress into adenocarcinomas and which patients are at greater risk of developing advanced disease.",

However, the role of palmitoylation in KRAS4A tumorigenesis is not clear.;The expression of KRAS4A in KRAS-mutated leukemia cell lines and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were checked using western blotting and reverse transcriptions-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis, respectively.

The activation of the RAS downstream signaling pathways and the membrane localizations of the KRAS4A and its mutants were analyzed via western blot analysis and confocal microscopy, respectively.;We show here that KRAS4A is expressed in human leukemia cell lines and in AML cells harboring KRAS mutations and that mutation at the palmitoylation site of oncogenic KRAS4A significantly abrogates its leukemogenic potential. However, unlike NRAS, palmitoylation-defective KRAS4A still induces leukemia in mice, albeit with a much longer latency. Using NRAS/KRAS4A chimeric constructs, we found that the KIKK motif of KRAS4A contributes to the transforming activity of KRAS4A.

Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases.

Despite these agents have paved the way to individualized therapy, our understanding why some patients respond to treatment whereas others do not remain poor. The realization that detection of positive EGFR expression by IHC does not reliably predict clinical outcome of EGFR-targeted treatment has led to an intense search for alternative predictive biomarkers. Data derived from multiple phase III trials have indicated that KRAS mutations can be considered a highly specific negative biomarker of benefit to anti-EGFR mAbs. Oncologists are now facing emerging issues in the treatment of metastatic CRC, including the identification of additional genetic determinants of primary resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy for further improving selection of patients, the explanation of rare cases of patients carrying KRAS-mutated tumours who have been reported to respond to cetuximab and panitumumab and the discovery of mechanisms of secondary resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. Current data suggest that, together with KRAS mutations, the evaluation of EGFR gene copy number (GCN), BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA mutations or loss of PTEN expression could also be useful for selecting patients with reduced chance to benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs. This review aims to provide an updated of the most recent data on predictive and prognostic biomarkers within the EGFR pathway, the challenges this emerging field presents and the future role of these molecular markers in CRC treatment.",

Since approaches to directly target mutant Ras have not been successful, most efforts have focused on indirect approaches to block Ras membrane association or downstream effector signaling. While inhibitors of effector signaling are currently under clinical evaluation, genome-wide unbiased genetic screens have identified novel directions for future anti-Ras drug discovery.",

Despite wide expression of EGFR, only a subgroup of cancer patients responds to cetuximab therapy. In the present study we assessed the cetuximab response in vivo of 79 human patient-derived xenografts originating from five tumour histotypes. We analysed basic tumour characteristics including EGFR expression and activation, mutational status of KRAS, BRAF and NRAS, the expression of EGFR ligands and the activation of HER3 (ErbB3) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET. Based on these results, a cetuximab response score including positive and negative factors affecting therapeutic response is proposed. Positive factors are high expression and activation of EGFR and its ligands epiregulin or amphiregulin, negative factors are markers for downstream pathway activation independent of EGFR. In cetuximab resistant NSCL adenocarcinoma LXFA 526 and LXFA 1647, overexpression due to gene amplification and strong activation of MET was identified. Knock-down of MET by siRNA in the corresponding cell lines showed that anchorage-independent growth and migration are dependent on MET. MET knock down sensitized LXFA 526L and LXFA 1647L to EGF. Combined treatments of a MET inhibitor and cetuximab were additive. Therefore, combination therapy of cetuximab and a MET inhibitor in selected lung cancer patients could be of high clinical significance.",

Molecular alterations in these pathways are implicated in tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways are known to interact with each other at several nodes, and mounting evidence suggests that dual blockade of both pathways may be required to achieve anticancer effects in certain contexts. This may include tumor types with a high frequency of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway activation, or situations in which dual pathway strategies may be required to overcome resistance to current targeted therapies. Several clinical studies are currently evaluating the combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors in a variety of different cancers with certain types of molecular alterations. This review will summarize existing knowledge of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways, the cross-talk between them, and the current generation of PI3K and MEK inhibitors that target them. The preclinical rationale for dual pathway inhibition will be discussed within the context of the major tumor types currently being explored in ongoing clinical trials, namely malignant melanoma with BRAF or NRAS mutations, and colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and basal-like breast cancers.

We suggest a new approach to trial design that links novel treatment evaluation with the concurrent evaluation of a biomarker within a confirmatory phase II/III trial setting. We describe a new protocol using this approach in advanced colorectal cancer called FOCUS4. The protocol will ultimately answer three research questions for a number of treatments and biomarkers: (1) After a period of first-line chemotherapy, do targeted novel therapies provide signals of activity in different biomarker-defined populations? (2) If so, do these definitively improve outcomes? (3) Is evidence of activity restricted to the biomarker-defined groups? The protocol randomizes novel agents against placebo concurrently across a number of different biomarker-defined population-enriched cohorts: BRAF mutation; activated AKT pathway: PI3K mutation/absolute PTEN loss tumors; KRAS and NRAS mutations; and wild type at all the mentioned genes. Within each biomarker-defined population, the trial uses a multistaged approach with flexibility to adapt in response to planned interim analyses for lack of activity. FOCUS4 is the first test of a protocol that assigns all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to one of a number of parallel population-enriched, biomarker-stratified randomized trials. Using this approach allows questions regarding efficacy and safety of multiple novel therapies to be answered in a relatively quick and efficient manner, while also allowing for the assessment of biomarkers to help target treatment.

As pancreatic cancer is critically dependent upon Ras signaling, we tested and now report that loss of Hras increases tumor load and reduces survival in an oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse model. These effects were traced to the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that wild-type Hras may suppress tumor initiation. In normal cells, activated Ras can suppress proliferation through p53-dependent mechanisms. We find that the tumor suppressive effects of Hras are nullified in a homozygous mutant p53 background. As such, loss of wild-type Hras fosters the earliest stages of pancreatic cancer in a p53-dependent manner. ",

We describe a novel EGFR exon 12 mutation acquired in tumors of 1 out of 3 patients treated with panitumumab. The EGFR G465R mutation introduces a positive charge within the overlap of the panitumumab and cetuximab epitopes. It abrogates antibody binding and mediates cross-resistance to both antibodies in EGFR G465R-transfected Ba/F3 cells. In circulating tumor DNA from an independent \"liquid biopsy\" cohort of 27 patients, we found this novel mutation in 1 out of 6 panitumumab-treated cases while about one third of patients show acquired RAS mutations. We show that acquired resistance by epitope-changing mutations also emerges during panitumumab treatment, which can be easily detected by a liquid biopsy approach even before clinical resistance occurs and this may help in tailoring EGFR-targeted therapies.

Somatic mutations (single-nucleotide variants and short insertion/deletions) were obtained and filtered and then searched for recurrently mutated genes and pathways.;An excess of C-to-T transitions at the CpG dinucleotide was observed in the substitution of bases. The authors identified recurrent mutations in tumor protein p53 (TP53), KRAS, catenin (cadherin-associated protein) β-1 (CTNNB1), AT-rich interactive domain 2 (ARID2), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), ARID1A, cadherin-related family member 1 (CDHR1), NRAS, Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (BOK), radial spoke head 14 homolog (chlamydomonas) (RTDR1), cell division cycle 27 (CDC27), catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PIK3CA), and SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4). Pathway scan indicated that the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, and the pathway of focal adhesion were the most extensively affected pathways.;This genomic characterization of duodenal adenocarcinoma provides researchers with insight into its somatic landscape and highlights the vital role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

        "Doc_abstract":"Several researches have shown that cancer is caused by genetic mutations especially in genes involved in cell growth and regulation. Ras family members are frequently found in their mutated, oncogenic forms in human tumors. Mutant RAS proteins are constitutively active, owing to reduce intrinsic GTPase activity and insensitivity to GTPase-activating protein (GAPs). In total, activating mutations in the RAS genes occur in approximately 20% of all human cancers, mainly in codon 12, 13 or 61. Activating mutations in the NRAS gene not only result in the reduction of intrinsic GTPase activity but also in the induction of resistance against molecules inducing such activity. In this paper, we reported a rapid, simple and portable method for detecting the mutant types of NRAS genes codon 12 and 61 simultaneously by using bead-quantum dots (QDs) based multi-channel microfluidic chip. Probe DNAs are conjugated to bead-QDs and packed in the pillars of channels in the microfluidic chip. After injection of target DNAs and intercalating dyes, the fluorescence quenching of QDs by intercalating dye was observed due to FRET phenomena. The platform can be effortlessly applied in other biological and clinical areas.",

Sun-exposed melanomas had markedly more ultraviolet (UV)-like C>T somatic mutations compared to sun-shielded acral, mucosal and uveal melanomas. Among the newly identified cancer genes was PPP6C, encoding a serine/threonine phosphatase, which harbored mutations that clustered in the active site in 12% of sun-exposed melanomas, exclusively in tumors with mutations in BRAF or NRAS. Notably, we identified a recurrent UV-signature, an activating mutation in RAC1 in 9.2% of sun-exposed melanomas. This activating mutation, the third most frequent in our cohort of sun-exposed melanoma after those of BRAF and NRAS, changes Pro29 to serine (RAC1(P29S)) in the highly conserved switch I domain. Crystal structures, and biochemical and functional studies of RAC1(P29S) showed that the alteration releases the conformational restraint conferred by the conserved proline, causes an increased binding of the protein to downstream effectors, and promotes melanocyte proliferation and migration. These findings raise the possibility that pharmacological inhibition of downstream effectors of RAC1 signaling could be of therapeutic benefit.",

We report here efficacy results for the FIRE-3 final RAS (KRAS/NRAS, exons 2-4) wild-type subgroup. Moreover, new metrics of tumour dynamics were explored during a centralised radiological review to investigate how FOLFIRI plus cetuximab conferred overall survival benefit in the absence of differences in investigator-assessed objective responses and progression-free survival.;FIRE-3 was a randomised phase 3 trial comparing FOLFIRI plus cetuximab with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint of the FIRE-3 study was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 in the intention-to-treat population. A centralised radiological review of CT scans was done in a post-hoc analysis to assess objective response according to RECIST 1.1, early tumour shrinkage, depth of response, duration of response, and time to response in the final RAS wild-type subgroup. Comparisons between treatment groups with respect to objective response rate and early tumour shrinkage were made using Fisher's exact test (two-sided), while differences in depth of response were investigated with a two-sided Wilcoxon test. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433927.;In the final RAS wild-type population (n=400), median overall survival was better in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab group than the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group (33·1 months [95% CI 24·5-39·4] vs 25·0 months [23·0-28·1]; hazard ratio 0·70 [0·54-0·90]; p=0·0059), although investigator-assessed objective response and progression-free survival were comparable between treatment groups. Centralised radiological review of CT-assessable patients (n=330) showed that the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (113 of 157, 72·0% [95% CI 64·3-78·8] vs 97 of 173, 56·1% [48·3-63·6]; p=0·0029), frequency of early tumour shrinkage (107 of 157, 68·2% [60·3-75·4] vs 85 of 173, 49·1% [41·5-56·8]; p=0·0005), and median depth of response (-48·9% [-54·3 to -42·0] vs -32·3% [-38·2 to -29·2]; p<0·0001) were significantly better in extended RAS wild-type patients receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus those receiving FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. No differences in duration of response and time to response were observed between treatment groups.;This analysis provides a new framework that connects alternative metrics of response to overall survival.

Here we present biomarker data from the randomised phase II AFFIRM trial assessing aflibercept in combination with mFOLFOX6 first line in mCRC.;Ninety-six somatic mutations in key oncogenic drivers of mCRC and 133 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway genes were analysed, and 27 plasma markers measured at baseline, during and after treatment. We assessed correlations of these three classes of biomarkers with progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AEs).;Somatic mutations identified in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and PIK3R1 did not significantly correlate with PFS (multiple testing-adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) or multiple testing-adjusted FDR>0.3). None of the individual SNPs correlated with PFS (multiple testing-adjusted FDR>0.22), but at the gene level variability in VEGFB significantly correlated with PFS (multiple testing-adjusted FDR=0.0423). Although none of the plasma markers measured at baseline significantly correlated with PFS, high levels of circulating IL8 at baseline together with increased levels of IL8 during treatment were significantly associated with reduced PFS (multiple testing-adjusted FDR=0.0478). No association was found between biomarkers and AEs.;This represents the first biomarker study in mCRC treated with aflibercept. High IL8 plasma levels at baseline and subsequent increases in IL8 were associated with worse PFS, suggesting that IL8 may act as a potentially predictive biomarker of aflibercept treatment outcome.",

Although nearly identical with respect to their catalytic and effector-binding properties, HRas, NRas and KRas lead to different biological outcomes in development, cell growth and cancer. This functional distinction is believed to result at least in part from the differential membrane compartmentalization of Ras isoforms. The different distribution of Ras proteins in cellular membranes dictates unique spatio-temporal patterns of activation of effector pathways. This perspective focuses on the factors that control membrane compartmentalization of Ras with an emphasis on a recently discovered novel posttranslational modification of Ras--ubiquitination. The properties of Ras ubiquitination, its contribution to the regulation of Ras intracellular trafficking and finally the influence of Ras ubiquitination on its signaling potential are discussed.",

Alterations of BRAF/NRAS/ PIK3CA/PTEN, have independently been found to give rise to resistance. The first-line trials with cetuximab chemotherapy are conflicting, because of the many differences among prospective and retrospective evaluations. In neoadjuvant regimens, cetuximab with CT obtained a significant and early increase of the RR. In second-line studies cetuximab improved RR and PFS. In third-line studies cetuximab-irinotecan is associated with a significant advantage in ORR, mTTP and OS. Cetuximab has not reported any benefit neither in adjuvant nor in trials with bevacizumab. In third-line studies cetuximab-irinotecan is associated with a significant advantage in ORR, mTTP and OS. Value of KRAS is questioned, since a high percentage of KRAS-wt patients has no benefit with cetuximab.

A subset of 8 specimens from a bank of 60 malignant and normal specimens was selected for array analysis to identify potential genes of interest. TaqMan polymerase chain reaction was carried out on the 60 specimens to examine if aberrations at the genomic level correlated with gene expression and to compare expression in normal and malignant samples. Oncogenes amplified in the endometrial cancers included AR, PIK3CA, MET, HRAS, NRAS, D17S1670, FGFR1, CTSB, RPS6KB1, LAMC2, MYC, PDGFRA, FGF4/FGF3, PAKI, and FGR.

Testing of four or five tumour samples is required per scheme. Laboratories provided information on which codons were routinely screened, and provided genotyping and interpretation results for each sample.;At least 85% of laboratories routinely tested KRAS codons 12, 13 and 61. Over the four schemes, an increasing number of laboratories routinely tested KRAS codons 59, 117 and 146. Furthermore, more laboratories were introducing next generation sequencing technologies. The pattern of 'extended testing' was reassuringly similar for NRAS, although fewer laboratories currently test for mutations in this gene. Alarmingly, still only 36.1% and 24.1% of participating laboratories met the ACP Molecular Pathology and Diagnostics Group and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, respectively, for extended RAS testing in the latest assessment.;Despite recommendations in the UK and USA on extended RAS testing, there has clearly been, based on these results, a delay in implementation.

A total of 23,620 somatic mutations generated by whole‑exome sequencing of 446 tumor/normal pairs of thyroid cancer were obtained from TCGA. Variant classification was conducted with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). OncodriveFM and Dendrix were applied to detect driver genes and pathways with statistical evidence. In addition, we analyzed DNA‑methylation status, copy number variation, expression levels and fusion genes among these driver candidates. In total, non‑synonymous mutations accounted for over 55% (13,091/23,620) of the total variants; 53 and 3 driver genes were determined by OncodriveFM and Dendrix, respectively, including 6 recurrently mutated driver genes, such as BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, EIF1AX, KRAS and 47 new genes. A total of 75 pathways with high function impact bias were identified by OncodriveFM. Two genes, FHOD3 and SRP72, were hypomethylated, overexpressed and involved in major deletions in thyroid cancer.

Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene plays a crucial role in MTC development. Besides RET, other oncogenes commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers have also been investigated in MTC. The family of human RAS genes includes the highly homologous HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes that encode three distinct proteins. Activating mutations in specific hotspots of the RAS genes are found in about 30% of all human cancers. In thyroid neoplasias, RAS gene point mutations, mainly in NRAS, are detected in benign and malignant tumors arising from the follicular epithelium. However, recent reports have also described RAS mutations in MTC, namely in HRAS and KRAS. Overall, the prevalence of RAS mutations in sporadic MTC varies between 0-43.3%, occurring usually in tumors with WT RET and rarely in those harboring a RET mutation, suggesting that activation of these proto-oncogenes represents alternative genetic events in sporadic MTC tumorigenesis. Thus, the assessment of RAS mutation status can be useful to define therapeutic strategies in RET WT MTC. MTC patients with RAS mutations have an intermediate risk for aggressive cancer, between those with RET mutations in exons 15 and 16, which are associated with the worst prognosis, and cases with other RET mutations, which have the most indolent course of the disease. Recent results from exome sequencing indicate that, besides mutations in RET, HRAS, and KRAS, no other recurrent driver mutations are present in MTC. ",

The level of certainty for BRAF V600E testing to guide antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy was deemed low. The EWG encourages further studies of the potential value of testing in patients with mCRC who were found to have tumors that are wild type (mutation negative) for KRAS to predict responsiveness to therapy.The EWG found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against testing for mutations in NRAS, or PIK3CA, and/or loss of expression of PTEN or AKT proteins. The level of certainty for this evidence was low. In the absence of supporting evidence, and with consideration of other contextual issues, the EWG discourages the use of these tests in guiding decisions on initiating anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab or panitumumab unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes.;It has been suggested that patients with mCRC whose tumors harbor certain mutations affecting EGFR pathway signaling are typically unresponsive to therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab). The EWG identified recent evidence reviews that have addressed this topic, and this recommendation statement is based on results of these reviews. In developing these recommendations the EWG considered evidence in the areas described below.;Although no research syntheses that have formally evaluated analytic validity of these tests were found, the EWG was able to draw the following conclusions from assessments included in the evidence reviews under consideration. There is adequate evidence that KRAS mutation analysis reliably and accurately detects common mutations (codons 12 and 13), whereas evidence was inadequate for less frequent KRAS mutations (e.g., codon 61). There is also adequate evidence that testing for BRAF V600E accurately and reliably detects the mutation. For common mutations in NRAS, PIK3CA, and expression of PTEN AKT, there is adequate evidence of accurate and reliable detection. However, much less data exist in support. Furthermore, in the specific context of mCRC, no evidence was found on the analytic validity of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays for PTEN or AKT expression.;For KRAS mutation analysis, the EWG found convincing evidence for association with treatment response to anti-EGFR therapy, independent of prognostic association. For BRAF V600E mutation testing, the EWG found insufficient evidence for association with treatment response to anti-EGFR therapy independent of prognostic association. The EWG found insufficient evidence for association of results of testing for mutations in NRAS or PIK3CA, and loss of expression of PTEN or ATK proteins, with treatment response to anti-EGFR therapy.;For KRAS mutation analysis, the EWG found adequate evidence that improved health outcomes are achieved by avoiding ineffective chemotherapy and potential side effects and expediting access to the next most effective treatment. Inadequate evidence was found regarding association of BRAF V600E mutation testing or loss of PTEN expression with improved health outcomes among patients with mCRC undergoing anti-EGFR therapy as compared with patients with tumors bearing wild-type BRAF sequence and PTEN expression levels, respectively. No evidence was found to support improved health outcomes associated with testing results for NRAS or PIK3CA variants, or AKT protein expression levels in this clinical scenario.;CRC is an important and highly prevalent health problem. Improvements in mCRC outcomes associated with pharmacogenetic testing could have important clinical, and potentially public health, impacts. Adverse events related to cancer chemotherapy can be common and severe. Therefore, successfully optimizing treatment to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects is important for reducing mCRC-related morbidity and mortality."},

Gain-of-function missense mutations in RAS genes are found in ∼25% of human cancers, prompting interest in identifying anti-RAS therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. However, despite more than three decades of intense effort, no anti-RAS therapies have reached clinical application. Contributing to this failure has been an underestimation of the complexities of RAS. First, there is now appreciation that the four human RAS proteins are not functionally identical. Second, with >130 different missense mutations found in cancer, there is an emerging view that there are mutation-specific consequences on RAS structure, biochemistry and biology, and mutation-selective therapeutic strategies are needed. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster, we provide a snapshot of the differences between RAS isoforms and mutations, as well as the current status of anti-RAS drug-discovery efforts.",

Lack of effective therapeutic options is one of the main challenges in clinical management of oral cancer patients. We interrogated large pool of samples from oral cancer gene expression studies to identify potential therapeutic targets that are involved in multiple cancer hallmark events. Therapeutic strategies directed towards such targets can be expected to effectively control cancer cells. Datasets from different gene expression studies were integrated by removing batch-effects and was used for downstream analyses, including differential expression analysis. Dependency network analysis was done to identify genes that undergo marked topological changes in oral cancer samples when compared with control samples. Causal reasoning analysis was carried out to identify significant hypotheses, which can explain gene expression profiles observed in oral cancer samples. Text-mining based approach was used to detect cancer hallmarks associated with genes significantly expressed in oral cancer. In all, 2365 genes were detected to be differentially expressed genes, which includes some of the highly differentially expressed genes like matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1/3/10/13), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands (IL8, CXCL-10/-11), PTHLH, SERPINE1, NELL2, S100A7A, MAL, CRNN, TGM3, CLCA4, keratins (KRT-3/4/13/76/78), SERPINB11 and serine peptidase inhibitors (SPINK-5/7). XIST, TCEAL2, NRAS and FGFR2 are some of the important genes detected by dependency and causal network analysis. Literature mining analysis annotated 1014 genes, out of which 841 genes were statistically significantly annotated. The integration of output of various analyses, resulted in the list of potential therapeutic targets for oral cancer, which included targets such as ADM, TP53, EGFR, LYN, CTLA4, SKIL, CTGF and CD70.

Notably, all selumetinib-resistant cells with elevated OxPhos could be resensitized by cotreatment with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD8055, whereas this combination was ineffective in resistant cell lines with low OxPhos. In both BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma cells, MEK inhibition increased MITF expression, which in turn elevated levels of PGC1α. In contrast, mTORC1/2 inhibition triggered cytoplasmic localization of MITF, decreasing PGC1α expression and inhibiting OxPhos. Analysis of tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma progressing on BRAF inhibitor ± MEK inhibitor revealed that PGC1α levels were elevated in approximately half of the resistant tumors.

The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic interobserver agreement and to characterize the immunohistochemical and molecular differences between these two subgroups. Fifteen cases initially classified as medullary carcinoma and 30 cases of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas were included. Two pathologists reviewed the slides independently without knowledge of the original diagnosis and subgrouped the tumors into the two entities. Agreement was reached in 31 of 45 cases (69 %) with kappa = 0.32. An extensive immunohistochemical panel was performed, and KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutational status was assessed. Of the 31 cases with diagnostic agreement, the expression of only MLH-1 along with corresponding expression of PMS-2 differed significantly (p = 0.04). A high rate of BRAF mutations was detected in both subgroups without significant differences. Expression of MLH-1 was superior in dividing the tumors into two separate entities with significant differences in CK20 (p = 0.005) expression and in the rate of BRAF mutations (p = 0.0035). In conclusion, medullary carcinomas of the colon are difficult to discriminate from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma even with the help of immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. This raises the question whether these morphological subtypes should be maintained or whether an alternative classification of poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinomas based on MLH-1 status rather than morphology should be suggested.",

Here we show that blocking phosphorylation of the AKT substrate, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS or NOS3), inhibits tumour initiation and maintenance. Moreover, eNOS enhances the nitrosylation and activation of endogenous wild-type Ras proteins, which are required throughout tumorigenesis.

However, several studies have shown a frequent loss of the wild-type KRAS allele in the tumors of murine models and an inhibition of oncogenic phenotype in tumor cell lines by transfection of wild-type RAS, indicating that wild-type RAS may have oncosuppressive properties. To determine whether loss of wild-type KRAS is involved in the development of human lung cancer, we investigated the mutations of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF in 154 primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) as well as 10 NSCLC cell lines that have been shown to have KRAS mutations. We also determined the loss of heterozygosity status of KRAS alleles in these tumors. We detected point mutations of KRAS in 11 (7%) of 154 NSCLCs, with 10 cases at codon 12 and 1 at codon 61, but no mutations of NRAS or BRAF were found. Using the laser capture microdissection technique, we confirmed that 9 of the 11 tumors and 7 of the 10 NSCLC cell lines retained the wild-type KRAS allele. Among the cell lines with heterozygosity of mutant and wild-type KRAS, all of the cell lines tested for expression were shown to express more mutated KRAS than wild-type mRNA, with higher amounts of KRAS protein also being expressed compared to the cell lines with a loss of wild-type KRAS allele. In addition, among 148 specimens available for immunohistochemical analysis, 113 (76%) showed positive staining of KRAS, indicating that the vast majority of NSCLCs continue to express wild-type KRAS. Our findings indicate that the wild-type KRAS allele is occasionally lost in human lung cancer, and that the oncogenic activation of mutant KRAS is more frequently associated with an overexpression of the mutant allele than with a loss of the wild-type allele in human NSCLC development.",

For the RASKET KIT, we used only 50-100 ng DNA from each FFPE specimen not processed by MMD. The primary endpoint was the concordance rate between RAS mutations identified with the RASKET KIT and two reference assays (DS with MMD and TheraScreen(®) K-RAS Mutation Kit). As the secondary endpoints, we evaluated the concordance rate between DS and the RASKET KIT for RAS mutations in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population and the genotyping performance of the RASKET KIT compared with DS.;Among 307 analyzable specimens, the reference assays detected 140 (45.6%, 140/307) RAS mutations: 111 KRAS exon 2 and 29 other (minor) RAS mutations.

MPD could be initiated by Kras(G12D) expression in a highly restricted population enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but not in common myeloid progenitors. Kras(G12D) HSCs demonstrated a marked in vivo competitive advantage over wild-type cells. Kras(G12D) expression also increased the fraction of proliferating HSCs and reduced the overall size of this compartment. Transplanted Kras(G12D) HSCs efficiently initiated acute T-lineage leukemia/lymphoma, which was associated with secondary Notch1 mutations in thymocytes.

Under normal physiologic conditions, the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) signalling cascade interaction is initiated by ligation of a receptor-linked tyrosine kinase by its cognate growth factor. It has been demonstrated in many systems that aberrant autocrine or paracrine stimulation of growth factor receptors is pathogenic in large part because of MAPK activation. As one of the key downstream effector pathways of mutated RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS), pharmacologic inhibition of components of the MAPK pathway has been pursued as a means to indirectly inhibit RAS, which remains a technical challenge for direct pharmacologic inhibition. RAF and MEK are the two non-membrane-bound, serine-threonine and tyrosine-threonine kinases, within the pathway that have been most extensively explored as drug targets. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in cancer clarified which cancer types and subsets of certain cancers are most dependent on activation of the MAPK pathway for growth and survival. Now, with the successful translation of selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors into validated therapies for BRAF mutant melanoma, the field seeks to resolve the role for these agents in cancers harbouring RAS mutations or those driven by aberrant growth factor receptor activation.",

To address this question, we utilized antibodies to specifically target Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, or jagged1 (Jag1) in a mouse model of primary liver cancer driven by v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRas). We show that inhibition of Notch2 reduces tumor burden by eliminating highly malignant HCC- and CCA-like tumors. Inhibition of the Notch ligand, Jag1, had a similar effect, consistent with Jag1 acting in cooperation with Notch2. This effect was specific to Notch2, because Notch3 inhibition did not decrease tumor burden. Unexpectedly, Notch1 inhibition altered the relative proportion of tumor types, reducing HCC-like tumors but dramatically increasing CC-like tumors. Finally, we show that Notch2 and Jag1 are expressed in, and Notch2 signaling is activated in, a subset of human HCC samples.;These findings underscore the distinct roles of different Notch receptors in the liver and suggest that inhibition of Notch2 signaling represents a novel therapeutic option in the treatment of liver cancer.",

In melanoma, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway driven by mutant BRAF or NRAS is a primary cause of malignant transformation. Activity of the MAPK pathway, as well as other factors, such as HIF1α, Myc and MITF, are among those that control the balance between non-oxidative and oxidative branches of central carbon metabolism.

Specific acquired RAS mutations have been found to predominate in different cancers, and HRAS T81C polymorphism has been determined to contribute the risk of various cancers, including thyroid cancer.

No mutation was found in any of the thyroid tumor tissue samples, but we frequently detected polymorphism at nucleotide 81 (T > C) in exon 1 of HRAS gene. In HRAS T81C SNP, frequencies of TT, TC, and CC genotypes among cases were 41.4, 38.6, and 20.0 %, while in controls genotype frequencies were 84.1, 11.7, and 4.2 %, respectively. A significant difference was observed in variant allele frequencies (TC + CC) between the cases and controls (58.6 vs. 16 %) with odds ratio = 7.4; confidence interval (CI) = 4.3-12.7 (P < 0.05). Interestingly, combined TC and CC genotype abundantly presented in follicular thyroid tumor (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significant association of the variant allele (TC + CC) was found with nonsmokers (P < 0.05).

In endometrial cancer, mutually exclusive mutations of PTEN and KRAS have been reported. On the other hand, mutation of BRAF is highly frequent, and mutually exclusive mutations of BRAF and NRAS have also been reported in melanomas. In this study, we elucidated the involvement of the up-regulation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer and melanoma by analyzing the genes and molecules in these cascades. Twelve cell lines, six melanoma and six endometrial cancer, were analyzed; 4 (67%) of the 6 melanomas had gene mutations in the RAS/MAPK cascade, and a decrease or loss of PTEN expression was also observed. These results suggested that simultaneous up-regulations in these two cascades play important roles in carcinogenesis of melanocytes. However, no activation of AKT by phosphorylation was observed. On the other hand, 4 (67%) of the 6 endometrial cancer cell lines had mutually exclusive up-regulations in these cascades. However, two cell lines with up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT cascade also had up-regulation in the RAS/MAPK cascade induced by inactivation of DUSP6. These results suggest that simultaneous up-regulation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades are crucial events in the pathogenesis of melanocytes, whereas up-regulation of either the RAS/MAPK or PI3K/AKT cascade is crucial for the majority of endometrial cancers.",

Here we present the first large scale RNA sequencing study of lung adenocarcinoma, demonstrating its power to identify somatic point mutations as well as transcriptional variants such as gene fusions, alternative splicing events, and expression outliers. Our results reveal the genetic basis of 200 lung adenocarcinomas in Koreans including deep characterization of 87 surgical specimens by transcriptome sequencing. We identified driver somatic mutations in cancer genes including EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET, and CTNNB1. Candidates for novel driver mutations were also identified in genes newly implicated in lung adenocarcinoma such as LMTK2, ARID1A, NOTCH2, and SMARCA4. We found 45 fusion genes, eight of which were chimeric tyrosine kinases involving ALK, RET, ROS1, FGFR2, AXL, and PDGFRA. Among 17 recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 14 skipping in the proto-oncogene MET as highly likely to be a cancer driver. The number of somatic mutations and expression outliers varied markedly between individual cancers and was strongly correlated with smoking history of patients. We identified genomic blocks within which gene expression levels were consistently increased or decreased that could be explained by copy number alterations in samples. We also found an association between lymph node metastasis and somatic mutations in TP53.

Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) are considered to be the most important pre-mutagenic type of DNA damage involved in skin carcinogenesis. To better understand the biological mechanisms of UV carcinogenesis, it is critical to understand the CPD distribution between the four types of dipyrimidine sites. Most of our knowledge regarding CPD distribution comes from in vitro studies or from investigations using UVC, even though we are not naturally exposed to these UV wavelengths. We exposed normal human fibroblasts and purified DNA to UVB. Using ligation-mediated PCR, we quantified the CPD formation at 952 dipyrimidine sites among the PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), JUN, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS and TP53 genes. In cellulo, we found a CPD distribution of 27 : 27 : 25 : 21 for TT : CC : TC : CT. This distribution is similar to that observed in vitro. In the analysed genes, we observed some extremely frequently damaged dipyrimidine sites and many of these occurred at potentially frequently mutated sites, i.e. at dipyrimidine sites containing cytosine. Also, most of the frequently damaged dipyrimidine sites in cellulo that are not frequently damaged in vitro are found on TP53 and NRAS. This indicates that many of the frequently damaged dipyrimidine sites in cellulo are on genes frequently mutated in skin cancer. All these results support the view that CPD are the main UVB-induced mutagenic photoproducts and provide evidence of the importance of CPD formation at sites containing cytosine.",

The majority of techniques to study oncogenic mutations require high quality and quantity DNA or are analytically challenging. Mass-spectrometry based mutation analysis however is a relatively simple and high-throughput method suitable for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour material. Targeted gene panels using this technique have been developed for several types of cancer. These current cancer hotspot panels are not focussed on the genes that are most relevant in gynaecological cancers. In this study, we report the design and validation of a novel, mass-spectrometry based panel specifically for gynaecological malignancies and present the frequencies of detected mutations. Using frequency data from the online Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, we selected 171 somatic hotspot mutations in the 13 most important genes for gynaecological cancers, being BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FOXL2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A and PTEN. A total of 546 tumours (205 cervical, 227 endometrial, 89 ovarian, and 25 vulvar carcinomas) were used to test and validate our panel, and to study the prevalence and spectrum of somatic mutations in these types of cancer. The results were validated by testing duplicate samples and by allele-specific qPCR. The panel presented here using mass-spectrometry shows to be reproducible and high-throughput, and is usefull in FFPE material of low quality and quantity. It provides new possibilities for studying large numbers of gynaecological tumour samples in daily practice, and could be useful in guided therapy selection. ",

Global miRNA expression profiles of a set of melanoma lymph node metastases, melanoma cell lines, and melanocyte cultures were determined using Agilent array. Deregulated miRNAs were evaluated in relation with clinical characteristics, patient survival, and mutational status for BRAF and NRAS. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed between melanocytes and melanomas as well as melanoma cell lines. In melanomas, miR-193a, miR-338, and miR-565 were underexpressed in cases with a BRAF mutation. Furthermore, low expression of miR-191 and high expression of miR-193b were associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. In conclusion, our findings show miRNA dysregulation in malignant melanoma and its relation to established molecular backgrounds of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations. The identification of an miRNA classifier for poor survival may lead to the development of miRNA detection as a complementary prognostic tool in clinical practice.",

Activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS are the source of extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway activation. We show that melanoma cell lines, originating in different metastatic sites, with BRAF or NRAS mutations, in addition to active mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK, also have highly activated stress activated protein kinase (SAPK)-p38. This is in direct contrast to carcinoma cells in which the activity of the two kinases appears to be mutually exclusive; high level of p38 activity inhibits, through a negative feedback, ERK activity and prevents tumorigenesis. Melanomas are insensitive to ERK inhibition by p38 and utilize p38-signaling pathway for migration and growth in vivo. We found a positive functional loop linking the high ERK activity to surface expression of alphaVbeta3-integrin. This integrin, by interacting with vitronectin, induces p38 activity and increases IL-8 production, enhancing cell migration. Because the negative loop from p38 to ERK is lost, the two kinases can remain simultaneously activated. Inhibition of ERK and p38 activities is more effective in blocking in vivo growth than inhibition of each kinase individually. Future therapies might have to consider targeting of both pathways.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic process accounts for the vast majority of melanoma associated mortality, and also results in difficulties in the effective treatment. Therefore, identification of novel biomarkers could contribute to melanoma prognosis, and may also provide new opportunities for efficient cancer treatment. Several signaling pathways have been identified as key regulators in melanoma progression, including the frequent activation of Ras/MAPK signaling pathway through the mutant BRAF or NRAS genes. Besides, alterations of CCND1 may also be of great importance. The oncogene plays a significant role in the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle, and its transcriptional activation is primarily carried out by the Ras/MAPK cascade. One of our aims was to determine the genetic and gene expression alterations of CCND1 during melanoma progression, considering the mutation status of BRAF and NRAS genes. Analysis of CCND1 copy number alterations revealed significant association with poor clinical outcome in primary melanomas, which was influenced by the mutation status of BRAF or NRAS in the term of sun exposure. Regarding gene expression, CCND1 mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and were correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation status of BRAF and NRAS. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation and shorter survival time. However, the proportion of cells expressing the protein showed a heterogeneous distribution, influencing the association with clinical-pathological parameters. Therefore melanoma cell lines with different biological behavior were also analyzed for protein expression. These experiments revealed an increasing CCND1 protein level throughout primary cancer progression, which then decreased in the metastasis. The other purpose of our study was to determine the role of 7q31 region in melanoma progression, which was found frequently altered using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). 7q31 is a gene dense locus, including the FRA7G fragile site, which serves as a mutation hot spot. In its close vicinity TES (focal adhesions) and CAV1 (lipid rafts) genes are located. Using interphase FISH, significant associations were found between 7q31 copy number alterations and poor clinical outcome. Both mRNA and protein levels of CAV1 decreased in thick lesions whereas primary melanomas forming multiple metastases were featured by decreased TES mRNA level. ;A melanoma okozta halálozások legfõbb oka a metasztázisok megjelenése, mely a túlélésen túl jelentõsen csökkenti az alkalmazott terápiák hatékonyságát is. Ezért szükséges olyan biomarkerek felkutatása, melyek hozzájárulnak a melanoma prognózisához, és sikeresen alkalmazhatók a terápiás hatékonyság növelésére. Számos jelátviteli útvonal szerepét bizonyították már a melanoma progressziójában. Ezek közül kiemelkedõ jelentõségû a Ras/MAPK útvonal aktivációja. A BRAF- és NRAS-mutációk korai megjelenése mellett fontos, hogy az útvonal egyik fõ célmolekulája a sejtciklus G1/S fázis átmenetét szabályozó CCND1. Vizsgálataink egyik részében a CCND1 genetikai és génexpressziós eltéréseit tanulmányoztuk a melanomaprogresszió során, figyelembe véve a BRAF és NRAS gének mutációs státuszát. Eredményeink a CCND1-kópiaszám eltéréseinek szignifikáns összefüggését tárták fel a kedvezõtlen klinikai kimenetellel primer melanomákban, mely összefüggést befolyásolta a BRAF és NRAS gének mutációs státusza a napsugárzásnak való kitettség függvényében. Génexpressziós vizsgálataink során a CCND1 mRNS-szintjének szignifikáns csökkenését figyeltük meg a többszörös áttétképzõ primer tumorokban, mely korrelációt mutatott mind a BRAF és NRAS mRNS-szintekkel, mind pedig ez utóbbi gének mutációs státuszával. A CCND1 protein fokozott expressziója pedig áttétképzéssel, rövidebb túléléssel és nagyobb Breslow-vastagsággal társult. A CCND1-et kifejezõ sejtek aránya azonban heterogén eloszlást mutatott, mely befolyásolta a klinikopatológiai paraméterekkel való összefüggést. Kísérleteinket ezért eltérõ biológiai karakterû sejtvonalakon végzett vizsgálatokkal egészítettük ki. Ez alapján a progresszió elõrehaladtával a CCND1-expresszió fokozódik, majd az áttétben lecsökken. További célunk volt az array komparatív genomhibridizációs (aCGH) vizsgálatok során gyakori eltérést mutató 7q31-es régió szerepének vizsgálata a melanoma progressziójában. A lókusz rendkívül géndenz, mely magában foglalja a mutációs forrópontként mûködõ FRA7G fragilis helyet. Ennek környezetében lokalizálódik a fokális adhéziók egy kulcsmolekuláját kódoló TES gén, valamint a membrán-lipidtutajok multifunkciós alapköve, a CAV1. Interfázisos FISH-vizsgálataink szignifikáns összefüggést mutattak a 7q31 kópiaszám-eltérései és a kedvezõtlen prognózis között. A CAV1 mRNS-expresszió lecsökkent vastag melanomákban, mely változás fehérjeszinten is tapasztalható volt, míg a TES mRNS-szint csökkenése a többszörös áttétképzõ primer mintákat jellemezte."},

The two-stage 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) model of mouse skin carcinogenesis has been used to study mechanisms of epithelial tumor development by oncogenic Hras. We used mice with an Hras(G12V) knock-in allele to elucidate the early events after Hras activation, and to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of farnesyltransferase inhibition (FTI). Treatment of Caggs-Cre/FR-Hras(G12V) mice with TPA alone was sufficient to trigger papilloma development with a shorter latency and an ∼10-fold greater tumor burden than DMBA/TPA-treated WT-controls. Hras(G12V) allele copy number was increased in all papillomas induced by TPA. DMBA/TPA treatment of Hras(G12V) knock-in mice induced an even greater incidence of papillomas, which either harbored Hras(G12V) amplification or developed an Hras(Q61L) mutation in the second allele. Laser-capture microdissection of normal skin, hyperplastic skin and papillomas showed that amplification occurred only at the papilloma stage. HRAS-mutant allelic imbalance was also observed in human cancer cell lines, consistent with a requirement for augmented oncogenic HRAS signaling for tumor development. The FTI SCH66336 blocks HRAS farnesylation and delocalizes it from the plasma membrane. NRAS and KRAS are not affected as they are alternatively prenylated. When tested in lines harboring HRAS, NRAS or KRAS mutations, SCH66336 delocalized, inhibited signaling and preferentially inhibited growth only of HRAS-mutant lines. Treatment with SCH66336 also induced near-complete regression of papillomas of TPA-treated Hras(G12V) knock-in mice. These data suggest that farnesyl transferase inhibitors should be reevaluated as targeted agents for human HRAS-driven cancers, such as those of bladder, thyroid and other epithelial lineages.",

Although high response rates and disease control have been observed in lung cancer patients bearing rearranged ROS1 tumors (ROS1+) treated with the kinase inhibitor crizotinib, many of these patients eventually relapse.To identify mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 inhibitors we generated resistant cells from HCC78 lung cancer cells bearing the SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement. We found that activation of the RAS pathway in the HCC78 cell model, due to either KRAS/NRAS mutations or to KRAS amplification, rendered the cells resistant to ROS1 inhibition. These cells were cross-resistant to different ROS1 inhibitors, but sensitive to inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway. Interestingly, we identified focal KRAS amplification in a biopsy of a tumor from a patient that had become resistant to crizotinib treatment.Altogether our data suggest that the activation of members of the RAS family can confer resistance to ROS1 inhibitors. This has important clinical implications as: (i) RAS genetic alterations in ROS1+ primary tumors are likely negative predictors of efficacy for targeted drugs and (ii) this kind of resistance is unlikely to be overcome by the use of more specific or more potent ROS1 targeting drugs.

Targeted mass spectrometry analysis by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) enables selective detection and quantitation of wild-type and mutant KRAS proteins in complex biological samples. A recently described immunoprecipitation approach (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.2011, 108, 2444-2449) can be used to enrich KRAS for MRM analysis, but requires large protein inputs (2-4 mg). Here, we describe sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-based enrichment of KRAS in a low molecular weight (20-25 kDa) protein fraction prior to MRM analysis (GeLC-MRM). This approach reduces background proteome complexity, thus, allowing mutant KRAS to be reliably quantified in low protein inputs (5-50 μg). GeLC-MRM detected KRAS mutant variants (G12D, G13D, G12V, G12S) in a panel of cancer cell lines. GeLC-MRM analysis of wild-type and mutant was linear with respect to protein input and showed low variability across process replicates (CV = 14%). Concomitant analysis of a peptide from the highly similar HRAS and NRAS proteins enabled correction of KRAS-targeted measurements for contributions from these other proteins. KRAS peptides were also quantified in fluid from benign pancreatic cysts and pancreatic cancers at concentrations from 0.08 to 1.1 fmol/μg protein.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MUP and mucosal melanomas harbor different prevalences of TERT-promoter mutations. Thirty-nine patients with MUP and 53 patients with mucosal melanomas were retrieved. In total, 152 paraffin samples of 92 patients were analyzed, and in 38 patients, multiple samples were tested. Mutational analysis of the TERT-promoter, BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes was carried out. In total, 92 patients were eligible for mutational analysis. TERT-promoter mutations were found in 33 patients (35.9%): chr5, 1,295,228 C>T (18 patients); chr5, 1,295,250 C>T (11 patients); chr5, 1,295,228-229 CC>TT (three patients); chr5, 1,295,242-243 CC>TT (one patient). The mutations were significantly more prevalent in MUP [26 (66.7%)] than in mucosal melanomas [seven patients (13.2%); P<0.001]. In MUP, BRAF mutations were found in 46.2% of patients (18 patients) and NRAS mutations in 28.2% of patients (11 patients). In mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutations were found in 18.9% of patients (10), and BRAF and KIT mutations in 7.5% of patients (four patients), respectively. The prevalence of TERT-promoter mutations was associated with the patient's sex [23 (51.1%) men, 10 (21.3%) women; P=0.004]. No significant correlation was found between TERT-mutation and patient survival. The TERT-promoter genotype of MUP points toward a cutaneous and not mucosal origin. The significant sex differences merit further attention in having putative therapeutic implications. ",

Here we report that LGR5 is also highly expressed in a subset of high grade neuroblastomas. Neuroblastoma is a clinically heterogenous paediatric cancer comprising a high proportion of poor prognosis cases (~40%) which are frequently lethal. Unlike many cancers, Wnt pathway mutations are not apparent in neuroblastoma, although previous microarray analyses have implicated deregulated Wnt signalling in high-risk neuroblastoma. We demonstrate that LGR5 facilitates high Wnt signalling in neuroblastoma cell lines treated with Wnt3a and R-spondins, with SK-N-BE(2)-C, SK-N-NAS and SH-SY5Y cell-lines all displaying strong Wnt induction. These lines represent MYCN-amplified, NRAS and ALK mutant neuroblastoma subtypes respectively. Wnt3a/R-Spondin treatment also promoted nuclear translocation of β-catenin, increased proliferation and activation of Wnt target genes. Strikingly, short-interfering RNA mediated knockdown of LGR5 induces dramatic Wnt-independent apoptosis in all three cell-lines, accompanied by greatly diminished phosphorylation of mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MEK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and an increase of BimEL, an apoptosis facilitator downstream of ERK. Akt signalling is also decreased by a Rictor dependent, PDK1-independent mechanism. LGR5 expression is cell cycle regulated and LGR5 depletion triggers G1 cell-cycle arrest, increased p27 and decreased phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. Our study therefore characterises new cancer-associated pathways regulated by LGR5, and suggest that targeting of LGR5 may be of therapeutic benefit for neuroblastomas with diverse etiologies, as well as other cancers expressing high LGR5.

Here, we have shown that B cell progenitors in old mice exhibit marked signaling, gene expression, and metabolic defects. Moreover, B cell progenitors that developed from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transferred from young mice into aged animals exhibited similar fitness defects. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of the oncogenes BCR-ABL, NRAS(V12), or Myc restored B cell progenitor fitness, leading to selection for oncogenically initiated cells and leukemogenesis specifically in the context of an aged hematopoietic system. Aging was associated with increased inflammation in the BM microenvironment, and induction of inflammation in young mice phenocopied aging-associated B lymphopoiesis. Conversely, a reduction of inflammation in aged mice via transgenic expression of α-1-antitrypsin or IL-37 preserved the function of B cell progenitors and prevented NRAS(V12)-mediated oncogenesis. We conclude that chronic inflammatory microenvironments in old age lead to reductions in the fitness of B cell progenitor populations. This reduced progenitor pool fitness engenders selection for cells harboring oncogenic mutations, in part due to their ability to correct aging-associated functional defects. Thus, modulation of inflammation--a common feature of aging--has the potential to limit aging-associated oncogenesis.",

By using a direct in vivo shRNA screen, we show that liver cancer cells that have mutations in the gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) and that are driven by the oncoprotein NRAS become addicted to MYC stabilization via a mechanism mediated by aurora kinase A (AURKA). This MYC stabilization enables the tumor cells to overcome a latent G2/M cell cycle arrest that is mediated by AURKA and the tumor suppressor protein p19(ARF). MYC directly binds to AURKA, and inhibition of this protein-protein interaction by conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors results in subsequent MYC degradation and cell death. These conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, with one of them currently being tested in early clinical trials, suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing Trp53-deficient, NRAS-driven MYC-expressing hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). TP53-mutated human HCCs revealed increased AURKA expression and a positive correlation between AURKA and MYC expression. In xenograft models, mice bearing TP53-mutated or TP53-deleted human HCCs were hypersensitive to treatment with conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, thus suggesting a therapeutic strategy for this subgroup of human HCCs.

        "Doc_abstract":"Knowledge of the molecular events that govern human thyroid tumorigenesis has grown considerably in the past ten years. Key genetic alterations and new oncogenic pathways have been identified. Molecular genetic aberrations in thyroid carcinomas bear noteworthy resemblance to those in acute myelogenous leukemias. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias both possess transcription factor gene rearrangements-PPARgamma-related translocations in thyroid carcinoma and RARalpha-related and CBF-related translocations (amongst others) in myeloid leukemia. PPARgamma and RARalpha are closely related members ofthe same nuclear receptor subfamily, and the PML-RARalpha and PAX8-PPARgamma fusion proteins both function as dominant negative inhibitors of their wild-type parent proteins. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias also both harbor NRAS mutations (15-25% of both cancers) and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations--RET mutations in thyroid carcinomas and FLT3 mutations in myeloid leukemias. The NRAS and tyrosine receptor kinase mutations are not observed in the same thyroid carcinoma or leukemia patients, suggesting that multiple initiating pathways exist in both. Lastly, thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias possess p53 mutations at relatively low frequency (10-15%) in patients who tend to be older and have more aggressive, therapy resistant disease. Such parallels are unlikely to occur by chance alone and argue that common mechanisms underlie these diverse epithelial and hematologic cancers. The comparison of thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias may highlight areas of thyroid cancer investigation worthy of further focus. For example, few collaborating mutations have been defined in thyroid carcinomas even though they play a clear role in myeloid leukemias, as exemplified by RARalpha rearrangements and FLT3 mutations that together dictate the promyleocytic leukemia phenotype. Functional interactions between collaborating mutations are possible at multiple levels, and it is tempting to speculate that some thyroid carcinomas might develop through an unique combination or co-activation of RET and RAS and/or RET and PPARgamma (and/or other) signaling systems. In fact, the ELE1-RET (PTC3) fusion protein contains the ELE1 nuclear receptor co-activator domain and it appears to physically associate with and inhibit wild-type PPARgamma in some papillary carcinomas. The similarities of the fusion proteins in thyroid carcinoma and myeloid leukemia suggest that a more directed search for fusion genes in non-thyroid carcinomas is warranted. In fact, novel fusion genes have been identified recently in aggressive midline, secretory breast, and renal cell carcinomas, although the epithelial nature of the latter is not well-documented. Interestingly, these cancers all tend to present more frequently in adolescence and young adulthood in a manner similar to thyroid and myeloid malignancies that have fusion genes. The analyses of cancers that present earlier in life may enhance fusion gene recognition in other carcinoma types. Definition and biologic characterization of the precursor cells that give rise to thyroid carcinoma will also be important. Myeloid leukemias are thought to arise from stem/progenitor cells that acquire disturbed self-renewal and differentiation capacities but retain characteristics of the myeloid lineages. Although the presence of comparable stem/progenitor cells in the thyroid are not defined, distinct thyroid cancer lineages and patterns of differentiation exist and candidate stem/progenitor cells such as the p63-immunoreactive solid cell nests are apparent. A last important area is development of molecular-based therapies for thyroid carcinoma patients resistant to standard radio-iodine treatment. Treatments for such cancers are limited and pathways defined by thyroid cancer mutations are prime targets for pharmacologic interventions with molecular inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and nuclear receptor ligands have proven dramatically effective in some myeloid leukemia patients. Various molecular inhibitors are being investigated now in thyroid cancer models. Such developments predict that the thyroid cancer model will continue to provide biologic insights into human carcinoma biology and that improved pathologic diagnosis and treatment for thyroid cancer patients sit on the not too distant horizon."},

Amplification of multiple oncogenes in human cancers can be rapidly determined in a single experiment. Tumor DNA and normal control DNA were labeled by nick translation with green- and red-tagged nucleotides, respectively. Instead of hybridizing to normal metaphase chromosomes in conventional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), the probes of the mixed fluorescent labeled DNA were applied to genomic array templates comprised of P1, PAC, and BAC clones of 58 target oncogenes. The baseline for measuring deviations was established by performing a series of independent array CGH using test and reference DNA made from normal individuals. In the present study, we examined fourteen GBMs (seven cell lines and seven tumours) with CGH and array CGH to reveal the particular oncogenes associated with this cancer.

Here, we report that the DNMT3A mutational hotspot at Arg882 (DNMT3A(R882H)) cooperates with NRAS mutation to transform hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and induce acute leukemia development. Mechanistically, DNMT3A(R882H) directly binds to and potentiates transactivation of stemness genes critical for leukemogenicity including Meis1, Mn1, and Hoxa gene cluster. DNMT3A(R882H) induces focal epigenetic alterations, including CpG hypomethylation and concurrent gain of active histone modifications, at cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers to facilitate gene transcription. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of a putative Meis1 enhancer carrying DNMT3A(R882H)-induced DNA hypomethylation impairs Meis1 expression. Importantly, DNMT3A(R882H)-induced gene-expression programs can be repressed through Dot1l inhibition, providing an attractive therapeutic strategy for DNMT3A-mutated leukemias. ",

Some promise has been shown in treating certain melanomas by targeting activated signaling pathways resulting from specific mutations in proteins, such as BRAF and NRAS. Recently, the identification of embryonic signaling pathways in melanoma has helped us better understand certain biological characteristics, such as cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity, and has provided novel insight pertinent to diagnosis and therapy. For instance, our studies have shown that the TGF-β family member, Nodal, is expressed in melanoma and is responsible, at least in part, for tumor cell plasticity and aggressiveness. Since the majority of normal adult tissues do not express Nodal, we reason that this embryonic morphogen could be used to identify and target aggressive melanoma cells. We have also identified that molecular cross-talk between the Notch and Nodal pathways may represent a mechanism responsible for the overexpression of Nodal in melanoma. Further exploitation of the relationship between embryonic signaling pathways and cancer pathogenesis could lead to novel approaches for diagnosis and therapy in cancers, such as melanoma.",

Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor, with most patients harboring mutations in the BRAF or NRAS oncogenes, leading to the overactivation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. The current therapeutic approaches are based on therapies targeting mutated BRAF and the downstream pathway, and on monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoint blockade. However, treatment resistance and side effects are common events of these therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence supports that melanoma is a hormone-related cancer. Melanoma incidence is higher in males than in females, and females have a significant survival advantage over men. Estrogens exert their effects through estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) that affect cancer growth in an opposite way: ERα is associated with a proliferative action and ERβ with an anticancer effect. ERβ is the predominant ER in melanoma, and its expression decreases in melanoma progression, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Thus, ERβ is now considered as an effective molecular target for melanoma treatment. 17β-estradiol was reported to inhibit melanoma cells proliferation; however, clinical trials did not provide the expected survival benefits.

        "Doc_abstract":"RAS proteins require membrane association for their biologic activity, making this association a logical target for anti-RAS therapeutics. Lipid modification of RAS proteins by a farnesyl isoprenoid is an obligate step in that association, and is an enzymatic process. Accordingly, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) were developed as potential anti-RAS drugs. The lack of efficacy of FTIs as anticancer drugs was widely seen as indicating that blocking RAS membrane association was a flawed approach to cancer treatment. However, a deeper understanding of RAS modification and trafficking has revealed that this was an erroneous conclusion. In the presence of FTIs, KRAS and NRAS, which are the RAS isoforms most frequently mutated in cancer, become substrates for alternative modification, can still associate with membranes, and can still function. Thus, FTIs failed not because blocking RAS membrane association is an ineffective approach, but because FTIs failed to accomplish that task. Recent findings regarding RAS isoform trafficking and the regulation of RAS subcellular localization have rekindled interest in efforts to target these processes. In particular, improved understanding of the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle that regulates RAS interaction with the plasma membrane, endomembranes, and cytosol, and of the potential importance of RAS chaperones, have led to new approaches. Efforts to validate and target other enzymatically regulated posttranslational modifications are also ongoing. In this review, we revisit lessons learned, describe the current state of the art, and highlight challenging but promising directions to achieve the goal of disrupting RAS membrane association and subcellular localization for anti-RAS drug development.

        "Doc_abstract":"At least some cancer stem cells (CSCs) display intrinsic drug resistance that may thwart eradication of a malignancy by chemotherapy. We explored the genesis of such resistance by studying mouse models of liver cancer driven by either MYC or the combination of oncogenic forms of activation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) and NRAS. A common manifestation of chemoresistance in CSCs is efflux of the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342. We found that only the MYC-driven tumors contained a subset of cells that efflux Hoechst 33342. This \"side population\" (SP) was enriched for CSCs when compared to non-SP tumor cells and exhibited markers of hepatic progenitor cells. The SP cells could differentiate into non-SP tumor cells, with coordinate loss of chemoresistance, progenitor markers, and the enrichment for CSCs. In contrast, non-SP cells did not give rise to SP cells. Exclusion of Hoechst 33342 is mediated by ATP binding cassette drug transporter proteins that also contribute to chemoresistance in cancer. We found that the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) transporter was responsible for the efflux of Hoechst from SP cells in our MYC-driven model. Accordingly, SP cells and their tumor-initiating subset were more resistant than non-SP cells to chemotherapeutics that are effluxed by MDR1.;The oncogenotype of a tumor can promote a specific mechanism of chemoresistance that can contribute to the survival of hepatic CSCs. Under circumstances that promote differentiation of CSCs into more mature tumor cells, the chemoresistance can be quickly lost. Elucidation of the mechanisms that govern chemoresistance in these mouse models may illuminate the genesis of chemoresistance in human liver cancer.",

Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

        "Doc_abstract":"Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a common approach to evaluate thyroid nodules. It offers definitive diagnosis of a benign or malignant nodule in the majority of cases. However, 10-25% of nodules yield one of three indeterminate cytologic diagnoses, leading to suboptimal management of these patients. Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undermined significance (AUS/FLUS) is a common indeterminate diagnosis, with the cancer risk ranging from 6% to 48%. This study assessed whether a multi-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay can offer significant improvement in diagnosis in AUS/FLUS nodules.;From May 2014 to March 2015, 465 consecutive FNA samples with the cytologic diagnosis of AUS/FLUS underwent prospective molecular testing using the ThyroSeq v2.1 panel. The panel included 14 genes analyzed for point mutations and 42 types of gene fusions occurring in thyroid cancer. In addition, eight genes were assessed for expression in order to evaluate the cell composition of FNA samples. Ninety-eight (21%) of these nodules had definitive surgical (n = 96) or nonsurgical (n = 2) follow-up and were used to determine the assay performance.;Among 465 AUS/FLUS nodules, three were found to be composed of parathyroid cells and 462 of thyroid follicular cells. Of the latter, 31 (6.7%) were positive for mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were NRAS and HRAS, and overall point mutations in seven different genes and five types of gene fusions were identified in these nodules. Among 98 nodules with known outcome, histologic analysis revealed 22 (22.5%) cancers. ThyroSeq v2.1 was able to classify 20/22 cancers correctly, showing a sensitivity of 90.9% [confidence interval (CI) 78.8-100], specificity of 92.1% [CI 86.0-98.2], positive predictive value of 76.9% [CI 60.7-93.1], and negative predictive value of 97.2% [CI 78.8-100], with an overall accuracy of 91.8% [CI 86.4-97.3].;The results of the study demonstrate that the ThyroSeq v2.1 multi-gene NGS panel of molecular markers provides both high sensitivity and high specificity for cancer detection in thyroid nodules with AUS/FLUS cytology, which should allow improved management for these patients.",

Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) can help analyze challenging tumor samples. We report our experience integrating NRASQ61R (SP174) and BRAFV600E (VE1) IHC in routine practice in a cancer molecular genetic platform. All samples screened for BRAF and NRAS mutations during the year 2014 were analyzed by IHC and pyrosequencing, with an independent analysis of the 2 methods. Cases with first-line discordant results benefited from a complementary second-round IHC and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a final interpretation taking into account the results of pyrosequencing, IHC, NGS, and quantification of the tumor cells. We analyzed 111 consecutive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 101 patients. Twenty-two and 11 samples were concordant for BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R mutations, respectively. Second-round analyses of 9 discordant and 1 molecularly inconclusive samples allowed conclusion in 4 further mutated samples (2 BRAFV600E and 2 NRASQ61R). A sample remained NRASQ61R IHC negative but NRASQ61R mutated with molecular methods. Overall, BRAFV600 and NRASQ61 mutation frequencies were 31.7% and 30.7%, respectively. When compared to molecular results, the sensitivity and specificity of IHC were 100% for BRAFV600E IHC and 92.3% and 98.9% for NRASQ61R IHC, respectively. IHC interpretation required a more stringent cutoff for BRAFV600E IHC than NRASQ61R to minimize false results.

Constitutive activation of the three canonical family members, KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS segregate strongly by tissue type. Of these, KRAS mutations predominate in human tumors, including those arising from the colon and lung. We sought to compare the oncogenic contributions of different RAS isoforms in a comparable genetic setting and to explore downstream molecular changes that may explain the apparent differential oncogenic effects of the various RAS family members. We utilized colorectal cancer cell lines characterized by oncogenic KRAS in parallel with isogenically derived lines in which the mutant allele has been disrupted. We additionally attempted to reconstitute the isogenic derivatives with oncogenic forms of other RAS family members and analyze them in parallel. Pairwise analysis of HCT 116 and DLD-1 cell lines as well as their isogenic derivatives reveals distinct K-RAS(G13D) signatures despite the genetic similarities of these cell lines. In DLD-1, for example, oncogenic K-RAS enhances the motility of these cells by downregulation of Rap1 activity, yet is not associated with increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In HCT 116, however, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is elevated relative to the isogenic derivative, but Rap1 activity is unchanged. K-RAS is uniquely oncogenic in the colonic epithelium, though the molecular aspects of its oncogenic contribution are not necessarily conserved across cell lines. We therefore conclude that the oncogenic contribution of K-RAS is a function of its multifaceted functionality and is highly context-dependent.",

Here, we identified and characterized the small molecule SBI-0640756 (SBI-756), a first-in-class inhibitor that targets eIF4G1 and disrupts the eIF4F complex. SBI-756 impaired the eIF4F complex assembly independently of mTOR and attenuated growth of BRAF-resistant and BRAF-independent melanomas. SBI-756 also suppressed AKT and NF-κB signaling, but small-molecule derivatives were identified that only marginally affected these pathways while still inhibiting eIF4F complex formation and melanoma growth, illustrating the potential for further structural and functional manipulation of SBI-756 as a drug lead. In the gene expression signature patterns elicited by SBI-756, DNA damage, and cell-cycle regulatory factors were prominent, with mutations in melanoma cells affecting these pathways conferring drug resistance. SBI-756 inhibited the growth of NRAS, BRAF, and NF1-mutant melanomas in vitro and delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of Nras/Ink4a melanomas in vivo. Furthermore, combining SBI-756 and a BRAFi attenuated the formation of BRAFi-resistant human tumors. Taken together, our findings show how SBI-756 abrogates the growth of BRAF-independent and BRAFi-resistant melanomas, offering a preclinical rationale to evaluate its antitumor effects in other cancers.",

The interval between NB treatment completion and PTC is usually more than 5 years. A 4-year-old, female patient with a high risk adrenal NB was found to have a 2.9-cm, right thyroid nodule on surveillance chest computed tomography (CT) 6 months after completion of her NB treatment (induction chemotherapy, tumor resection, autologous stem cell transplantation, external beam radiation to the abdominal tumor site, immunotherapy, and retinoic acid). Posttreatment surveillance included iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans and CT scans. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule diagnosed a follicular neoplasm, which was negative for BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, PAX8/PPARg, and RET/PTC mutations, without evidence of metastatic NB. Nodule histology demonstrated an encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC). Next-generation sequence analysis for a 46 cancer-gene profile was performed on both tumors with subsequent peripheral blood DNA testing. A heterozygous missense mutation in STK11 (F354L) was identified in both the NB and FVPTC. This mutation was also detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two additional heterozygous somatic missense mutations of uncertain significance were identified: KDR/VEGF receptor 2 (Q472H) on chromosome 4 and MET (N375S) on chromosome 7. To our knowledge, this is the shortest reported duration from completion of NB treatment to detection of thyroid cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer. Two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treatment of melanoma. Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.

The primary tumor showed an undifferentiated morphology with large cells and induced extensive thickening of the pleura in the right hemithorax. The Y-ML-1B cells grow as a monolayer, with a doubling time of 19 hours, and are tumorigenic in nude mice, which showed a morphology similar to the primary tumor in xenografts.

The opportunity to develop molecularly targeted therapy emerged with the discovery of activating mutations in BRAF, a component of the long studied MAP kinase pathway. These mutations are found in approximately 50 % of patients with regionally advanced or metastatic melanoma and appear to be one of the initiating steps in the development of primary melanoma. Additional oncogenic events, particularly those that affect tumor suppressor genes, are essential for development of invasive and metastatic melanoma. Nonetheless, mutated BRAF retains its central contribution to melanoma pathophysiology even in advanced stage disease as manifested by the remarkable antitumor effects and alteration the natural history of metastatic melanoma of selective BRAF inhibitors. After initial response, resistance commonly emerges within a few months' time and the field has focused on delineating molecular mechanisms of resistance toward the goal of improving upon the early therapeutic effects of single agent BRAF inhibition. Combination regimens are currently undergoing clinical investigation. NRAS and CKIT mutant melanoma represent the next oncogene defined melanoma subsets for which initial targeted therapy approaches are being explored, with early evidence suggesting progress with MEK and CKIT inhibitors, respectively.

Expression profiles for DNA replication/repair genes and the mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and KIT were compared with the karyotypic changes at diagnosis and relapse(s) in 94 cases of inv(16)(p13.1q22)-AML and 82 cases of t(8;21)(q22;q22)-AML. The majority of both AML types demonstrated a simple aneuploid pattern of cytogenetic progression, with highly distinctive patterns of chromosome copy number changes, such as +22 and +13 exclusively in inv(16)-AML and -Y and -X in t(8;21)-AML. Selection of certain cytogenetic changes correlated with particular somatic mutations, such as +8 with RAS mutation, and absence of kinase pathway mutations in t(8;21)-AML with localized deletions at chromosome band 9q22. Alterations in transcript levels of mitotic spindle kinases such as CHEK1, AURKA, and AURKB were associated with the aneuploid progression pattern, particularly in t(8;21) cases. Despite the similarity in the initiating genetics of the two CBF AML types, highly tumor-specific patterns of limited aneuploidy are noted that persist and continue to accumulate at relapse. Thus, activation of genetic instability, possibly through mitotic spindle dysregulation, leads rapidly to the selection of advantageous single chromosome aneuploidy.",

The typical and atypical carcinoid (TC and AC), the large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and the small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) are subgroups of pulmonary tumours that show neuroendocrine differentiations. With the rising impact of molecular pathology in routine diagnostics the interest for reliable biomarkers, which can help to differentiate these subgroups and may enable a more personalised treatment of patients, grows.;A collective of 70 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours (17 TCs, 17 ACs, 19 LCNECs and 17 SCLCs) was used to identify biomarkers by high-throughput sequencing. Using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon-Cancer Panel on the MiSeq instrument, the samples were screened for alterations in 221 mutation hot spots of 48 tumour-relevant genes.;After filtering >26 000 detected variants by applying strict algorithms, a total of 130 mutations were found in 29 genes and 49 patients. Mutations in JAK3, NRAS, RB1 and VHL1 were exclusively found in SCLCs, whereas the FGFR2 mutation was detected in LCNEC only. KIT, PTEN, HNF1A and SMO were altered in ACs. The SMAD4 mutation corresponded to the TC subtype. We prove that the frequency of mutations increased with the malignancy of tumour type. Interestingly, four out of five ATM-mutated patients showed an additional alteration in TP53, which was by far the most frequently altered gene (28 out of 130; 22%). We found correlations between tumour type and IASLC grade for ATM- (P=0.022; P=0.008) and TP53-mutated patients (P<0.001). Both mutated genes were also associated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis (P⩽0.005). Furthermore, PIK3CA-mutated patients with high-grade tumours showed a reduced overall survival (P=0.040) and the mutation frequency of APC and ATM in high-grade neuroendocrine lung cancer patients was associated with progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.020).;The implementation of high-throughput sequencing for the analysis of the neuroendocrine lung tumours has revealed that, even if these tumours encompass several subtypes with varying clinical aggressiveness, they share a number of molecular features. An improved understanding of the biology of neuroendocrine tumours will offer the opportunity for novel approaches in clinical management, resulting in a better prognosis and prediction of therapeutic response.",

Among them, 5 miRNAs were further confirmed to have altered expression in three independent lines of glioblastoma stem cells by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Moreover, two of the miRNAs with increased expression in glioblastoma stem cells also exhibited elevated expression in glioblastoma patient tissues examined, while two miRNAs with decreased expression in glioblastoma stem cells displayed reduced expression in tumor tissues. Furthermore, we identified two oncogenes, NRAS and PIM3, as downstream targets of miR-124, one of the down-regulated miRNAs; and a tumor suppressor, CSMD1, as a downstream target of miR-10a and miR-10b, two of the up-regulated miRNAs. In summary, this study led to the identification of a set of miRNAs that are differentially expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and normal neural stem cells.

This study is the first to investigate a different, however, effective antitumor drug candidate Wentilactone A (WA) for its development as a novel agent. In NCI-H460 and NCI-H446 cell lines, WA triggered G2/M phase arrest and mitochondrial-related apoptosis, accompanying the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53 and increased expression of p21. When we pre-treated cells with ERK, JNK, p38, p53 inhibitor or NAC followed by WA treatment, only ERK and p53 inhibitors blocked WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. We further observed Ras (HRas, KRas and NRas) and Raf activation, and found that WA treatment increased HRas-Raf activation. Knockdown of HRas by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. HRas siRNA also halted Raf, ERK, p53 activation and p21 accumulation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that WA could bind to HRas-GTP, causing accumulation of Ras-GTP and excessive activation of Raf/ERK/p53-p21. The direct binding affinity was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In vivo, WA suppressed tumor growth without adverse toxicity and presented the same mechanism as that in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest WA as a promising novel, potent and selective antitumor drug candidate for lung cancer. ",

In this study we performed a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the phylogeny of RAS proteins and their location in the protein interaction network. This analysis was integrated with the structural analysis of conserved positions in available 3D structures of RAS complexes. Our results show that many RAS proteins with divergent sequences are found close together in the human interactome. We found specific conserved amino acid positions in this group that map to the binding sites of RAS with many of their signaling effectors, suggesting that these pairs could share interacting partners. These results underscore the potential relevance of cross-talking in the RAS signaling network, which should be taken into account when considering the inhibitory activity of drugs targeting specific RAS oncoproteins.

In humans, SPRY4 is located on chromosome 5q, a region affected by large heterozygous deletions that are associated with aggressive disease in which gain-of-function mutations in the RAS pathway are rare. These 5q deletions often co-occur with chromosome 17 alterations involving the deletion of NF1 (another RAS negative regulator) and TP53. Accordingly, combined suppression of Spry4, Nf1 and p53 produces high levels of Ras signaling and drives AML in mice.

Cancers located in the right and left colon are referred to as right colon cancer (RCC) and left colon cancer (LCC), respectively, based on their apparent anatomical positions. Increasing evidence supports the notion that not only are there differences in treatment strategies when dealing with RCC and LCC, but molecular features also vary between them, not to mention the distinguishing clinical manifestations. Disease-free survival after radical surgery of both RCC and LCC are similar. In the treatment of RCC, the benefit gained from adjuvant FOLFIRI chemotherapy is superior, or at least similar, to LCC, but inferior to LCC if FOLFOX regimen is applied. On the other hand, metastatic LCC exhibits longer survival than that of RCC in a palliative chemotherapy setting. For KRAS wild-type cancers, LCC benefits more from cetuximab treatment than RCC. Moreover, advanced LCC shows a higher sensitivity to bevacizumab treatment in comparison with advanced RCC. Significant varieties exist at the molecular level between RCC and LCC, which may serve as the cause of all apparent differences. With respect to carcinogenesis mechanisms, RCC is associated with known gene types, such as MMR, KRAS, BRAF, and miRNA-31, while LCC is associated with CIN, p53, NRAS, miRNA-146a, miRNA-147b, and miRNA-1288. Regarding protein expression, RCC is related to GNAS, NQO1, telomerase activity, P-PDH, and annexin A10, while LCC is related to Topo I, TS, and EGFR. In addition, separated pathways dominate progression to relapse in RCC and LCC. Therefore, RCC and LCC should be regarded as two heterogeneous entities, with this heterogeneity being used to stratify patients in order for them to have the optimal, current, and novel therapeutic strategies in clinical practice.

The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of different mutations in pediatric WDTC and correlate the genotype with the clinical phenotype.;This is a single-center retrospective study. Thyroid tissue blocks from 42 consecutive pediatric WDTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy between 2001 and 2013 were analyzed at Quest Diagnostics for BRAF(V600E), RAS mutations (N,K,H), and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements, using validated molecular methods. Thyroid carcinomas included PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC).;Thirty-nine samples (29 females) were genotyped. The mean age at diagnosis was 14.7 years (range 7.9-18.4 years), and most were Hispanic (56.4%) or Caucasian (35.9%). The mean follow-up period was 2.9 years. Mutations were noted in 21/39 (53.8%), with both BRAF(V600E) (n = 9), and RET/PTC (n = 6) detected only in PTC. Mutations were detected in 2/5 FTC (PAX8/PPARγ and NRAS) and 3/6 FVPTC cases (PAX8/PPARγ). Of 28 PTC patients, 57.1% had mutations: 32.1% with BRAF(V600E), 21.4% with RET/PTC, and 3.6% with NRAS. Of patients with BRAF(V600E), 77.8% were Hispanic and 88.9% were >15 years, while all RET/PTC-positive patients were ≤15 years (p = 0.003). Tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis at diagnosis (or soon after (131)I ablation) did not vary significantly based on the mutation.;BRAF(V600E) was the most common mutation, especially in older and Hispanic adolescents. A larger, ethnically diverse pediatric cohort followed long term will enable the genotypic variability, clinical presentation, and response to therapy to be better assessed.",

The rise is mostly due to an increased detection of small papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) (≤20  mm), predominantly microPTC (≤10  mm). Although small tumors generally have an excellent outcome, a considerable percentage may have a more aggressive disease and worse prognosis. The clinical challenge is to preoperatively identify those tumors that are more likely to recur.;To improve risk stratification and patient management, we sought to determine the prognostic value of BRAF V600E, NRAS or RET/PTC mutations in patients with PTC measuring <20  mm, mainly microPTC.;The prevalence of RET/PTC fusion genes was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61 mutations were determined by PCR sequencing. To further elucidate why some small PTC are less responsive to radioactive iodine treatment therapy, we explored if these genetic alterations may modulate the expression of iodine metabolism genes (NIS, TPO, TG, TSHR and PDS) and correlated with clinico-pathological findings that are predictors of recurrence.;This study shows that tumors measuring ≤20  mm exhibited higher prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation, which correlated with aggressive histopathological parameters, higher risk of recurrence, and lower expression of NIS and TPO. Although this correlation was not found when microPTC were evaluated, we show that tumors measuring 7-10  mm, which were positive for BRAF mutation, presented more aggressive features and lower expression of NIS and TPO.;We believe that our findings will help to decide the realistic usefulness of BRAF V600E mutation as a preoperative marker of poor prognosis in small PTC, primarily in microPTC.",

Molecularly targeted therapy, such as imatinib therapy, has revolutionized the treatment of advanced GIST and facilitates scientific research on GIST. Nevertheless, surgery remains a mainstay of treatment to obtain a permanent cure for GIST even in the era of targeted therapy. Many GIST guidelines have been published to guide the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. We review current versions of GIST guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, by the European Society for Medical Oncology, and in Japan. All clinical practice guidelines for GIST include recommendations based on evidence as well as on expert consensus. Most of the content is very similar, as represented by the following examples: GIST is a heterogeneous disease that may have mutations in KIT, PDGFRA, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, NF1, or the succinate dehydrogenase complex, and these subsets of tumors have several distinctive features. Although there are some minor differences among the guidelines--for example, in the dose of imatinib recommended for exon 9-mutated GIST or the efficacy of antigen retrieval via immunohistochemistry--their common objectives regarding diagnosis and treatment are not only to improve the diagnosis of GIST and the prognosis of patients but also to control medical costs. This review describes the current standard diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of GISTs based on the recommendations of several guidelines and expert consensus.",

We developed a novel mass spectrometry multiplexed genotyping platform named PentaPanel to concurrently assess single nucleotide polymorphisms in 56 hotspots of the 5 most clinically relevant cancer genes, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and PIK3CA for a total of 221 detectable mutations. To both evaluate and validate the PentaPanel performance, we investigated 1025 tumor specimens of 6 different cancer types (carcinomas of colon, lung, breast, pancreas, and biliary tract, and melanomas), systematically addressing sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of our platform. Sanger sequencing was also performed for all the study samples. Our data showed that PentaPanel is a high throughput and robust tool, allowing genotyping for targeted therapy selection of 10 patients in the same run, with a practical turnaround time of 2 working days. Importantly, it was successfully used to interrogate different DNAs isolated from routinely processed specimens (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded, frozen, and cytological samples), covering all the requirements of clinical tests. In conclusion, the PentaPanel platform can provide an immediate, accurate and cost effective multiplex approach for clinically relevant gene mutation analysis in many solid tumors and its utility across many diseases can be particularly relevant in multiple clinical trials, including the new basket trial approach, aiming to identify appropriate targeted drug combination strategies.

The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%) were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway (n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A, CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1, MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively).

But in the setting of melanoma, a highly aggressive and invariably fatal malignancy in its advanced disseminated form, mutation/deletion of p53 is relatively rare, whereas its positive regulator ARF is often lost. Here, we show that genetic deficiency in Arf but not p53 facilitates rapid development of melanoma in a genetically engineered mouse model. This difference is accounted for, at least in part, by the unanticipated observation that, unlike fibroblasts, senescence control in melanocytes is strongly regulated by Arf and not p53. Moreover, oncogenic NRAS collaborates with deficiency in Arf, but not p53, to fully transform melanocytes. Our data demonstrate that ARF and p53, although linked in a common pathway, suppress tumorigenesis through distinct, lineage-dependent mechanisms and suggest that ARF helps restrict melanoma progression by executing the oncogene-induced senescence program in benign nevi. Thus, therapeutics designed to restore wild-type p53 function may be insufficient to counter melanoma and other malignancies in which ARF holds p53-independent tumor suppressor activity.",

The recent identification of causative genetic alterations has revealed mutations in signaling pathways that offer targets for therapy. Identifying morphologic surrogates that can identify patients whose tumors express such alterations (or functionally equivalent alterations) would be clinically useful for therapy stratification and for retrospective analysis of clinical trial data.;We defined and assessed a panel of histomorphologic measures and correlated them with the mutation status of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS in a cohort of 302 archival tissues of primary cutaneous melanomas from an academic comprehensive cancer center. Melanomas with BRAF mutations showed distinct morphological features such as increased upward migration and nest formation of intraepidermal melanocytes, thickening of the involved epidermis, and sharper demarcation to the surrounding skin; and they had larger, rounder, and more pigmented tumor cells (all p-values below 0.0001). By contrast, melanomas with NRAS mutations could not be distinguished based on these morphological features. Using simple combinations of features, BRAF mutation status could be predicted with up to 90.8% accuracy in the entire cohort as well as within the categories of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Among the variables routinely recorded in cancer registries, we identified age < 55 y as the single most predictive factor of BRAF mutation in our cohort. Using age < 55 y as a surrogate for BRAF mutation in an independent cohort of 4,785 patients of the Southern German Tumor Registry, we found a significant survival benefit (p < 0.0001) for patients who, based on their age, were predicted to have BRAF mutant melanomas in 69% of the cases. This group also showed a different pattern of metastasis, more frequently involving regional lymph nodes, compared to the patients predicted to have no BRAF mutation and who more frequently displayed satellite, in-transit metastasis, and visceral metastasis (p < 0.0001).;Refined morphological classification of primary melanomas can be used to improve existing melanoma classifications by forming subgroups that are genetically more homogeneous and likely to differ in important clinical variables such as outcome and pattern of metastasis.

An extensive literature search and interrogation of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database identified more than 1,000 melanoma mutations. Applying a filtering strategy to focus on mutations amenable to the development of targeted drugs, we initially screened 120 known mutations in 271 samples using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. A total of 252 mutations were detected in 17 genes, the highest frequency occurred in BRAF (n = 154, 57%), NRAS (n = 55, 20%), CDK4 (n = 8, 3%), PTK2B (n = 7, 2.5%), and ERBB4 (n = 5, 2%). Based on this initial discovery screen, a total of 46 assays interrogating 39 mutations in 20 genes were designed to develop a melanoma-specific panel. These assays were distributed in multiplexes over 8 wells using strict assay design parameters optimized for sensitive mutation detection. The final melanoma-specific mutation panel is a cost effective, sensitive, high-throughput approach for identifying mutations of clinical relevance to molecular-based therapeutics for the treatment of melanoma.

It is commonly recognized that to overcome resistance and improve outcome, treatment should be guided by tumor biology, which includes genotype, epigenotype, and gene expression profile. We therefore took an integrative approach to better understand melanoma cell response to clinically relevant dose of decitabine and identify complementary targets for combined therapy. We employed eight different melanoma cell strains, determined their growth, apoptotic and DNA damage responses to increasing doses of decitabine, and chose a low, clinically relevant drug dose to perform whole-genome differential gene expression, bioinformatic analysis, and protein validation studies. The data ruled out the DNA damage response, demonstrated the involvement of p21(Cip1) in a p53-independent manner, identified the TGFbeta pathway genes CLU and TGFBI as markers of sensitivity to decitabine and revealed an effect on histone modification as part of decitabine-induced gene expression. Mutation analysis and knockdown by siRNA implicated activated beta-catenin/MITF, but not BRAF, NRAS or PTEN mutations as a source for resistance. The importance of protein stability predicted from the results was validated by the synergistic effect of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in enhancing the growth arrest of decitabine in otherwise resistant melanoma cells.

We aimed to establish an extensive well-characterized panel of NSCLC xenograft models in the context of a long-distance research network after careful control of the preanalytical steps. One hundred fresh surgically resected NSCLC specimens were shipped in survival medium at room temperature from a hospital-integrated biobank to animal facilities. Within 24 h post-surgery, tumor fragments were subcutaneously xenografted into immunodeficient mice. PDX characterization was performed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, aCGH and next-generation sequencing approaches. For this model system, the tumor take rate was 35%, with higher rates for squamous carcinoma (60%) than for adenocarcinoma (13%). Patients for whom PDX tumors were obtained had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients for whom no PDX tumors (P = 0.039) were obtained. We established a large panel of PDX NSCLC models with a high frequency of mutations (29%) in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MEK1, BRAF, PTEN, and PI3KCA genes and with gene amplification (20%) of c-MET and FGFR1.

Specifically, we found that oncogenic forms of HRAS (HRAS(G12V)) but not its downstream target BRAF (BRAF(V600E)), engaged a rapid cell-cycle arrest that was associated with massive vacuolization and expansion of the ER. However, neither p53, p16(INK4a) nor classical senescence markers--such as foci of heterochromatin or DNA damage--were able to account for the specific response of melanocytes to HRAS(G12V). Instead, HRAS(G12V)-driven senescence was mediated by the ER-associated unfolded protein response (UPR). The impact of HRAS on the UPR was selective, as it was poorly induced by activated NRAS (more frequently mutated in melanoma than HRAS). These results argue against premature senescence as a converging mechanism of response to activating oncogenes and support a direct role of the ER as a gatekeeper of tumour control.",

Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations, we show that ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome formation, as well as the translation of growth-related messenger RNAs containing a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth in mice.

Cell culture and animals studies have elucidated several cellular and molecular mechanisms by which phytochemicals act in the prevention and treatment of metastatic melanoma. Several promising phytochemicals, such as, fisetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resveratrol, curcumin, proanthocyanidins, silymarin, apigenin, capsaicin, genistein, indole-3-carbinol, and luteolin are gaining considerable attention and found in a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, roots, and herbs. In this review, we will discuss the preventive potential, therapeutic effects, bioavailability and structure activity relationship of these selected phytochemicals for the management of melanoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Routine molecular testing in acute myeloid leukemia involves screening several genes of therapeutic and prognostic significance for mutations. A comprehensive analysis using single-gene assays requires large amounts of DNA, is cumbersome and timely consolidation of results for clinical reporting is challenging. High throughput, next-generation sequencing platforms widely used in research have not been tested vigorously for clinical application. Here we describe the clinical application of MiSeq, a next-generation sequencing platform to screen mutational hotspots in 54 cancer-related genes including genes relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KIT and EZH2). We sequenced 63 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome using MiSeq and compared the results with those obtained using another next-generation sequencing platform, Ion-Torrent Personal Genome Machine and other conventional testing platforms. MiSeq detected a total of 100 single nucleotide variants and 23 NPM1 insertions that were confirmed by Ion Torrent or conventional platforms, indicating complete concordance. FLT3-internal tandem duplications (n=10) were not detected; however, re-analysis of the MiSeq output by Pindel, an indel detection algorithm, did detect them. Dilution studies of cancer cell-line DNA showed that the quantitative accuracy of mutation detection was up to an allelic frequency of 1.5% with a high level of inter- and intra-run assay reproducibility, suggesting potential utility for monitoring response to therapy, clonal heterogeneity and evolution. Examples demonstrating the advantages of MiSeq over conventional platforms for disease monitoring are provided. Easy work-flow, high throughput multiplexing capability, 4-day turnaround time and simultaneous assessment of routinely tested and emerging markers make MiSeq highly applicable for clinical molecular testing in acute myeloid leukemia.

We performed hybridization capture of the coding exons of 287 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes and sequenced these to deep, uniform coverage.;Actionable genomic alterations with a targeted agent based on NCCN guidelines were identified in 26% [8 of 31: EGFR G719A, BRAF V600E, SOCS5-ALK, HIP1-ALK, CD74-ROS1, KIF5B-RET (n = 2), CCDC6-RET]. Seven of these patients either received or are candidates for targeted therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling using this method also identified a genomic alteration with a targeted agent available on a clinical trial in an additional 39% (12 of 31).;Broad, hybrid capture-based NGS identified actionable genomic alterations in 65% [95% confidence interval (CI), 48%-82%] of tumors from never or light smokers with lung cancers deemed without targetable genomic alterations by earlier extensive non-NGS testing.

It remains unclear whether they are associated with other characteristics. We analyzed characteristics and outcome of 90 consecutive patients with diverse advanced tumors and PIK3CA mutations and 180 wild-type PIK3CA controls matched by tumor type, gender, and age referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy. PIK3CA and MAPK mutations (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing. The most frequent PIK3CA mutations were E545K (31/90, 34%), E542K (16/90, 18%) in exon 9, and H1047R (20/90, 22%) in exon 20. PIK3CA mutations compared to wild-type PIK3CA were associated with simultaneous KRAS (p=0.047) and MAPK mutations (p=0.03), but only MAPK mutations were confirmed as having an independent association in multivariate analysis. Rates of lung, bone, liver and brain metastases were similar in PIK3CA-mutant and wild-type patients. Patients with PIK3CA mutations treated on trials with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors had a higher partial/complete response (PR/CR) rate than wild-type PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (10/56, 18% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.045), but not a prolonged progression-free survival. Patients with H1047R PIK3CA mutations had higher PR/CR rate with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors compared to wild-type PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (6/16, 38% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.003). In conclusion, PIK3CA mutations in diverse cancers were not associated with clinical characteristics, but were correlated with MAPK mutations.

Our objective was to assess the performance of molecular cytology on preoperative thyroid nodule fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) across a broad range of variables, including independent collection sites, clinical practices, and anatomic pathology interpretations.;Single-pass FNAs were prospectively collected from 806 nodules 1 cm or larger by ultrasonography at five independent sites across the United States. Specimens were shipped in a nucleic acid stabilization solution and tested at a centralized clinical laboratory. Seventeen genetic alterations (BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS mutations, PAX8-PPARG and RET-PTC rearrangements) were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and liquid bead array cytometry in 769 FNAs that met inclusion criteria. Cytology, histology, and clinical care followed local procedures and practices. All results were double-blinded.;Thirty-two specimens (4.2%) failed to yield sufficient nucleic acid to generate molecular data. A single genetic alteration was detected in 80% of cytology malignant cases, 21% of indeterminate, 7.8% of nondiagnostic, and 3.5% of benign cases. Among 109 nodules with surgical histology reference standard, oncogenic mutations were present in 50% of malignant nodules missed by cytology. There were 14 cancers not identified by cytology or molecular tests, including 5 carcinomas with histologic sizes less than 1 cm (3 multifocal) and 8 noninvasive follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (4 encapsulated). No mutations were detected in 89% of the nodules benign by histopathology with 6 false-positive molecular results in 5 adenomas (2-5.5 cm) and 1 cystic nodule with an incidental papillary microcarcinoma (0.15 cm). The posttest probability of thyroid cancer was 100% for nodules positive for BRAF or RET-PTC, 70% for RAS or PAX8-PPARG, and 88% for molecular cytology overall.;Centralized and standardized molecular testing for genetic alterations associated with a high risk of malignancy efficiently complements the local cytopathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodule aspirates in the clinical setting.

Hence, there is an increasing need for a robust and high-throughput technology to detect oncogenic hotspot mutations. Although commercial assays are available to detect genetic alterations in single genes, only a limited amount of tissue is often available from patients, requiring multiplexing to allow for simultaneous detection of mutations in many genes using low DNA input. Even though next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms provide powerful tools for this purpose, they face challenges such as high cost, large DNA input requirement, complex data analysis, and long turnaround times, limiting their use in clinical settings. We report the development of the next generation mutation multi-analyte panel (MUT-MAP), a high-throughput microfluidic, panel for detecting 120 somatic mutations across eleven genes of therapeutic interest (AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, FGFR3, FLT3, HRAS, KIT, KRAS, MET, NRAS, and PIK3CA) using allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and Taqman technology. This mutation panel requires as little as 2 ng of high quality DNA from fresh frozen or 100 ng of DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Mutation calls, including an automated data analysis process, have been implemented to run 88 samples per day. Validation of this platform using plasmids showed robust signal and low cross-reactivity in all of the newly added assays and mutation calls in cell line samples were found to be consistent with the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database allowing for direct comparison of our platform to Sanger sequencing. High correlation with NGS when compared to the SuraSeq500 panel run on the Ion Torrent platform in a FFPE dilution experiment showed assay sensitivity down to 0.45%. This multiplexed mutation panel is a valuable tool for high-throughput biomarker discovery in personalized medicine and cancer drug development. ",

The diagnostic evaluation of these lesions is challenging, as diagnostic imaging and cytological sampling do not provide accurate information on lesion classification, the grade of dysplasia or the presence of invasion. Moreover, the molecular driver gene mutations of these precursor lesions have yet to be fully characterized. Fifty-two intraductal papillary neoplasms, including 48 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and four intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms (ITPNs), were subjected to the mutation assessment in 51 cancer-associated genes, using ion torrent semiconductor-based next-generation sequencing. P16 and Smad4 immunohistochemistry was performed on 34 IPMNs and 17 IPMN-associated carcinomas. At least one somatic mutation was observed in 46/48 (96%) IPMNs; 29 (60%) had multiple gene alterations. GNAS and/or KRAS mutations were found in 44/48 (92%) of IPMNs. GNAS was mutated in 38/48 (79%) IPMNs, KRAS in 24/48 (50%) and these mutations coexisted in 18/48 (37.5%) of IPMNs. RNF43 was the third most commonly mutated gene and was always associated with GNAS and/or KRAS mutations, as were virtually all the low-frequency mutations found in other genes. Mutations in TP53 and BRAF genes (10% and 6%) were only observed in high-grade IPMNs. P16 was lost in 7/34 IPMNs and 9/17 IPMN-associated carcinomas; Smad4 was lost in 1/34 IPMNs and 5/17 IPMN-associated carcinomas. In contrast to IPMNs, only one of four ITPNs had detectable driver gene (GNAS and NRAS) mutations. Deep sequencing DNA from seven cyst fluid aspirates identified 10 of the 13 mutations detected in their associated IPMN. Using next-generation sequencing to detect cyst fluid mutations has the potential to improve the diagnostic and prognostic stratification of pancreatic cystic neoplasms.",

Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6).

Concordance was highest in patients who underwent dual-platform sequencing prior to initiation of definitive treatment, and lowest in patients who underwent cfDNA analysis following treatment. Nineteen patients had treatment at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center following cfDNA sequencing. One patient was observed, and three patients opted for hospice. At the time of last contact, 15/23 (65%) patients were alive.;Next-generation sequencing platforms offer clinicians an opportunity to identify targetable oncogenic events in ATC. To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest sequential cohort of ATC patients who have undergone targeted genomic profiling. Based on these data, utilization of both tumor-based and cfDNA analysis in the context of clinical-trial development and application is recommended. Integration of these or similar platforms in clinical-trial implementation may have the potential to transform clinical outcomes for patients with ATC.",

Patients were enrolled onto a not-otherwise-specified arm and treated with standard-of-care therapies or one of the following five biomarker-matched treatment groups: erlotinib for EGFR mutations; selumetinib for KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, or BRAF mutations; MK2206 for PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN mutations; lapatinib for ERBB2 mutations or amplifications; and sunitinib for KIT or PDGFRA mutations or amplification.;Six hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled, and 88% had their tumors tested for at least one gene. EGFR mutation frequency was 22.1% in NSCLC, and erlotinib achieved a response rate of 60% (95% CI, 32.3% to 83.7%).

Signaling of the RAS-GTPases through the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, the first identified mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is essential in development. A group of genetic syndromes, named \"RASopathies\", had been identified which are caused by heterozygosity for germline mutations in genes that encode protein components of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Several of these clinically overlapping disorders, including Noonan syndrome, Noonan-like CBL syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type I, and Legius syndrome, predispose to cancer and abnormal myelopoiesis in infancy. This review focuses on juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a malignancy of early childhood characterized by initiating germline and/or somatic mutations in five genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway: PTPN11, CBL, NF-1, KRAS and NRAS. Natural courses of these five subtypes differ, although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative therapy option for most children with JMML. With whole-exome sequencing studies revealing few secondary lesions it will be crucial to better understand the RAS/MAPK signaling network with its crosstalks and feed-back loops to carefully design early clinical trials with novel pharmacological agents in this still puzzling leukemia.

Recurrent mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway, recently reported in ENKTL cases, are interesting in terms of both pathogenesis and inhibitor therapy. However, the frequencies of these mutations are low and variable among reports, and other pathognomonic mutations in ENKTL remain to be elucidated. In the present study, targeted capture sequencing of 602 cancer-related genes from 25 frozen ENKTL samples was performed, 11 of which were matched to normal samples. Several recurrent somatic mutations involving BCOR (32%), TP53 (16%), DDX3X (12%), FAT4 (8%), NRAS (8%), MLL3 (12%), and MIR17HG (8%) were identified. The pattern of BCOR aberrations (1 nonsense and 5 frame-shift mutations, a mutation leading to a splicing error, and gene loss) suggested that loss of function of BCOR was the functionally important outcome of such changes. The literature was reviewed and the public data on BCOR aberrations was reanalyzed and it was found that the aberrations were frequently found in myeloid neoplasms, but, interestingly, were highly specific to ENKTL among lymphoid malignancies. Given the high frequency and pattern of aberration, BCOR is likely to play an important role in ENKTL pathogenesis as a tumor suppressor gene.",

RAS genes encode small GTP-binding proteins that affect gene expression in a global way by acting as major switches in signal transduction processes, coupling extracellular signals with transcription factors. Oncogenic forms of RAS are locked in their active state and transduce signals essential for transformation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis via downstream pathways involving the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade of cytoplasmic kinases, the small GTP-binding proteins RAC and RHO, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and others. We have used subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH), a PCR-based cDNA subtraction technique, to contrast differential gene expression profiles in immortalized, non-tumorigenic rat embryo fibroblasts and in HRAS- transformed cells. Sequence and expression analysis of more than 1,200 subtracted cDNA fragments revealed transcriptional stimulation or repression of 104 ESTs, 45 novel sequences and 244 known genes in HRAS- transformed cells compared with normal cells.

However, significant downregulation of genes involved in pigmentation and upregulation of genes playing a role in DNA protection were observed. Lastly, our microarrays displayed upregulation of genes mediating chemoresistance in cancer. As alteration of pigmentation mechanisms can trigger oxidative damage, increased expression of genes involved in maintenance of DNA integrity might reflect the ability of nevocytic cells to self-protect against cellular stress. Furthermore, the observed alterations linked to chemoresistance might partially account for the well-known inefficacy of chemotherapy in malignant melanoma.",

Recurrent minimally deleted regions (MDRs) were identified at 7q36.1 (7.7%), 9q21.32 (5%), 11p13 (2.3%), and 17q11.2 (2%). Approximately one-half of the 7q deletions were detectable only by single-nucleotide polymorphism-array analysis because of their limited size. Sequence analysis of MLL3, contained within the 7q36.1 MDR, in 46 diagnostic samples revealed one truncating mutation in a leukemia lacking a 7q deletion.

Adjuvant therapy decisions may be informed by careful consideration of prognostic factors.

External beam radiation therapy is an option for nodal beds where the risk of local recurrence is very high. In-transit melanoma metastases may be treated locally with surgery, immunotherapy, radiation, or heated limb perfusion. For metastatic melanoma, the options include chemotherapy or immunotherapy; targeted anti-BRAF and anti-KIT therapy is under active investigation. Standard chemotherapy yields objective tumor responses in approximately 10%-20% of patients, and sustained remissions are uncommon. Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 yields objective tumor responses in a minority of patients; however, some of these responses may be durable. Identification of activating mutations of BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT, and GNAQ in distinct clinical subtypes of melanoma suggest that these are molecularly distinct.

In the four murine models studied herein this enhanced tumor aggressiveness could not be attributed to NRAS mutations or other hereditary changes, differential vascularization of live tumor tissues, or necrosis content. Instead, the main tumor feature associated with a more aggressive behavior was the presence of a high number of vessels, sometimes filled with inflammatory cells, inside a tumor area, which we have identified and designated as the transition zone between the live and the necrotic zones. Our experiments suggest that during tumor growth, different cachectic factors are produced within the transition and necrotic zones by dying tumor cells and by tumor infiltrating macrophages only reaching the general circulation through the vessels present in the transition zone. Therefore, a small tumor displaying high vascularization of its transition area could be harmful to its host, while, in contrast, a large tumor could behave as a relatively benign one if its transition zone exhibited little or no vascularization, and in consequence its cachectic factors remained \"trapped.\" Similar histological images to those observed in mice were seen in a significant percentage of human cancer biopsies, raising the possibility that such images might have a prognostic value.",

The transfer of alleles derived from the arthritis-resistant F344 strain at the arthritis severity locus Cia5d (RNO10), as in DA.F344(Cia5d) congenics, was enough to significantly and specifically reduce the invasive properties of FLSs. This genetically controlled difference in FLS invasion involves increased production of soluble membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) by DA, and is dependent on increased activation of MMP-2. In the present study we aimed to characterize the pattern of gene expression that correlates with differences in invasion in order to identify pathways regulated by the Cia5d locus.;Synovial tissues were collected from DA and DA.F344(Cia5d) rats 21 days after the induction of PIA. Tissues were digested and FLSs isolated. After a minimum of four passages, FLSs were plated on Matrigel-covered dishes at similar densities, followed by RNA extraction. Illumina RatRef-12 expression BeadChip arrays were used. Expression data were normalized, followed by t-test, logistic regression, and cluster analysis. Real-time PCR was used to validate the microarray data.;Out of the 22,523 RefSeq gene probes present in the array, 7,665 genes were expressed by the FLSs. The expression of 66 genes was significantly different between the DA and DA.F344(Cia5d) FLSs (P < 0.01). Nineteen of the 66 differentially expressed genes (28.7%) are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression or cancer-associated phenotypes, such as invasion and contact inhibition. These included Cxcl10, Vil2 and Nras, three genes that are upregulated in DA and known to regulate MMP-2 expression and activation. Nine of the 66 genes (13.6%) are involved in the regulation of estrogen receptor signaling or transcription. Five candidate genes located within the Cia5d interval were also differentially expressed.;We have identified a novel FLS invasion associated gene expression signature that is regulated by Cia5d. Many of the genes found to be differentially expressed were previously implicated in cancer cell phenotypes, including invasion.

Results were confirmed using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR and replicated in an independent set of 330 melanomas using AQUA analysis of tissue microarray (TMA).

The effects of dabrafenib, a selective inhibitor of the BRAFV600E kinase, and trametinib, a reversible inhibitor of MEK activity, were investigated. Dabrafenib strongly inhibited the viability in BRAF mutated cells by demonstrating G0/G1-arrest via the downregulation of MEK/ERK phosphorylation. Upregulated phosphorylation of MEK was observed in RAS mutated cells after dabrafenib treatment and caused VEGF upregulation, but was not related to the cellular proliferation. Trametinib inhibited the cellular viability to variable degrees in every cell by downregulating ERK phosphorylation. Dual blockade by both inhibitors demonstrated clear cytostatic effect in all the cells. OCUT-4 showed the weakest sensitivity to trametinib, no additional effect of either inhibitor in combination with the other, and an increase of SNAI1 mRNA expression after treatment with inhibitors, suggesting a mechanism for resistance. Our findings demonstrated the efficacy of a mutation-selective BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor in human ATC cells in a genetic alteration-specific manner.",

However, until now, rearrangements have only been detected in fresh FNA material and the number of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) was rather low in previous studies. We aimed at investigating the impact of point mutations and rearrangement detection in a set of routine air-dried FNA smears with a higher percentage of FTCs.;RNA and DNA was extracted from 310 FNAs (164 indeterminate, 57 malignant, 89 benign) and corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (156 follicular adenomas [FAs], 32 FTCs, 44 papillary thyroid carcinomas [PTCs], 9 follicular variant PTCs, and 69 goiters). PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by qPCR, BRAF and RAS mutations by high-resolution melting PCR and by pyrosequencing.;Forty-seven mutations were detected in the FNAs: 22 BRAF, 13 NRAS, and 3 HRAS mutations, 8 PAX8/PPARG, and one RET/PTC-rearrangement. While the presence of a BRAF and RET/PTC mutation was associated with cancer in 100% of samples each, the presence of a RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutation was associated with cancer in only 12% and 50% of samples, respectively. In the indeterminate group 4 of 25 carcinomas were identified by molecular FNA screening, which increased the sensitivity from 67% (cytology alone) to 75% (cytology plus molecular screening).;Molecular screening for point mutations and rearrangements is feasible in air-dried FNAs. Although the impact of detecting point mutations and rearrangements in FNAs has most likely been overestimated in previous studies, molecular FNA analyses improve presurgical diagnostics. The detection of BRAF mutations in FNA may improve the choice of surgery and postsurgical treatment. Further data are necessary to elucidate the true impact of detecting RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutations in FNAs. The inclusion of additional rare somatic mutations and miRNA markers might further improve the impact of molecular FNA diagnostics.",

Aberration in the response to growth inhibitors leads to the escape of the cell from the cell cycle control mechanisms and may lead to the development of malignancies. The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, activation of oncogenes leads to the acquisition of an invasive and increasingly malignant immunophenotype and secretory profile by transformed cells. The commencement of the complex process of carcinogenesis, and subsequent, rapid tumor growth and progression of mammalian neoplasms depends upon the continuous de novo formation of capillaries (angiogenesis). The generation of a malignant, invasive cellular immunophenotype (CIP) and distant metastases, as aspects of tumor progression, are also NRA-dependent processes. Specific molecules with cytostatic/cytotoxic growth inhibitory effects represent a very diverse group of factors. Growth inhibitors may regulate the cell cycle at various levels, and growth inhibitors comprise a heterogeneous group of agents including cytokines, growth factors, steroid hormones, etc. The phenomenon of multidrug resistance to a wide spectrum of cytostatic/cytotoxic agents has posed a major difficulty in the effective chemotherapeutical treatment of cancer patients. The development of novel therapeutic regimens should be based on the observations of the growth inhibitory profile of the particular malignancy, in addition to its immunophenotype and genotype, and the devisement of 'individualized' combinations of factors, including gene and immuno-therapeutical options, targeting different aspects of the malignant disease.",

Despite technologic advancements over the past decade, little is known about the somatic changes that occur in these tumors. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of common oncogenes in resected cholangiocarcinoma specimens that could provide potential therapeutic targets for patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 94 resected cholangiocarcinomas were used to extract DNA from areas comprising more than 20% tumor. Specimens were evaluated using the Sequenom MassARRAY OncoCarta Mutation Profiler Panel (San Diego, CA). This matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry single genotyping panel evaluates 19 oncogenes for 238 somatic mutations. Twenty-five mutations were identified in 23 of the 94 cholangiocarcinomas within the following oncogenes: KRAS (n = 12), PIK3CA (n = 5), MET (n = 4), EGFR (n = 1), BRAF (n = 2), and NRAS (n = 1). Mutations were identified in 7 (26%) of 27 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 16 (24%) of 67 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. When combined with IDH1/2 testing, 40 (43%) of the 94 cholangiocarcinomas had a detectable mutation. MassARRAY technology can be used to detect mutations in a wide variety of oncogenes using paraffin-embedded tissue. Clinical testing for somatic mutations may drive personalized therapy selection for cholangiocarcinomas in the future. The variety of mutations detected suggests that a multiplexed mutation detection approach may be necessary for managing patients with biliary tract malignancy.",

The genetic mutations of PDGFRA were unrelated to the age, thickness, and ulceration status of primary melanomas. Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA.

Three months later, the flat part increased in height, the dilated round pits were partly replaced by type IIIL pits, and capillary vessels were evident. The lesion was removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection, and diagnosed pathologically as tubular adenoma. We performed the sequence analyses on KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA genes in flat part and nodular part separately, and a mutation of KRAS gene at codon 146 was observed at only nodular part, suggesting probable that nodular part be a precancerous lesion.;This is a unique and suggestive case, providing information on progression of LST-Gs at the very early stage to carcinogenesis.",

RNA G-quadruplex structures are general inhibitors of cap-dependent mRNA translation and were recently shown to be targeted for oncoprotein translational activation. In contrast however, the G-quadruplex within the 5'UTR of the human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) has been shown to be essential for IRES-mediated translation. Since VEGF has a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis and is a major target of anti-tumoral therapies, we investigated the structure/function relationship of the VEGF G-quadruplex and defined whether it could have a therapeutic potential. We found that the G-quadruplex within the VEGF IRES is dispensable for cap-independent function and activation in stress conditions. However, stabilization of the VEGF G-quadruplex by increasing the G-stretches length or by replacing it with the one of NRAS results in strong inhibition of IRES-mediated translation of VEGF. We also demonstrate that G-quadruplex ligands stabilize the VEGF G-quadruplex and inhibit cap-independent translation in vitro. Importantly, the amount of human VEGF mRNA associated with polysomes decreases in the presence of a highly selective stabilizing G-quadruplex ligand, resulting in reduced VEGF protein expression. Together, our results uncover the existence of functionally silent G-quadruplex structures that are susceptible to conversion into efficient repressors of cap-independent mRNA translation. These findings have implications for the in vivo applications of G-quadruplex-targeting compounds and for anti-angiogenic therapies. ",

Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines. In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas. The numerous focal amplifications and HDs we have documented here are the first step toward identifying a comprehensive catalog of genes involved in melanoma development, some of which may be useful prognostic markers or targets for therapies to treat this disease.",

NS shares many clinical features with a group of developmental disorders including Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Recently, KRAS and SOS1 were identified as causative genes for NS. Moreover, mutations in several genes associated with the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including HRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 were identified in patients with Costello syndrome and CFC syndrome. Accordingly, this study carried out mutation analysis of nine genes including PTPN11, SOS1, GRB2, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 associated with the Ras-MAPK pathway in 14 Korean patients with NS. Seven patients were found to have mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Mutation analyses of the other genes did not reveal any disease causing mutations except for one unclassified variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the HRAS gene (c.*1C>T). The patient's father also had the same substitution with the normal phenotype. Therefore, this variation is believed to be either a rare polymorphism or a disease-related variation with variable penetrance. The Ras-MAPK pathway has now emerged as a key cascade in a group of similar developmental disorders as well as in many types of cancers. This study found that, with the exception of PTPN11, mutations in genes related to the Ras-MAPK pathway appear to be uncommon, at least in Korean patients with NS.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The small GTP-binding proteins HRAS, KRAS and NRAS belong to a family of oncoproteins associated with many types of human cancer. Signal transduction processes initiated at receptor tyrosine kinases converge on RAS proteins which serve as molecular switches linking upstream signals with the transcriptional machinery. RAS proteins interact with a number of effector proteins that in turn activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, the PI3K/PKB/Akt pathway, the RalGDS/Ral pathway and other downstream pathways. Mutations in RAS lock the protein in its active form. Chronic activation of the KRAS isoform is the basis for resistance toward antibody therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases, as an upstream stimulus through growth factor receptor-mediated activation is no longer required. However, the complexity of the RAS signaling system necessitates the search for additional activating mechanisms as well as biomarkers associated with pathway activation. During recent years, several RAS pathway-related gene signatures were identified, mostly by microarray-based gene expression profiling of normal versus RAS-transformed cells. The signatures can serve as a source of common biomarkers indicating functionally relevant downstream effects of the RAS signaling system. In searching for new markers, we compared the gene expression signatures compiled in 24 independent studies. We analyzed differentially regulated genes recovered in microarray studies on human specimens to discriminate paired normal and tumor tissues. Although the overlap between individual studies was low, this meta-analysis revealed Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), the CD44 antigen and members of the epidermal growth factor (EGR)-family as common downstream effectors of RAS.",

Molecular parameters (DNA sequences of mutation hot spots in AKT1, ALK, APC, BRAF, CDH1, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2, FBXW7, FGFR2, FOXL2, GNAQ, GNAS, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, MSH6, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, SF3B1, SMAD4, SRC, SRSF2, STK11, TP53, and U2AF1; copy numbers for EGFR, c-myc, FGFR, PLAG, c-met) were assessed. None of the patients had axillary lymph node involvement. In 13 cases, local recurrence developed after surgery (30.9 %). Distant metastasis occurred in seven patients (17 %; four after local recurrence). The most frequent genetic alteration was PIK3CA mutation (50 % of cases). None of the pathological parameters (size, grade, stage, Ki-67 labeling index) was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). PIK3CA mutation, especially the H1047R type, tended to adversely affect OS. Type of resection (mastectomy vs. breast-conserving therapy, width of margins) or adjuvant radiotherapy had no influence on DFS or OS, whereas in the group treated with radio-/chemotherapy, no local recurrence or metastasis and no death occurred. We conclude that the spindle cell type of MBC with myoepithelial features exhibits a higher frequency of PIK3CA mutation than other types of metaplastic or basal-like breast cancer and may benefit from combined radio-/chemotherapy.

Mutually exclusive activating mutations in NRAS or BRAF have been identified in approximately 85% of melanomas, and components of this pathway have been developed as molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. We and others have shown that inhibition of this pathway with specific small molecule MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors induces a wide range of apoptotic responsiveness in human melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. To define the molecular mechanism underlying variable apoptotic sensitivity of melanoma cells to MEK inhibition, we examined the expression and subcellular localization of Bcl-2 family members in a comprehensive set of human melanoma cell lines. Whereas the proapoptotic protein Bim was activated and localized to the mitochondrial membrane in all cell lines regardless of apoptotic sensitivity, Bmf activation and cytosolic translocation was exclusive to sensitive cells. In resistant cells, Bmf remained sequestered to the cytoskeleton through dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) binding. Overexpression of Bmf in resistant cells did not enhance apoptosis, whereas expression of mutant BmfA69P, which has decreased binding to DLC2, promoted cell death. Expression of BmfA69P mutants possessing the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain mutation L138A, which impairs BH3 interactions, did not enhance apoptosis in resistant cells. RNA interference targeting Bim and Bmf provided protection from apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition. These results show a novel role for Bmf in promoting apoptosis and provide insight into the mechanism of apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibition in melanoma.",

HR-HPV status was determined on the basis of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for p16 expression and chromogenic in-situ hybridization (CISH) for HR-HPV. All cases were genotyped with a multiplexed mass spectrometry assay interrogating 91 hotspot mutations in eight cancer-related genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, MEK1 and ERBB2), and studied by fluorescence in-situ hybridization for PTEN copy number alteration. Three of eight cases (37.5%) were positive for the presence of HR-HPV by CISH and p16 IHC. One of three (33%) HR-HPV-positive cases harboured a PTEN hemizygous deletion, and one (33%) HR-HPV-positive case harboured a PIK3CA E545K somatic mutation. No alteration of the PTEN-PI3K pathway was detected in HR-HPV-negative tumours.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, transcriptional profiles of four normal thyroids and 51 papillary carcinomas (PCs) were generated using DNA microarrays. The tumors were genotyped for their common activating mutations: BRAF V600E point mutation, RET/PTC1 and 3 rearrangement and point mutations of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS. Principal component analysis based on the entire expression data set separated the PCs into three groups that were found to reflect tumor morphology and mutational status. By combining expression profiles with mutational status, we defined distinct expression profiles for the BRAF, RET/PTC and RAS mutation groups. Using small numbers of genes, a simple classifier was able to classify correctly the mutational status of all 40 tumors with known mutations. One tumor without a detectable mutation was predicted by the classifier to have a RET/PTC rearrangement and was shown to contain one by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Among the mutation-specific expression signatures were genes whose differential expression was a direct consequence of the mutation, as well as genes involved in a variety of biological processes including immune response and signal transduction. Expression of one mutation-specific differentially expressed gene, TPO, was validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and tissue arrays containing an independent set of tumors. The results demonstrate that mutational status is the primary determinant of gene expression variation within these tumors, a finding that may have clinical and diagnostic significance and predicts success for therapies designed to prevent the consequences of these mutations.",

Treatments developed to target a specific signaling pathway may not be effective when tumor activating mutations occur downstream of the target and bypass the targeted mechanism. For instance, mutations detected in KRAS/BRAF/NRAS genes can lead to EGFR-independent intracellular signaling pathway activation. Most patients with these mutations do not respond well to anti-EGFR treatment. In an effort to detect various mutations in FFPE tissue samples among multiple solid tumor types for patient stratification many mutation assays were evaluated. Since there were more than 30 specific mutations among three targeted RAS/RAF oncogenes that could activate MAPK pathway genes, a custom designed Single Nucleotide Primer Extension (SNPE) multiplexing mutation assay was developed and analytically validated as a clinical trial assay. Throughout the process of developing and validating the assay we overcame many technical challenges which include: the designing of PCR primers for FFPE tumor tissue samples versus normal blood samples, designing of probes for detecting consecutive nucleotide double mutations, the kinetics and thermodynamics aspects of probes competition among themselves and against target PCR templates, as well as validating an assay when positive control tumor tissue or cell lines with specific mutations are not available. We used Next Generation sequencing to resolve discordant calls between the SNPE mutation assay and Sanger sequencing. We also applied a triplicate rule to reduce potential false positives and false negatives, and proposed special considerations including pre-define a cut-off percentage for detecting very low mutant copies in the wild-type DNA background.

The NCI/COG TARGET-AML initiative used whole exome capture sequencing (WXS) to interrogate the genomic landscape of matched trios representing specimens collected upon diagnosis, remission, and relapse from 20 cases of de novo childhood AML. One hundred forty-five somatic variants at diagnosis (median 6 mutations/patient) and 149 variants at relapse (median 6.5 mutations) were identified and verified by orthogonal methodologies. Recurrent somatic variants [in (greater than or equal to) 2 patients] were identified for 10 genes (FLT3, NRAS, PTPN11, WT1, TET2, DHX15, DHX30, KIT, ETV6, KRAS), with variable persistence at relapse. The variant allele fraction (VAF), used to measure the prevalence of somatic mutations, varied widely at diagnosis. Mutations that persisted from diagnosis to relapse had a significantly higher diagnostic VAF compared with those that resolved at relapse (median VAF 0.43 vs. 0.24, P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that 90% of the diagnostic variants with VAF >0.4 persisted to relapse compared with 28% with VAF <0.2 (P < 0.001). This study demonstrates significant variability in the mutational profile and clonal evolution of pediatric AML from diagnosis to relapse.

In an effort to molecularly profile these subtypes of ampullary carcinomas, we conducted a two-phase study. In the discovery phase, we identified 18 pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinomas and 14 intestinal-type ampullary carcinomas using stringent pathologic criteria and performed next-generation sequencing targeting 279 cancer-associated genes on these tumors. Although the results showed overlapping of genomic alterations between the two subtypes, trends including more frequent KRAS alterations in pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma (61 vs 29%) and more frequent mutations in APC in intestinal-type ampullary carcinoma (43 vs 17%) were observed. Of the entire cohort of 32 tumors, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53 (n=17); the most frequently amplified gene was ERBB2 (n=5); and the most frequently deleted gene was CDKN2A (n=6). In the second phase of the study, we aimed at validating our observation on ERBB2 and assessed ERBB2 amplification and protein overexpression in a series of 100 ampullary carcinomas. We found that (1) gene amplification and immunohistochemical overexpression of ERBB2 occurred in 13% of all ampullary carcinomas, therefore providing a potential target for anti-HER2 therapy in these tumors; (2) amplification and immunohistochemical expression correlated in all cases, thus indicating that immunohistochemistry could be used to screen tumors; and (3) none of the 14 ERBB2-amplified tumors harbored any downstream driver mutations in KRAS/NRAS, whereas 56% of the cases negative for ERBB2 amplification did, an observation clinically pertinent as downstream mutations may cause primary resistance to inhibition of EGFR family members.

Predictive biomarkers play a key role in patient selection, while diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers expand our understanding of tumor biology, suggest treatment combinations, and facilitate discovery of novel drug targets. We have developed a high-throughput microfluidics method for mutation detection (MUT-MAP, mutation multi-analyte panel) based on TaqMan or allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) assays. We analyzed a set of 71 mutations across six genes of therapeutic interest. The six-gene mutation panel was designed to detect the most common mutations in the EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, NRAS, BRAF, and AKT1 oncogenes. The DNA was preamplified using custom-designed primer sets before the TaqMan/AS-PCR assays were carried out using the Biomark microfluidics system (Fluidigm; South San Francisco, CA). A cross-reactivity analysis enabled the generation of a robust automated mutation-calling algorithm which was then validated in a series of 51 cell lines and 33 FFPE clinical samples. All detected mutations were confirmed by other means. Sample input titrations confirmed the assay sensitivity with as little as 2 ng gDNA, and demonstrated excellent inter- and intra-chip reproducibility. Parallel analysis of 92 clinical trial samples was carried out using 2-100 ng genomic DNA (gDNA), allowing the simultaneous detection of multiple mutations. DNA prepared from both fresh frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were used, and the analysis was routinely completed in 2-3 days: traditional assays require 0.5-1 µg high-quality DNA, and take significantly longer to analyze. This assay can detect a wide range of mutations in therapeutically relevant genes from very small amounts of sample DNA. As such, the mutation assay developed is a valuable tool for high-throughput biomarker discovery and validation in personalized medicine and cancer drug development.",

Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been described in many carcinomas, but little is known about the significance of mismatch repair in gallbladder carcinogenesis. Additionally, methylation status of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1), a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation, has defined distinct subsets of other cancer types but has not been explored in GBC. Immunohistochemical expression of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 and LINE-1 mRNA in situ hybridization was evaluated in 67 primary and 15 metastatic GBCs from 77 patients. Amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Genotyping for 24 genes involved in carcinogenesis was performed using a multiplex PCR-based platform. MSI was present in 6 of 77 GBCs (7.8 %). Loss of MSH2/MSH6 was detected in five cases and loss of MLH1/PMS2 in one case. MSI status was not associated with Lynch syndrome, tumor grade, extracellular mucin, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. There was no significant difference in mean overall survival of patients with and without MSI. Strong LINE-1 staining was identified in none of the GBC with MSI and in 36 of 69 (52 %) of those without MSI (p = 0.005), suggesting that LINE-1 in the former cohort was hypermethylated. All MSI tumors were negative for HER2 amplification, and TP53 and NRAS mutations were only found in GBC without MSI. MSI was identified in a minority of GBC cases. The strong correlation between global DNA methylation as measured by LINE-1 and loss of mismatch repair proteins suggests that methylation may account for the loss of these proteins. These hypermethylated tumors appear to represent a genetically unique cohort of gallbladder neoplasms, and the data suggests that demethylating agents may have a therapeutic value in this class of tumors.",

Understanding the communication between cancer cells and MSCs has become fundamental to determine whether MSC-tumor interactions should be exploited as a vehicle for therapeutic agents or considered a target for intervention. Therefore, we investigated whether conditioned medium from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs-CM) modulate glioma tumor cells by analyzing several cell biology processes in vitro. C6 rat glioma cells were treated with ADSCs-CM, and cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell viability, cell morphology, adhesion, migration, and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related surface markers were analyzed. ADSCs-CM did not alter cell viability, cell cycle, and growth rate of C6 glioma cells but increased their migratory capacity. Moreover, C6 cells treated with ADSC-CM showed reduced adhesion and underwent changes in cell morphology. Up-regulation of EMT-associated markers (vimentin, MMP2, and NRAS) was also observed following treatment with ADSC-CM. Our findings demonstrate that the paracrine factors released by ADSCs are able to modulate glioma cell biology. Therefore, ADSC-tumor cell interactions in a tumor microenvironment must be considered in the design of clinical application of stem cell therapy. Graphical Abstract Factors released by adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) may modulate the biology of C6 glioma cells. When C6 cells are exposed to a conditioned medium from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs-CM), some of these cells can undergo an EMT-like process and trans-differentiate into cells with a more mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by enhanced expression of EMT-related surface markers, reduced cell adhesion capacity, increased migratory capacity, as well as changes in cell and nuclei morphology.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The incidence of melanoma is rising. The primary initial treatment for melanoma continues to be wide local excision of the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes. Exceptions to wide local excision include cases where surgical excision may be cosmetically disfiguring or associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The role of definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy has largely been relegated to palliative measures because melanoma has been viewed as a prototypical radiotherapy-resistant cancer. However, the emerging clinical and radiobiological data summarized here suggests that many types of effective radiation therapy, such as radiosurgery for melanoma brain metastases, plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma, intensity modulated radiotherapy for melanoma of the head and neck, and adjuvant radiotherapy for selected high-risk, node-positive patients can improve outcomes. Similarly, although certain chemotherapeutic agents and biologics have shown limited responses, long-term control for unresectable tumors or disseminated metastatic disease has been rather disappointing. Recently, several powerful new biologics and treatment combinations have yielded new hope for this patient group. The recent identification of several clinically linked melanoma gene mutations involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as BRAF, NRAS, and cKIT has breathed new life into the drive to develop more effective therapies. Some of these new therapeutic approaches relate to DNA damage repair inhibitors, cellular immune system activation, and pharmacological cell cycle checkpoint manipulation. Others relate to the investigation of more effective targeting and dosing schedules for underutilized therapeutics, such as radiotherapy. This paper summarizes some of these new findings and attempts to give some context to the renaissance in melanoma therapeutics and the potential role for multimodality regimens, which include certain types of radiotherapy as aids to locoregional control in sensitive tissues.",
