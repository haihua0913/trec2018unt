We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of nilotinib, a KIT inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT alterations, either mutations or amplifications.;This study was open-label, single center, prospective phase II clinical trial. Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).;Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events.;We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies. Currently, phase II nilotinib trial is ongoing in Korea as multi-center study.",

This raises the question of whether other aberrations are occurring in the MAP kinase cascade in the melanoma types with infrequent mutations of BRAF and NRAS.;We analyzed array comparative genomic hybridization data from 102 primary melanomas (38 from mucosa, 28 from acral skin, and 18 from skin with and 18 from skin without chronic sun-induced damage) for DNA copy number aberrations specific to melanoma subtypes where mutations in BRAF and NRAS are infrequent. A narrow amplification on 4q12 was found, and candidate genes within it were analyzed.;Oncogenic mutations in KIT were found in three of seven tumors with amplifications. Examination of all 102 primary melanomas found mutations and/or copy number increases of KIT in 39% of mucosal, 36% of acral, and 28% of melanomas on chronically sun-damaged skin, but not in any (0%) melanomas on skin without chronic sun damage. Seventy-nine percent of tumors with mutations and 53% of tumors with multiple copies of KIT demonstrated increased KIT protein levels.;KIT is an important oncogene in melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in BRAF or c-kit have been reported in malignant melanoma. Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state. These results have important implications concerning the mechanism of oncogenesis in melanoma as well as in the response of the tumor to anticancer drugs targeting BRAF or c-kit.",

We therefore examined the expression and mutations of KIT in 4 primary and 24 metastatic acral and mucosal melanomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong KIT protein expression in 13 (48%) tumors. Sequence analysis revealed K642E and D820Y mutations in two metastases. Amplification of KIT was identified by real-time PCR in 4 tumors, including one that had K642E. Western blot analysis showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor in 8 (62%) of 13 cryopreserved samples, indicating the frequent pathological activation of the receptor in vivo. Phosphorylation of KIT protein was detected in 2 tumors harboring KIT mutations, as well as in one tumor with KIT gene amplification. Furthermore, 5 tumors without detectable KIT gene aberrations showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in melanoma cells as well as stromal cells suggests SCF/KIT autocrine and paracrine activation in these tumors. Finally, we found significant growth suppressive effects of sunitinib in two acral melanoma cell lines; one harboring the D820Y mutation and one showing SCF-dependent KIT activation. These results show pathological activation of KIT in a substantial number of metastatic tumors of acral and mucosal melanomas, and suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of sunitinib for these melanomas.",

Currently, the limited data regarding KIT mutational status in ocular melanoma suggest that activating mutations are extremely rare. PDGFRA mutational status in ocular melanoma has not been determined. Seventy-five ocular melanomas (53 choroidal, 6 iris, 11 ciliary body, and 5 conjuctival) were selected from the files of the Department of Ophthalmology. High-resolution melting curve analysis and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. Results of mutational analysis were correlated with anatomical site and KIT (CD117) immunohistochemistry. Eight of 75 (11%) ocular melanomas contained mutations in either the KIT or PDGFRA gene. Five of 53 (9%) choroidal melanomas were associated with mutations (KIT exon 11=3; KIT exon 17=1; PDGFRA intron 18=1). Two of six (33%) iris melanomas and a single (9%) ciliary body melanoma harbored KIT exon 11 mutations. No mutations were identified in conjunctival melanomas. The distribution of KIT and PDGFRA mutations by ocular melanoma anatomical site did not reach statistical significance (P=0.393) CD117 positivity was not predictive of KIT mutational status as only 6 of 58 (10%) CD177-positive tumors harbored KIT mutations.

KIT and PDGFRA mutations do occur in ocular melanomas at a frequency (11%) that is similar to acral and mucosal melanomas. Limited correlation of CD117 positivity with mutational status suggests that all ocular melanomas should undergo mutational analysis to determine if imatinib therapy is appropriate.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mucosal melanoma is a rare, aggressive histologic subtype of malignant melanoma, and prognosis for patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma is very poor. In general, conventional cytotoxic agents alone or in combination with immunologic drugs have limited clinical benefit. Advances in molecular analytic techniques have helped researchers discover genetic aberrations in KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, in nearly 40% of patients with mucosal melanoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that hot-spot mutations, mostly substitutions in exons 11 and 13, result in constitutive activation of KIT and its downstream signal transduction pathways, such as the MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. KIT inhibitors, most notably imatinib, have shown promising clinical activity in KIT-mutant advanced melanoma, including mucosal melanoma, with clinical response rates exceeding 35% in patients with hot-spot mutations in exon 11 or 13 and/or a high mutant/wild-type allelic ratio. However, the duration of disease control is rather short in general, and treatment with KIT inhibitors as single agents is not optimal. Well-designed mechanistic studies aimed at assessing molecular differences between various KIT mutations or other aberrations and mechanisms of resistance are urgently needed to improve KIT-targeting therapy for melanoma. In addition, with availability of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies, immunotherapies using those inhibitors alone or in combinations of such immunotherapies with KIT inhibitors may lead to more effective therapeutic regimens. This review discusses the rationale for KIT inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma and the findings of preclinical and clinical studies of KIT inhibitors in this patient population.

The more recent identification of multiple molecular mechanisms underlying the development, progression, and prognosis of melanoma has led to a new paradigm for the management of this disease, has created new therapeutic opportunities, and has led to improved clinical outcomes. Such advances, however, are dependent upon methods that can reproducibly identify key molecular alterations within an individual tumor, define clinically relevant genetic subgroups of disease, and permit improved patient selection for targeted therapies.Melanomas harboring genetic alterations of KIT have been demonstrated to constitute one such molecular subgroup of disease. In this chapter, we will discuss the biology of KIT in melanoma, review the rationale for and clinical data regarding KIT inhibition in melanomas harboring activating alterations of KIT, propose guidelines for the selection of patients for KIT inhibitor therapy, and, finally, present laboratory methods for KIT assessment in melanoma.

Through an initial whole-genome screen for aberrant promoter methylation in melanoma, we identified the KIT promoter as a target for hypermethylation in 43/110 melanoma cell lines, and in 3/12 primary and 11/29 metastatic cutaneous melanomas. Methylation density at the KIT promoter correlated inversely with promoter activity in vitro and in vivo, and the expression of KIT was restored after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Hypermethylation of KIT showed no direct or inverse correlations with well-documented melanoma drivers. Growth of melanoma cells in the presence of SCF led to reduced KIT expression and increased methylation density at the KIT promoter, suggesting that SCF may exert a selection pressure for the loss of KIT. The frequent loss of KIT in cutaneous melanoma by promoter hypermethylation suggests that distinct KIT signaling pathways have opposing roles in the pathogenesis of melanoma subtypes. ",

It was recently reported that gain-of-function KIT mutations and/or copy number increases are more common in mucosal and acral melanomas.

We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case. Of the 97 mucosal or acral melanoma specimens, 49 were tested for KIT gene copy number changes using quantitative PCR. Increased KIT copy number was identified in 15 patients: seven (40%) of 20 acral melanomas and eight (31%) of 26 mucosal melanomas.

The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found.

Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Mutational analyses for KIT exons 9 and 11, and BRAF were performed on cases with 3+ labeling. Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage.

The role of c-KIT signaling in melanoma has been controversial; although c-KIT activity is critical to melanocyte development, its expression tends to be lost in most melanomas. Some reports have even shown that the re-expression of c-KIT induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. The recent publication of work showing the presence of activating c-KIT mutations in acral and mucosal melanomas, as well as melanomas arising on skin with chronic sun damage, has renewed interest in c-KIT signaling in melanoma. Recent work from our own laboratory has further identified melanomas with constitutive c-KIT signaling activity resulting from c-KIT receptor overexpression. Although the initial clinical trials of the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate in melanoma were negative, some dramatic responses have been seen in patients with very high c-KIT expression and/or documented activating mutations, fostering the belief that focused studies in patients selected on the basis of c-KIT mutational status will yield more encouraging results.

We report a case of amelanotic subungual melanoma with multiple metastases that was associated with KIT mutation and vitiligo. An 85-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of a tender erythematous ulcerated tumor on the left third fingertip and developed hypopigmented patches on the face and trunk. Histopathological examination of the ulcerative tumor showed aggregates of tumor cells that were pleomorphic epithelioid cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells was positive for S100, HMB45, and c-Kit. Histopathological findings from the hypopigmented patch on the face were consistent with vitiligo. Mutation analysis showed a KIT mutation in exon 17 (Y823D). The patient had metastasis to the brain, liver, bone, and both lungs. The patient refused chemotherapy, and died 3 months after the first visit. ",

However, it is now clear that melanoma is not a single entity, but can be molecularly divided into subtypes that generally correspond to the anatomical location of the primary melanoma. Melanomas from acral lentiginous, mucosal, and chronic sun-damaged sites frequently harbor activating mutations and/or increased copy number in the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor gene, which are very rare in the more common cutaneous tumors. Multiple case reports and early observations from clinical trials suggest that targeting mutant KIT with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is efficacious in KIT mutant melanoma.

In Wv/Wv-RET (304/B6)-transgenic mice, in which c-Kit function was severely impaired, development of melanoma was strongly suppressed. Although 31 of the 44 original RET-transgenic mice died of rapidly growing melanoma within 12 months after birth, only 8 of the 44 Wv/Wv-RET-transgenic mice developed slowly growing melanocytic tumors with a greatly prolonged mean tumor-free period, 2 of which died of melanoma at a late stage. Even Wv/+-RET-transgenic mice had a clearly prolonged tumor-free period and definitely reduced frequency (6 of 61) of tumor death within 12 months after birth. Melanin production in the skin of these mice was not strongly impaired, suggesting that c-Kit affects the development of melanomas in these mice with only minor effects in melanin production. c-Kit expression in skin soon after birth was promoted in RET-transgenic mice, and c-Kit was expressed at high levels at the benign but not malignant stage of the tumor. A single injection of anti-c-Kit antibody (ACK2) into RET-transgenic mice soon after birth caused a surprisingly long-lasting suppression of development of melanoma, greatly prolonging the tumor-free period, and none of the 28 ACK2-treated RET-transgenic mice died from tumors at 12 months of age. The c-Kit function needed for melanin production was also suppressed for an unusually long time in ACK2-treated, RET-transgenic mice.

In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment.

Recent advances in our understanding of the genetic profile of melanoma cells and the molecular factors that drive malignant transformation have resulted in the identification of numerous new therapeutic targets.

By sequencing exons and intron borders, 36 SNPs and one indel were identified. Of 10 coding SNPs, three were non-synonymous mutations, likely to affect the protein conformation. A promising variant, located in exon 19 (p.Val870Ala), was genotyped in a MeLiM × Duroc cross, and an association analysis was conducted on several melanoma-related traits. This variant showed a significant association with melanoma development, tumor ulceration and cutaneous invasion.

However, justification for such a distinction is controversial because of histological overlap and lack of prognostic significance. We analyzed chromosomal aberrations of 15 AMs and 15 SSMs that were comparable for tumor thickness and patient age, using comparative genomic hybridization. All AMs had at least one (mean, 2.0) gene amplification, significantly more than the SSMs, in which only 2 of 15 (13%) had one amplification each (P < 0.0001). At least 15 different genomic regions were amplified in AM. These involved small portions of chromosomal arms, sometimes including known oncogenes implicated in melanoma. The most frequently amplified regions in AMs occurred at 11q13 (47%), 22q11-13 (40%), and 5p15 (20%). Comparison of the amplification levels of invasive and noninvasive portions of the tumors using fluorescence in situ hybridization suggested that amplifications occurred before the formation of the invasive portion. The finding of amplifications of 11q13 in three of five additional cases of AM in situ further supports the notion that amplifications arise early in the progression of AM. Very significantly, we found isolated melanocytes with amplifications in the epidermis up to 3 mm beyond the histologically recognizable extent of the melanomas in 5 of 15 invasive AMs. In conclusion, our data show that AM is a distinct type of melanoma characterized by focused gene amplifications occurring early in tumorigenesis, and that malignant cells are present beyond the histologically detectable boundary, thereby revealing one mechanism of local recurrence.",

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 42409-42418). We have shown that stem cell factor (SCF) is involved in the proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes and that c-Kit is expressed in 75% of primary uveal melanomas. This suggests that the acquisition of autonomous growth during melanoma progression may involve the SCF/c-Kit axis. We used six human uveal melanoma tumor-derived cell lines and normal uveal melanocytes to characterize the SCF/c-Kit system and to assess its specific role in transformation. We investigated the possible roles of activating mutations in c-KIT, the overexpression of this gene, and ligand-dependent c-Kit overactivation in uveal melanoma cell tumorigenesis. Four cell lines (92.1, SP6.5, Mel270, and TP31) expressed both SCF and c-Kit, and none harbored the c-KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 that have been shown to induce SCF-independent c-Kit activation. Melanoma cell proliferation was strongly inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of c-Kit in these cells, despite the presence of (V599E)B-Raf in SP6.5 and TP31 cells. We characterized the signaling pathways involved in SCF/c-Kit-mediated cell growth and survival in normal and tumoral melanocytes and found that constitutive ERK1/2 activation played a key role in both the SCF/c-Kit autocrine loop and the gain of function of (V599E)B-Raf for melanoma cell proliferation and transformation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Stimulation of the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase has a critical role in the development and migration of melanocytes, and oncogenic c-Kit mutants contribute to the progression of some melanomas. c-Kit signalling activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways and their relative contribution to the activities of oncogenic and ligand-dependent c-Kit remains uncertain. We show that PI3K is a major regulator of MAPK activation in response to c-Kit activity and the dominant effector of c-Kit-driven melanocyte proliferation and melanoma survival. Nevertheless, inhibition of the PI3K pathway in c-Kit mutant melanoma cells did not replicate the apoptotic efficacy of the c-Kit inhibitor, imatinib mesylate. Instead, the simultaneous suppression of the PI3K and MAPK pathways promoted a strong synergistic apoptotic effect. These data indicate that MAPK functions as a redundant survival signal that reinforces the PI3K cascade in c-Kit mutant melanoma. Thus, the concurrent inhibition of PI3K and MAPK signalling is required to suppress oncogenic c-Kit activity and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy in c-Kit mutant melanomas. ",

The status of KIT mutations is of interest because they usually are mutually exclusive with N-RAS and B-RAF mutations and because of the availability of KIT kinase inhibitors in the clinic. Some recurrent KIT mutations are well characterized; others are poorly described.OBSERVATIONS We describe a novel KIT mutation in a patient with metastatic melanoma. The mutation, located in exon 13, resulted in S628N substitution in the KIT receptor. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical assays, and cell-based assays, we showed that the mutation is a bona fide gain-of-function oncogenic mutation. Furthermore,we evaluated the sensitivity of the mutant to imatinib and dasatinib.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We report a novel KIT gain-of-function mutation with S628N substitution (exon 13) and show that it is sensitive to imatinib in vitro. Therefore, patients with this mutation may be eligible for KIT kinase inhibitor–based therapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefit of such therapy.",

Trastuzumab (Herceptin), the antibody to the HER2 oncoprotein, has had a significant impact on therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. This study examined the incidences of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic malignant melanoma, which remain unclear in the literature.;The study evaluated patients with stage III and stage IV malignant melanoma who were treated between 1983 and 1999. Tissue blocks were retrieved and reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. From the 101 cases identified, 49 (31 stage III and 18 stage IV) had sufficient residual tumor sample to enable an assay to be performed. The blocks were tested for HER2 overexpression using the DAKO HercepTest immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. Any sample that tested 1+ or greater for HER2 expression on IHC and a randomly selected subset of HER2-negative samples were tested for the presence of HER2 gene amplification using the Vysis PathVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay.;The median age of the 49 selected patients was 52.2 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.23:1 (27 men to 22 women). All of the 49 cases of malignant melanoma were negative for HER2 overexpression by IHC. However, two samples (3%) were found to have a weak level of HER2 expression (1+ level of staining). Subsequent FISH results on the samples that were 1+ on IHC were negative for HER2 gene amplification. FISH results on 21 other randomly selected IHC-negative samples were also negative for HER2 amplification. Flow cytometry failed to show HER2 overexpression in two melanoma cell lines, and treatment of these cells with trastuzumab did not affect their proliferation rate.;We found a low incidence of HER2 expression and no evidence of HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in metastatic malignant melanoma tissues. Therefore, routine testing for HER2 overexpression or HER2 amplification would not be of benefit in this patient population. These results also imply that anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab is highly unlikely to provide benefit for patients with metastatic melanoma.",

Melanomas also commonly show impairment of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-Rb and ARF-HDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathways. CDKN2A mutations can produce p16(INK4A) and ARF protein loss. Rb bypass can also occur through activating CDK4 mutations as well as by CDK4 amplification. In addition to ARF deletion, p53 pathway disruption can result from dominant negative TP53 mutations.

Responses are almost exclusively restricted to tumors with mutations in KIT exon 9 or 11.

Somatic exon 8 KIT mutations have not been previously reported in mucosal melanoma or in other human solid tumors; however, such mutations have been reported in canine and feline mast cell tumors. Protein transcripts from exon 8 play an important role in the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular domain of KIT. In preclinical studies, a mutation in exon 8 led to autophosphorylation, independent of KIT ligand, and constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase. This biology may explain the successful application of imatinib in animals with tumors harboring exon 8 KIT mutations and in our patient with mucosal melanoma.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic and expression alterations of CCND1 with a focus on primary cutaneous melanomas, to define BRAF and NRAS mutation status, and correlate the data with clinical-pathological parameters. CCND1 amplification was associated with ulceration and the localization of the metastasis. After correction for the mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes, CCND1 amplification in samples without such mutations was associated with ulceration and sun exposure. The cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and was correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes. Primary melanomas with BRAF(V600) or NRAS(Q61 ) mutations exhibited lower CCND1 mRNA level. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation, and shorter survival time. These observations suggest that CCND1 alterations are linked to melanoma progression and are modified by BRAF and NRAS mutations.

This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

Among the paracrine growth factors involved in skin homeostasis, the KGF/FGF7 secreted by dermal fibroblasts promotes the epidermal proliferation and differentiation as well as the release from keratinocytes of other paracrine mediators. To evaluate the possible role played by KGF in affecting the behavior of different subtypes of melanoma carrying activating mutations or overexpression of the SCF receptor c-KIT, we used human melanoma cell lines, characterized by different expression levels of c-KIT and opposing responsivity to SCF, and HaCaT keratinocytes. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and ELISA test on KGF-treated keratinocytes showed enhanced expression and secretion of SCF in response to KGF and dependent on functional KGF receptor. Immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical analysis showed, in one of the selected melanoma cell models, SCF-dependent c-KIT activation induced by stimulation with the culture supernatants collected from KGF-treated keratinocytes. In keratinocyte-melanoma cocultures stained for the Ki67 proliferation marker, incubation with KGF induced enhanced growth not only of the keratinocytes but also of the melanoma cells, which could be blocked by the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib, demonstrating the establishment of a KGF-induced paracrine signaling network owing to the coexpression of biologically active SCF released from keratinocytes and functional c-KIT on melanoma cells.",

MITF gene amplification was shown to be associated with a reduced survival in metastatic melanoma patients, and reduction of MITF activity was shown to sensitize melanoma cell lines to chemotherapeutics, suggesting the intratumoral MITF gene copy number as a predictive biomarker of response and survival after chemotherapy.;To validate this hypothesis, we investigated MITF gene amplification in tumor tissues obtained from 116 metastatic melanoma patients before an individualized sensitivity-directed chemotherapy using quantitative real-time PCR. MITF amplification rates were correlated with tumor chemosensitivity quantified by an ATP-based luminescence assay and with chemotherapy outcome in terms of response and survival.;Of 116 tumor tissues, 104 were evaluable for MITF gene amplification. Strong amplification (> or =4 copies per cell) was detected in 24 of 104 tissues (23%), whereas 62 of 104 tissues (60%) harbored >3 copies per cell. Strong MITF gene amplification was associated with a reduced disease-specific survival (P = 0.031). However, no correlation was found between MITF copy number and in vitro chemosensitivity or in vivo chemotherapy response.;Our findings suggest that strong amplifications of the melanoma oncogene MITF affects patient survival but does not influence tumor chemosensitivity and chemotherapy response. Thus, the MITF gene copy number seems a useful prognostic marker in metastatic melanoma but could not be confirmed as a predictive marker of chemosensitivity and chemotherapy response.",

We investigated KIT expression in a group of patients with early-stage malignant melanoma. Primary tumour specimens obtained from 261 radically resected patients with stage I and II malignant melanoma were examined for KIT expression. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were stained with the polyclonal rabbit anti-human anti-KIT antibody (Dako Cytomation Inc., Carpenteria, California, USA). Patients were classified into four groups according to the level of expression (0%, <30%, 30-60% and >60%). Univariate and multivariate analyses examining the impact of KIT expression, Breslow thickness, Clark level and microscopic ulceration on disease-free survival were performed. Within the population of 261 patients with early-stage melanoma with 62 recurrences during a follow-up of 64 months, KIT expression was found in 144 cases (55%). KIT was expressed in more than 60% of cells in 20 patients (8%), in 30-60% of cells in 64 patients (24%) and in less than 30% of cells in 60 patients (23%). KIT expression was not found in 117 patients (45%). In univariate analyses, the influence of KIT expression on disease-free survival was not proven (P=0.4956; log-rank test). Increasing Breslow thickness, a higher Clark level, the presence of microscopic ulceration and a higher stage were significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.0001; log-rank test in all cases). In multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness, stage and KIT expression were significant negative prognostic factors for a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.0001, P=0.0028, P=0.0488, respectively; stepwise Cox regression model). It can be concluded that KIT is expressed in more than one-half of early-stage malignant melanoma. KIT may serve as an additive prognostic factor to Breslow thickness and stage within the tested population. The therapeutic impact of KIT expression in malignant melanoma is uncertain.

In this study, we show how its genetic amplification in PTEN-deficient melanomas may rationalize the use of CDK2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy. Analysis of array-CGH data revealed that PTEN deficiency is coupled tightly with genomic amplification encompassing the NUAK2 locus, a finding strengthened by immunohistochemical evidence that phospho-Akt overexpression was correlated with NUAK2 expression in clinical specimens of acral melanoma. Functional studies in melanoma cells showed that inactivation of the PI3K pathway upregulated p21 expression and reduced the number of cells in S phase. NUAK2 silencing and inactivation of the PI3K pathway efficiently controlled CDK2 expression, whereas CDK2 inactivation specifically abrogated the growth of NUAK2-amplified and PTEN-deficient melanoma cells. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed an association of CDK2 expression with NUAK2 amplification and p-Akt expression in melanomas. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK2 was sufficient to suppress the growth of NUAK2-amplified and PTEN-deficient melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results show how CDK2 blockade may offer a promising therapy for genetically defined melanomas, where NUAK2 is amplified and PTEN is deleted.",

We studied the prevalence of overexpression of HER-2/neu and c-Kit in 202 patients with malignant melanoma to evaluate a possible prognostic value of these molecular targets in malignant melanoma. METHODS: Overexpression of HER-2/neu and c-Kit was evaluated using immunohistochemical assays in 202 archival tissue specimens. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2001, 202 subjects (109 males; 54% and 93 females; 46%) with malignant melanoma were studied with a mean age of 57 years (age range: 15-101 years). The most common histologic type was amelanotic melanoma (n = 62; 30.7%) followed by superficial spreading melanoma (n = 54; 26.7%). The depth of penetration of melanoma (Breslow thickness, pT Stage) ranged from 0.4 mm (stage pT1) to 8.0 mm (stage pT4A). Mean thickness was 2.6 mm (stage pT3A). The ECOG performance scores ranged from 0 to 3. Only 2 patients (0.9%) revealed HER-2/neu overexpression, whereas 46 (22.8%) revealed c-Kit overexpression. Multivariate analysis performed did not show a significant difference in survival between c-Kit positive and negative groups (p = 0.36). Interestingly, not only was c-Kit more likely to be overexpressed in the superficial spreading type, a preliminary association between the presence or absence of c-Kit overexpression and the existence of another second primary tumor was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our large study indicate that the HER-2/neu onco-protein neither has a role in melanogenesis nor is a potential target for clinical trials with monoclonal antibody therapy. This indicates there is no role for its testing in patients with malignant melanoma. Although c-Kit, expressed preferentially in the superficial spreading type, may not have prognostic value, it does have significant therapeutic implications as a molecular target warranting further investigation.",

Breslow staging currently seems to be the most adequate predictor of prognosis. We thus performed a clinicopathological and literature review to identify suitable predictors of prognosis and survival and investigated the expression of c-KIT (by immunohistochemistry) in patients with vulvar melanoma (n=33) from the Gynaecological Cancer Centres of the Royal Hospital for Women (Sydney, Australia) and John Hunter Hospital (Newcastle, Australia).

We identified 3 patients (9.1%) with lichen sclerosus associated with melanoma in situ, although no lichen sclerosus was found in the areas of invasive melanoma. No patient had vulvar nevi. We identified a) Breslow's depth, b) an absence of any of the pathological risk factors, such as satellitosis, in-transit metastasis, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and dermal mitosis, c) removal of inguino-femoral lymph nodes, d) lateral margin of >1 cm, and e) c-KIT expression as valuable prognostic predictors for disease-free survival. We conclude that c-KIT expression is, apart from Breslow's depth, another valuable predictor of prognosis and survival. Lichen sclerosus may be associated with vulvar melanoma.",

KIT, an established oncogene with a multifaceted role in melanogenesis and melanoma pathogenesis, has recently been shown to be upregulated in some melanomas, and is also a target of the miRNA miR-221. Here, we describe a genetic variant in the 3' UTR of the KIT oncogene that correlates with a greater than fourfold increased risk of acral melanoma. This KIT variant results in a mismatch in the seed region of a miR-221 complementary site and reporter data suggests that this mismatch can result in increased expression of the KIT oncogene. Consistent with the hypothesis that this is a functional variant, KIT mRNA and protein levels are both increased in the majority of samples harboring the KIT variant.

Nevertheless, drug resistance develops in treated patients, and strategies to overcome primary and acquired resistance are required. To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in primary resistance to PLX4032, we investigated its effects on cell proliferation and signaling in a panel of 27 genetically characterized patient-derived melanoma cell lines. Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAF(V600E) and independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification; similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032.

Several candidate genes are localized at this sequence; however, their role in melanoma has not been clearly defined. The aim of this study was to develop an accurate method for determining the amplification pattern of six candidate genes that map to this amplicon core and to elucidate the possible relationship between BRAF, NRAS mutations and CCND1 copy number alterations, all of which are key components of the MAP kinase pathway. Characterization of gene copy numbers was performed by quantitative PCR and, as an alternative method, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to define the CCND1 amplification pattern at the single cell level. Samples with amplified CCND1 (32%) were further analyzed for copy number alterations for the TAOS1, FGF3, FGF19, FGF4 and EMS1 genes. Co-amplification of the CCND1 and TAOS1 was present in 15% of tumors and was more frequent in ulcerated lesions (P=0.017). Furthermore, 56% of primary melanomas had either BRAF or NRAS mutations, but these two mutations were not present in any of the lesions analyzed. Of these cases, 34% also had CCND1 amplification. There was a significant relationship between NRAS activating mutations and UV exposure (P=0.005). We did not find correlations between CCND1 gene amplification status and any of the patients' clinicopathological parameters. However, CCND1 amplification simultaneously with either BRAF or NRAS activation mutations was observed mainly in primary tumors with ulcerated surfaces (P=0.028). We assume that co-amplification of these candidate genes in the 11q13 region or CCND1 gene alterations along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone.",

Stimulation of PBMC from healthy subjects with MELOE-1 induced the amplification of CD4 T cells specific for various regions of the protein in multiple HLA contexts, for each tested donor. We confirmed these results in a panel of melanoma patients, and documented that MELOE-1 specific CD4 T cells, were mainly Th1 cells, presumably favourable to the amplification of CD8 specific T cells. Using autologous DC, we further showed that these class II epitopes could be naturally processed from MELOE-1 whole protein and identified minimal epitopes derived from each region of MELOE-1, and presented in four distinct HLA contexts.

Sequence analysis for SOX10, a transcription factor, which both acts upstream of MITF and synergizes with MITF, identified an additional three samples with frameshift or nonsense mutations. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and SOX10 were found to be mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion, possibly suggesting disruption in a common genetic pathway. Taken together we found that over 20% of the metastatic melanoma cases had alterations in the MITF pathway. We show that the MITF pathway is also altered in primary melanomas: 2/26 demonstrated mutations in MITF and 6/55 demonstrated mutations in SOX10.

Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines. In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas. The numerous focal amplifications and HDs we have documented here are the first step toward identifying a comprehensive catalog of genes involved in melanoma development, some of which may be useful prognostic markers or targets for therapies to treat this disease.",

However, combined treatment with these two agents produced drug resistant cells in the B16 melanoma cell line at a much higher frequency than would be expected if resistance to the two agents was totally independent. An isolated doubly resistant clone, B16-F1 MP, showed a high frequency of resistance to pyrazofurin and ouabain, which are also agents to which resistance can be conferred by gene amplification. Thus MTX combined with PALA selected cells with an 'amplificator' phenotype (an increased ability to amplify parts of the genome). These B16-F1 MP cells had a decreased ability to form experimental lung metastases compared with the parent line but this difference was not found in baby hamster kidney cells with the amplificator phenotype.

The most frequent sites of origin of noncutaneous melanoma are the eye and mucosal surfaces. Although noncutaneous melanomas are an uncommon group of cancers (representing less than 10% of all melanomas) a greater understanding of their genetic and molecular abnormalites is being translated into novel treatment strategies. These developments are important because there is currently no effective systemic therapy for noncutaneous melanoma. Significant attention has been focused on the role of c-kit (KIT, CD117), a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. In vitro and ex vivo evidence suggests that c-kit is frequently expressed/over expressed/mutated in noncutaneous melanoma. Anti-tumour effects with c-kit inhibitors are seen in pre-clinical models. A variety of multitargeted kinase inhibitors which have activity against c-kit are currently in early phase clinical trials in metastatic ocular, mucosal and acral melanoma. The few case reports of significant clinical activity with targeted therapies provides hope that greater understanding of the biology of noncutaneous melanoma can be translated into effective treatment.",

We determined, by Western blot, variation in the level of expression of AP-2 and three of its downstream targets, c-kit, E-cadherin, and p21 in several human melanoma cell lines and, by immunohistochemistry, in a group of 99 histological samples including benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. A significant negative correlation between AP-2 expression level and tumor thickness was found. Moreover, AP-2 expression was positively associated with E-cadherin and c-kit expression. In contrast, there was a significant negative association between AP-2 and p21 expression levels. These findings suggest that p21 is independent of AP-2 transactivator function during the latest phases of melanoma progression. Finally, AP-2, c-kit, E-cadherin, and p21 expression levels did not show to be able to distinguish between dysplastic nevi and nevi without dysplasia. We conclude that changes in the expression of these proteins are involved in the later phases of melanoma progression, and may be responsible for the transition from local invasive melanoma to metastasis.",

Illumina Human CNV370 Bead chip arrays were used to assess the genome for unbalanced chromosomal events occurring in 39 cell lines derived from stage III metastatic melanomas. A number of genes previously recognized to have an important role in the development and progression of melanoma were identified including homozygous deletions of CDKN2A (13 of 39 samples), CDKN2B (10 of 39), PTEN (3 of 39), PTPRD (3 of 39), TP53 (1 of 39), and amplifications of CCND1 (2 of 39), MITF (2 of 39), MDM2 (1 of 39), and NRAS (1 of 39). In addition, a number of focal homozygous deletions potentially targeting novel melanoma tumor suppressor genes were identified. Because of their likely functional significance for melanoma progression, FAS, CH25H, BMPR1A, ACTA2, and TFG were investigated in a larger cohort of melanomas through sequencing. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified in BMPR1A (1 of 43), ACTA2 (3 of 43), and TFG (5 of 103). A number of potentially important mutation events occurred in TFG including the identification of a mini mutation \"hotspot\" at amino acid residue 380 (P380S and P380L) and the presence of multiple mutations in two melanomas. Mutations in TFG may have important clinical relevance for current therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic melanoma.",

On the basis of previous expression studies, we aimed to trace melanoma cells in the blood of melanoma patients by RT-PCR of melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA. To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed. However, MIA amplification seems to be of little value as a surrogate marker for clinical staging or the detection of metastatic disease.",

An entirely new, additional explanation has now been found, and is defined as error amplification by screening. This previously unrecognized artefact is shown to be an inevitable consequence of the uneven operation of routine histopathological error in the diagnosis of borderline malignancy; thus, as the equality of diagnostic plus/minus is lost, it is no longer self-correcting, and the overdiagnosis of malignancy therefore outweighs its underdiagnosis: the error is then amplified by patient screening. The magnitude of this new artefact is a function of the reproducibility of routine histopathological diagnosis and the number of patients screened, and the evidence on this, and from studies done for other purposes, shows the error to be considerable. The artefact of error amplification by screening detracts from a possible role for ultraviolet radiation in the increase in melanoma incidence and provides an explanation of their erroneous association; in addition to melanoma, it could be a major source of misdiagnosis of other cancers associated with patient screening programmes.",

Expression of these genes was assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in 23 melanoma tumor specimens and in 25 additional nonmelanoma or nonmalignant specimens. MIA, tyrosinase, and MGSA were expressed in most melanoma specimens. Specificity was highest for MART-1, followed by MIA and tyrosinase. Increasing the number of cycles of amplification from 35 to 40 increased sensitivity but decreased specificity of most markers, though MIA was relatively robust. MIA mRNA was also detected in carcinomas of the colon, ovary, kidney, and head/neck, as well as in normal laryngeal epithelium. Although MIA discriminated melanoma from nonmelanoma at least as well as tyrosinase, no single mRNA marker had accuracy greater than 71%, raising potential concern about application of these particular mRNA markers to the minimal disease setting.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, both genes were shown to be over-represented or amplified in several melanomas. Interestingly, hTERT amplification was abundant in superficial spreading primary melanomas, subcutaneous metastases and malignant effusion-derived cells, but completely absent or very rare in primary nodular melanomas as well as brain, bone and lymph node metastases.

In normal skin, SCF was mainly observed in endothelial cells of blood vessels but not frequently in basal melanocytes, whereas c-KIT was predominantly localised in tissue mast cells. In benign neoplastic melanocytes (common melanocytic naevi), localisation of SCF and c-KIT was complementary: SCF was mostly found in dermal naevus cells while c-KIT was revealed in epidermal naevus cells, although the expression of the latter antigen was not frequent. Malignant melanoma cells showed less frequent expression of these antigens than those in benign lesions. Of five cultured melanoma cell lines, SCF was observed in only one, and c-KIT was not found in any melanoma cells. No quantitative or qualitative alterations assessed by Western blot analysis were induced in the presence of phenotypic modifiers (sodium butyrate and HMBA).

We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas.

We reviewed published literature in PubMed on GIST and melanoma, with a focus on both past and current clinical trials. The data presented centers on imatinib, vemurafenib, and most recently dabrafenib, targeting KIT and BRAF mutations and their outcomes in GIST and melanoma.

High response rates with inhibition of KIT in GIST have not been recapitulated in KIT-mutated melanoma. Median time to resistance to targeted agents occurs in ~7 months with BRAF inhibitors and 2 years for imatinib in GIST. In GIST, the development of secondary mutations leads to resistance; however, there have been no similar gatekeeper mutations found in melanoma. Although surgery remains an important component of the treatment of early GIST and melanoma, surgeons will need to continue to define the thresholds and timing for operation in the setting of metastatic disease with improved targeted therapies.

Our data indicate that assessment of VEGF expression might aid in the differential diagnosis between dysplastic nevi and melanomas. Moreover, VEGF might be a candidate for targeted therapy. The loss of c-kit expression might contribute to melanoma progression.",

This goal is best facilitated by understanding both an individual's inherited genetic variation and the somatic genetic changes arising during cancer development. Clinical decision making based on inherited genetic variation is done for those patients with cancer susceptibility syndromes and more generally to personalize drug dosing. Personalized medicine based on genetic and genomic changes within tumors is being applied more widely, with increased use of therapies targeted to somatic mutations and amplifications. Somatic mutations associated with resistance also are being used to select against therapies. Somatic point mutation testing being used clinically includes direct sequencing, short sequencing and single nucleotide interrogation. Single amplifications are commonly assessed using FISH or CISH; high throughput assessment of amplifications and deletions is done mainly on a research basis. Melanomas contain complex mutational profiles that allow them to be sub-grouped by their genetic and genomic profile, each of which then can be evaluated pre-clinically to determine their response to targeted therapies. BRAF V600E mutations are the most common found in melanoma; specific inhibitors of mutant BRAF have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. In addition, other melanoma sub-groups have been identified genetically, which respond to other inhibitors. These studies focus on somatic genetic changes in cancer, which can be targeted directly by therapies. However in the future, personalized medicine will use a combination of inherited and somatic genetics to select the optimal tailored therapy for each patient.",

Recently, the better results in melanoma treatment were obtained with the mutation-specific inhibitors that have been developed for clinical use and target only patients with particular tumor genotypes. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectrum of \"driver\" mutations in melanoma subtypes from 137 patients with skin melanoma and 14 patients with mucosal melanoma. In total 151 melanoma cases, the frequency of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS mutations was 55.0, 10.6, 4.0, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. BRAF mutations were found in 69% of cutaneous melanoma without UV exposure and in 43% of cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (p=0.045), rarely in acral and mucosal melanomas. Most of melanomas containing BRAF mutations, V600E (92%) and V600K (6.0%) were potentially sensitive to inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib. NRAS mutations were more common in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (26.0%), in acral and mucosal melanomas; the dominant mutations being Q61R/K/L (87.5%). KIT mutations were found in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (8.7%) and mucosal one (28.6%), but not in acral melanoma. Most of KIT mutations were identified in exon 11; these tumors being sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is the first monitoring of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS hotspot mutations in different subtypes of melanoma for Russian population. On the base of data obtained, one can suppose that at the molecular level melanomas are heterogeneous tumors that should be tested for \"driver\" mutations in the each case for evaluation of the potential sensitivity to target therapy.

Mutations in murine c-kit that reduce the receptor tyrosine kinase activity cause deficiencies in the migration and proliferation of melanoblasts, hematopoietic stem cells, and primordial germ cells. We therefore investigated whether c-Kit regulates normal human melanocyte proliferation and plays a role in melanomas. We show that normal human melanocytes respond to mast cell growth factor (MGF), the Kit-ligand that stimulates phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in c-Kit and induces sequential phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in several other proteins. One of the phosphorylated intermediates in the signal transduction pathway was identified as an early response kinase (mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase). Dephosphorylation of a prominent 180-kDa protein suggests that MGF also activates a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. In contrast, MGF did not induce proliferation, the cascade of protein phosphorylations, or MAP kinase activation in the majority of cells cultured from primary nodular and metastatic melanomas that grow independently of exogenous factors. In the five out of eight human melanoma lines expressing c-kit mRNAs, c-Kit was not constitutively activated. Therefore, although c-Kit-kinase is a potent growth regulator of normal human melanocytes, its activity is not positively associated with malignant transformation.",

However, increasing attention is being turned towards the participation of 'epigenetic' events in melanoma progression that do not affect DNA sequence, but which nevertheless may lead to stable inherited changes in gene expression. Epigenetic events including histone modifications and DNA methylation play a key role in normal development and are crucial to establishing the correct program of gene expression. In contrast, mistargeting of such epigenetic modifications can lead to aberrant patterns of gene expression and loss of anti-cancer checkpoints. Thus, to date at least 50 genes have been reported to be dysregulated in melanoma by aberrant DNA methylation and accumulating evidence also suggests that mistargetting of histone modifications and altered chromatin remodeling activities will play a key role in melanoma. This review gives an overview of the many different types of epigenetic modifications and their involvement in cancer and especially in melanoma development and progression.",

The optimized procedure, validated in 3 blank runs in a clinical setting, allowed the production of at least 10⁸ pure (>90%) Melan-A- and MELOE-1-specific T cells within 28 days starting with 100 mL of blood from metastatic melanoma patients.

Whereas the vast majority of melanoma expresses chromosomal aberrations, blue nevi, congenital nevi, and most Spitz nevi typically show no aberrations. A subset of Spitz nevi shows an isolated gain of chromosome 11p, an aberration pattern not observed in melanoma. These Spitz nevi frequently harbor mutations in the HRAS gene located on this chromosomal arm. Comparisons among melanoma types showed that melanomas of the palms, soles, and subungual sites can be distinguished by the presence of multiple gene amplifications that arise very early in their progression. About 50% of these amplifications are found at the cyclin D1 locus. By contrast, amplifications are significantly less frequent in other cutaneous melanoma types and if present arise late in progression. The frequent amplifications in melanomas on acral sites allowed the detection of single basal melanocytes with gene amplifications in the histologically normal appearing skin immediately adjacent to a melanoma. These \"field cells\" represent subtle melanoma in situ and are likely to represent minimal residual disease that can lead to local recurrences if not excised with safety margins. The high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in melanomas and their relative absence in nevi could indicate that melanocytes of melanomas went through telomeric crisis, whereas melanocytes in nevi did not. Such a scenario would suggest that replicative senescence is a tumor-suppressive mechanism in melanocytic neoplasia. It might also explain part of the phenomenon of regression commonly seen in melanoma. Genomic analysis is a powerful tool to obtain insight in the progression of melanocytic neoplasms with potential clinical applications for classification and detection of minimal residual melanoma.",

The significance and practical value of this procedure for the diagnosis of tumor dissemination in melanoma patients are unclear. The conflicting results may at least partially be related to very low amounts of circulating tumor cells and to our observation that melanoma cells only transiently persist in the peripheral blood. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relevance of detection of extracellular melanoma-specific mRNA in serum and plasma samples in comparison to blood cell samples from patients with disseminated disease (stage IV). We therefore compared the presence of specific mRNA for tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 by RT-PCR amplification of specific cDNA from serum, plasma, and whole blood samples of 10 melanoma patients. Melanoma-specific mRNA was detectable in whole blood samples of all ten patients tested indicating the presence of circulating melanoma cells. In addition, tyrosinase mRNA could be detected in the serum and/or plasma of 6 of 10 melanoma patients whereas gp100 and MART-1 specific transcripts were not detectable in any of the samples tested. The presence and integrity of amplifiable RNA was shown in all serum and plasma samples of patients and controls by RT-PCR-specific amplification of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBDG) mRNA. We conclude that tyrosinase mRNA but not gp100 and MART-1 mRNA can be amplified from serum and/or plasma in a subset of melanoma patients showing circulating melanoma cells. Therefore, extracellular-directed assays appear to be less sensitive and efficacious in detecting melanoma-specific transcripts compared to cellular-based assays.",

We collected 170 melanocytic lesions, including 106 cutaneous MM from acral melanoma (AM) and nonacral melanoma (NAM) sites, 24 dysplastic nevi, and 40 common melanocytic nevi. Tissue microarray was constructed, and immunohistochemical expression for c-kit was assessed with correlation with clinical parameters. Mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing was also analyzed. Immunostaining scores for c-kit were found to be statistically higher in Dysplastic Nevi than in common melanocytic nevi and MM. In addition, cytoplasmic c-kit staining was significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with AM but not in those with NAM. Twenty-nine cases of MM (including 9 NAM and 20 AM) are analyzed for mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing, and no genetic mutation is found. Our findings confirm that KIT mutations, in contrast to previous white cohorts, are not common in both AM and NAM of the Chinese and do not necessarily correlate with c-kit expression.

Here we show (V600E)B-RAF copy-number gain as a mechanism of acquired B-RAF inhibitor resistance in 4 out of 20 (20%) patients treated with B-RAF inhibitor. In cell lines, (V600E)B-RAF overexpression and knockdown conferred B-RAF inhibitor resistance and sensitivity, respectively. In (V600E)B-RAF amplification-driven (versus mutant N-RAS-driven) B-RAF inhibitor resistance, extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation is saturable, with higher doses of vemurafenib down-regulating phosho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and re-sensitizing melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibitor. These two mechanisms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244/selumetinib or its combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib. In contrast to mutant N-RAS-mediated (V600E)B-RAF bypass, which is sensitive to C-RAF knockdown, (V600E)B-RAF amplification-mediated resistance functions largely independently of C-RAF. Thus, alternative clinical strategies may potentially overcome distinct modes of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation underlying acquired B-RAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma.",

The excision biopsy revealed a melanoma with depth of 1.5 mm. The patient was submitted to amplification of the margins 2 cm in all directions and the sentinel node was also excised. The histopathological exam did not show residual disease. Sentinel on exam did not show metastases either under hematoxylin-eosin stain or immunohistochemistry (S-100 and HMB45). Therefore, RT-PCR for tyrosinase mRNA was positive. The patient has been followed for twelve months without evidence of recurrence.;Childhood melanoma is rare, corresponding to less than 1% of malignant tumors in children. Data point to a worldwide increase in its incidence. Melanoma occurs in melanocytic lesions in 70% and in the remaining 30% it occurs de novo. Melanoma is very aggressive, so the survival depends on an early diagnosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has selected patients to complete lymphadenectomy.

It has been suggested that choroidal melanoma can develop due to accumulation of genetic alterations in the DNA of normal melanocytes. Neoplastic transformation in the choroid can be triggered as a consequence of the following genetic alterations: --deletions and/or amplifications in the genetic material, usually in the chromosome 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 18; --point mutations, especially within some egzones, which leads to monosomia or loss of heterozygosity of the chromosome. As a consequence of the above alterations a number of false codons can appear resulting in formation of defective enzymatic proteins. Some of these proteins, like p16 and p14, normally play a role of suppressors of oncogenesis and defects in their structure may result in melanoma formation.",

The tyrosinase promoter, alone and in combination with a single, or a dual, tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer, was used to regulate expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Transient transfections of these tissue-specific luciferase constructs in human and murine melanoma (Pmel, B16mel) and colon carcinoma (WiDr, MC38) cell lines resulted in melanoma-specific luciferase expression that was amplified 5- and 500-fold with the addition of a single or double enhancer, respectively, to the tyrosinase promoter. When the double enhancer-promoter construct expressed the highly toxic Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, transfection of the same cell lines followed by administration of the prodrug 6-methyl purine deoxyriboside (6-MPDR) at a concentration of 50 microM caused melanoma-specific in vitro cell killing. Within 5 days after prodrug administration methylthiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity assays showed that only 15 and 9% of Pmel and B16mel cells, respectively, remained viable compared with controls. This effect was highly specific, as 90 and 96% of WiDr and MC38 colon carcinoma cells remained viable 5 days after identical treatment. This effect was a direct result of increased tissue-specific conversion of 6-MPDR to the toxic metabolite 6-methylpurine (6-MP), as documented by HPLC analysis of culture supernatants. These results show that the dual tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer provides powerful amplification of the transcriptional targeting of gene expression afforded by use of the tyrosinase promoter. This amplification translates into increased, highly specific cytotoxicity to melanoma by the PNP/6-MPDR enzyme/prodrug system and, therefore, has potential efficacy in the use of gene therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",

Our analysis of 27 melanoma cell lines showed no correlation between AP2 and c-kit expression. Suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of cKit down-modulation, we performed genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling and found that several miRNA species are commonly up-regulated in melanomas. Among them was mir-221, which can directly interact with c-kit 3'UTR and inhibit cKit protein translation. Observed inverse correlation of the c-kit and mir-221 expression in various melanocytic cells pointed to its involvement in regulation of cKit in melanoma. Moreover, a series of functional assays demonstrated that mir-221 could directly inhibit cKit, p27(Kip1) and, possibly, other pivotal proteins in melanoma. Collectively, the studies presented here indicate that mir-221 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma.

We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the biology of congenital melanocytic proliferations, showing that amplification of mutated NRAS seems to represent a new genetic mechanism leading to melanoma in the context of neurocutaneous melanocytosis.

The analysis was validated by genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR) on an extended set of cases (n = 64) and the results were correlated with the clinical outcome. To investigate TrkA molecular pathways and cellular function, we generated inducible activation of the NGF-TrkA signaling in human MM cell lines.;We identified amplification of 1q23.1, where the TrkA locus resides, as a candidate hotspot implicated in the progression of MM. Across 40 amplicons detected, segmental amplification of 1q23.1 showed the strongest association with tumor thickness. By validation of the analysis, TrkA gene amplification emerged as a frequent event in primary melanomas (50 % of patients), and correlated with worse clinical outcome. However, experiments in cell lines revealed that induction of the NGF-TrkA signaling produced a phenotype of dramatic suppression of cell proliferation through inhibition of cell division and pronounced intracellular vacuolization, in a way straightly dependent on NGF activation of TrkA. These events were triggered via MAPK activity but not via AKT, and involved p21(cip1) protein increase, compatibly with a mechanism of oncogene-induced growth arrest.;Taken together, our findings point to TrkA as a candidate oncogene in MM and support a model in which the NGF-TrkA-MAPK pathway may mediate a trade-off between neoplastic transformation and adaptive anti-proliferative response.",

In this study, we aimed to analyze c-kit expression in canine cutaneous melanocytic tumors and its association with tumor behavior, in order to investigate the dog's potential in comparative pathology and c-kit's potential in the diagnosis of these tumors. The expression of c-kit was evaluated immunohistochemically in 39 canine cutaneous melanocytic tumors and scored in terms of the labeling location, extension, and intensity. The labeling location was essentially cytoplasmic, and the labeling extension and intensity were generally higher in melanocytomas (83.3% diffuse-labeled cells) than those in malignant melanomas (22.2% negative-labeled cells). The differences found in the labeling extension were statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no association between c-kit immunoexpression in malignant melanomas and the clinicopathological criteria, except between the labeling intensity and the degree of intralesional pigmentation (P = 0.048). Our results for labeling extension are in agreement with similar human studies, reinforcing the dog's potential as a model organism for investigation in this type of cancer.

Patient A is a girl treated for anaplastic astrocytoma at 10 years and for multiple melanomas on the scalp associated to dysplastic nevi two years later. Her monozygotic twin sister carried dysplastic nevi and a slow growing, untreated cerebral lesion. Direct sequencing analysis showed no alterations in melanoma susceptibility genes including CDKN2A, CDK4, MC1R and MITF or in TP53. By microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array comparative genomic hybridization a deletion including the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2BAS gene cluster was detected in both twin sisters, encompassing a large region at 9p21.3 and occurring de novo after the loss of one paternal allele.Patient B is a boy of 7 years when treated for astrocytoma then developing melanoma associated to congenital nevi on the head 10 years later: sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed a normal profile of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B/CDKN2BAS region. Array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed the absence of deletions at 9p21.3 and failed to reveal known pathogenic copy number variations.;By comparison with the other germ line deletions at the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2BAS gene cluster reported in melanoma susceptible families, the deletion detected in the two sisters is peculiar for its de novo origin and for its extension, as it represents the largest constitutive deletion at 9p21.3 region identified so far.In addition, the two studied cases add to other evidence indicating association of melanoma with exposure to ionizing radiation and with second neoplasm after childhood cancer. Melanoma should be considered in the monitoring of pigmented lesions in young cancer patients.",

However, some cancer cell types including malignant melanoma cells are resistant             to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Here, we show that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic             organosulfur compound, sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis while             sparing normal cells. DATS also potentiates apoptosis induced by agonistic antibodies             against death receptors (DR) 4 and DR5. The amplification of DR-mediated apoptosis             was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and caspase-3/7             activation. However, these events were not sufficient for full sensitization.             TRAIL also induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the activation             of X-box-binding protein 1 and caspase-12 and DATS poten-tiated both events. Moreover,             inhibition of caspase-12, but not caspase-4, abolished the amplification of apoptosis,             indicating that ER stress plays a crucial role. On the other hand, DATS and/or             TRAIL induced minimal apoptosis and caspase-12 activation in melanocytes despite             their substantial expression of DR4 and DR5 on the cell surface. Our data suggest             that DATS amplifies death ligand-induced melanoma cell death by disrupting their             adaptation to ER-mediated death pathway. The present findings raise the possibility             that DATS may be combined with death ligands to treat TRAIL-resistance melanoma             cells without impairing its tumor selectivity.",

In this study, we showed that array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of genome-wide CNAs can classify tumors on the basis of differing etiologies and provide mechanistic insights to specific biological processes. In a RAS-induced p19(Arf-/-) mouse model that experienced accelerated melanoma formation after UV exposure, array-CGH analysis was effective in distinguishing phenotypically identical melanomas that differed solely by previous UV exposure. Moreover, classification by array-CGH identified key CNAs unique to each class, including amplification of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 in UV-treated cohort, a finding consistent with our recent report that UVB targets components of the p16(INK4a)-cyclin-dependent kinase-RB pathway in melanoma genesis (K.

In cancer EZH2 has been implicated in silencing tumor suppressor genes. Its role in melanoma as well as target genes affected by EZH2 are poorly understood. In view of this we have used an integrated systems biology approach to analyze 471 cases of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for mutations and amplifications of EZH2. Identified changes in target genes were validated by interrogation of microarray data from melanoma cells treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. We found that EZH2 activation by mutations, gene amplification and increased transcription occurred in about 20% of the cohort. These alterations were associated with significant hypermethylation of DNA and significant downregulation of 11% of transcripts in patient RNASeq data. GSK126 treatment of melanoma lines containing EZH2 activation reversed such transcriptional repression in 98 candidate target genes. Gene enrichment analysis revealed genes associated with tumor suppression, cell differentiation, cell cycle inhibition and repression of metastases as well as antigen processing and presentation pathways. The identified changes in EZH2 were associated with an adverse prognosis in the TCGA dataset. These results suggest that inhibiting of EZH2 is a promising therapeutic avenue for a substantial fraction of melanoma patients. ",

EGFR mRNA levels were detected by Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays for 16 lesions. Both increased gene dosage and chromosome 7 alterations were found in 70% of tumors. Extra EGFR copies were detected in an additional 10% of samples. Polysomy 7 was associated with EGFR gene amplification. Significant correlation was found between EGFR alterations and histological subtypes, tumor thickness, ulceration and metastases formation. Amplification was significantly higher in lesions that developed metastases within 2 years after surgical excision of the primary tumor. Gene copy alterations were associated with elevated mRNA expression in 77% of lesions when compared to tumors with disomic EGFR status, the correlation was not directly proportional to gene copy number. Associations between protein expression and mRNA levels were even less prominent. In conclusion, our study indicates that amplification of the EGFR gene and polysomy 7 are frequent alterations in primary melanomas and are associated with bad prognosis.

The extent of field cells did not correlate with tumor depth or diameter, indicating that tumor depth is not suited to predict the extent of field cells.

Here, we report that the secretory portion (SP) of eccrine sweat glands provide an anatomical niche for melanocyte-melanoma precursor cells. Using lineage-tagged H2B-GFP reporter mice, we found that melanoblasts that colonize sweat glands during development are maintained in an immature, slow-cycling state but renew themselves in response to genomic stress and provide their differentiating progeny to the epidermis. FISH analysis of human acral melanoma expanding in the epidermis revealed that unpigmented melanoblasts with significant cyclin D1 gene amplification reside deep in the SP of particular sweat gland(s).

Recombinant IL-10 and melanoma supernatants were found to inhibit production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and mixed lymphocyte reactions but reversal of these effects of melanoma supernatants by MAbs against IL-10 was only seen in the case of TNF-alpha production.

We found novel mutations and focal SCNAs in genes that are embryonic regulators of axon guidance, predominantly in thick melanomas. Analysis of publicly available microarray datasets provided further support for a potential role of Ephrin receptors in melanoma progression. In addition, we have identified a set of SCNAs, including amplification of BRAF and ofthe epigenetic modifier EZH2, that are specific for the group of thick melanomas that developed metastasis during the follow-up.

We engineered an oncolytic measles virus entering melanoma cells through the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMWMAA) and proved highly specific infection and spread in melanoma cells. We further enhanced this oncolytic virus by inserting the FCU1 gene encoding the yeast-derived prodrug convertases cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. Combination treatment with armed and retargeted MV-FCU1-αHMWMAA and the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) led to effective prodrug conversion to 5-fluorouracil, extensive cytotoxicity to melanoma cells, and excessive bystander killing of noninfected cells. Importantly, HMWMAA-retargeted MV showed antitumor activity in a human xenograft mouse model, which was further increased by the FCU1/5-FC prodrug activation system.

We sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with RAS mutations, mutant BRAF amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.

Until recently this mutation had however only been identified in one case of posterior uveal melanoma. Despite this apparent lack of the BRAF mutation, inappropriate downstream activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway has been described in posterior uveal melanoma. Based on the already recognised morphological and cytogenetic heterogeneity in uveal melanoma, we hypothesised that the BRAF mutation may be present in uveal melanoma but only in some of the tumour cells. In this study, we analysed 20 ciliary body and 30 choroidal melanomas using a nested PCR-based technique resulting in the amplification of a nested product only if the mutation was present. This sensitive technique can identify mutated DNA in the presence of wild-type DNA. The mutation was identified in 4 of 20 (20%) ciliary body and 11 of 30 (40%) choroidal melanomas. Further analysis of separate areas within the same choroidal melanoma demonstrated that the mutation was not present in the entire tumour. In conclusion, the T1799A BRAF mutation is present in a proportion of posterior uveal melanomas but within these tumours the distribution of the mutation is heterogeneous.",

In order to explore the prognostic significance of these molecules in melanoma, total SCF, SCF splice variants and c-Kit expression were studied in normal skin melanocytes and in 11 different melanoma cell lines, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nine of the 11 melanoma cell lines expressed SCF-1 mRNA, only two of them SCF-2, and these two also SCF-1. Coexpression of both SCF-1 and c-Kit was noted in five cell lines, and only one cell line as well as normal melanocytes expressed both SCF-1 and SCF-2 as well as c-Kit. Corresponding results were obtained on immunocytochemical staining. Of three exemplary melanoma cell lines studied, two expressing SCF mRNA also released SCF spontaneously and on stimulation, whereas the line lacking SCF and c-kit mRNA (SK-Mel-23) failed to do so. These data demonstrate thus that melanoma cell lines, particularly those known to metastasize in vivo, lose the ability to express SCF-2 mRNA, suggesting that this molecule may serve, next to c-Kit, as a prognostic marker for malignant melanoma.",

Microdissection was targeted on band 6q21. Direct PCR amplification of dissected DNA was first used as a probe in chromosomal in situ hybridization of normal metaphases to confirm the specificity of material excised for cloning. A genomic library of 20,000 clones, which is highly enriched for sequences encompassing 6q21, was then constructed. Clones from this library have been mapped against a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel that divides chromosome 6 into seven regions, confirming the localization of probes within the target region. Direct PCR amplification of DNA excised by microdissection greatly simplifies and facilitates this chromosome band-specific cloning strategy. The isolation of microclones from this region of chromosome 6 should assist in establishing a physical map of the melanoma deletion region.",

Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13, 10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes 1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain.

We have therefore studied the prevalence of germline 9p deletions encompassing the CDKN2 locus in melanoma pedigrees, using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Germline deletions were found in 3 of 93 UK pedigrees, with no previously identified CDKN2A mutations. A hemizygous deletion of CDKN2A exon 1beta previously reported by this group was confirmed in one family and identified in a second. Microsatellite analysis determined that these two families were ancestrally related. In the third family, a novel p16 hemizygous deletion involving CDKN2A exons 1alpha, 2, and 3 was detected. An additional 9p21 deletion reported previously in a USA melanoma-neural system tumor family was shown to involve CDKN2A exon 1beta, and not p16. The CDKN2A exon 1beta deletions provide further evidence that this tumor suppressor gene is important in melanoma-neural system tumor susceptibility, but do not exclude the possibility of a novel gene or regulatory element also being deleted in this region.

The transfected cells were flow sorted by B7-1 expression into two populations, bright and dim. The bright population had 85%-90% of cells expressing B7-1; the dim population had less than 50% of cells with B7-1 expression. Chromosome analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and G-banding showed that 70% of bright cells had two main integration sites, with extensive amplification of the transgene. The dim population had random signal distribution, with little or no amplification, despite G418 selection. Because B7-1 has been mapped to 3q21, FISH was performed using a chromosome 3 painting probe (WCP) together with a probe for B7-1. In transfected bright M-21 cells, amplified genes that hybridized with the B7-1 construct were localized to chromosome 3 material inserted into marker chromosomes.

Furthermore, resistance frequently develops due to secondary mutations. Approaches to addressing both of these issues as well as combination therapies to optimise use of KIT kinase inhibitors are discussed.;This review covers the occurrence of oncogenic KIT mutations in different cancers and the molecular basis of their action. The action of KIT kinase inhibitors, especially imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib and PKC412, on different primary and secondary mutants is discussed. Outcomes of clinical trials in GIST, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), systemic mastocytosis and melanoma and their implications for future directions are considered.;Analysis of KIT mutations in individual patients is an essential prerequisite to the use of kinase inhibitors for therapy, and monitoring for development of secondary mutations that confer drug resistance is necessary.

Aberrant activation of c-Kit results in dysregulated signaling and is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. The development of more specific and effective c-Kit therapies is warranted given its essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we describe the biological properties of CK6, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the extracellular region of human c-Kit. CK6 specifically binds c-Kit receptor with high affinity (EC 50 = 0.06 nM) and strongly blocks its interaction with SCF (IC 50 = 0.41 nM) in solid phase assays. Flow cytometry shows CK6 binding to c-Kit on the cell surface of human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), melanoma, and leukemia tumor cell lines. Furthermore, exposure to CK6 inhibits SCF stimulation of c-Kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT), in addition to reducing tumor cell line growth in vitro. CK6 treatment significantly decreases human xenograft tumor growth in NCI-H526 SCLC (T/C% = 57) and Malme-3M melanoma (T/C% = 58) models in vivo. The combination of CK6 with standard of care chemotherapy agents, cisplatin and etoposide for SCLC or dacarbazine for melanoma, more potently reduces tumor growth (SCLC T/C% = 24, melanoma T/C% = 38) compared with CK6 or chemotherapy alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that CK6 is a c-Kit antagonist antibody with tumor growth neutralizing properties and are highly suggestive of potential therapeutic application in treating human malignancies harboring c-Kit receptor.

In the present study, 596 blood samples from 186 melanoma patients at various clinical tumour stages, together with samples from 25 healthy volunteers, were analysed with the aim of investigating the value of tyrosinase detection in predicting melanoma recurrence. We suggest a possible role for this marker in the monitoring of melanoma patients after the excision of regional lymph node metastases, and provide evidence that tyrosinase is related to the status of disease in advanced metastatic patients. Moreover, chemotherapy administration appeared to influence tyrosinase determination and may explain the discrepancies in the reported percentages of positive samples.",

Given the lack of specificity of light microscopic features, ancillary studies are needed. In this study, the authors explored the possibility of distinguishing metastatic tumors derived from uveal primaries from those known to have originated from a cutaneous melanoma by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes for chromosome 3, 8q24, and 1p36. A total of 32 metastatic tumors were analyzed by FISH. Monosomy 3 was detected in 9 out of 16 (56.3%) cases of metastatic uveal melanoma but was not found in any of the 16 metastatic cutaneous melanomas (P < .001). With regard to 1p36, amplifications were found in 8 out of 16 (50%) cases of metastatic cutaneous melanoma but not in any case of uveal melanoma (P < .05). 1p36 was deleted in 3 cases of uveal and 1 case of cutaneous melanoma. Amplifications of 8q were found in 15 out of 16 (94%) cases of uveal melanoma metastases and in 12 out of 16 (75%) cases of cutaneous metastases.

How MITF functions in melanoma development and the effects of targeting MITF in vivo are unknown because MITF levels have not been directly tested in a genetic animal model. Here, we use a temperature-sensitive mitf zebrafish mutant to conditionally control endogenous MITF activity. We show that low levels of endogenous MITF activity are oncogenic with BRAF(V600E) to promote melanoma that reflects the pathology of the human disease. Remarkably, abrogating MITF activity in BRAF(V600E)mitf melanoma leads to dramatic tumor regression marked by melanophage infiltration and increased apoptosis. These studies are significant because they show that targeting MITF activity is a potent antitumor mechanism, but also show that caution is required because low levels of wild-type MITF activity are oncogenic.

Targeting BRAF is an effective therapy for advanced melanoma, but patients progress due to the development of resistance. This 'acquired resistance' is thought to be based on a minority of tumour cell populations that are resistant and will eventually re-establish tumour growth even in the presence of drug. In particular, mutations, amplifications or overexpression of genes encoding regulators of the MAPK pathway can confer this resistance, because it allows the melanoma cells to bypass inhibitor action by stimulating ERK activation through alternative routes. Furthermore, there are mechanisms that produce resistance by enhancing the tolerance of melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of the drug. These compensatory mechanisms can activate survival signals in the melanoma cells without reactivating ERK. Besides these cell-autonomous resistance mechanisms, stromal fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment have been identified as a potential source of resistance, because these cells can produce growth factors that reactivate ERK through paracrine signalling. Understanding and further identifying mechanisms of resistance is crucial for the future treatment of advanced melanoma, because this can inform the design of improved therapies with more durable responses.

Here we use a series of melanoma cell lines that recapitulate the phenotypic characteristics of melanomas at varying stages of malignant progression to evaluate the expression levels of Id1 in this model system and determine the mechanism of Id1 dysregulation in these tumor cells. We find elevated protein levels of Id1 to be present consistently in radial growth phase tumor cells in accordance with our primary tumor data. Id1 transcript levels were also found to be elevated in these radial growth phase melanoma cells without any appreciable evidence of gene amplification and Id1 promoter activity was found to correlate with Id expression levels.

Furthermore, loss of expression of DNA mismatch repair proteins has been associated with progression from benign to malignant disease in melanocytic neoplasms, but the presence or absence of mismatch repair defects in uveal melanomas has yet to be determined. This study was designed to establish whether MSI is a feature of these ocular melanomas. To investigate the prevalence of MSI in uveal melanomas, 52 tumours were analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a panel of microsatellite markers selected for their ability to detect tumours exhibiting defects in DNA mismatch repair mechanisms.

However, melanoma tissue is often rich in melanin that co-purifies with DNA/RNA and inhibits subsequent PCR reactions, hampering tumor antigen detection and amplification. This problem has not yet been addressed systematically. Here we generated a photometric protocol to determine both the melanin and RNA concentration by correcting the latter for the absorption coefficient of melanin at 260 nm. Subsequently, different combinations of silica-based RNA-binding, size-exclusion, and ion-exchange columns were used in 8 protocols for isolation of RNA from melanoma tissue to compare efficacy of melanin removal and yield of RNA. Furthermore, the capability of the different RNA preparations to function as template in RT-PCRs with products of different length, i.e. GAP-DH, tyrosinase, and gp100, was tested. We found that the combination of silica-based RNA-binding and size-exclusion columns was not sufficient to remove melanin from highly contaminated tumor samples, and subsequent RT-PCR failed to give larger products. However, protocols including ion-exchange columns resulted in efficient removal of melanin, while retaining reasonable RNA yields in samples from highly pigmented melanomas. Efficient RT-PCR of larger products turned out to be inversely correlated to the melanin contamination. This RNA-purification method will help scientists to isolate polynucleotides from melanin-containing tumor samples, which subsequently can be used in antigen detection assays and vaccination strategies using amplified total tumor RNA.",

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy leads to remarkable anti melanoma responses, but the initial tumor shrinkage is commonly incomplete, providing a nidus for subsequent disease progression. Adaptive signaling may underlie early BRAFi resistance and influence the selection pattern for genetic variants, causing late, acquired resistance. We show here that BRAFi (or BRAFi + MEKi) therapy in patients frequently led to rebound phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in their melanomas early on-treatment. In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT. Thus, adaptive or genetic upregulation of AKT critically participates in melanoma survival during BRAFi therapy. ",

Our data showed gross but nonrandom somatic changes specific to the tumor genome. Although the CDKN2A (78%) and PTEN (70%) loci were the major targets of mono-allelic and bi-allelic deletions, amplifications affected loci with BRAF (53%) and NRAS (12%) as well as EGFR (52%), MITF (40%), NOTCH2 (35%), CCND1 (18%), MDM2 (18%), CCNE1 (10%), and CDK4 (8%). The amplified loci carried additional genes, many of which could potentially play a role in melanoma. Distinct patterns of copy number changes showed that alterations in CDKN2A tended to be more clustered in cell lines with mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes; the PTEN locus was targeted mainly in conjunction with BRAF mutations. Amplification of CCND1, CDK4, and other loci was significantly increased in cell lines without BRAF-NRAS mutations and so was the loss of chromosome arms 13q and 16q. Our data suggest involvement of distinct genetic pathways that are driven either through oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations complemented by aberrations in the CDKN2A and PTEN genes or involve amplification of oncogenic genomic loci and loss of 13q and 16q. It also emerges that each tumor besides being affected by major and most common somatic genetic alterations also acquires additional genetic alterations that could be crucial in determining response to small molecular inhibitors that are being currently pursued.",

To this end, mutant hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficient (HPRT-) T-cells were used as probes to detect T-cell clonal amplifications and trafficking in vivo in patients with advanced melanoma. Mutant T-cells from peripheral blood were obtained as clonal isolates or in mass cultures in the presence of 6-thioguanine (TG) selection and from tumor-bearing lymph nodes (LNs) or metastatic melanoma tissues by TG-selected mass cultures. Nonmutant (wild-type) cells were obtained from all sites by analogous means, but without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains (TCR-beta), determined directly (clonal isolates) or following insertion into plasmids (mass cultures), were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality of mature T-cell clones. Clonal amplifications, identified as repetitive TCR-beta V-region, complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and J-region gene sequences, were demonstrated at all sites studied, that is, peripheral blood, LNs, and metastatic tumors. Amplifications were significantly enriched among the mutant compared with the wild-type T-cell fractions. Importantly, T-cell trafficking was manifested by identical TCR-beta cDNA sequences, including the hypervariable CDR3 motifs, being found in both blood and tissues in individual patients.

Current standard of care typically involves taking fewer than ten histologic sections of the node out of the hundreds of possible sections available in the tissue. We have developed a photoacoustic method that probes the entire intact node. We acquired a lymph node from a healthy canine subject. We cultured a malignant human melanoma cell line HS 936. Approximately 1 x 10(6) cells were separated and injected into the lymph node. We also had a healthy lymph node in which no melanoma cells were implanted. We used a tunable laser system set at 532 nm to irradiate the lymph nodes. Three piezoelectric acoustic detectors were positioned near the lymph node to detect photoacoustic pulses generated within the lymph nodes. We also acquired lymph nodes from pigs and repeated the experiments with increased amplification and improved sensors. We detected photoacoustic responses from a lymph node with as few as 500 melanoma cells injected into the tissue, while normal lymph nodes showed no response.

Melanoma may express all of these proteins. The aim of this study was to investigate whether STI571 inhibits the in-vitro growth of melanoma cells. Nineteen cell lines were obtained from four primary and 15 metastatic melanomas of cutaneous origin.

In this study, we investigated whether PD-L1 expression is controlled by melanoma driver mutations and modified by oncogenic signaling inhibition.;Expression of PD-L1 was investigated in a panel of 51 melanoma cell lines containing different oncogenic mutations, including cell lines with innate and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). The effects of targeted therapy drugs on expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cells were investigated.;No association was found between the level of PD-L1 expression and mutations in BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, or amplification of AKT. Resistance to vemurafenib due to the activation of alternative signaling pathways was accompanied with the induction of PD-L1 expression, whereas the resistance due to the reactivation of the MAPK pathway had no effect on PD-L1 expression. In melanoma cell lines, the effects of BRAF, MEK, and PI3K inhibitors on expression of PD-L1 were variable from reduction to induction, particularly in the presence of INFγ. In PD-L1-exposed lymphocytes, vemurafenib paradoxically restored activity of the MAPK pathway and increased the secretion of cytokines.;In melanoma cell lines, including BRAFi-resistant cells, PD-L1 expression is variably regulated by oncogenic signaling pathways. PD-L1-exposed lymphocytes decrease MAPK signaling, which is corrected by exposure to vemurafenib, providing potential benefits of combining this drug with immunotherapies.",

In addition, the progression of human melanoma towards the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT. This review summarizes our recent data demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly downregulated while c-KIT expression was upregulated in the AP-2 transfected cells. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, MMP-2, p21WAF-1, HER-2, BCL-2, and insulin like growth factor receptor-1, we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.",

Different reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols allowing the quantification of the TAA mRNA expression in the solid tumor or the detection of circulating melanoma cells have been described. We have recently shown a positive correlation between the amount of specific product formed by RT-PCR and the staining intensity in immunohistochemical analysis of the corresponding sample. Here we describe a quantification procedure based on the direct digitization of the PCR products after separation on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, followed by computer-assisted densitometry. To standardize our method, we examined the linear range of the densitometric quantification procedure as reflected by the correlation of signal intensity to the amount of the corresponding DNA. As an internal measure for the so-termed cDNA in the different samples after RNA isolation and reverse transcription, a beta-actin PCR was introduced. Subsequently, we chose four sets of primers for the melanoma-associated antigens MAGE1, tyrosinase, Melan A/MART-1 and gp100/Pmel17 and performed PCR analysis over a range of cycle numbers. In each case, the amplification rate remained constant up to at least 26 cycles under the respective conditions. Plotting the logarithm of the amount of product against the cycle number yields a slope that equals the logarithm of the amplification rate. The amount of starting material can be determined from the intercept with the ordinate. In summary, the method introduced in the present work allows the quantification of TAA in melanoma which might be important for the monitoring of disease. Technically the method is sound and sensitive, avoids post-PCR manipulations and can be performed with the standard equipment of a molecular biology laboratory. It can be applied also to other solid tumors and leukemias.",

In this pilot trial, we examined the toxicity and efficacy of sunitinib malate, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. Twenty patients with metastatic uveal melanoma expressing c-kit, 17 of whom failed previous treatments, were included in this study. Patients received sunitinib malate 37.5 mg daily continuously in 4-week cycles. The evaluation of response was carried out every 8 weeks. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and differences in survivals were tested using the log-rank test. There was one partial response and 12 stable disease (SD) after sunitinib treatment. The median OS and PFS were 8.2 and 4.2 months, respectively. Three patients had SD for more than 12 months with sunitinib after failing previous treatments. The most common adverse events were fatigue (90%), diarrhea (60%), hemorrhage (55%), anorexia (45%), hand-foot syndrome (25%), hypothyroidism (25%), and rash (25%). Eleven patients required a dose reduction to 25 mg daily secondary to grade 3 adverse events. The degree of c-kit expression in melanoma cells was not associated with longer PFS or OS. Patients who developed systemic metastases after more than 5 years of their initial diagnosis had better PFS (median PFS: 5.8 vs. 2.6 months, P=0.005).

In 68 families with increased hereditary susceptibility to malignant melanoma, we previously reported a low frequency of alterations in the CDKN2A gene, which is regarded as the major melanoma predisposition gene. Among these alterations, we identified a novel mutation in 3 families (Asp108Tyr). In the present study, we focused on the possible role of heritable epimutations as a cause of the silencing of the CDKN2A gene. We used two different technical approaches to detect changes in CpG methylation in the promoter region of the CDKN2A gene; methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis of bisulfite-converted DNA and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). From families who tested negative for germ-line CDKN2A mutations, 64 unrelated patients with hereditary melanoma were included in the study. We showed a consistent lack of hypermethylation in the promoter region of CDKN2A in patients with HMM in our western Swedish population. A putative germ-line methylation of the CDKN2A, if any, is therefore likely to be a rare event in hereditary melanoma.

Coexpression of the growth factor and receptor suggests their role in autocrine or paracrine growth mechanisms. Imatinib mesylate was previously reported to have specific activity in inhibiting select tyrosine kinase receptors, including PDGF and c-Kit. Melanoma cells express abundant levels of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Nevertheless, c-Kit expression is progressively lost as the cells take on a more highly metastatic phenotype. To investigate the potential of imatinib mesylate as a therapy for melanoma, we studied its effect on the growth of melanoma cells using an in vivo mouse model. Melanoma cells with high malignant potential (PDGFR-positive, c-Kit-negative) or low malignant potential (PDGFR-positive, c-Kit-positive) were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. Mice were treated with imatinib mesylate (100 mg/kg three times weekly) or with phosphate-buffered saline for 4 to 6 wk. PDGFR-alpha and -beta were expressed on all melanoma cell lines tested. The level of PDGFR expression correlated with the metastatic potential of the melanoma cells: higher levels of PDGFR-alpha were expressed on cells with higher metastatic potential, and higher levels of PDGFR-beta were expressed on cells with lower metastatic potential. There was no significant difference in tumor size between treated and control mice. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated inhibition of PDGFR phosphorylation on the tumors from mice treated with imatinib mesylate but not from control mice, suggesting that the receptors were functional and that the concentration of drug used was appropriate.

Tumor cells migration within the 3-D collagen matrix was microscopically recorded with a time-lapse video recorder and analyzed by computer-assisted cell tracking. Gelatin zymography was adopted to assay the metalloproteinases secretion. A polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) was used for measuring telomerase activity. The results demonstrated that B16BL6 and B16F10 cells were highly invasive compared to B16 cells, but the melanin content of B16F10 was very low. B16F10 and B16BL6 were hypermotile and secreted much more metalloproteinases than B16. No differences were observed in telomerase activity among the three melanoma cell lines. Invasion of mouse melanoma was closely correlated to tumor cell migration and secretion of metalloproteinases. Melanin content and telomerase activity were phenotypically not related to invasiveness in these three mouse melanoma cell lines.",

However, mast cell-deficient mouse models based on c-kit defects have recently been questioned for their relevance. Here we addressed the effect of mast cells in a tumor setting by using transgenic Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice, in which the deficiency of mast cells is independent of c-kit defects. Melanoma cells (B16.F10) were administered either subcutaneously or intravenously into Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice or Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ littermate controls, followed by the assessment of formed tumors. In the subcutaneous model, mast cells were abundant in the tumor stroma of control mice but were absent in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice. However, the absence of mast cells did not affect tumor size. In contrast, after intravenous administration of B16.F10 cells, melanoma colonization of the lungs was markedly reduced in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals. Decreased melanoma colonization of the lungs in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ animals was accompanied by increased inflammatory cell recruitment into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting that mast cells suppress inflammation in this setting. Further, qPCR analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of Twist and E-cadherin in lungs of Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. control Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals, suggesting an impact of mast cells on epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, this study reveals that mast cells promote melanoma colonization of the lung.",

Tyrosinase mRNA in peripheral blood from these patients was assayed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction prior to initiation of adjuvant interferon, at completion of 1 month of intravenous interferon and at 3 monthly intervals until progression. Four hundred and eighteen blood samples from 60 melanoma patients were analysed. The median follow-up time calculated from the time of inclusion in the study was 23 months (range 2-38 months). Tyrosinase mRNA in blood was detected in 42 (70%) of 60 patients: 16 (76%) of 21 stage IIB patients and 26 (66% ) of 39 stage III patients. The presence of tyrosinase mRNA in blood was correlated with a shorter disease-free survival (P : 0.03) and in multivariante analysis was an independent prognostic factor for relapse. Patients who seroconverted to a negative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction after induction treatment had a significantly lower probability of recurrence. The presence of circulating melanoma cells is a marker of a high relapse risk and shorter disease-free survival whether detected postoperatively or during follow-up.

The spectrum of canine melanocytic neoplasia includes benign lesions with some analogy to nevi, as well as invasive primary melanoma, and widespread metastasis. Growing evidence of distinct subtypes in humans, differing in somatic and predisposing germ-line genetic alterations, cell of origin, epidemiology, relationship to ultraviolet radiation and progression from benign to malignant tumors, may also exist in dogs. Canine and human mucosal melanomas appear to harbor BRAF, NRAS, and c-kit mutations uncommonly, compared with human cutaneous melanomas, although both species share AKT and MAPK signaling activation.

Here, we investigated the role of BRAF(V600E) signaling in altering gene methylation in the genome of melanoma cells using a methylated CpG island amplification/CpG island microarray system and searched for genes coupled to the BRAF(V600E) signaling through methylation aberrations. The results indicated that a wide range of genes with broad functions were linked to BRAF(V600E) signaling through their hyper- or hypomethylation. Expression of 59 genes hypermethylated upon BRAF knockdown was selectively tested and found to be largely correspondingly underexpressed, suggesting that these genes were naturally hypomethylated, and overexpressed with BRAF(V600E) in melanoma. This BRAF(V600E)-promoted hypomethylation was confirmed on genes selectively examined in primary melanoma tumors. Some of these genes were functionally tested and demonstrated to play a role in melanoma cell proliferation and invasion. As a mechanism of aberrant gene methylation driven by BRAF(V600E), expression of the DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone methyltransferase EZH2 was profoundly affected by BRAF(V600E). We have thus uncovered a previously unrecognized prominent epigenetic mechanism in the tumorigenesis of melanoma driven by BRAF(V600E).

The p16(INK4a)-Cyclin D-CDK4/6-pRb pathway is dysregulated in 90% of melanomas. CDK4/Cyclin D kinase hyperactivation, associated with mutation of CDK4, amplification of Cyclin D or loss of p16(INK4a) leads to increased risk of developing melanoma. This kinase therefore constitutes a key biomarker in melanoma and an emerging pharmacological target, however there are no tools enabling direct detection or quantification of its activity. Here we report on the design and application of a fluorescent peptide biosensor to quantify CDK4 activity in melanoma cell extracts, skin biopsies and melanoma xenografts. This biosensor provides sensitive means of comparing CDK4 activity between different melanoma cell lines and further responds to CDK4 downregulation by siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors. By affording means of monitoring CDK4 hyperactivity consequent to cancer-associated molecular alterations in upstream signaling pathways that converge upon this kinase, this biosensor offers an alternative to immunological identification of melanoma-specific biomarkers, thereby constituting an attractive tool for diagnostic purposes, providing complementary functional information to histological analysis, of particular utility for detection of melanoma onset in precancerous lesions. This is indeed the first fluorescent peptide biosensor which has been successfully implemented to monitor kinase activity in skin samples and melanoma tumour xenografts. Moreover by enabling to monitor response to CDK4 inhibitors, this biosensor constitutes an attractive companion assay to identify compounds of therapeutic relevance for melanoma. ",

Recently, a new technique for the high-resolution analysis of copy number changes named digital karyotyping was introduced. This approach is derived from SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and allows the detection of genomic amplifications and deletions, which are indicative of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Four human melanoma cell lines were subjected to analysis by digital karyotyping. 828,780 genomic tags were generated and analyzed quantitatively. Thereby, we identified a somatic, homozygous deletion of 570 kbp removing exons 3-29 of the dystrophin (DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) gene. Analysis of 51 melanoma cell lines further revealed a homozygous and a hemizygous deletion in DMD. Furthermore, DMD mRNA expression was downregulated with respect to primary melanocytes and accompanied by loss of dystrophin protein expression in 38 of 55 (69%) and significantly reduced in 10 of 55 (18%) melanoma cell lines. Sequence analysis of DMD cDNAs in 37 melanoma cell lines revealed six new sequence variants with a significantly lower frequency than previously described DMD polymorphisms, which may affect dystrophin function. Knock-down of DMD enhanced migration and invasion, whereas re-expression of DMD attenuated migration and induced a senescent phenotype in melanoma cell lines. Therefore, loss of DMD may critically change the migratory and proliferative capacity of melanocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that inactivation of DMD is involved in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma.",

In a meeting chaired by Dr Mihm, a list of biomarkers of interest in melanoma was compiled. The specialized programs of research excellence (SPORE) in skin cancer developed a melanocytic tumor progression tissue microarray (TMA) to evaluate these candidate biomarkers. In addition to markers reported elsewhere, we evaluated c-Kit, MITF, MART1, HMB-45 and bcl-2.;The TMA contains 480 cores of benign nevi, primary cutaneous melanoma and melanoma metastases. Immunohistochemical detection of melanoma biomarkers, including c-Kit, MITF, MART-1, HMB-45 and bcl-2 was performed.;Intense nuclear staining for MITF protein was observed in 83% of nevi, 56% of primary melanomas and 23% of metastases. Bcl-2 expression was reduced with progression to metastasis (detected in 86, 89 and 52% of nevi, primaries and metastases, respectively), contrary to MART-1, which showed no differential expression (74, 85 and 84%). HMB-45 was observed in 18% of nevi and most (72 and 75%) primary melanomas and metastases. c-Kit protein increased with progression from nevi to primary tumor (10 and 77% of cases, respectively) and was decreased in metastases (26% of cases).;Through a collaboration of the Skin SPOREs sponsored by the Organ Systems Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), we identified a list of melanoma biomarkers of interest, developed a melanocytic tumor progression TMA and completed a coordinated analysis of these biomarkers. This TMA has served as a powerful validation tool for newly identified and known melanoma biomarkers by revealing trends in expression during tumor progression and by confirming the heterogeneity of biomarker expression in cutaneous melanocytic tumors.",

These poor results may come from treating all melanomas as though they are biologically homogeneous. Recently, it has been shown that targeting specific activated tyrosine kinases (oncogenes) can have striking clinical benefits in patients with melanoma. In 2002, a V600E mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine kinase was described as present in more than 50% of all melanomas. The mutation appeared to confer a dependency by the melanoma cancer cell on activated signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The frequency and focality of this mutation (>95% of all BRAF mutations being at V600 position) suggested its importance in melanoma pathophysiology and potential as a target for therapy. The recent results of a phase 1 study with PLX4032/RG7204, a small molecule RAF inhibitor, confirm this hypothesis. Mucosal and acral-lentiginous melanomas, comprising 3% of all melanomas, frequently harbor activating mutations of c-kit and drugs targeting this mutation seem to confer similar benefits for these types of tumors.

To initiate molecular genetic analysis of 96-kDa MAA, the gene encoding the Ag was transfected into mouse B16 melanoma cell clone B78H1. Formation of B78H1-transfectant colonies expressing a surface Ag reactive with mAb CL203.4 in an immunorosetting assay was dependent on addition of chromosomal DNA from human melanoma cells [primary (1 degree) transfer] or from Ag-expressing transfectant cells (2 degrees, 3 degrees, 4 degrees transfer). The mAb CL203.4-reactive species expressed by the transfectant cells is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass 93-kDa, within the range of 93 to 96-kDa observed for the endogenous human Ag. In the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, both mouse melanoma transfectants and human melanoma cells express a 50- to 51-kDa antigenic species. Human alu family repeat sequences (h-alu) are present in the genomes of 3 degrees transfectant cells. Continued presence of these h-alu after dilution of extraneous human DNA by three cycles of transfection suggests their association with the transferred 96-kDa MAA gene. Use of a selective co-amplification procedure led to transfectant cells' increased expression of 96-kDa MAA and to commensurate increases in their content of presumed 96-kDa MAA gene-associated h-alu.

Selective lymphadenectomy consists of the intraoperative identification of the first node in the nodal basin, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Routine examination, serial sectioning, and immunohistochemistry may underestimate the presence of tumor cells. PCR is a molecular biology technique that may be useful for the detection of malignant melanoma nodal metastases in the SLN.;The aim of this study was to use tyrosinase messenger RNA (mRNA) amplification for the detection of micrometastases in fresh frozen SLNs.;46 hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-negative sentinel node samples from 42 patients with malignant melanoma were included in this study. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were immunostained with S-100 protein and HMB-45. A central portion of the node was submitted for PCR. This method was accomplished with a combination of reverse transcription and amplification of the tyrosinase complementary DNA and double- round PCR (nested reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR).;In 1 of the 42 SLN-negative patients, immunohistochemistry stains allowed the detection of micrometastases. With molecular biology, 14 of the 42 SLN patients were positive (33%); in another 12 (29%), only the nested RT-PCR was positive.

Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and RT-PCR both successfully amplified target RNA in peripheral blood samples from patients with melanoma and colorectal cancer, but only RT-PCR detected PSA in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer. There was relatively good agreement between sample replicates analyzed by RT-PCR (Kappa values of one for tyrosinase, 0.67 for CK-20 and one for PSA), but less agreement when analyzed by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification.

The significance and practical value of these procedures for the diagnosis of tumor dissemination in melanoma patients is, however, still unclear. We analyzed peripheral blood samples of melanoma patients of different clinical stages for the presence of tyrosinase mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition to a nested RT-PCR-based system, we evaluated the new PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tyrosinase system for sensitivity and specificity in detecting circulating melanoma cells. Our results showed a high sensitivity and specificity for this system in detecting one melanoma cell in 1 ml of whole blood. Using different methods of detection, no tyrosinase mRNA was detectable in blood samples of patients with primary melanoma and regional lymph node metastases. In a small number of patients with visceral metastases (10-30%), we found tyrosinase mRNA-positive results. Analyses of different blood samples taken at 2-h intervals indicate that tumor cells persist only transiently in the peripheral blood. Successful establishment of melanoma cell growth from tyrosinase mRNA-positive samples indicates that viable tumor cells exist in melanoma patients' peripheral blood. Our results indicate a low amount of tyrosinase-specific transcripts in a small subset of stage IV patients and suggest that the analysis of tyrosinase mRNA in peripheral blood samples is not helpful as a prognostic marker or monitoring tool in melanoma patients.",

BCL2's regulation by Mitf was verified in melanocytes and melanoma cells and by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the BCL2 promoter. Mitf also regulates BCL2 in osteoclasts, and both Mitf(mi/mi) and Bcl2(-/-) mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis. Disruption of Mitf in melanocytes or melanoma triggered profound apoptosis susceptible to rescue by BCL2 overexpression. Clinically, primary human melanoma expression microarrays revealed tight nearest neighbor linkage for MITF and BCL2.

This suggests that BRAF and NRAS 'double mutants' may not provide advantage for tumour growth, or may even be selected against during tumorigenesis. However, by applying mutant-allele-specific-amplification-PCR method to short-term melanoma lines, one out of 14 tumours was found to harbour both BRAFV600E and the activating NRASQ61R mutations. On the other hand, analysis of 21 melanoma clones isolated by growth in soft agar from this tumour indicated that 16/21 clones harboured a BRAFV600E, but were wild-type for NRAS, whereas the remaining had the opposite genotype (NRASQ61R/wild-type BRAF). When compared to BRAFV600E clones, NRASQ61R clones displayed reduced growth in soft agar, but higher proliferative ability in vitro in liquid medium and even in vivo after grafting into SCID/SCID mice. These data suggest that NRAS and BRAF activating mutations can coexist in the same melanoma, but are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level. Moreover, the presence of NRASQ61R or BRAFV600E is associated with distinct in vitro and in vivo growth properties of neoplastic cells.",

The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumour with increasing -incidence and poor prognosis in the metastatic stage. In recent years, a substantial number of reports on individual miRNAs or miRNA patterns have been published providing strong evidence that miRNAs might play an important role in malignant melanoma and might help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of melanoma development and progression. A major preliminary finding was that melanoma-associated miRNAs are often located in genomic regions with frequent gains and losses in tumours. Detailed studies of different groups thereafter identified miRNAs with differential expression in benign melanocytes compared with melanoma cell lines or in benign melanocytic lesions compared with melanomas. Among these were let-7a and b, miR-23a and b, miR-148, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-211, miR214, and miR-221 and 222. Some of these miRNAs target well-known melanoma-associated genes like the NRAS oncogene, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT or AP-2 transcription factors (TFAP2). Although we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in malignant melanoma, these findings further underscore the notion of a direct involvement of miRNAs in melanoma biology. Very recently, a prognostic signature of six miRNAs has been identified consisting of miRNAs miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-145, miR-155, and miR-497. High expression of these miRNAs was shown to be associated with improved long-term survival of metastatic patients.",

These alterations are of prognostic relevance and have also be shown to correlate to high risk and low risk metastatic categories of uveal melanoma as defined by micro-array analysis. It is, however, possible that a catalogue of relevant genetic alterations, involving gene rearrangement rather than amplification, have as yet eluded identification. To address this point we examined 14 primary uveal melanomas, using 24 colour multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH). All tumours were karyotyped following G-Banding, and M-FISH was performed to confirm and clarify the identity of abnormal chromosomes. M-FISH data were obtained from all tumours and was able to establish the nature of most abnormalities not fully characterized by cytogenetics. Abnormalities of chromosome 6 were far more frequent than previously indicated, in approximately 70% of cases, indicating they have been substantially underrepresented in past studies of uveal melanoma. Spindle melanomas were found to have novel rearrangements affecting in particular chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, suggesting that juxtaposition of genes through translocational events may play a role in the development of some uveal melanomas. In conclusion, this study is the largest of primary uveal melanoma analysed by M-FISH and indicates that alterations of chromosome 6 have previously been underestimated. Furthermore spindle melanomas are prone to rearrangements affecting chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, which may relate to early changes in uveal melanoma development or associate with those melanomas of a more differentiated status.",

We completed a preliminary clinical trial applying cantilever array sensors to demonstrate identification of a BRAF(V600E) single-point mutation using total RNA obtained from biopsies of metastatic melanoma of diverse sources (surgical material either frozen or fixated with formalin and embedded in paraffin). The method is faster than the standard Sanger or pyrosequencing methods and comparably sensitive as next-generation sequencing. Processing time from biopsy to diagnosis is below 1 day and does not require PCR amplification, sequencing, and labels. ",

We tested this hypothesis in a human tumour spontaneous metastasis model, using six clones and variants isolated from the parental poorly metastatic M4Be melanoma cell line, and expressing various metastatic abilities. The spontaneous rates of mutation to ouabain resistance measured in these cells by Luria and Delbrück fluctuation analysis correlated with the metastatic ability of the cells: moderately and highly metastatic cells showed spontaneous mutation rates 10 to 50 times higher than those of poorly metastatic cells. Genomic instability at the chromosome level was assessed by searching for accumulated structural abnormalities in the moderately and highly metastatic cell lines. All the cell lines appeared hypertriploid, and showed comparable modal numbers and great chromosome dispersion. Unstable DNA amplification in the form of double minute chromosomes was shown in one of the four poorly metastatic cell lines, and in a significantly higher proportion of the cells of two of the three metastatic cell lines. Abnormal chromosomes were demonstrated in all cell lines, with markers involving specific rearrangements of chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 and 15, as frequently observed in human melanoma cells. Clonal markers were present in all cell lines, documenting the common origin of all variants and clones, and specific marker amplification was noticed in highly metastatic cells compared to poorly metastatic lines. These results suggest that human tumour progression might be accompanied both by an increase in genomic instability and by accumulation of karyotypic abnormalities.",

Passive immuno-gene therapy, employing an adoptive treatment with in vitro activated and expanded anti-tumor effector cells, involves two major application fields for gene transfer techniques, first the genetic modification of the effector cells, and second the in vivo amplification of pre-effector cells by procedures also used in active immuno-gene therapy. Corresponding preclinical studies are reviewed. The clinical studies inaugurated during the last few years are mostly still ongoing and focus on treatment safety and tolerability rather than efficacy. A recent trend is emerging to explore recombinant adenovirus and vaccinia virus vectors particularly with regard to in vivo gene transfer applications. Overall, immuno-gene therapy of melanoma is still in a highly experimental stage of development but may become a safe, efficacious and practical adjuvant treatment modality in the future.",

A number of PTKs are encoded by proto-oncogenes or viral oncogenes, and are thus strongly implicated in cancer. While a role for PTKs in human melanoma is less firmly established, human melanomas or melanoma cells have been reported to contain more tyrosine phosphate than normal melanocytes, and some receptor PTKs (EPH-A2/ ECK and EPH-B3) are overexpressed in over 90% of melanoma cell lines. Other specific PTKs are also frequently overexpressed, including KDR and fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGF-R4), while, interestingly, yet others, such as KIT and FES, are consistently downregulated in melanoma cell lines. All of these differentially expressed PTKs are candidates for gene products important in melanoma development. In addition, PTKs expressed in significant amounts in both benign and malignant melanocytes, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R), FGF-R1, HER2/NEU and FAK, are likely to play a role in melanoma genesis and progression.",

We previously demonstrated that expression of the cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 correlates directly with the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. In addition, the progression of human melanoma towards the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT. In this review, I will summarize our recent studies demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly down-regulated while c-KIT expression was up-regulated in the AP-2-transfected cells. To further investigate the role of AP-2 in the progression of human melanoma, we attempted to inactivate AP-2 in primary cutaneous melanoma by using a dominant-negative AP-2, or the AP-2B gene. Expression of AP-2B in SB-2 cells augmented their tumorigenicity in nude mice, and upregulated MMP-2 expression and activity. As AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, p21/WAF-1, HER2/neu, Bcl-2, FAS/APO-1, IGF-R-1, VEGF and the thrombin receptor (PAR-1), we therefore propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma. In addition, the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is also associated with over-expression of the transcription factors CREB and ATF-1. The notion that the balance between AP-2 and CREB/ATF-1 expression determines the progression of melanoma cells towards the metastatic phenotype will be discussed.",

This study investigated the ability of high-resolution array-based CGH to serve as a diagnostic test in distinguishing Spitz nevus and melanoma using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. Two of 3 Spitz nevi exhibited no significant chromosomal alterations, while the third showed gain of the short arm of chromosome 11p. The latter finding has previously been described as characteristic of a subset of Spitz nevi. The 2 melanomas showed multiple copy number alterations characteristic of melanoma such as 1q amplification and chromosome 9 deletion. This study has shown the utility of array-based CGH as a potential molecular test in distinguishing Spitz nevus from melanoma. The assay is capable of using archival paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed material; is technically easier to perform as compared with conventional CGH; is more sensitive than conventional CGH in being able to detect focal alterations; and can detect copy number alterations even with relatively small amounts of lesional tissue as is typical of many skin tumors.",

Some follicles contained germinal centers. In contrast to metastatic lesions, primary melanomas did not host follicles, but many contained HEVs, suggesting an incomplete lymphoid neogenesis. Analysis of the repertoire of rearranged immunoglobulin genes in the B cells of microdissected follicles revealed clonal amplification, somatic mutation and isotype switching, indicating a local antigen-driven B-cell response. Surprisingly, IgA responses were observed despite the nonmucosal location of the follicles.

All three tumors were also analyzed for the presence of BRAF mutations. All three metastatic tumors were negative for S100, Melan A, HMB-45 and Tyrosinase but positive for MITF. Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases. In summary, our experience shows that MITF can be a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of metastatic tumors that are suspicious for melanoma but negative for other melanoma markers. ",

Activation of c-Kit induces cell proliferation, differentiation or migration among different cell types. The present study provides evidence that c-Kit plays an important role in the cell differentiation rather than in cell proliferation in pigment cells. We found that normal human melanocytes and a limited number of melanoma cells, e.g. WM35, WM39 and G361 cell lines, expressed the c-Kit gene together with tyrosinase and TRP-1 genes. When exposed to alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, these three cell lines also showed an increased tyrosinase (dopa-oxidase) activity. By incubating these cells with 20 ng/ml of stem cell factor (SCF) which is a ligand of c-Kit receptor, we found a transient increase of tyrosinase activity 2-4 h post-incubation, indicating an early response of tyrosinase activation, either by elevating tyrosinase protein expression or by tyrosinase protein modification (e.g. phosphorylation). However, Western blot analysis using anti-tyrosinase antibody suggested that there was no change of tyrosinase protein expression between SCF-treated and non-treated cells. We therefore suggest that protein modulation of tyrosinase (e.g. phosphorylation) plays an important role in c-Kit-induced melanogenesis.",

Differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed with Western blot analysis. An independent cohort of 41 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) uveal melanomas, whose chromosome 3 status had been determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), was examined for the appropriate antigens by immunohistochemistry.;Four protein spots were 1.5-fold (Student's t-test, P < 0.05) differentially expressed in the two uveal melanoma types: two spots were overexpressed in the disomy 3 group compared with the monosomy 3 group, whereas two spots were underexpressed. Identification of the four spots yielded nine proteins. Western blot analysis confirmed the results for heat shock protein (HSP)-27, vimentin, and pyruvate dehydrogenase beta (PDHB), with a statistical significance for the first two proteins. HSP-27 was significantly downregulated, whereas vimentin was upregulated in the monosomy 3 tumors (Student's t-test, P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively).

This study was aimed to examine the effect of resveratrol, an abundant ingredient of grape and medicinal plants, on α -MSH signaling, viability, and invasiveness in melanoma cells. By α -MSH treatment, the melanin production in B16 melanoma cells was augmented as a validation for activation of α -MSH signaling. The upregulated expression of α -MSH signaling-related molecules β -catenin, c-Kit, and MITF was suppressed by resveratrol and/or STI571 treatment. Nuclear translocation of MITF, a hallmark of α -MSH signaling activation, was inhibited by combined treatment of resveratrol and STI571. At effective concentration, resveratrol and/or STI571 inhibited cell viability and α -MSH-activated matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-)9 expression and invasion capacity of B16 melanoma cells.

These hybrids, derived from the same parental fusion partners, represent a unique genetically matched model for analyzing differential gene expression regulating the metastatic phenotype. We have examined the differences in gene expression in metastatic fusion hybrid compared to its parental partners, non-/poorly metastatic melanoma cells and normal macrophages. An approach by selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and display of 3' end restriction fragments of double-stranded cDNAs was used [Methods Enzymol. 303 (1999) 272]. Gene expression analyses showed an extensive set of transcripts that were up- or down-regulated in the most metastatic hybrid, H95-1, compared to the parental macrophages or melanoma cells. Sequence analyses of more than 60 of these differentially expressed cDNAs revealed significant up- or down-regulation of a number of genes known to be associated with metastasis of melanoma and other solid tumors. Some genes are found to express exclusively either in normal macrophages or in melanoma. Thirteen fragment sequences were found with no matches with GenBank search. Comparison of these gene expression patterns should be of great value in understanding the coordinate programs regulating metastasis.

Examination of the chromatin structure of the transcription unit revealed no qualitative differences in DH sites within the panel of tested human melanoma cells, but especially the sequences around the transcription start site and a 1.5 kb upstream region appeared more accessible to the nuclease in frequently (BLM, MV3) as compared to poorly (530, 1F6) metastasizing cells. The genomic fragments that harbor one or more DH sites were subjected to functional analysis by luciferase reporter gene assays. Thus, an enhancer element was detected between 361 and 167 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This enhancer displayed equal activating potential (2-3 fold) both in weakly and in frequently metastasizing cells and was apparently recognized by transcription factors present in both types of human melanoma cells lines.

BRAF(V600E) induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAF(V600E). Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAF(V600E) stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAF(V600E) signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAF(V600E) signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis.

In melanoma lesions, cells expressing high levels of POU3F2 show enhanced invasive and metastatic capacity that can in part be explained by repression of Micropthalmia-associated Transcription Factor (MITF) expression via POU3F2 binding to its promoter. To identify other POU3F2 target genes that may be involved in modulating the properties of melanoma cells, we performed ChIP-chip experiments in 501Mel melanoma cells. 2108 binding loci located in the regulatory regions of 1700 potential target genes were identified. Bioinformatic and experimental assays showed the presence of known POU3F2-binding motifs, but also many AT-rich sequences with only partial similarity to the known motifs at the occupied loci. Functional analysis indicates that POU3F2 regulates the stem cell factor (Kit ligand, Kitl) promoter via a cluster of four closely spaced binding sites located in the proximal promoter. Our results suggest that POU3F2 may regulate the properties of melanoma cells via autocrine KIT ligand signalling.",

All cell lines except for one nonmetastatic line established from a primary melanoma lost expression of c-kit. Expression of the other four tyrosine kinase receptors varied among the lines.

We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45(-)C-KIT(low/+)TIE2(+) bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.",

Further mutations which can be approached by targeted therapies are found on the c-Kit and NRAS genes. Another promising approach is immunotherapy aimed to activate cytotoxic T cells.

In this study, we investigated the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3 (Foxp3) in melanoma-invaded LNs and determined proportion and functionality of Treg cells among TIL extracted from these 10 metastatic melanoma LNs at different steps of their in vitro expansion.

In addition, functional assays demonstrated that these CD4+CD25(high) T cells were capable of suppressing autologous CD8+ and CD4+CD25- T cell proliferation.

Functional evidences implicate semaphorin signals in cancer progression and metastasis. Yet, it is largely unknown whether plexin genes are genetically altered in human tumors. We performed a comprehensive gene copy analysis and mutational profiling of all nine members of the plexin gene family (plexinome), in melanomas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), which are characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Gene copy analysis detected amplification of PLXNA4 in melanomas, whereas copy number losses of multiple plexin genes were seen in PDACs. Somatic mutations were detected in PLXNA4, PLXNB3, and PLXNC1; providing the first evidence that these plexins are mutated in human cancer. Functional assays in cellular models revealed that some of these missense mutations result in loss of plexin function. For instance, c.1613G>A, p.R538H mutation in the extracellular domain of PLXNB3 prevented binding of the ligand Sema5A. Moreover, although PLXNA4 signaling can inhibit tumor cell migration, the mutated c.5206C>T, p.H1736Y allele had lost this activity.

Purification of the mononuclear cell fraction using a Ficoll gradient with a density of 1.077 g/mL prior to RNA isolation gave the highest sensitivity, with the detection of two SKMEL28 cells in 5 mL of blood. In addition, the RNA isolation method and the kind of RT enzyme used had a significant impact on the sensitivity and reproducibility of tyrosinase detection, whereas variations in the PCR conditions had only a minor influence. Furthermore, we showed that amplification of MelanA in addition to tyrosinase resulted in an approximately 10% enhanced sensitivity of melanoma cell detection, whereas gp100/pMel17 and MUC18 gene products were also detected in blood from non-melanoma patients.

Clinically, DM differs from conventional melanoma by a higher propensity for local recurrence and less frequent metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes. In its pure form, DM has a distinct appearance displaying a low density of fusiform melanocytes in a collagen-rich matrix. Whereas a number of mutations have been identified in primary melanoma, including BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, GNA11, and KIT, and the occurrence of these mutations has been found to correlate to some extent with the histopathologic features, anatomic site, and/or mode of sun exposure, no distinct set of mutations has so far been reported for DM. To study the potential association of neurofibromin (NF1) mutations with DM, we examined 15 desmoplastic and 20 non-DMs by next-generation sequencing. Mutations of the NF1 gene were found in 14 of 15 (93%) DMs and 4 of 20 (20%) non-DMs. The high frequency of NF1 mutations in DMs suggests an important role for NF1 in the biology of this type of melanoma.

Recently, highly recurrent telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-promoter mutations were found in malignant melanomas, which may function as driver mutations of skin cancer. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MUP and mucosal melanomas harbor different prevalences of TERT-promoter mutations. Thirty-nine patients with MUP and 53 patients with mucosal melanomas were retrieved. In total, 152 paraffin samples of 92 patients were analyzed, and in 38 patients, multiple samples were tested. Mutational analysis of the TERT-promoter, BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes was carried out. In total, 92 patients were eligible for mutational analysis. TERT-promoter mutations were found in 33 patients (35.9%): chr5, 1,295,228 C>T (18 patients); chr5, 1,295,250 C>T (11 patients); chr5, 1,295,228-229 CC>TT (three patients); chr5, 1,295,242-243 CC>TT (one patient). The mutations were significantly more prevalent in MUP [26 (66.7%)] than in mucosal melanomas [seven patients (13.2%); P<0.001]. In MUP, BRAF mutations were found in 46.2% of patients (18 patients) and NRAS mutations in 28.2% of patients (11 patients). In mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutations were found in 18.9% of patients (10), and BRAF and KIT mutations in 7.5% of patients (four patients), respectively. The prevalence of TERT-promoter mutations was associated with the patient's sex [23 (51.1%) men, 10 (21.3%) women; P=0.004]. No significant correlation was found between TERT-mutation and patient survival. The TERT-promoter genotype of MUP points toward a cutaneous and not mucosal origin. The significant sex differences merit further attention in having putative therapeutic implications. ",

Most mutations are in exon 17, although exon 11-activating mutations have recently been described. For patients refractory to standard therapeutic protocols for seminoma, the presence of c-kit-activating mutations in some of these neoplasms might suggest an alternative therapy with KIT targeting drugs. We used the novel mutation scanning technique, high-resolution melting amplicon analysis, to screen a series of 22 testicular seminomas for c-kit-activating mutations. Four cases (18%) had exon 17-activating mutations and these included D816Y, D816V, Y823N and one case that contained both D816E and D820H. A single case (5%) had an exon 11-activating mutation. Interestingly, the exon 11-activating mutation was L576P, the same mutation that characterizes the rare c-kit mutation-positive cases of malignant melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for c-kit suggested that most seminomas are probably polysomic for c-kit and there was not a significant difference in c-kit FISH characteristics between the mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases. The use of high-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a screening technique will allow for the rapid identification of patients with testicular seminomas whose tumors contain c-kit-activating mutations.

We have previously demonstrated that the protein melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is involved in the metastasis of and immunosuppression in malignant melanoma. Recently, we further established MIA as a therapeutic target to inhibit metastatic spread in malignant melanoma. We could show that an inhibition of MIA by a synthetic peptide decreased both the number of metastases as well as immunosuppression in a murine model of malignant melanoma. To control recurrence after surgical resection of a primary lesion, it is paramount to have diagnostic tools available that can detect a relapse due to the strong metastatic potential of melanoma. This follow-up is maintained with periodic re-examinations. Due to high cost and the associated radiation exposure, radiology examinations are avoided if possible. The analysis of prognostic markers in patient serum is therefore attractive. In this review, we focus on the quantitative analysis of the MIA protein as a prognostic tool because it has proven to be a useful serum marker for documenting disease progression of malignant melanoma. The MIA quantification assay itself is readily performed using an ELISA kit and common laboratory equipment. Because analysing MIA serum levels in combination with other established markers such as S100B improves their prognostic value, we feel that the quantification of MIA in the serum, among other markers, should be performed as a general standard of care in patients at risk of developing metastatic melanoma.

Targeting just a few out of several potential mutations, BRAF-Inhibitors such as PLX 4032 achieved already tremendous results in the therapy of metastatic melanoma. Up to now, the correlation of clinical, histomorphologic, and genetic features is, however, not understood. Even more, is it not well known precisely what kind of molecular changes predispose the primary melanoma for metastasis. The identification of morphological surrogates and prognostic parameters in tumors with such genetic alteration seems therefore crucial when differentiating and classifying this heterogeneous tumor entity in more detail and thus facilitates the stratification of prognosis as well as therapy.

We investigated the effects of TGF-beta1 on IL-8 expression in the well-characterized A375 human melanoma system. We demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunoassay and Northern blot analysis that TGF-beta1 selectively induced IL-8 expression, at both protein and mRNA levels, in highly metastatic A375SM cells but not cells of their poorly metastatic parental line A375P. Transient transfection with luciferase reporter gene constructs revealed that TGF-beta1 activated IL-8 promoter activity in A375SM cells but not A375P cells. Studies with progressive 5' deletion constructs and site-specific mutations demonstrated that a construct containing -133 to +44 of the 5'-flanking sequence was necessary and sufficient for maximal TGF-beta1-induced transcription response and that TGF-beta1-induced activation of IL-8 promoter depended on AP-1 (-126 to -120 bp), NF-kappaB (-94 to -71 bp), and C/EBP-like factor NF-IL6 (-94 to -81 bp) in this region. Interestingly, both A375P and A375SM cells expressed type I and type II TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta1 induced the nuclear translocation of Smad3 protein in both A375P and A375SM cells. Moreover, both A375P and A375SM cells were susceptible to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition. Our data thus demonstrated that TGF-beta1 selectively induced IL-8 expression in highly metastatic A375SM melanoma cells.

Statistical analysis of receptor tyrosine kinase activation as well as ligand and receptor expression indicates that some receptors, such as FGFR3, may be activated via autocrine circuits. Short hairpin RNA knockdown targeting three of the active kinases identified in the screen, AXL, HER3, and IGF1R, inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells and knockdown of active AXL also reduced melanoma cell migration.

Our results indicate that early passage SSCMs, in the accelerated growth phase, do not show telomeric associations but do have numerical and other specific structural abnormalities. However, the same melanoma cell lines at late passages or melanomas obtained from middle- and old-aged Sinclair swine show extensive telomeric associations in the form of dicentric, multicentric, and ring configurations. Such abnormal structures are present mostly in metaphases that are hyperploids. Increasing frequencies of apoptotic bodies were also observed in higher passage tumor cell lines obtained from younger animals or in melanomas obtained from older animals. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay shows no detectable telomerase activity in any of these regressing swine melanoma cell lines, neither in normal swine skin fibroblasts nor in nevi. However, the fetal swine (i.e., non-regressing) melanoma cells show telomerase activity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results using the commercially available human telomeric repeat DNA probe indicate a reduction of telomeric signals in metaphase and interphase cells of regressing melanomas. From these observations we conclude that spontaneous regression of SSCM is associated with the loss of telomerase activity and a reduction of telomeric repeats that results in the formation of multicentric and ring configurations. Such abnormal chromosome configurations are lost, following the breakage-fusion-bridge-cycles, and result in extensive DNA fragmentation, as shown by laddering experiments, and, finally, cell death.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is the most aggressive of the cutaneous malignancies, causing more than 9,000 deaths in the past year in the United States. Historically, systemic therapies have been largely ineffective, because melanoma is usually resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, during the past few years, several targeted therapies have proved effective in this challenging disease. These recent advances have been facilitated by an improved understanding of the driving genetic aberrations of melanoma, particularly mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, demonstrated an overall survival advantage in phase III trials and is an appropriate option for first-line therapy in metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma. Dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, also have been shown to be effective in phase III trials for BRAF mutant melanoma and may be additional treatment options as monotherapy or in combination pending regulatory approval. Additionally, imatinib is a promising targeted therapy for patients whose tumors harbor a KIT mutation in exons 11 and 13. Although these targeted agents cause objective responses and clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, resistance invariably develops. New targets and strategies to overcome acquired resistance are urgently needed. Furthermore, no effective targeted therapy has been developed for NRAS mutant tumors or in melanomas with as yet unknown driver mutations. In this review, we discuss current molecular targeted treatment options and promising ongoing research to develop new strategies to treat melanoma.",

Primary sites of origin include the head and neck, anorectum and vulvovaginal regions. It is uniquely different from cutaneous melanoma with respect to epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis and prognosis. The etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, exposure to UV light is not an apparent risk factor. Furthermore, distinct molecular features including a lower incidence of BRAF oncogene mutations but a higher incidence of KIT oncogene mutations suggest divergent genetic etiologies. Mucosal melanomas generally present at a later stage, are more aggressive and carry a worse prognosis regardless of the stage at diagnosis. Establishing standardized treatment guidelines has been challenging due to the rarity of the disease. Early detection provides the best chance at survival but is often difficult due to anatomic location. Surgery remains the primary therapeutic intervention if complete resection is technically feasible given the anatomic location. Radiotherapy may be used to achieve local control when resection is not feasible, or adjuvantly to enhance locoregional control, but most studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival. There are no consensus guidelines on the optimal systemic therapy, and regimens are often extrapolated from data based on therapies used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma. Clinical trials, particularly utilizing newer targeted therapies and immunotherapies, are investigating novel treatment approaches. ",

Whereas 100% positivity was initially reported for stage IV patients, more recent investigations reported positive detection rates between 30% and 50% in patients with disseminated melanoma. While the high detection rate initially reported in metastatic melanoma may be explained by contamination problems, methodological differences in different steps of the technical procedure of RT-PCR may account for the differences reported in more recent examinations. Major differences may result from the kind of blood preparation, the RNA isolation method, the kind of RT enzyme used, and the gene targeted by PCR primers. In our experience, blood purification by a Ficoll gradient increased melanoma cell detection rates compared to RNA extraction from total blood or after erythrocyte lysis. Amplification of MelanA in addition to tyrosinase resulted in a 30% enhanced sensitivity of melanoma cell detection compared to amplification to tyrosinase alone, whereas gp100/pMel17 and MUC18 gene products were already detected in blood from nonmelanoma patients. These findings are in agreement with those of other groups. Currently, an increase in the sensitivity for detection of circulating tumour cells to more than 50% of patients with disseminated melanoma seems to be unlikely. It is interesting that between 15% and 30% positive results and sometimes more have already been obtained from patients with primary melanoma. So far, there is no data for judging the prognostic significance of the detection of circulating tumour cells in patients without clinically recognisable metastases. Our limited experience shows that staging examinations in these patients reveal no proof of macrometastasis. Therefore, it is presently unclear whether these positive findings are associated with long-term prognosis or if they merely reflect false positive findings in this highly sensitive RT-PCR technique.",

Growth and metastasis formation in melanomas are regulated by a network of cytokines, cytokine-receptors, and adhesion molecules. However, little is known about surface antigens and target expression profiles in human melanomas. We examined the cell surface antigen profile of human skin melanoma cells by multicolor flow cytometry, and compared their phenotype with 4 melanoma cell lines (A375, 607B, Mel-Juso, SK-Mel28). Melanoma cells were defined as CD45-/CD31- cells co-expressing one or more melanoma-related antigens (CD63, CD146, CD166). In most patients, melanoma cells exhibited ErbB3/Her3, CD44/Pgp-1, ICAM-1/CD54 and IGF-1-R/CD221, but did not express CD20, ErbB2/Her2, KIT/CD117, AC133/CD133 or MDR-1/CD243. Melanoma cell lines were found to display a similar phenotype. In most patients, a distinct subpopulation of melanoma cells (4-40%) expressed the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and ErbB4 together with PD-1 and NGF-R/CD271. Both the EPO-R+ and EPO-R- subpopulations produced melanoma lesions in NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice in first and secondary recipients. Normal skin melanocytes did not express ErbB4 or EPO-R, but expressed a functional KIT receptor (CD117) as well as NGF-R, ErbB3/Her3, IGF-1-R and CD44. In conclusion, melanoma cells display a unique composition of surface target antigens and cytokine receptors. Malignant transformation of melanomas is accompanied by loss of KIT and acquisition of EPO-R and ErbB4, both of which are co-expressed with NGF-R and PD-1 in distinct subfractions of melanoma cells. However, expression of EPO-R/ErbB4/PD-1 is not indicative of a selective melanoma-initiating potential. ",

Our results indicate a correlation between RNA expression and gene amplification in the case of HST but not of INT2.

These effects are performed by activation of the SCF receptor, c-kit. Because of the potential use of SCF in patients undergoing chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, the effect of SCF on nonhematopoietic tumors requires investigation. To determine whether human tumor cell lines display c-kit receptors, we performed binding experiments with 125I-SCF on a breast carcinoma cell line (Du4475), a gastric carcinoma cell line (KATO III), a melanoma cell line (HTT144), as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (H69 and H128). The biologic effect of SCF on tumor cell lines was assessed by its ability to stimulate tritiated thymidine uptake and to enhance colony growth in methylcellulose. The breast carcinoma cell line, Du4475, as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, H69 and H128, exhibit high-affinity c-kit receptors with approximate binding affinities of 40, 100, and 90 pmol/L, respectively. The number of high-affinity receptors per cell ranged from 700 to 9,500. The gastric carcinoma cell line, as well as the melanoma cell line, showed trace binding of 125I-SCF. In the presence of SCF alone, or in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, there was less than a 17% increase in the colony growth of Du4475, H69, or H128 cell lines. Postulating that the lack of growth response could be secondary to endogenous SCF production by the tumor cell lines, we used an RNAse protection assay to determine whether the tumor cell lines contain SCF messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition, we tested tumor cell line supernatants for the presence of secreted SCF protein by enzyme immunoassay, and analyzed the tumor cell lines for membrane-bound SCF by indirect immunofluorescence. Our results show that the Du4475, H69, and H128 cell lines, as well as a melanoma cell line (HTT144), have multiple copies of SCF mRNA. Soluble SCF protein was detected in the cell supernatants in the Du4475 and H69 cell lines and SCF was found on the surface of all four cell lines. These data show that some human solid tumor cell lines display high-affinity c-kit receptors and produce SCF, which can be detected on the cell surface. These results suggest the possibility that autocrine production of SCF by c-kit receptor-bearing tumor cells may enhance cell growth in tumor cell lines.",

The progression of lung metastasis, and lung colonization initiated by intravenous injection of tumor cells, was investigated using B16 melanoma clone G3.12. Analysis of the growth of invisible metastases in organ culture explants of lung revealed that tumors continually disseminated relatively small numbers of lung metastases after reaching a size of about 6 mm in diameter. However, most terminal-stage lung metastases, along with all extrapulmonary metastases, apparently arise from a secondary spread of tumor cells from tumor-derived lung metastases 1-2 mm in size. Individual lung colonies, initiated with G3.12 cells bound to single microbeads, also disseminated large numbers of secondary lung colonies, as well as extrapulmonary colonies, at a 1- to 2-mm size.

The goal of our study was to explore specific chromosomal alterations associated with the aggressive behavior of this neoplasm. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed to screen and compare genomic imbalances present in primary and metastatic melanomas. Sixteen primary and 12 metastatic specimens were analyzed. We found that the pattern of chromosomal aberrations is similar in the two subgroups; however, alterations present only in primary and/or metastatic tumors were also discovered. The mean number of genetic changes was 6.3 (range 1-14) in primary and 7.8 (range 1-16) in metastatic lesions. Frequent losses involved 9p and 10q, whereas gains most often occurred at 1q, 6p, 7q, and 8q. Distinct, high-level amplifications were mapped to 1p12-p21 and 1p22-p31 in both tumor types. Amplification of 4q12-q13.1, 7q21.3-qter and 8q23-qter were detected only in primary tumors. The 20q13-qter amplicon was present in a metastatic tumor. The number of genetic alterations were significantly higher in primary tumors which developed metastases within one year after the surgery compared to tumors without metastasis during this time period. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromeric and locus-specific probes was applied to validate CGH results on a subset of tumors. Comparison of FISH and CGH data gave good correlation. The aggressive behavior of melanoma is associated with accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. Chromosome regions, which differ in the primary and metastatic lesions, may represent potential targets to identify metastases-related chromosomal alterations.",

Numerous studies, including our own, linked arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) supplementation to induction of apoptosis and decreased proliferation of various cancer cells. The cytotoxic effects result from lipid peroxidation and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which modify proteins and nucleic acids. DNA damage by ROS causes mutations and genomic instability, leading to uncontrolled proliferation or cell death. In the present work, four human melanoma cell lines differing in origin, doubling time, metastatic potential, and melanin content (A375, A2058, G361, and C32) were exposed to AA, EPA or DHA added into culture media in the concentrations ranging from 0 (control) to 100 mM. After 24 h incubation cytotoxicity of the analyzed acids was determined with TOX-2 (In Vitro Toxicology Assay Kit XTT Based, TOX-2, Sigma) test. The oxidative protein modifications were measured using Aldehyde Site (DNA and Protein) Detection Kit (Cayman). All the acids tested showed marked inhibition of cell proliferation. The observed effects were statistically significant and depended on the concentration. Decrease of proliferation, associated by oxidative protein and DNA damage (measured as aldehyde sites in cells), was observed for EPA and DHA (50 mM and 100 mM) in A375, A2058, and G361 cells. In case of C32 cell line, which is amelanotic melanoma, EPA and DHA inhibited cell proliferation at 100 mM only. The effect of DHA was more pronounced. AA did not show its antiproliferative action in this cell line. The obtained results suggest that antiproliferative effects of the fatty acids in cultured human melanoma cells depend on the type of acid, its concentration and may be diverse when different melanoma cell lines are used.",

Instead, they are characterized by activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, two highly homologous α subunits of Gαq/11 heterotrimeric G proteins, and in PLCB4 (phospholipase C β4), the downstream effector of Gαq signaling. We analyzed genomics data from 136 uveal melanoma samples and found a recurrent mutation in CYSLTR2 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) encoding a p.Leu129Gln substitution in 4 of 9 samples that lacked mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, and PLCB4 but in 0 of 127 samples that harbored mutations in these genes. The Leu129Gln CysLT2R mutant protein constitutively activates endogenous Gαq and is unresponsive to stimulation by leukotriene. Expression of Leu129Gln CysLT2R in melanocytes enforces expression of a melanocyte-lineage signature, drives phorbol ester-independent growth in vitro, and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. Our findings implicate CYSLTR2 as a uveal melanoma oncogene and highlight the critical role of Gαq signaling in uveal melanoma pathogenesis. ",

Protein expression patterns in whole slides and TMA sections from 34 melanoma patients were compared for a number of inflammation and tumor cell markers using immunohistochemical stains against CD8 (lymphocytes), CD163 (macrophages), micropthalmia transcription factor, N-cadherin, melanoma cell-adhesion molecule, and c-kit protein (CD117). Using simplified versions of previously published grading systems, the agreement between TMA and whole slide sections ranged between 83 and 96%, and between 81 and 97% for inflammation and tumor cell markers, respectively.

The conventional classification system for this disease is based on histological growth patterns, with division into four subtypes: superficial spreading, lentigo maligna, nodular, and acral lentiginous. Major limitations of this classification system are absence of prognostic importance and little correlation with treatment outcomes. Recent preclinical and clinical findings support the notion that melanoma is not one malignant disorder but rather a family of distinct molecular diseases. Incorporation of genetic signatures into the conventional histopathological classification of melanoma has great implications for development of new and effective treatments. Genes of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway harbour alterations sometimes identified in people with melanoma. The mutation Val600Glu in the BRAF oncogene (designated BRAF(V600E)) has been associated with sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to agents that inhibit BRAF(V600E) or MEK (a kinase in the MAPK pathway). Melanomas arising from mucosal, acral, chronically sun-damaged surfaces sometimes have oncogenic mutations in KIT, against which several inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy. Some uveal melanomas have activating mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, rendering them potentially susceptible to MEK inhibition.

These alterations may result from inaccurate chromosomal segregation during mitosis, which can occur through several mechanisms including defective telomere metabolism, centrosome amplification, dysfunctional centromeres, and/or defective spindle checkpoint control. In this work, we used an in vitro murine melanoma model that uses a cellular adhesion blockade as a transforming factor to characterize telomeric and centromeric alterations that accompany melanocyte transformation. To study the timing of the occurrence of telomere shortening in this transformation model, we analyzed the profile of telomere length by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization and found that telomere length significantly decreased as additional rounds of cell adhesion blockages were performed. Together with it, an increase in telomere-free ends and complex karyotypic aberrations were also found, which include Robertsonian fusions in 100% of metaphases of the metastatic melanoma cells. These findings are in agreement with the idea that telomere length abnormalities seem to be one of the earliest genetic alterations acquired in the multistep process of malignant transformation and that telomere abnormalities result in telomere aggregation, breakage-bridge-fusion cycles, and CIN. Another remarkable feature of this model is the abundance of centromeric instability manifested as centromere fragments and centromeric fusions. Taken together, our results illustrate for this melanoma model CIN with a structural signature of centromere breakage and telomeric loss.",

Except for the NH2-terminal sequence, HEMCAM is identical to gicerin, a molecular involved in neurite outgrowth and Wilm's kidney tumor progression in the chicken and it is significantly homologous with MUC18 a molecule involved in melanoma progression and metastasis in human beings. In the bone marrow the HEMCAM+ cell population contains c-kit+ subsets. HEMCAM+ cells coexpressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit give rise to T cells at a frequency of 0.17 when injected intrathymically in congenic animals. As HEMCAM+, c-kit+ cells differentiate into myeloid and erythroid CFU's the double-positive cell population seems to contain precursors for multiple lineages. HEMCAM promotes cell-cell adhesion of transfected cells. Cross-linking of murine HEMCAM leads to cell spreading of T-lymphocyte progenitors adhering to the vascular adhesion molecules, PECAM-1 and VCAM-1.

Given that large deletions involving CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) account for only 2% of cases, we describe a family that highlights the co-occurrence of both melanoma and neural system tumours to aid clinical recognition and propose a management strategy. A patient with multiple neurofibromas was referred with a provisional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior molecular testing, though, had failed to identify an NF1 mutation by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. His family history was significant for multiple in situ/malignant melanomas at young ages and several different cancers reminiscent of an underlying syndrome. A search of the Familial Cancer Database, FaCD Online, highlighted several families with cutaneous melanoma and nervous system tumours who were subsequently identified to have large deletions spanning CDKN2A. Although sequencing of CDKN2A and TP53 failed to identify a mutation, a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion was identified by targeted array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH and SNP analysis identified an interstitial deletion of at least 1.5 Mb within 9p21.3 and spanning approximately 25 genes. Identification of the underlying molecular abnormality permits predictive testing for at-risk relatives. Given the young cancer diagnoses, a surveillance regimen was developed and a clinical team organised for ongoing management so that genetic testing could be offered to both adults and minor children. Surveillance recommendations addressed cancer risks associated with FAMMM, and other cancers exhibited by this family with a large contiguous gene deletion.",

The molecular changes associated with these transitions are not yet well defined. However, transcriptional regulation of some genes that are critical in melanoma progression is beginning to be elucidated. The first part of this review will focus on our recent studies demonstrating that progression of human melanoma is associated with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. In metastatic melanoma cells, this loss resulted in overexpression of MCAM/MUC18 and MMP-2, and lack of expression of c-KIT. In further investigations, we inactivated AP-2 in SB-2 primary cutaneous melanoma cells by using a dominant-negative AP-2, the AP-2B gene. Expression of AP-2B in SB-2 cells augmented their tumorigenicity in nude mice and upregulated MMP-2 expression and activity. We have also recently demonstrated that loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells resulted in overproduction of the thrombin receptor, PAR-1. Other studies have shown that AP-2 regulates additional genes involved in melanoma development and progression, including E-cadherin, p21/WAF-1, HER2, Bcl-2, FAS/APO-1, IGF-R-1, and VEGF. We propose that loss of AP-2 is crucial in the development of malignant melanoma. Additionally, the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is associated with overexpression of two transcription factors, CREB and ATF-1, both of which may act as survival factors for human melanoma cells. The second part of the review will briefly discuss the role of other transcription factors, including ATF-2, SNAIL, MITF, and NFkappaB in the progression of human melanoma and will summarize recent knowledge on how changes in the expression of these transcription factors contribute to acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in human melanoma.",

Genes targeted by the miRNAs were found to be present in chromosomal regions 8p22, 13q, and 17p but were often found to be deleted.;This technique can be applied to routine pathology using archival specimens to identify patients with monosomy 3. We were able to perform CISH in all the cases except the heavily pigmented tumors, where dots were observed but were not assessed. Initial studies on microRNA have revealed their role as oncomirs in both metastasizing and non-metastasizing melanomas. Further studies may provide insights into their role in tumor progression and facilitate metastatic phenotype analysis.",

Archival pathology specimens of confirmed IM cases were analysed for chromosomal alterations, using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or microsatellite analysis (MSA) depending on DNA yield, and BRAF mutation status.;5189 patients were diagnosed with intraocular melanoma at LOOC from 1993 to 2015. Of these, 303 (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with IM. Tissue samples were available for 26 IM cases. Twelve of these cases had biopsies taken post-proton beam radiotherapy (PBR). Histological subtyping showed 14 IM being spindle, 2 epithelioid and 10 were of mixed cell type. Twenty of the 26 IM cases (77%) analysed genetically were classified as either disomy 3 (n=16) or monosomy 3 (n=4). Chromosome 6p gain was detected in 4/18 (22%) IM, and polysomy 8q in 6%. BRAF mutations were not detected in any of the four IM cases examined. One patient with IM died from metastatic disease: this tumour was disomy 3 with 6p and 8q gains. All other patients were alive with no evidence of metastases at study closure.;Chromosomal aberrations seen in posterior UM can also be demonstrated using MLPA or MSA in both treatment naïve and PBR-treated IM.

        "Doc_abstract":"The melanoma cell adhesion molecule was identified as a human melanoma-associated antigen that increases in expression as tumors increase in thickness and begin to acquire metastatic potential. Clinical and experimental evidences suggest that the development of metastatic capacity might be the consequence of increased melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression. The mechanisms for upregulation of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule during melanoma progression are, however, still poorly understood. In this study, we show that melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. Using a combination of CAT reporter assays and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we observed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate significantly increases transcription of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule in nonmetastatic melanoma cells. In metastatic cells, transcription of the gene was constitutive and could not be further increased by cyclic adenosine monophosphate. On the other hand, melanoma cell adhesion molecule promoter activity was impeded upon treatment with phorbol esters or in the presence of stem cell factor, a phenomenon which was protein kinase C-dependent. Promoter-deletion studies demonstrated that the first 196 nt of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule promoter region are sufficient to get full expression in metastatic melanoma cells. This fragment contains five binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 and DNA mobility shift experiments showed direct binding of Sp1 to the promoter. In conclusion, our results indicate that Sp1 is sufficient to drive constitutive melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression in metastatic melanoma cells. In nonmetastatic cells, however, melanoma cell adhesion molecule expression is repressed and we speculate that stem cell factor/c-Kit signaling might be responsible for the control of melanoma cell adhesion molecule synthesis, and thus, perhaps, of melanoma progression and metastasis.",

Glutathione was labelled with 99Tcm by a Sn2+ reduction method with an efficiency of > 99% as determined by instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC). Anti-melanoma antibody was obtained as a kit from SORIN (Italy) and labelled with 99TcmO-4. Forty-three patients with a total of 55 biopsy-proven metastatic melanoma foci, 1 ocular melanoma and 20 benign pathologic foci, also confirmed by ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were included in the study after giving their informed consent. Following the intravenous (i.v.) injection of 500 MBq 99Tcm-AMAb, scintigraphic images of the involved areas were obtained 6 h post-injection. Three days later, the same patients were given 500 MBq 99Tcm-GSH i.v. and images were obtained 6 and 24 h post-injection. The images were classified as positive (focal abnormal accumulation) or negative. Quantitative evaluation was also applied. Regions of interest were drawn over the involved areas and nearby soft tissues and the target-to-nontarget (T/NT) ratios obtained with 99Tcm-AMAb (T/NT: 1.92 +/- 0.2) and 99Tcm-GSH (T/NT: 1.84 +/- 0.2) were compared (0.1 < P < or = 0.3). The sensitivity (and specificity) of 99Tcm-AMAb and 99Tcm-GSH in the detection of malignant melanoma metastases were 91% (95%) and 84% (90%), respectively. Compared with 99Tcm-AMAb, the advantages of 99Tcm-GSH are lower levels of blood radioactivity, lower costs and easy in-house preparation. In conclusion, our results show that 99Tcm-GSH is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for the detection of metastases of malignant melanoma.",

Our aims were to assess the reactivity of PG-M1 with a series of primary cutaneous and metastatic melanomas and to establish the potential usefulness of this antibody in the differentiation between histiocytes and histiocytic tumors and melanomas. PG-M1 staining was performed in 50 primary cutaneous and metastatic melanomas. For comparison, additional sections were stained with KP-1 and lysozyme (commonly used as histiocytic markers) and with S-100 and HMB-45 (commonly used as melanoma markers). The intensity (1+, 2+) and extent (1+ to 4+) were recorded semiquantitatively. PG-M1 stained weakly (1+) and focally (2+) only four cases of melanoma (8%). In contrast, histiocytes were strongly reactive for PG-M1 in all cases, being readily differentiated from melanoma cells including the positive cases. KP-1 stained melanoma cells in 44 cases (88%), lysozyme in 11 cases (22%), S-100 in 50 cases (100%), and HMB-45 in 48 cases (96%). No changes were found after restaining of selected KP-1 and lysozyme positive melanomas using an endogenous avidin/biotin blocking kit.

Signalling pathways known to be disrupted in UM include: (1) the retinoblastoma pathway, probably as a result of cyclin D1 overexpression; p53 signalling, possibly as a consequence of MDM2 overexpression; and the P13K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase pathway pathways that are disturbed as a result of PTEN and GNAQ/11 mutations, respectively. Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities are common and include 6p gain, associated with a good prognosis, as well as 1p loss, 3 loss, and 8q gain, which correlate with high mortality. These are identified by techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation, comparative genomic hybridisation, microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. UM can also be categorised by their gene expression profiles as class 1 or class 2, the latter correlating with poor survival, as do BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) inactivating mutations. Genetic testing of UM has enhanced prognostication, especially when results are integrated with histological and clinical data.

Traditional therapeutics and immunomodulatory agents have not shown much efficacy against metastatic melanoma. Agents that target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway - the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib - have increased survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. Further, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has been shown to be superior to single agent therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, resistance to these agents develops rapidly. Studies of additional agents and combinations targeting the MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K), c-kit, and other signaling pathways are currently underway. Furthermore, studies of phytochemicals have yielded promising results against proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis by targeting signaling pathways with established roles in melanomagenesis. The relatively low toxicities of phytochemicals make their adjuvant use an attractive treatment option. The need for improved efficacy of current melanoma treatments calls for further investigation of each of these strategies. In this review, we will discuss synthetic small molecule inhibitors, combined therapies and current progress in the development of phytochemical therapies. ",

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K with 5'LTR-gag-pro-pol-env-rec/np9-3'LTR sequences represents the newest retrovirus family that integrated into the human genome 1 to 5 million years ago. Although a high-level expression of HERV-K in melanomas, breast cancers, and teratocarcinomas has been demonstrated, the mechanism of the lineage-specific activation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) remains obscure. We studied chromosomal HERV-K expression in MeWo melanoma cells in comparison with the basal expression in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Cloned LTR of HERV-K (HML-2.HOM) was also characterized by mutation and transactivation experiments. We detected multiple transcriptional initiator (Inr) sites in the LTR by rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (5' RACE). HEK293 and MeWo showed different Inr usage. The most potent Inr was associated with a TATA box and three binding motifs of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Both chromosomal HERV-K expression and the cloned LTR function were strongly activated in HEK293 by transfection with MITF-M, a melanocyte/melanoma-specific isoform of MITF. Coexpression of MITF and the HERV-K core antigen was detected in retinal pigmented epithelium by an immunofluorescence analysis. Although malignant melanoma lines MeWo, G361, and SK-MEL-28 showed enhanced HERV-K transcription compared with normal melanocytes, the level of MITF-M messenger RNA persisted from normal to transformed melanocytes. Thus, MITF-M may be a prerequisite for the pigmented cell lineage-specific function of HERV-K LTR, leading to the high-level expression in malignant melanomas.",

Slides were evaluated blind by three independent observers. The percentage of tumour cells staining for HSP-27 was categorized as: 0 (<1%); 1 (1-24%); 2 (25-49%); 3 (50-74%) or 4 (>74%). The staining intensity was categorized as: 0 (no staining); 1 (weak); 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). These two categories were multiplied together to obtain the HSP-27 expression score. All data were processed in spss for statistical analyses.;Heat shock protein 27 score was lower in monosomy 3 melanomas than in disomy 3 tumours (p<0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test).

Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a significantly decreased predicted 8-year survival rate for patients with an HSP-27 Score≤6 (p=0.03; Log rank test). Predicting monosomy 3 was enhanced by considering the HSP-27 score together with basal tumour diameter, melanoma cytomorphology and mitotic rate.;Low HSP-27 expression correlates with monosomy 3 in UM and with increased predicted mortality.

In this study, we explored lentiviral vector-mediated, the entire mTRP-2 gene transfer and expression in dendritic cells (DCs). Adoptive transfer of DCs-expressing mTRP-2 (DC-HR'CmT2) into C57BL/6 mouse was also assessed. Dendritic cells were harvested from bone marrow and functional DCs were proved by allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Lentiviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells. Transduction of DCs was proved by marker gene expression and PCR and RT-PCR amplification. Implantation of the transduced DCs, depletion of immune cells as well as the survival of the mice after tumour challenge were investigated. High efficiency of gene transfer into mature DCs was achieved. The high level expression of the functional antigen (TRP-2) and induction of protective immunity by adoptive transfer of TRP-2 gene modified DCs were demonstrated. In vivo study showed a complete protection of mice from further melanoma cell challenge. In comparison, only 83% of mice survived when mTRP-2 peptide-pulsed DCs were administered, suggesting the generation of specific protection. Together, these results demonstrated the usefulness of this gene transfer to DC approach for immunotherapy of cancer and indicated that using tumour associated antigens (TAAs) for gene transfer may be potentially beneficial for the therapy of melanoma.",

It occurs predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults, manifesting as a deep, painless, slow-growing mass. CCS is sometimes confused with other types of melanoma because of its melanocytic differentiation. Although BRAF and KIT mutations are well-known melanocytic tumour-promoting mutations frequently found in cutaneous melanoma, they are rare or absent in CCS. We present two cases of CCS with different clinical and genetic features. Both female patients, aged 25 and 20 years, presented with a palpable nodule on a lower extremity. Biopsies of both tumours revealed features diagnostic of CCS. Each tumour cell was positive for S100 protein and HMB-45. However, one patient's tumour was localized to the dermis, with many multinucleated giant cells, whereas the other was located in the deep subcutaneous fat layer near bone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of a characteristic Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein (EWSR)1 gene rearrangement in both cases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR product revealed an EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 type 1 fusion transcript in both cases. In addition, we detected BRAF mutation in the dermal type and KIT mutation in the subcutaneous type. It is of interest that the BRAF and KIT mutations are known to be very rare in CCS. On the basis of our observations, we suggest that mutation inhibitors may be useful in selected patients with mutated CCS lineages.",

We have identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor as a repressor of miR-221 and miR-222 by direct binding to their putative regulatory region. Specifically, PLZF silencing in melanomas unblocks miR-221 and miR-222, which in turn controls the progression of the neoplasia through down-modulation of p27Kip1/CDKN1B and c-KIT receptor, leading to enhanced proliferation and differentiation blockade of the melanoma cells, respectively. In vitro and in vivo functional studies, including the use of antisense \"antagomir\" oligonucleotides, confirmed the key role of miR-221/-222 in regulating the progression of human melanoma; this suggests that targeted therapies suppressing miR-221/-222 may prove beneficial in advanced melanoma.",

Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway.

Here, we investigated DNA methylation changes associated with melanoma progression and links between methylation patterns and other types of somatic alterations, including the most frequent mutations and DNA copy number changes. Our results revealed that the methylome, presenting in early stage samples and associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, gradually decreased in the medium and late stages of the disease. An inverse relationship among the other predefined groups and promoter methylation was also revealed except for histologic subtype, whereas the more aggressive, nodular subtype melanomas exhibited hypermethylation as well. The Breslow thickness, which is a continuous variable, allowed for the most precise insight into how promoter methylation decreases from stage to stage. Integrating our methylation results with a high-throughput copy number alteration dataset, local correlations were detected in the MYB and EYA4 genes. With regard to the effects of DNA hypermethylation on melanoma patients' survival, correcting for clinical cofounders, only the KIT gene was associated with a lower overall survival rate. In this study, we demonstrate the strong influence of promoter localized DNA methylation changes on melanoma initiation and show how hypermethylation decreases in melanomas associated with less favourable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we establish the methylation pattern as part of an integrated apparatus of somatic DNA alterations.",

Formation of new blood vessels, named angiogenesis, was proposed to be the main hallmark of the growth of BM. Previous preclinical evidence revealed that angiogenic blockage might be considered for treatment; however, there were varying responses. In this study, we aimed to characterize the expression pattern of angiogenesis-related genes in BM of lung cancer and melanoma, which might be of importance for the different responses against anti-angiogenic treatment. Fifteen snap-frozen tissues obtained from BM of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and melanoma patients were analyzed for angiogenesis-related genes using a commercially available gene expression kit. Epilepsy tissue was used as control. Expression values were analyzed using hierarchical clustering investigating relative fold changes and mapping to Omicsnet protein interaction network. CXCL10, CEACAM1, PECAM1, KIT, COL4A2, COL1A1, and HSPG2 genes were more than 50-fold up-regulated in all diagnosis groups when compared to control, whereas genes such as ANGPT4, PDGFRB, and SERPINF1 were down-regulated only in SCLC and melanoma groups, respectively. Using hierarchical clustering, 12 out of 15 cases were allocated to the correct histological primary tumor type. We identified genes with consistent up-regulation in BM of lung cancer and melanoma and other genes with differential expression across BM of these tumor types. Our data may be of relevance for targeted therapy or prophylaxis of BM using anti-angiogenic agents. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"To determine treatment strategies and predict the clinical outcome of patients with melanoma it is important to understand the etiology of this disease. Recently, there has been some insight into molecular basis of melanoma including identification of a few of the regulatory factors and genes involved in this disease. For instance, the transcription factor AP-2 plays a tumor suppressor-like role in melanoma progression by regulating genes involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Previously, we have shown that the progression of human melanoma to the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of AP-2 expression and deregulation of target genes such as MUC18/MCAM, c-KIT, and MMP-2. Increasing evidence demonstrates that the thrombin receptor (protease-activated receptor-1, PAR-1) plays a major role in tumor invasion and contributes to the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma. This review focuses on the role of the thrombin receptor in melanoma and its regulation by AP-2. We show that loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells correlates with overexpression of the thrombin receptor. Our analysis of AP-2/Sp1 complexes within the regulatory region of the thrombin receptor demonstrates that AP-2 binds the proximal 3' region of the promoter and diminishes PAR-1 expression. Levels of AP-2 and Sp1 proteins in a panel of melanoma cell lines demonstrated a marked decrease in the ratio of AP-2/Sp1, a decrease that correlated with overexpression of PAR-1 in metastatic melanoma cells. We propose that loss of AP-2 results in increased expression of the thrombin receptor, which subsequently contributes to the metastatic phenotype of melanoma by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules, proteases, and angiogenic molecules.",

The effect of miR-26b on cell viability was determined by using MTT assays and colony formation assay. The apoptosis levels were evaluated by using Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit and the apoptosis cells were confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed to confirm direct targeting. Our study found that the expression of miR-26b was downregulated in human melanoma specimens. Overexpression of miR-26b significantly increased the anti-proliferative effects and apoptosis in A375 and B16F10 melanoma cells. In addition, luciferase gene reporter assays confirmed that TRAF5 was a direct target gene of miR-26b and the anti-tumor effect of miR-26b in melanoma cells was significantly counteracted by treatment with TRAF5 overexpression. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressor of miR-26b in malignant melanomas may be due to the dephosphorylation of MAPK pathway caused by the decrease in TRAF5 expression when miR-26b is up-regulated in melanoma cells. These findings indicate that miR-26b might influence TRAF5-MAPK signaling pathways to facilitate the malignant progression of melanoma cells. ",

Evaluation of this revealed the cause to be massive myelopoiesis due to ectopic granulocyte/ colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production by the melanoma cells. Because of these observations linking G-CSF expression with metastasis of human melanoma, we decided to investigate the mechanism of this ectopic production. No gross amplification or rearrangement of the G-CSF gene could be detected as the basis for the increased transcriptional activity in any of these lines. Human-human somatic cell hybridization studies carried out between the metastatic C8161 and several different nonmetastatic non-G-CSF-expressing lines revealed, in addition to metastatic dominance, 3- to 10-fold enhancement of G-CSF transcription and expression in the fusions compared with C8161 itself. The suggestion of a trans-dominant mechanism was further supported by transfection studies with a human G-CSF promoter-CAT-reporter construct, which revealed 3- to 5-fold increased reporter activity in only those melanoma lines and hybrids expressing G-CSF. Furthermore, no obvious autocrine or paracrine effects of this ectopic G-CSF expression on the melanoma lines' growth or metastasis were apparent, as all of the G-CSF-expressing lines lacked the G-CSF receptor and injections of purified recombinant G-CSF exerted no stimulatory effects on their tumorigenicity, latency, growth, or metastasis in Scid mice. Thus, we advance the hypothesis that G-CSF expression is serving as a marker of a more generalized trans-dominant pathway linked to tumor progression and metastasis. This hypothesis has direct relevance to many human cancers where ectopic hormone or growth factor production occurs with no obvious autocrine or paracrine benefit to the tumor.",

The method introduced a fluorophore-tagged peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to serve as both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clamp and sensor probe, which inhibited the amplification of wild-type templates during PCR and revealed multiple types of mutant signals during melting analysis. We demonstrated the design and optimization process of the method, and applied it in the detection of BRAF mutations in 49 melanoma samples.

Although a great deal of progress has been made in the past decade, including the development of immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy using BRAF, MEK or KIT inhibitors, treatment for unresectable stage III, stage IV, and recurrent melanoma is still challenging with limited response rate, severe side effects and poor prognosis, highlighting an urgent need for discovering and designing more effective approaches to conquer melanoma. Melanoma is not only driven by malignant melanocytes, but also by the altered communication between neoplastic cells and non-malignant cell populations, including fibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells, in the tumor stroma. Infiltrated and surrounding fibroblasts, also known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), exhibit both phenotypical and physiological differences compared to normal dermal fibroblasts. They acquire properties of myofibroblasts, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and architecture of the diseased tissue and secrete chemical factors, which all together promote the transformation process by encouraging tumor growth, angiogenesis, inflammation and metastasis and contribute to drug resistance. A number of in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that stromal fibroblasts promote melanoma cell proliferation and they have been targeted to suppress tumor growth effectively. Evidently, a combination therapy co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts may provide promising strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes and overcome treatment resistance. A significant benefit of targeting CAFs is that the approach aims to create a tumor-resistant environment that inhibits growth of melanomas carrying different genetic mutations. However, the origin of CAFs and precise mechanisms by which CAFs contribute to melanoma progression and drug resistance remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the origin, activation and heterogeneity of CAFs in the melanoma tumor microenvironment and examine the contributions of stromal fibroblasts at different stages of melanoma development. We also highlight the recent progression in dissecting and characterizing how local fibroblasts become reprogrammed and build a dynamic yet optimal microenvironment for tumors to develop and metastasize. In addition, we review key developments in ongoing preclinical studies and clinical applications targeting CAFs and tumor-stroma interactions for melanoma treatment. ",

This enigma is most evident in partially regressing melanomas, where efficient eradication of tumor cells is closely linked to uncontrolled tumor growth. Mechanisms involved in this differential susceptibility of tumor cells to the host immune response may include altered production of immunosuppressive cytokines, i.e., transforming growth factor (TGF) beta or interleukin (IL) 10. Since only limited amounts of tissue samples are available from primary tumors, a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was established which allowed to estimate the amount of cytokine mRNA expressed in a small number of melanoma cells segregated by indirect immunomagnetic isolation. Thereby, we determined the expression of TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 mRNA in melanoma cells obtained from regressing and progressing areas of 9 primary tumors. TGF-beta 1 mRNA could be detected in all undiluted samples from progressing areas and in 7 samples from regression zones. Titration of the sample revealed that in 6 cases TGF-beta 1 mRNA could be detected at a significant higher titer in progressing than in regressing areas. IL-10 mRNA was present in 8 samples obtained from progressing and in 7 samples from regressing tumor areas. In 6 tumors IL-10 mRNA was detectable at a higher titer in the progression zones. Specificity of the PCR amplification was confirmed with a series of restriction enzyme digestions of the resulting PCR product. Based on these findings the hypothesis that immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-beta 1 or IL-10, represent important factors for the melanoma cells to escape immune surveillance is supported.",

For most primary tumors that commonly metastasize to the CNS, molecular biomarker analyses are recommended in the clinical setting for selection of appropriate targeted therapies. Therapeutic efficacy of some of these agents has been documented in patients with brain metastases, and molecular testing of CNS metastases should be considered in the clinical setting. Here, we summarize the clinically relevant biomarker tests that should be considered in neurosurgical specimens based on the current recommendations of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the most relevant primary tumor types: lung cancer (EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement, BRAF mutations), breast cancer (HER2 amplification, steroid receptor overexpression), melanoma (BRAF mutations), and colorectal cancer (RAS mutations). Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic targets including novel oncogenic alterations (ROS1 rearrangements, FGFR1 amplifications, CMET amplifications, and others) and molecular features of the tumor microenvironment (including immune-checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1). We also discuss the potential role of advanced biomarker tests such as next-generation sequencing and \"liquid biopsies\" for patients with CNS metastases. ",

To facilitate the detection and sequencing of minority mutations from clinical specimens, we developed wild-type blocking polymerase chain reaction (WTB-PCR). This technique allows sensitive detection of minority mutations in a tissue sample containing excess wild-type DNA. In WTB-PCR, a nonextendable locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotide binds tightly to a region of wild-type DNA known to develop point mutations. This LNA sequence blocks amplification of wild-type DNA during PCR while permitting amplification of mutant exon 15. Our results show that the LNA blocking oligonucleotide inhibits amplification of wild-type DNA in a dose-dependent manner. WTB-PCR was able to detect mutant DNA in clinical samples of melanoma tissue containing an excess of nonmelanoma cells. This method was also able to detect small amounts of point mutated or tandem mutated DNA diluted with a much larger concentration of wild-type DNA. This rapid and simple assay overcomes the limitations of current methods to detect minority mutations. The potential applications of WTB-PCR include early diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers.",

Although this notion has been rigidly proven for infectious diseases, direct evidence for lymph node priming of in vivo T-cell responses against tumors is still lacking. In the present study, we conducted a full and nonbiased comparison of T-cell clonotypes in melanoma lesions and corresponding sentinel lymph nodes. Whereas most tumor lesions comprised a high number of T-cell clonotypes, only a small number of clonally expanded T cells were detected in the draining lymph nodes. Comparative clonotype mapping demonstrated the presence of identical T-cell clonotypes in the tumors and the respective sentinel lymph nodes, only when tumor cells were present in the latter. However, taking advantage of clonotype specific PCR amplification, TCR sequences representing clonally expanded T cells at the tumor site could be detected in the lymph nodes draining the tumors even in the absence of tumor cells. Evidence for the tumor-specific characteristics of these cells was obtained by in situ staining with peptide/HLA class I complexes demonstrating the presence of MART-1/HLA-A2- and MAGE-3/HLA-A2-reactive T cells at the tumor site, as well as in the draining lymph node.

        "Doc_abstract":"Anorectal malignant melanomas (AMMs) are aggressive neoplasms, which account for less than 1% of all anorectal tumors. Anorectal malignant melanomas are notorious for their diversity of histologic features and mimic a number of other tumors. Aberrant expression of immunohistochemical stains such as cytokeratins and CD117 (c-kit) further increases the risk of misdiagnosis. Aim of our study was to describe the common as well as unusual architectural and cytologic features that create difficulty in diagnosis. We also discussed the role of immunohistochemical stains in diagnosis of AMMs. We retrieved and reviewed 61 cases of anal melanoma diagnosed in our institution between January 2005 and May 2014. Epithelioid cell type was observed in 57 (93.4%) cases, spindle cells in 35 (57.4%) cases, pleomorphic in 12 (19.7%) cases, and lymphoma-like in 2 (3.3%) cases. Cytoplasmic clearing was observed in 16.4% and nuclear pseudoinclusions in 9.8% cases. Twenty-one point three percent cases were completely amelanotic, and 36.1% showed focal melanin pigment. Average mitotic count was 2 mitoses/high-power fields. Nesting pattern was seen in 24.6%, pseudoalveolar pattern in 11.5%, and peritheliomatous/pseudopapillary pattern in 5% cases. Positive expression of vimentin, S-100, HMB-45, and Melan A was seen in 100%, 100%, 94.4%, and 93.3% cases, respectively. Cytokeratins were positive in 9% and CD117 (c-kit) in 20% of cases in which they were performed. In conclusion, AMMs should be considered in the differential of any malignant tumor of anorectal region without obvious glandular and squamoid differentiation. The knowledge of amelanotic nature, unusual histologic features, and aberrant immunohistochemical expression is helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis. ",

Diverse whole-genome amplification methods are applied to provide sufficient amount of DNA for comparative genome hybridization, single-nucleotide polymorphism, and microsatellite analyses. In these applications, the reliability of the amplification techniques is particularly important. In PCR-based approaches, the plateau effect can seriously alter the original relative copy number of certain chromosomal regions. To eliminate this distorting effect, we improved the standard degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) technique by following the amplification status with quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). With real-time detection of the products, we could eliminate DNA overamplification. Probes were prepared from 10 different tumor samples: primary and metastatic melanoma tissues, epidermoid and bronchioloalveolar lung carcinomas, 2 renal cell carcinomas, 2 colorectal carcinomas, and a Conn and Cushing adenoma. Probes were generated by using nonamplified and amplified genomic DNA with DOP-PCR and DOP-PCR combined with QRT-PCR. To demonstrate the reliability of the QRT-PCR based amplification protocol, altogether 152 relative copy number changes of 44 regions were determined. There was 85.6% concordance in copy number alterations between the QRT-PCR protocol and the nonamplified samples, whereas this value was only 63.8% for the traditional DOP-PCR. Our results demonstrate that our protocol preserves the original copy number of different chromosomal regions in amplified genomic DNA than standard DOP-PCR techniques more accurately.",

There was no relationship between BRAF/NRAS mutations and gene dosage at 9p21.3. Reduced gene dosage at MTAP showed a borderline association with BRAF mutation (P = 0.04) and reduced gene dosage at the interferon gene cluster was borderline associated with wild type NRAS (P = 0.05). Reduced gene dosage in the CDKN2A regions coding for CDKN2A was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P = 0.03). Reduced gene dosage across 9p21.3 was associated with increased tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration (P = 0.02, 0.02, and 0.002, respectively), specifically in coding regions impacting on CDKN2B and P14ARF and CDKN2A. Loss at MTAP (P = 0.05) and the interferon gene cluster (P = 0.03) on 9p21 was also associated with tumor ulceration.

It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen).

In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain metastases are the most common cause of death in patients with metastatic melanoma, and the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways are key players in melanoma progression and drug resistance. The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib significantly improved overall survival. However, brain metastases still limit the effectiveness of this therapy. In a series of patients, we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases, but brain metastases developed. This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to treatment resistance in brain metastases. Matched brain and extracerebral metastases from melanoma patients had identical ERK, p-ERK, and AKT immunohistochemistry staining patterns, but there was hyperactivation of AKT (p-AKT) and loss of PTEN expression in the brain metastases. Mutation analysis revealed no differences in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutation status in matched brain and extracerebral metastases. In contrast, AKT, p-AKT, and PTEN expression was identical in monolayer cultures derived from melanoma brain and extracerebral metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells stimulated by astrocyte-conditioned medium showed higher AKT activation and invasiveness than melanoma cells stimulated by fibroblast-conditioned medium. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling resensitized melanoma cells isolated from a vemurafenib-resistant brain metastasis to vemurafenib. Brain-derived factors appear to induce hyperactivation of the AKT survival pathway and to promote the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells in the brain. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling shows potential for enhancing and/or prolonging the antitumor effect of BRAF inhibitors or other anticancer agents in melanoma brain metastases.",

Although evidences exist regarding its impact on tumorigenesis, the role of genetic alterations and the expressions of locus-related genes are still controversial. Our study aimed to define the 7q31 copy number alterations in primary melanomas, primary-metastatic tumor pairs and cell lines. Data were correlated with clinical-pathological parameters. Genetic data show that 7q31 copy number distribution was heterogeneous in both primary and metastatic tumors. Extra copies were highly accompanied by chromosome 7 polisomy, and significantly increased in primary lesions with poor prognosis. Additionally, we determined the mRNA and protein levels of the locus-related CAV1 and TES genes. TES mRNA level was associated with metastatic location. CAV1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in thicker tumors, however, lack of protein was also observed in a subpopulation of thin lesions. Expressions of CAV1 and TES were not associated with 7q31 alterations. In conclusion, 7q31 amplification can predict unfavorable outcome. Alterations of TES mRNA level may predict the location of metastasis. CAV1 possibly affect the cancer cell invasion.",

Alternatively, some molecules such as TRAF-2, c-Myc, endothelins, and integrins may have either pro- or anti-apoptotic effects. Some of these molecules are of potential therapeutic use, such as: (1) p53, which influences resistance to chemotherapy; (2) Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), which can override apoptosis; (3) TRAIL, which has selective fatal effects on tumour cells; (4) NF-(K)B, which when downregulated sensitizes cells to TRAIL and TNF; (5) the PITSLRE kinases, whose alteration appears to result in Fas resistance; (6) interferons, which sensitize cells to other factors; and (7) survivin and other IAPs that inhibit apoptosis.

Twenty-eight lesions were conjunctival nevi, of which 20 were excised from children younger than 18 years. Fifteen lesions were conjunctival primary acquired melanosis (PAM; 11 without atypia and 4 with atypia) and five were conjunctival melanomas. To detect the BRAF T1799A mutation, both a newly developed kit (Mutector; TrimGen, Sparks, MD) and direct DNA sequence analysis of exon 15 after PCR amplification were used.;The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in 14 of 28 (50%) conjunctival nevi analyzed, but in none of the 15 conjunctival PAMs, with and without atypia.

Advantages and limitations of diverse, already established methods, such as (fluorescence) in situ hybridization and mutation analysis, to detect these cytogenetic alterations in melanocytic tumours are described. In addition, the potential value of more novel techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is pointed out. This review demonstrates that at present cytogenetics has mainly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumours, with an important role for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in the initiation of melanocytic tumours. Mutations in BRAF (in common naevocellular naevi), NRAS (congenital naevi), HRAS (Spitz naevi) and GNAQ (blue naevi) can all cause MAPK activation. All these mutations seem early events in the development of melanocytic tumours, but by themselves are insufficient to cause progression towards melanoma. Additional molecular alterations are implicated in progression towards melanoma, with different genetic alterations in melanomas at different sites and with varying levels of sun exposure. This genetic heterogeneity in distinct types of naevi and melanomas can be used for the development of molecular tests for diagnostic purposes. However, at the moment only few molecular tests have become of diagnostic value and are performed in daily routine practice. This is caused by lack of large prospective studies on the diagnostic value of molecular tests including follow-up, and by the low prevalence of certain molecular alterations. For the future we foresee an increasing role for cytogenetics in the treatment of melanoma patients with the increasing availability of targeted therapy. Potential targets for metastatic melanoma include genes involved in the MAPK pathway, such as BRAF and RAS. More recently, KIT has emerged as a potential target in melanoma patients. These targeted treatments all need careful evaluation, but might be a promising adjunct for treatment of metastatic melanoma patients, in which other therapies have not brought important survival advantages yet.",

In contrast to most human melanomas with an early onset of metastasis, the Grey horse melanomas have an extended period of benign growth, after which 50% or more eventually undergo progression and may metastasize. In efforts to define changes occurring during Grey horse melanoma progression, we established an in vitro model comprised of two cell lines, HoMel-L1 and HoMel-A1, representing a primary and a metastatic stage of the melanoma, respectively. The cell lines were examined for their growth and morphological characteristics, in vitro and in vivo oncogenic potential, chromosome numbers, and expression of melanocytic antigens and tumor suppressors. Both cell lines exhibited malignant characteristics; however, the metastatic HoMel-A1 showed a more aggressive phenotype characterized by higher proliferation rates, invasiveness, and a stronger tumorigenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. HoMel-A1 displayed a near-haploid karyotype, whereas HoMel-L1 was near-diploid. The cell lines expressed melanocytic lineage markers such as TYR, TRP1, MITF, PMEL, ASIP, MC1R, POMC, and KIT. The tumor suppressor p53 was strongly expressed in both cell lines, while the tumor suppressors p16 and PTEN were absent in HoMel-A1, potentially implicating significance of these pathways in the melanoma progression. This in vitro model system will not only aid in understanding of the Grey horse melanoma pathogenesis, but also in unraveling the steps during melanoma progression in general as well as being an invaluable tool for development of new therapeutic strategies.

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years, large discrepancies were described in the success rate of the tyrosinase reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting melanoma cells in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients. We present a quality control study in which we analysed the reproducibility of detection of tyrosinase and MART-1 transcripts in 106 blood samples from 68 melanoma patients (mainly stages III and IV). With this study, we aimed to improve insight in the reproducibility of a RT-PCR for the detection of (minimal) amounts of circulating melanoma cells. We performed two reverse transcriptions on each mRNA sample and performed tyrosinase and MART-1 nested PCRs in duplicate per cDNA sample. Thus, four tyrosinase and four MART-1 measurements were performed per blood sample. In our study, the majority of blood samples was negative for tyrosinase (80%) or MART-1 (66%). Only four samples were positive in all four determinations for tyrosinase and seven for MART-1. Variable results (1-3 times positive results) were obtained for tyrosinase and MART-1 in 16% and 27% respectively. MART-1 PCR had a better performance than tyrosinase PCR. Sensitivity increased when both markers were used. We reasoned that the low number of melanoma marker PCR-positive blood samples can be explained by differences in mRNA quality. By using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that this was not the case: amplification of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), a low copy household gene, was not different in blood samples in which a melanoma marker was not detected from groups in which this marker was detected more or less consistently (1-4 times). When applying real-time quantitative PCR for tyrosinase and MART-1, we found that a low amount of SK-MEL-28 cell equivalents was present in the blood of melanoma patients, with a higher number of equivalents in the group with a consistently positive result. We conclude that low reproducibility of a repeated assay for the detection of circulating melanoma cells is not caused by differences in mRNA quality between the samples, but due to low numbers of amplifiable target mRNA molecules in the mRNA sample. Use of more than one marker and repetition of the assay will increase the probability of finding positive PCR results.",

Meanwhile, evidence has been provided that combinations between BRAF inhibitors and MEK1/2 inhibitors are more promising than single-agent treatments. Moreover, new treatment algorithms favor sequential treatment using BRAF inhibitors and newly developed immunotherapies targeting common T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In depth molecular analyses have uncovered new mechanisms of treatment resistance and recurrence, which may impact on future treatment decisions. Moreover, next-generation sequencing data have shown that recurrent lesions harbor specific genetic aberrations.

More recent bioinformatic technologies provided genetic evidence for extensive tumor heterogeneity and tumor clonality of solid tumors, which might also be of relevance for melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Carbohydrate tumor-antigens are important tumor markers for diagnosis and functional characteristics of human cancer cells. Detection of these carbohydrate tumor antigens on metastatic cancer cells in blood is a difficult task. We developed a highly sensitive method to detect a cell surface carbohydrate antigen using a hybrid technology referred to as cellular immuno-PCR. This technique uses the human monoclonal antibody (HumAb) L612, specific to a tumor-related antigen (ganglioside) GM3 that is expressed on the cell surface of human tumor cells and not normal cells. L612 coupled to a DNA oligonucleotide for exponential amplification by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to enhance the detection signal. The DNA-HumAb conjugate was assessed for detection of a small number of human cancer cells after PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis. To assess the assay specificity human melanoma and other cancer cell lines, as well as healthy donor and melanoma patients, bloods were assessed. Cellular immuno-PCR requires < 1 ng/ml DNA-HumAb complex and was shown to have a detection level of < 10 cells in titration studies in which melanoma cells were diluted in 2 million healthy donor peripheral blood lymphocytes. The assay was shown to be very sensitive and could detect low levels of GM3 antigen expression by tumor cells. This novel approach for detecting a carbohydrate tumor antigen on tumor cells in blood provides a potential useful clinicopathological assay.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase (RGP) to vertical growth phase (VGP) and the metastatic phenotype are not very well defined. However, some of the genes involved in this process and their transcriptional regulation are beginning to be elucidated. For example, the switch from RGP to VGP and the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of the AP-2α transcription factor. AP-2α regulates the expression of c-KIT, MMP-2, VEGF, and the adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18. Recently, we reported that AP-2α also regulates two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) PAR-1 and PAFR. In turn, the thrombin receptor, PAR-1, regulates the expression of the gap junction protein Connexin-43 and the tumor suppressor gene Maspin. Activation of PAR-1 also leads to overexpression and secretion of proangiogenic factors such as IL-8, uPA, VEGF, PDGF, as well certain integrins. PAR-1 also cooperates with PAFR to regulate the expression of the MCAM/MUC18 via phosphorylation of CREB. The ligands for these GPCRs, thrombin and PAF, are secreted by stromal cells, emphasizing the importance of the tumor microenvironment in melanoma metastasis. The metastatic phenotype of melanoma is also associated with overexpression and function of CREB/ATF-1. Loss of AP-2α and overexpression of CREB/ATF-1 results in the overexpression of MCAM/MUC18 which by itself contributes to melanoma metastasis by regulating the inhibitor of DNA binding-1 (Id-1). CREB/ATF-1 also regulates the angiogenic factor CYR-61. Our recent data indicate that CREB/ATF-1 regulates the expression of AP-2α, thus, supporting the notion that CREB is an important \"master switch\" in melanoma progression.",

Familial UM (FUM), defined as two or more family members diagnosed with UM, is rare and estimated at less than 1% of all UM. Currently, BAP1 is the only gene known to contribute significant risk for UM. In this study we aimed to estimate the frequency of BAP1 mutation in FUM and to characterize the family and personal histories of other cancers in these families. We identified 32 families with FUM, including seven families previously reported by our group. BAP1 mutation testing was carried out by direct sequencing of the coding exons and the adjacent untranslated regions of the gene. Germline deletion and duplication analysis of BAP1 was assessed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Germline BAP1 mutations were found in 6/32 (19%) families. No deletions or duplications were identified in any of the 24 samples tested by MLPA. Combined with published studies, the frequency of BAP1 mutations was 14/64 (22%) in FUM. FUM families without BAP1 mutations have distinct family histories with high rates of prostate cancer in first- and second-degree relatives. It is likely that additional genes conferring risk for FUM exist. It is important to understand key shared features of FUM to focus future research on identifying these additional tumor predisposition syndromes. Though BAP1 should be tested first in these families, FUM families without BAP1 mutation should be explored for additional predisposition genes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

PDGFRA mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with KIT mutations, but may coexist with BRAF and NRAS mutations. The genetic mutations of PDGFRA were unrelated to the age, thickness, and ulceration status of primary melanomas. Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA. Crenolanib showed higher potency than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of PDGFRA. Except that V658A mutation was imatinib-resistant, all the other mutations were sensitive to both imatinib and crenolanib.;PDGFRA mutations are detected in a small population of melanoma patients.

We included 148 adult patients with melanoma. The median follow-up was 40 months.

Concentrations of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and YKL-40 were measured by ELISA kits. VEGF, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and YKL-40 were significantly higher in group of patients than in controls. Increased concentrations of TIMP-1 were related to patient survival, which in the group of lower and increased TIMP-1, disease-free survival amounted to 81 vs. 61% (p = 0.014) and overall survival -88 vs. 82% (p = 0.050), respectively. An increased concentration of YKL-40 was observed in 59% of patients with ulceration and in 26% of patients without ulceration (p = 0.012). We have found a clinically significant correlation between YKL-40 and MMP-9 (rho = 0.363; p = 0.004) as well as YKL-40 and VEGF (rho = 0.306; p = 0.018).

The implication of hormonal interplay is strong since metastatic MM to the breast is seen nearly always in women. However, the role of hormonal status as a predisposing factor in the development of this entity is largely unresolved. A number of chromosomal loci, including 1p36 and 9p21-22, appear to harbor critical genes important to melanoma tumorigenesis, and additionally chromosome 9q22.3-31. We wanted to know if metastatic MM in breast showed chromosome 1p and 9p genetic alterations (loss of heterozygosity) similar to those that occur in primary cutaneous MM, and whether additional 9q LOH changes are present. Hormonal receptor status of the metastatic MM was also determined. We identified 20 patients with known MM metastatic to the breast, which we analyzed with the following genetic markers: D9S12 (9q22.3), D9S171 (9p21), IFNA (9p22), and D1S450 (1p). Visually directed microdissection was performed on archival histologic slides containing both tumor and adjacent normal breast epithelium, followed by single-step DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for evaluation of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the above-listed markers. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was performed on 10 of the cases. Twelve of the 20 cases contained DNA suitable for PCR amplification following direct visualization microdissection. Four of 8 (50%) informative cases showed LOH at 9p21 with D9S171. Ten cases were heterozygous for IFNA, with 2 cases (20%) showing LOH at this locus. These particular cases also showed LOH at 9p21. One of 9 (11%) informative cases showed LOH for D1S450 (1p36). Five cases were heterozygous for D9S12, and 2 (40%) showed LOH in the tumor at 9q22.3. IHC stains for ER and PR were negative in the 10 tumors studied. Metastatic MM presenting as a breast mass is an interesting entity often requiring IHC studies for diagnosis, particularly when the histologic features simulate breast carcinoma or when no primary tumor is known. These tumors are ER and PR negative. Metastatic MM involving the breast shows similar genetic allelic losses on chromosome 9p21-22 (50%) and 1p36 (11%), as previously described in primary cutaneous MM. Additional LOH was observed at the 9q22.3-31 locus (40%). We suggest this locus to be investigated for harboring potential genes important in the tumorigenesis of cutaneous MM.",

The malfunction of KIT gene results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-KIT which is believed to be the major oncogenic event in stomach, small intestine mastocytosis, acute leukemias, melanomas and colon tumors. The genetics of these diseases could be better understood by knowing the functional relevance of their SNP variation. In this study, a computational analysis to detect the most deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of KIT gene was performed and investigated its binding affinity to native and predicted mutant protein structure (D816V) with sunitinib and HDAC (Trichostatin A and Panobinostat) inhibitors was investigated. Out of 1,288 SNPs retrieved from dbSNP database against KIT gene, 11 non-synonymous SNPs were detected to be damaging and deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen and I-Mutant2.0 servers. Further, we modeled the mutant protein based on the deleterious nsSNP (rs121913507) and showed that the mutation from Aspartic acid to Valine at 816 position exhibit greatest impact on stability. The RMSD values of mutant and native structures are found to be 0.40 and 1.9 A, respectively. Furthermore, the binding affinity of sunitinib and HDAC inhibitors were compared with native and mutant protein. In this regard, it was found that trichostatin A has a high binding efficacy towards the mutant protein with a binding energy of -35.274 kcal mol(-1), as compared to the native structure which has a binding energy of -25.996 kcal mol(-1). Also, the FastSNP tool suggested that 3 SNPs found to affect protein splicing site and splicing regulation. From present results, it was clear that the non-synonymous SNP rs121913507 (D816V) could be the most deleterious SNP for KIT gene and HDAC inhibitors can serve as a best drug for the mutant protein.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is promising             for cancer treatment owing to its selective cytotoxicity against malignant cells.             However, some cancer cell types, including malignant melanoma cells, are resistant             to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, drugs that can amplify TRAIL cytotoxicity             are urgently required. Depolarization of the plasma membrane potential is associated             with apoptosis induced by a variety of death-inducing agents but its role in apoptosis             remains a matter of debate. We found that TRAIL treatment resulted in robust depolarization             in human melanoma cells with a considerable lag (2-4 h). Moreover, membrane-depolarizing             agents, including K+ and ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitors glibenclamide             and U37883A enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. On the contrary, inhibitors of calcium-             and voltage-dependent K+ channels and mitochondrial KATP channels had no such             effects. Melanocytes were insensitive to TRAIL-induced depolarization and apoptosis             as well as to the sensitization by membrane-depolarizing agents despite their             substantial surface expression of death receptors. TRAIL induced robust activation             of X-box-binding protein-1 and caspase-12, both of which were enhanced by the             K+ and KATP channel inhibitors, but not by other K+ channel inhibitors.

Two HLA class I+ melanoma cell lines, one (TOM) A2+ and the other (CLB-M) A2-, obtained from living patients were transduced with the IL-2 gene. The patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were incubated with irradiated IL-2 gene-transduced autologous tumor cells for up to four weeks. After seven days, PBL from both patients showed non-specific cytotoxic activity against the K562 cell line. When the co-culture incubation time was prolonged to 28 days, PBL from patient TOM (A2+) developed a lytic activity directed specifically against the autologous tumor cells. In contrast, after 28 days of incubation, PBL from CLB-M (A2-) displayed only non-specific cytotoxic activity. Inhibition experiments demonstrated that the specific lytic function observed with TOM cells transduced with the IL-2 gene could be reversed following incubation with monoclonal antibodies directed against HLA class I and CD8. The evidence that K562 cells were incapable of blocking the PBL killing capacity in a cold-target inhibition assay further confirmed that engineered TOM cells induced the generation of specific CTL. This study indicates that retroviral vector mediated transfer of the IL-2 gene into human melanoma cell lines can lead to the amplification of the autologous cytotoxic compartment and to the generation of specific antitumor CTL, and that the A2 allele may play an important role in the process of tumor recognition.",

We have previously shown that enforced expression of MCAM/MUC18 in primary cutaneous melanoma led to increased tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice. The mechanism for up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 during melanoma progression is unknown. Here we show that up-regulation of MCAM/MUC18 expression in highly metastatic cells correlates with loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2. The MCAM/MUC18 promoter contains four binding sites for AP-2, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay gels demonstrated that the AP-2 protein bound directly to the MCAM/MUC18 promoter. Transfection of AP-2 into highly metastatic A375SM melanoma cells (AP-2-negative and MCAM/MUC18-positive) inhibited MCAM/MUC18 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in AP-2-transfected but not in control cells. In addition, re-expression of AP-2 in A375SM cells inhibited their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice. These results indicate that the expression of MCAM/MUC18 is regulated by AP-2 and that enforced AP-2 expression suppresses tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of human melanoma cells, possibly by down-regulating MCAM/MUC18 gene expression. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as c-KIT, E-cadherin, MMP-2, and p21(WAF-1), we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.",

His grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer and his mother had been operated for rectal cancer. Physical examination revealed a hard mass at the 12 o'clock position, 2 cm from the anal verge. A colonoscopic examination revealed an irregular surface mass, approximately 4.0 cm in size, located on the anterior wall of the lower rectum. A biopsy of the rectal tumor showed the proliferation of epithelioid cells with pleomorphic features. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed. S-100 protein, CD-56, and KIT expression were positive, but HMB-45 expression was negative. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple liver and lymph node metastases. With the diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the rectum, abdominoperineal resection was performed. After the operation, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level had rapidly increased. An abdominal CT showed progressive liver metastases. Thirteen days after the surgery, abdominal angiography was performed, which showed multiple hypervascular tumor stains in the liver. The reservoir was implanted transcutaneously with the aid of angiography and the catheter was fixed to the proper hepatic artery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy using cisplatin and irinotecan via the subcutaneous reservoir port was performed and a partial response was obtained. However, the final pathological diagnosis of the surgically resected specimen was malignant amelanotic melanoma of the rectum. Immunohistochemical expression differed between rectal biopsy specimens and surgically resected specimens. HMB-45 expression was positive and KIT expression was negative in the resected specimen. As preoperative pathological diagnosis showed rare rectal tumor, we measured the chemosensitivity of the rectal tumor using the collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) to determine the most appropriate chemotherapy regimen for the patient. However, there were no anticancer drugs tested by CD-DST for malignant melanoma. With informed consent, the patient received two cycles of immunochemotherapy consisting of dacabazine, nimustine hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and interferon -beta. Although the patient was treated with immunochemotherapy for metastatic liver tumor, he died because of progression of metastases.",

A new feature, however, is the establishment of molecular classification of melanoma indicating that beside the most frequent genetic alterations (BRAF, NRAS, CKIT mutations) there is a wide variety of rare molecular subclasses. Unfortunately, none of these genetic alterations can be used to discriminate benign lesions from malignant ones. The frequently used \"melanoma\" markers are mostly melanosomal markers, therefore they are not helpful for this diagnostic purpose either. More recently, novel FISH kits have been developed analyzing characteristic copy number alterations specific for malignant melanoma. Though melanosomal markers are helpful in differencial diagnostics, the presence of normal melanocytes in various tissues (lymph nodes, intestine or brain) requires application of molecular techniques when melanoma metastasis is in question. ;A malignus melanóma patológiai klasszifikációja az utóbbi években csak az UV-besugárzással kapcsolatos jelenségek tekintetében változott.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer of pigment-producing cells, derivates of the neural crest. Surgical resection is the most effective form of treatment during initial phases of the disease. Advanced stages are usually treated by adjuvant immunotherapy (interferon alpha) or dacarbazine + multiferon. Response and survival rates are extremely poor. The emerging approach of personalized medicine brings about significant advances in the treatment of melanoma. Apart from administration of imatinib for a small subgroup of melanomas harbouring KIT mutations, the most promising approach is the use of B-RAF kinase inhibitors. The previously tested RAF inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib) did not perform better compared to conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. However, the results are much more promising with the recently developed inhibitor PLX4032 (Plexxikon; RG7204, Roche Pharmaceuticals; vemurafenib). This inhibitor targets tumours harbouring B-RAF(V600E) of B-RAF(V600K) activating mutations, which are present in 40-70% of malignant melanomas. An absence of the above mentioned activating mutations or parallel presence of activating RAS mutations (e.g. RAS(G12D)) should be used as contraindications. The use of PLX4032 provides better outcome than any of the currently used therapies, including partial or complete response recorded in 81% of patients, and prolonged median survival. Currently, this drug is being tested in phase II and III trials. The incidence of PLX4032-related adverse effects is relatively high; acquired resistance repeatedly occurring within several months of treatment may also represent a significant problem. Combined therapy is probably needed to further increase the complete response rate and to prolong survival. This should either include some of the currently used chemotherapeutics, or alternatively it may employ inhibitors of some of the kinases capable of stimulating the MEK and ERK kinases independently of B-RAF (e.g. COT). Nevertheless, even PLX4032 monotherapy should be viewed as a significant improvement of the current state-of-the-art treatment of malignant melanoma.",

To gain further insight into their genetics and DNA repair efficiency, we systematically investigated the status of eight genes whose products are critically involved in the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and GNAQ/11 pathways, including BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, c-KIT, PI3K, GNAQ, and GNA11, in a series of 16 primary gynecological melanomas, covering all anatomical locations, ranging from stages I to III. Analysis either by real-time PCR coupled with fluorescence melting curve analysis or by PCR followed by direct sequencing, along with studies for DNA mismatch repair status using immunohistochemistry, disclosed that 15 out of the 16 cases displayed wild-type genotypes, with a single case of vulvar primary melanoma, harboring the activating mutation BRAF(V600E). Investigations on whether this could reflect partly an efficient mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism were confirmed by normal expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2, suggesting that the lack of mutations could be explained by the operation of alternative pathogenetic mechanisms modulating downstream effectors of the signaling pathways.

ERK1/2 levels were determined using an ELISA kit. Adenosine and inosine levels were quantified using an enzyme-coupled assay. Adenosine caused cell proliferation through AR activation. Adenosine deaminase increased inosine levels (nanomolar concentrations) on the extracellular space, in a time-dependent manner, inducing proliferation through A3 AR activation. Micromolar concentrations of inosine enhanced proliferation through A3 AR activation, causing an increase in ERK1/2 levels, and P2Y1 R activation via ENT-dependent mechanisms.

DNA was extracted from plasma and mutant DNA was detected using the amplification-refractory mutation system method. Before the beginning of any treatment, the corresponding BRAF mutation was detected in 29 of the 38 tested plasma samples (76.3% positive per cent agreement). We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity.

This study was to explore the distribution pattern, kinetic delivery of adenovirus, and therapeutic efficacy of the MSC loading of E1A mutant conditionally replicative adenovirus Adv-Stat3(-) which selectively replicated and expressed high levels of anti-sense Stat3 complementary DNA in breast cancer and melanoma cells.;We assessed the release ability of conditionally replicative adenovirus (CRAd) from MSC using crystal violet staining, TCID(50) assay, and quantitative PCR. In vitro killing competence of MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) toward breast cancer and melanoma was performed using co-culture system of transwell plates. We examined tumor tropism of MSC by Prussian blue staining and immunofluorescence. In vivo killing competence of MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) toward breast tumor was analyzed by comparison of tumor volumes and survival periods.;Adv-Stat3(-) amplified in MSCs and were released 4 days after infection. MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) caused viral amplification, depletion of Stat3 and its downstream proteins, and led to significant apoptosis in breast cancer and melanoma cell lines. In vivo experiments confirmed the preferential localization of MSCs in the tumor periphery 24 hours after tail vein injection, and this localization was mainly detected in the tumor parenchyma after 72 hours. Intravenous injection of MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) suppressed the Stat3 pathway, down-regulated Ki67 expression, and recruited CD11b-positive cells in the local tumor, inhibiting tumor growth and increasing the survival of tumor-bearing mice.;These results indicate that MSCs migrate to the tumor site in a time-dependent manner and could be an effective platform for the targeted delivery of CRAd and the amplification of tumor killing effects.",

Among the top 147 most-expressed tags in glioblastoma, we found a tag, TTTTGGGTAT, that originated from an unidentified gene and which was not detected in human astrocyte cultures. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that MAGE-E1 expression was 2.6-15-fold enriched in glioblastoma relative to human astrocytes. Expressed sequence tags containing this tag were homologous to the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) family, and this new cDNA, named MAGE-E1, was cloned by the 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. Three alternatively spliced variants (MAGE-E1a-c) were found, and deduced amino acid sequence showed that MAGE-E1a and -E1b shared the MAGE-conserved region, whereas -E1c did not. This suggests that although MAGE-E1c is expressed from one of the MAGE family, it has distinct functions from other members. Tissue distribution analysis showed that MAGE-E1 was distinct from other MAGEs. MAGE-E1 expression was detected only in brain and ovary among normal tissues.

Nine Th1/Th2 related cytokines and sIL-2R were determined in 26 malignant melanoma patients at clinical stage III prior and during adjuvant immunotherapy. Control group consisted of 26 healthy persons. Patients were treated with rIFN-alpha according to EORTC Melanoma group protocol 18952. Cytokines were quantified in patients sera using commercial ELISA kits. Majority of melanoma patients showed significantly lower values of IL-2 and IFN-gamma and pathologically elevated levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 as compared to healthy subjects what indicates disease associated Th1/Th2 imbalance. In addition increased IL-12 and IL-15 values were noted in some patients (54% and 27%, respectively). All patients who manifested early relapse during immunotherapy had significantly lower pretreatment levels of IL-2 and IL-12 than those remaining without progression and probably benefiting from the treatment. Cytokine changes during immunotherapy disclosed that decreases in IL-2 and IL-12 and raises in IL-6 and IL-10 values occurred at least one month prior to relapse. Moreover, the continuous elevation of TNF-alpha and sIL-2R could be observed in patients who remained without progression during 10 months lasting immunotherapy. Our data illustrate that malignant melanoma associates with Th1/Th2 perturbances which are directed towards extended Th2 responses and that measurement of selected cytokines of Th1/Th2 category may be used as an early signal of disease deterioration and for evaluation of immunotherapy response.",

We found that in a high percentage of neuroblastoma cell lines and patient samples with amplified MYCN, caspase-8 mRNA is not expressed. The caspase-8 gene, CASP8, was deleted or silenced by methylation in the neuroblastoma cell lines while methylation of its promoter region was the predominant mechanism for its inactivation in the patient tumor samples. Reintroduction of caspase-8 into the neuroblastoma cell lines resensitized these cells to drug-induced and survival factor dependent apoptosis. Subsequently others have also shown that caspase-8 is silenced by methylation in neuroblastoma and peripheral neural ectodermal tumors, and that the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1 is silenced by methylation in melanoma cell lines and patient samples. We conclude that caspase-8 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastomas, that its silencing provides a permissive environment for MYCN gene amplification once the tumors are treated with chemotherapeutic drugs/irradiation, and that expression of this gene in these tumor cells may be of clinical benefit. We also discuss the possible significance of the neural crest cell progenitor cell origin and the silencing of important apoptotic regulators via methylation in both neuroblastoma and melanoma tumors.",

The cells have been shown to express the C3b-cleaving membrane protease p65. To delineate the molecular consequences of the C3b-cleaving activity for the complement cytotoxicity, the molecular events during the initiation (R24 monoclonal antibody, C1), amplification (C4, C3), and membrane attack (C5, C9) phases of complement were studied in comparison to a complement-susceptible human melanoma line (SK-MEL-93-2). No cleavage of C4b and C5b, 2 molecules structurally similar to C3b, was observed on the cells during classical pathway activation indicating the specificity of the p65 protease for the C3b molecule. The rapid degradation of C3b by p65 on the surface of complement-resistant SK-MEL-170 cells generates a M(r) 30,000 C3 alpha'-chain-fragment detectable as early as 1 min after complement activation, whereas no such fragment was present in detectable amounts on complement-susceptible cells. As a result of the rapid C3b proteolysis by p65 on resistant SK-MEL-170 cells, less C5 convertases are formed, which in turn results in the formation of a lower number of terminal complement components and membrane attack complexes. R24 antibody and C1q binding to the resistant cells was slightly lower as to susceptible cells. C4 binding studies, however, revealed that the observed difference in antibody and C1q binding has no influence on the complement resistance of SK-MEL-170 cells: significantly more C4b was bound to complement-resistant (1565 +/- 92 fg/cell) as compared to susceptible cells (715 +/- 31 fg/cell). On extraction of the molecular forms of C4 bound to the cell membranes, an additional high molecular weight C4 species--apparently a C4b-C4b homodimer--appeared only on the resistant SK-MEL-170 cells that may function as a residual back-up C5 convertase. Collectively, these results show that SK-MEL-170 human melanoma cells evade complement-mediated cytolysis despite sufficient activation of early components of the classical complement pathway by p65-mediated rapid degradation of surface-bound C3b, leading to a significant reduction in membrane attack complex formation. Thus, rapid cleavage of surface deposited C3b was established as a powerful mechanism of complement resistance.",

Twenty-seven endoresection or enucleation specimens were analysed by MLPA, and a single enucleation specimen by MSA. Chromosome 3 data showed prognostic concordance for the patient-matched samples in all 28 cases including 4 cases where samples were taken pre pre- and post radiotherapy. Thirteen cases were classified as monosomy 3 and 12 as disomy 3. Two cases had a loss of chromosome arm 3q in both samples and a single case showed loss of 3p in the biopsy sample with complete monosomy 3 in the subsequent enucleation sample taken 5 months later.;Intraocular biopsy of CM yields similar prognostic information to larger surgical specimens.

However, some very encouraging results obtained with new protocols for adoptive immunotherapy have been published and we also hope that further results will confirm that the subset of KIT-mutated melanomas will beneficiate from an efficient targeted anti-Kit therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"The presentations of primary and metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) are very diverse. Evidence increasingly indicates that single CMM cells spread to distant sites quite early during cancer progression and are soon eliminated before they become clinically detectable. However bulky metastases which appear at a later stage might derive from some of these early neoplastic cells. It seems that local CMM single cell micro-metastases commonly predict sentinel lymph node involvement without overtly reflecting CMM progression to bulky visceral metastases. This study is intended to review the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying two CMM presentations. The first is the long interval, apparently disease-free, with persistent CMM dormancy, which may precede overt metastatic growth. Immunosurveillance may induce dormancy in single CMM cells disseminated in the body by blocking their proliferation cycle. The second is the so-called CMM smoldering phenomenon, which is marked by an alternate progression and regression of CMM locally with metastases that wax and wane for long periods of time over restricted skin areas. These very diverse patterns of CMM progression are likely to be ascribable to a number of biological factors, including the activation of CMM stem cells, and the combined phenotypic heterogeneity and variability in proliferative amplification in CMM cell clusters. Furthermore an adequate stimulation of CMM immune-surveillance and the induction of a specific stromal structure and vascular response are required. In this context, most early CMM tumors are in part controlled by lymphocyte-mediated responses before they become clinically detectable. However both the role of immune-surveillance and the mechanisms underlying both persistent and smoldering CMM dormancy remain unclear. ",

Although MTS1 may thus be the candidate melanoma suppressor gene that maps to chromosome 9p21, it is not clear how dysfunction at that locus temporally relates to melanoma progression. To further test its role in sporadic melanoma, the expression of p16INK4-protein and -mRNA was characterized in melanomas and melanocytic nevi by immunocytochemistry and in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Histologic tissue sections were immunolabeled with anti-p16INK4 antibody for 108 melanocytic lesions, including common and atypical nevi, in situ melanomas, primary invasive melanomas, and metastatic tumors. A subset of the lesions was analyzed for expression of p16INK4-mRNA, employing forward and reverse intron-bridging primers for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of the transcript corresponding to exons 1 and 2 of MTS1. Strong immunolabeling was detected in the melanocytes of common nevi and of nevi with architectural disorder and cytologic atypia. By digital image analysis, in contrast, labeling intensity decreased significantly and progressively in the melanocytes of in situ, invasive, and metastatic melanomas. Results from the in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis were confirmatory, showing a strong signal in the melanocytic nevi but progressive signal attenuation with increasing stage of melanoma. These data indicate correlation between gradual loss of expression of the MTS1 locus and progression of melanoma, further supporting an emerging role for the gene in the malignant transformation of melanocytes. The failure to demonstrate reduced expression in nevi suggests either that these lesions are not an early stage in melanoma development, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, or that loss of p16INK4 function is not an initiating event in melanocyte transformation.",

Intravenous adoptive transfer of costimulated T cells into mice bearing disseminated micrometastasis of a poorly immunogenic, major histocompatibility complex class I-negative A9P melanoma results in a 60% cure rate. Autopsy of mice that died after unsuccessful treatment revealed tumor growth in the liver, spleen, and skin with minimal or no evidence of pulmonary disease. In contrast, mice that received no treatment or noncostimulated T cells had massive pulmonary tumors, suggesting that adoptively transferred T cells are less effective against growth of extrapulmonary tumors. These results show that costimulation of tumor-draining lymph node T cells through CD28 and 4-1BB increases their potential for cancer immunotherapy and suggests that improper trafficking of tumor-reactive T cells to extrapulmonary sites must be improved to enhance clinical efficacy.",

Similarities with uveal melanoma were recently suggested as both entities harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11. Whether primary LMNs share additional genetic alterations with uveal melanoma including copy number variations is unknown. Twenty primary LMNs ranging from benign and intermediate-grade melanocytomas to melanomas were tested by direct sequencing for hotspot mutations in the genes GNA11, GNAQ, BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. Furthermore, the lesions were tested for copy number variations of chromosomes frequently present in uveal melanoma (1p, 3, 6 and 8q) by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Genome-wide analyses of copy number alterations of two leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms were performed using the OncoScan SNP-array. GNAQ(Q209) mutations were present in eleven LMNs, while two of 20 cases carried a GNA11(Q209) mutation. No BRAF, HRAS or NRAS hotspot mutations were detected. Monosomy 3 and gain of 8q were present in one leptomeningeal melanoma, and one intermediate-grade melanocytoma harbored a gain of chromosome 6. With MLPA, the melanocytomas did not show any further gross chromosomal variations. Our data shows that primary LMNs, like uveal melanoma, harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 but lack mutations in BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. This finding may help in the differential diagnosis between a primary LMN and a metastasis from a cutaneous melanoma to the central nervous system. Copy number variations in some aggressive LMNs resemble those present in uveal melanoma but their prognostic significance is unclear. ",

In addition, cellular effectors were investigated by ELISA kits, western blotting and flow cytometry.;The exposure to vemurafenib inhibited MO-1 cell proliferation at concentrations similar to those obtained in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, and an explanation of this sensitivity is the strong activation of Erk1/2 and the low expression of MITF. Nab-paclitaxel strongly reduced proliferation of MO-1 cells perhaps for the very low expression level of PMEL17, transcriptionally regulated by MITF and negatively involved in determining sensitivity to taxanes.;Thus, the mutation BRAF G469A in MM might be related to a weak effectiveness of therapy with BRAF inhibitors and a promising therapeutic approach may be with nab-paclitaxel.",

Genomic analyses of human cutaneous melanoma (CMM) models (N = 51, low passage) by classical and/or array CGH revealed frequent gains at chromosome 20q (65%, amplifications in 45%) repeatedly including the Aurora A gene locus. Accordingly, the majority of CMM cell cultures overexpressed Aurora A when compared to proliferating non-malignant cells. Moreover, CMM cells even when arrested in G1/S cell cycle phase contained readily detectable levels of Aurora A indicating incomplete degradation during mitosis. Already at low concentrations (10-100 nm), long-term (7-10 days) application of the pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor VE-465 completely prevented colony formation in all CMM models tested. In contrast, blockade of cell survival/proliferation and DNA synthesis as well as the induction of apoptosis by VE-465 distinctly differed in short-term experiments (up to 72 h exposure). Both cell cycle arrest and DNA synthesis blockade depended on the level of VE-465-mediated p53/p21 activation while p53/p21 unresponsiveness led to repetitive endoreduplication (>8n DNA content). In contrast, apoptosis induction by VE-465 and Aurora A siRNA did not correlate with p53/p21 responsiveness and DNA synthesis blockade. Moreover, application of the Aurora B-specific inhibitor ZM447439 and siRNA was less efficient to induce CMM cell death proofing that apoptosis induction by VE-465 depended predominantly on Aurora A targeting. In combination experiments with chemotherapeutic agents, VE-465 acted additive to antagonistic when applied concomitantly but in several cases even synergistic when applied consecutively. In summary, we suggest that the Aurora A kinase might represent a promising target of well-designed novel antimelanoma strategies.",

The tumor interstitial collagenase cDNA was sequenced and compared to the published sequences for human fibroblast collagenase. The sequence for the tumor collagenase has two DNA base pairs which differ from the sequence of normal fibroblast collagenase. Restriction enzyme digestion of a specific DNA fragment produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA from human placenta resolves a discrepancy in the previously reported DNA and amino acid sequences for the fibroblast collagenase. A high level of expression of interstitial collagenase message was found in human A2058 melanoma cells by Northern blot analysis, and this level was slightly increased by phorbol ester (phorbol myristate acetate) stimulation. Interstitial collagenase mRNA expression was significantly decreased by treatment with either transforming growth factor-beta 1 or retinoic acid in A2058 melanoma cells. A high level of the collagenase protein secreted into conditioned media was identified by Western blotting. As shown by gelatin zymogram analysis interstitial collagenase was one of at least two metalloproteinases secreted by this same cell line. Thus, human melanoma cells can directly produce interstitial collagenase without a requirement for host cell interaction.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The theory of immunosurveillance against cancer has been an extensively debated question over the last decades. Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. A primary cutaneous lesion was investigated. T cell repertoire analysis showed the in situ amplification of at least two tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) expressing the V beta 13 and V beta 16 variable TCR gene segments respectively. The two clones were precisely characterized by sequence of the TCR beta chain junctional region. Further functional study demonstrated that both lymphocytes displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. The V beta 16+ cells, predominant in vivo, were shown to be closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrated the existence of a local adaptative immune response associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept. A gastric metastasis which occurred three years after the primary lesion has been studied here. Overexpression of the V beta 13 and V beta 16 TCR segments was no longer detected by direct PCR analysis in situ. Sequencing transcripts from V beta 13+ and V beta 16+ TILs confirmed that the two CTLs, identified in the primary lesions, were not represented with high frequency. The V beta 13+ cell was however shown to be present while the V beta 16+ CTL was not detected. Yet, characterization of a tumor cell line derived from the gastric site indicated that the peptidic antigen(s) which induced the initially successfully immune response was still expressed. The present data illustrate that it has become possible to perform very precise analysis of local immune responses during cancer development. Such an improvement together with the recently initiated molecular characterization of tumor associated peptidic antigens, should provide the basis for improved strategies of cancer immunotherapy.",

Identical splicing patterns were found in transcripts from human primary melanocytes in culture and a melanoma cell line, indicating that lymphoblastoid cell lines provide an accurate reflection of transcript processing in melanocytes. Similar splicing patterns have also been found with murine melanocyte tyrosinase transcripts.

All of the hypodiploid cells, but none of the hypotetraploid cells, contained chromosomes with long homogeneously staining regions (HSR's) when examined with quinacrine fluorescence. These long HSR's on an X-chromosome and derivative chromosome 15, produced characteristic patterns of positive- and negative-staining areas along the HSR's with both conventional Giemsa (G) staining and C-banding. The C- and G-positive regions stained with distamycin A-DAPI, which is specific for the centromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9, 15p, 16, and Y. DNA extracted from MeWo cells and digested with the restriction enzymes KpnL or Sau3A exhibited marked amplification of a 1.8-kilobase fragment. The amplified Sau3A fragment (D15Z1) was cloned, mapped, and partially sequenced. The sequenced region contained a five-base-pair repeat unit (adenine-adenine-thymine-guanine-guanine) that has undergone considerable divergence. Estimates of the size of the HSR's and the amount of amplified DNA suggested that each HSR contained at least 30,000 copies of the 1.8-kb KpnL fragment, representing about 50% of each HSR. The amplified sequence was identified as one member of the previously described KpnL family of repeated sequences. In situ hybridization of D15Z1 to MeWo metaphase chromosomes resulted in heavy labeling over both HSR's.

        "Doc_abstract":"Due to a variety of known and unknown control mechanisms, the human genome is remarkably stable when compared to most other species. The long latency periods of most solid tumors, during which the cell undergoes malignant transformation, are presumably due to this stability. The molecular basis responsible for the induction of genetic instability and the resultant biological characteristics manifest in tumor populations is not well understood. The discovery of both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, however, has placed the phenomenon of human genome stability on a more solid conceptual footing. These types of genes clearly place multiple barriers to oncogenic transformation, and traversing these barriers apparently requires both time and the accumulation of genetic defects that cannot be corrected. The evolution of neoplasias can, therefore, be predicted to be due to: (1) consistent and progressive loss of tumor suppressor genes; (2) gene amplification, resulting in the over-expression of proteins that aid in tumor progression; (3) gene mutation, which alters the orderly biochemistry of the normal cell; (4) genes that allow a cell like the melanocyte to escape the confining nature of the epidermis and to invade through the dermis into the circulatory and lymphatic systems in order to disseminate itself to other organs (e.g., proteolytic enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, integrins, metastases genes, chemotactic factors etc.); (5) factors, perhaps such as TGF beta 2, that may impact negatively on MHC antigens and confuse host defense mechanisms; and (6) S.O.S.-type genes, which may be expressed as a direct response to the accumulating damage in an attempt to correct the damage, but that may then become part of the problem instead of the solution. The extraordinary plasticity and instability of the genome of a melanoma cell suggests an inordinate amount of genetic flux. In addition to activating and inactivating various genes, this constant shuffling and rearranging of the genome in neoplasms such as MM may be constantly altering gene dose. Cytogenetic and molecular biological studies have been the Rosetta stone for understanding the etiological relevant genetic events in human cancers. Genetic alterations fundamental to the pathology of MM have begun to be defined. Studies designed to understand these perturbations at the biochemical and organismic level are underway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Copy number changes of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8 were studied by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Oncogenic mutations in UM involving exons 4 and 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, respectively, were analysed by sequencing.;All cell lines grew in suspension. UMT2 cells were homogeneous, UMT26 and UMT33 cells heterogeneous with regard to cell size and pigmentation. All UM cell lines revealed a melanocytic differentiation. UMT2 and 33 adhered on various extracellular matrices, while UMT26 only adhered to basal membrane extract (BME). This difference corresponded to the different expression of various integrins. Ki67 was expressed by 89% of UMT2 and 95% of UMT33 cells, which thus were in a proliferative stage, while only 2% of UMT26 cells revealed immunostaining for this proliferation marker. The doubling time of UMT2 was 3 days, 12 days for UMT33, and circa 3-4 months for UMT26. MLPA revealed disomy 3 in UMT2 and monosomy 3 in UMT33. The same point mutation was found in UMT2, 26 and 33, in exon 5 of GNA11 at codon 209 (p.Q209L).;The establishment of UM cell lines under serum-free conditions is possible.

Correlations between sIL-2R values, baseline patients and tumour features were studied by contingency tables and the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was applied to plot disease-free survival (DFS) curves. Univariate analysis was performed with the Log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to analyse the effect of several risk factors on DFS. In total, 2330 blood samples were collected during follow-up of 329 MM patients. Forty-five (13.7%) patients had Breslow tumour thickness<or=1.00, 83 (25.2%) patients>1.00 and <or=2.00 mm, 72 (21.9%) patients>2.00 and <or=4.00 mm, and 47 (14.3%) patients>4.00 mm. Ulceration was present in 64 cases (19.4%). Thirty-nine sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) (11.8%) were infiltrated by MM. Soluble IL-2R values ranged from 130 to 1420 U/ml; median value was 500 U/ml. One hundred twenty-one (36.8%) patients presented with sIL-2R>600 U/ml at first measure (FM), 194 patients (58.9%) with values increasing up to or more than 600 U/ml [increasing values (IV) pattern]. A correlation was found between Breslow's tumour values and the IV sIL-2R pattern group (P=0.0304 with chi2 test). Gender, presence of ulceration, Breslow tumour thickness, FM and IV sIL-2R pattern groups had a significant prognostic value for DFS. At multivariate analysis, presence of ulceration, gender, FM and IV sIL-2R pattern groups emerged as independent prognostic factors for DFS. The 5-year DFS rate was 88% for patients with FM<600 U/ml and 76.9% for patients with FM>600 U/ml. In IV pattern, the 5-year DFS rate was 69.5% compared to 87% for patients with no sIL-2R values>600 U/ml during follow-up. sIL-2R values are associated with progression of MM.

Recent studies indicate that the derepressed expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and telomerase activity (TA) are involved in the process of human carcinogenesis. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of IFN-alpha on hTERT and TA, with controversial results. Objectives To study the hTERT mRNA expression, TA and apoptosis in human melanoma cells treated with IFN-alpha.;Five human melanoma cell lines (Me665/2/21, Me665/2/60, HT-144, SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5) were cultured in standard conditions and treated with 20000 IU mL-1 of human recombinant IFN-alpha-2b. Apoptosis was evaluated as hypodiploid DNA content determined by flow cytometry, caspase-3/7 activity by enzymatic assay, and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage by Western blot analysis. IFN-alpha receptor (IFNA-R) and hTERT mRNA expression levels were evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. TA was evaluated by a polymerase chain reaction-based telomerase repeat amplification protocol assay.;Besides a variable degree of cell proliferation inhibition in all cell lines tested, we found different responses, ranging from no significant effects in SK-Mel-28 cells, to a high degree of apoptosis with no hTERT mRNA expression and TA modification in HT-144 cells, and induction of apoptosis, along with decrease in hTERT mRNA expression and TA in Me665/2/21 cells. No induction of apoptosis was observed in SK-Mel-5 and Me665/2/60 cells, although an early decrease in hTERT mRNA expression, and a minor increase of both hTERT mRNA expression and TA were found, respectively.;Our results suggest that the effects of IFN-alpha on hTERT and TA can result from the induction of apoptosis, but they can also occur through a direct modulation of hTERT. We hypothesize that, depending on the cellular context rather than the IFNA-R status of the targeted cells, IFN-alpha can elicit an apoptotic cell death; furthermore, different pathways of apoptosis, not necessarily involving telomerase, can be put into motion.",

A 61-year-old woman underwent enucleation for rubeotic glaucoma and cells in the anterior chamber after proton-beam radiotherapy of a cilio-choroidal melanoma of the right eye. Examination of the enucleated eye was performed with immunohistochemistry, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangements. A review of the literature on ocular collision tumours and uveal involvement by plasma cell neoplasms was also performed.;Morphological, immunophenotypical, and genotypical examination of the tumour revealed the co-existence of both a melanoma and a plasmacytoma within the choroid and ciliary body. The glaucoma was caused by extensive infiltration of the iris and trabecular meshwork by the plasmacytoma cells. Review of the literature revealed only four collision tumours involving the eyelid and three involving the choroid. All three intraocular collision tumours consisted of uveal melanoma and choroidal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Uveal involvement by plasma cell neoplasms is also extremely rare, with only six reported cases.;This is the first documented intraocular collision tumour consisting of a uveal melanoma and isolated plasmacytoma. If a patient presents with 'uveitis' after proton-beam radiotherapy of a cilio-choroidal melanoma, there may be scope for performing biopsies to determine whether the lymphoid infiltrate is reactive or neoplastic.",

Because cyclin D1 has been reported to be overexpressed in malignant melanomas, but not in common acquired nevi, we hypothesized that cyclin D1 might be a useful marker to distinguish Spitz nevi from malignant melanoma. Thus, we assessed for cyclin D1 expression in 11 Spitz nevi (10 compound and 1 intradermal) and 9 malignant melanomas (4 Clark stages I-III and 5 Clark stages IV-V) using an immunohistochemical method and routinely fixed and processed tissues. The cyclin D1 results were arbitrarily divided into three groups: 0% to 10%, >10% to 25%, and >25%. We confirmed the observations reported previously by others that cyclin D1 is expressed in malignant melanomas but not in common acquired nevi. Unexpectedly, a relatively high number of cyclin D1-positive cells (i.e., >10%) was also found in all cases of Spitz nevus. However, unlike malignant melanoma, the cyclin D1 positivity in Spitz nevi was present in a zonal pattern. In other words, the number of cyclin D1-positive cells decreased as the lesion extended more deeply, with the number of positive cells in the reticular dermis being less than that in the papillary dermis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization methods were used to assess amplification of 11q13, the locus harboring the cyclin D1 gene, in four cases of Spitz nevus; all were disomic. Using the antibody MIB-1, we compared cyclin D1 expression to the proliferation rate in Spitz nevi. Despite the high cyclin D1 positivity, all Spitz nevi had a relatively low number of MIB-1-positive cells (mean=3.2%), which was significantly lower than that of malignant melanomas (mean=15.3%) (p < 0.001). Thus, unlike malignant melanoma, there appears to be a dissociation between cyclin D1 overexpression and cell proliferation in Spitz nevi.",

Gene expression profiles and chromosome 3 status are correlated with tumor classification and prognosis. Somatic BAP1 mutations are another feature largely restricted to metastatic UM. Here we performed thorough BAP1 mutation analysis including sequencing and gene dosage analysis of all BAP1 coding exons as well as methylation analysis of the promoter CpG island in a set of 66 UMs. The results were compared with the BAP1 protein expression as determined by immunohistochemistry and the tumor-related survival of the patients. BAP1 sequencing and gene dosage analysis of BAP1 exons by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed a mutation in 33 (89%) of 37 tumors with monosomy 3 (M3) or isodisomy 3. BAP1 mutations were not detected in any of the 28 tumors with disomy 3 or partial monosomy 3 (partM3). Most of the sequence mutations (21 of 28) were frame-shift, splice-site, or nonsense mutations leading to a premature termination codon. BAP1 protein as determined by immunohistochemistry was absent in all samples with a BAP1 mutation irrespective of the functional type of mutation. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a highly significant association between BAP1 protein staining and patients' survival (P=0.0004). The association between BAP1 mutation status and tumor-related survival was less pronounced but still significant (P=0.0023). We conclude that BAP1 protein staining is favorable over BAP1 mutation screening by Sanger sequencing for prognostic testing of UM patients. ",

To further examine the association between enhanced tumorigenicity and the presence of HSR-bearing chromosomes, hybrid cell lines were constructed by fusing X-HSR-containing MeWo cells with ouabain-resistant, HPRT-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and culturing in HAT medium containing ouabain. A hybrid containing the X-HSR chromosome and several MeWo chromosomes was more tumorigenic in BALB/c nude mice than derivative cells lacking the X-HSR and human chromosome 18. However, since this enhanced tumorigenicity could be due to sequences on either the X-HSR or chromosome 18, a second series of hybrids was constructed by micro-cell fusion. In this case, the tumorigenicity of hybrid cells containing 2 copies of the X-HSR as the only MeWo chromosome was similar to that of derivative cells lacking these chromosomes. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) on the HSR were inactive in the hybrid cells. Our data indicate that DNA sequences amplified on MeWo HSRs do not enhance tumorigenicity under experimental conditions in which rRNA genes are not expressed. As the only active NORs in MeWo HSR-containing cells are on the HSRs, we suggest that expression of these amplified rRNA genes is responsible for the selective growth advantage of these cell types in nude mice. Our data also indicate that the enhanced tumorigenicity of MeWo HSR-containing cells is not due to co-amplification of a dominant oncogene.",

The Wf/Wf mutant mouse coat comprises viable and inviable melanoblast clones, seen ultimately as pigmented and white transverse stripes--the latter more prominent. Judging from the pattern, all clones initially expand, and the inviable ones then undergo programmed cell death prenatally. To observe skin melanocytes of the viable clones during extended proliferation, the cells were explanted from individual young mice. An unusually large number of primary explants failed to survive--a result consistent with a growth handicap. In 3 of the 10 surviving cell lines, many cells spontaneously underwent a series of striking changes with the classic features of transformation. The two transformed lines that have been tested by grafting to immunosuppressed hosts formed undifferentiated invasive tumors compatible with malignant amelanotic melanoma. None of our 52 other melanocyte lines of the coisogenic wild-type strain and 13 other natural genotypes have become transformed under the same culture conditions. Molecular analysis of the Wf gene revealed a single change from wild-type: a point mutation affecting the catalytic region in the kinase domain of the Kit protein. The apparent growth disadvantage due to the mutation may allow selection for melanocytes mobilizing more efficient pathways, thus leading to neoplasia. Production of both viable and inviable melanoblast clones is unlikely to be due only to the kinase mutation; possibly the degree, duration, and consistency of expression of this locus may be controlled by cis elements outside the coding region.",

In the present study, based on novel IgG antibody-measuring ELISA and antibody gene copy number-quantitative PCR, a human single B cell RT-PCR-mediated IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) gene cloning method was established, and CMVpp65-specific human mAbs were successfully identified. Quantitative PCR for the human IgG mRNA copy number per cell demonstrated that the detection range was 10-250copies/cell. CMVpp65(+)surfaceIgG(+) B cells were collected from melanoma patients who showed high titers of serum anti-CMVpp65 IgG antibody. RT-PCR was successful in 64% (IGH) and 84% (β-actin) of 88 single B cells. Finally, both IGH and IGL gene amplifications in the same cell were successful in 21 single cells, and 18 IgG antibody genes specific for CMVpp65 antigen were cloned. Four of 13 recombinant human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies showed strong responses to full-length CMVpp65 protein.

A standardized method allowing for high-throughput structural profiling and functional characterization of living cell surface GSLs is of growing importance because they function as crucial signal transduction molecules in various processes of dynamic cellular recognitions. However, methods are not available for amplification of GSLs, while the genomic scale PCR amplification permits large-scale mammalian proteomic analysis. Here we communicate such an approach to a novel \"omics\", namely, glycosphingolipidomics based on the \"glycoblotting\" method. The method, which involves selective ozonolysis of the C-C double bond in the ceramide moiety and subsequent enrichment of generated GSL aldehydes by chemical ligation using an aminooxy-functionalized gold nanoparticle (aoGNP) should be of widespread utility for identifying and characterizing whole GSLs present in the living cell surfaces. The present protocol using glycoblotting permitted MALDI-TOFMS-based high-throughput structural profiling of mouse brain gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a/GD1b, and GT1b for adult or GD3 in the case for the embryonic mouse. When mouse melanoma B16 cells were subjected to this protocol, it was demonstrated that gangliosides enriched from the plasma membranes are the only GM3 bearing microheteogeneity in the structure of the N-acyl chain. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that aoGNP displaying whole GSLs blotted from mouse B16 melanoma cell surfaces can be used directly for monitoring the specific interaction with the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Gg3Cer (gangliotriaosylceramide). Our results indicate that GSL-selective enrichment onto aoGNP from living cell surfaces allows for rapid reconstruction of plasma membrane models mimicking the intact GSL microdomain feasible for further structural and functional characterization.",

Using an antibody to HSP90, we precipitated the telomerase activity associated with the molecular chaperone. The results of TRAP (telomeric repeat amplification protocol) experiments carried out on HSP90 immunoprecipitates showed that exposure to 100 ng/ml GA and 17-AAG induced a significant (P < 0.01) inhibition of telomerase activity, which was observed at earlier time points than drug-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Superimposable results were obtained from TRAP experiments carried out on total JR8 protein extracts. To investigate whether the basal level of telomerase activity of the tumour cell system plays a role in determining the cellular response to 17-AAG, we compared the cytotoxic activity of the drug in JR8 cells and in two JR8-derived clones that were stably transfected with a hammerhead ribozyme targeting the RNA template of telomerase and were characterized by a markedly lower telomerase activity than the parental cells. The cytotoxicity results indicated that both ribozyme-transfectant clones were almost 2-fold more sensitive to 72 h 17-AAG exposure than JR8 cells as a consequence of a more than double apoptotic response [in terms of the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in cells stained with propidium iodide and the percentage of Tdt-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells]. In summary, our results suggest that (i) telomerase is a target of GA and 17-AAG action and its inhibition may contribute to the cytotoxic activity of the drugs, (ii) the basal level of telomerase activity of the tumour cell system may also have a role in influencing 17-AAG cytotoxicity.",

To identify molecular alterations driving clinical acquired resistance, we performed whole-exome sequencing on paired pretreatment and postprogression tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer treated with RAF inhibitor combinations. We identified alterations in MAPK pathway genes in resistant tumors not present in matched pretreatment tumors, including KRAS amplification, BRAF amplification, and a MEK1 mutation. These alterations conferred resistance to RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK combinations through sustained MAPK pathway activity, but an ERK inhibitor could suppress MAPK activity and overcome resistance. Identification of MAPK pathway reactivating alterations upon clinical acquired resistance underscores the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and suggests therapeutic options to overcome resistance.;RAF inhibitor combinations represent promising approaches in clinical development for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

On the other hand, for ex vivo analysis of malignant cells from melanocytic tumors laser pressure catapulting is an essential prerequisite to obtain noncontaminated melanocytic preparations; however, laser pressure catapulting prepared material provides only nanogram amounts of RNA. In this study we present an approach to overcome these limitations by combining laser pressure catapulting and real-time polymerase chain reaction based SMART cDNA amplification technology. Reproducible and reliable hybridization patterns from about 500 laser pressure catapulting prepared cell equivalents from 22 cases of melanocytic tumors were generated using array analysis. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences of the expression pattern of melanocytic nevi, melanomas, and melanoma metastases. Multivariate analysis with four genes being the best univariate discriminative features (tyrosinase related protein 2, translation initiation factor 2 gamma, ubiquitine conjugating enzyme E2I and one expressed sequence tag) allowed clustering of nevi, melanomas, and melanoma metastases with an accuracy of 82%. Data validation was performed by additional quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Taken together, this study shows, that (1) array analysis is feasible on tumors with rather low cell numbers, and (2) differences in expression profiles allow discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. Expression patterns of marker genes defined in unequivocal histopathologic entities may improve the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of difficult melanocytic lesions, which is still the hardest problem in dermatopathology.",

This article summarizes therapeutic efficacy and immune mechanisms involved in targeting interleukin-2 (IL-2) to neuroectodermal tumors using ganglioside GD2-specific antibody-IL-2 fusion protein (ch14.18-IL-2). Treatment of established melanoma metastases with ch14.18-IL-2 resulted in eradication of disease followed by a vaccination effect protecting mice from lethal challenges with wild-type tumor calls. In a syngeneic neuroblastoma model, targeted IL-2 was effective in the amplification of a weak memory immune response previously induced by IL-12 gene therapy using an engineered linear version of this heterodimeric cytokine. These findings show that targeted IL-2 may provide an effective tool in cancer immunotherapy and establish the missing link between T cell-mediated vaccination and objective clinical responses.",

To date, the concordance between MLPA data generated from frozen and fixed samples has not been investigated. Our study aimed to compare MLPA data obtained from fixed and frozen tissues to determine whether fixed samples can be used in UM genetic prognostic testing.;Adjacent samples were taken from 20 UM cases, with one sample being snap-frozen, and the second being formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE). MLPA analysis was performed using the P027.B1 assay. The chromosome arm copy numbers obtained for each pair of UM samples then were compared.;Of the 20 UM cases 18 gave MLPA results from FFPE material that passed quality control thresholds. When chromosome 3 copy number was classified successfully (loss, disomy or gain) using FFPE material, the corresponding frozen sample showed concordance in 100% of cases. However, even when FFPE samples passed quality thresholds, chromosome arm copy numbers for 3p and 3q were \"unclassifiable\" in 28% and 11% of cases, respectively. This compared to \"unclassifiable\" cases in 0% and 6% of the frozen UM samples.;Whenever possible, fresh or snap-frozen tissue should be used for UM genetic prognostic testing by MLPA. When only fixed tissue is available, MLPA can be used to determine reliably chromosome 3 copy number. However, some tumors will be unclassifiable where DNA quality is poor.",

We have studied immunohistochemically KIT expression in 23 canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), 10 histiocytomas, 5 malignant melanomas, and in 2 cell lines derived from mast cells (HMC-1, human and C2, canine). As expected, KIT was detected both in the human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC- ) and in the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. In normal canine skin, KIT expression was confined to mast cells. All canine MCTs expressed KIT, although the intensity of the staining reaction varied considerably among the 23 neoplasms. Grade III tumors showed the highest expression of KIT, whereas grade I tumors showed the lowest expression of KIT. Two patterns of KIT expression were detected in mast cells. In normal canine mast cells and in some neoplastic mast cells, KIT appeared mainly on the cell membrane. However, in many canine MCTs, KIT is accumulated in the cytoplasm, usually near the cell nucleus. The meaning of these two patterns is not clear. Expression of KIT could not be detected immunohistochemically in any of the other neoplasias investigated. According to our results, it can be concluded that most, if not all, canine MCT express KIT. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the expression of KIT. Moreover, according to our results, KIT can be used as a reliable immunohistochemical marker for canine mast cells and undifferentiated mast cell tumors.",

Activation of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases in melanocytes stimulates not only proliferation but also the expression of pigmentation. Melanoma cells constitutively express several tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins that in normal melanocytes are stimulated in response to growth factors. This high level of phosphorylation was not due to either the presence of constitutively active Kit kinase and Met kinase nor to the absence of any of several known protein tyrosine phosphatases. Because bFGF by itself does not transform melanocytes to melanomas, there must be additional cooperating factors that confer the malignant phenotype to pigment cells.",

Cancer vaccines take many forms, including synthetic peptides, tumor cells and lysates, cell lines, and autologous antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells. The target antigens may be known, or \"defined\" in the vaccine, or unknown. In melanoma, more so than in other cancers, a large number of immunogenic \"shared\" antigens (tumor-specific or tumor-associated) have been identified. This allows for vaccination of groups of patients with the same vaccine, and also allows for testing for melanoma tumor immunity even when the vaccine does not include defined antigens. For the cancer vaccine field, the goal of a prognostic or predictive biomarker has yet to be achieved. However, the primary immunologic goal of any cancer vaccine is the induction (or amplification) of an immune response against the tumor, therefore the primary goal of immunologic monitoring in this setting, is testing for that response. In this chapter, we present standardized methodology from a central immunologic monitoring laboratory for melanoma cancer vaccine immune response assessment by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Spot (ELISPOT) assay. This assay allows for enumeration of antigen-specific cells in a plate format. We present the Interferon (IFN)-γ-producing lymphocyte assay, but the platform is easily adjusted to several cell types and several secreted molecules. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanomas are highly variable with respect to aberrant gene expression and chromosomal lesions but share a common characteristic of an acquired independence from environmental growth factors that are needed for proliferation of normal melanocytes. Receptors with tyrosine kinase activity play a critical role in normal melanocyte proliferation and in the uncontrolled growth of melanomas. Normal human melanocytes depend on exogenous peptide growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), or mast cell growth factor (MGF), all of which stimulate receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, human melanoma cells from primary nodular and metastatic lesions grow autonomously partially because of inappropriate production of bFGF and continuous activation of the bFGF-receptor kinase. Animal models also provide evidence for the importance of receptor-tyrosine kinases in normal melanocyte proliferation and in malignant transformation. In the mouse, genes residing in three loci in which inactivation mutations lead to piebaldism, the dominant spotting (W), patch (Ph), and Sl encode, respectively, the receptor-kinases c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor, and the ligand for c-kit: MGF. In vivo transformation of mouse melanocytes to melanoma, due to constitutive expression of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, the oncogene ret, was recently demonstrated in transgenic mice. Studies on a fish model, Xiphophorus, in which melanoma is inherited, showed that the dominant tumor inducing gene, Tu, encodes an EGF-receptor related tyrosine kinase which is expressed only in melanomas and not in normal tissues. Taken together, the results suggest that the uncontrolled growth of melanomas is due, in large part, to constitutive activation of receptors with tyrosine kinase activity.",

In this study, cultures of epidermal melanocytes, progenitor cells of CMM, were established and harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth. Telomerase activity was looked for using a non-isotopic variant of the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, and transcript expression of the hTERT gene, the rate-limiting catalytic telomerase subunit, was investigated by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Neither telomerase activity nor hTERT mRNA could be detected in proliferating melanocyte cultures. Our in vitro data argue against the model of telomerase as a common biomarker of cell proliferation. The results further suggest that telomerase is tightly controlled in normal melanocytes, and that telomerase is reactivated rather than up-regulated in melanocytic precursors during melanoma initiation or progression.",

It should be taken into account that CD117 are also expressed by melanomas, vascular, and some other tumors. The c-kit gene mutations leading to the expression and autoactivation of the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT underlie the oncogenesis of GIST, which results in enhanced proliferative activity and inhibited apoptosis. This is supported by successful chemotherapy for GIST with a KIT receptor inhibitor. The histogenesis of GIST is associated with GIT somatic stem, the Cajal cell precursors. Many GISTs behave like sarcomas and they are characterized by an infiltrating growth, hematogenic (mainly into the liver) and implantational (along the peritoneum) cancer spread. There are opinions that all such neoplasms are potentially malignany and small-sized GISTs are benign and have the minimum mitotic activity.",

Microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) is a melanocytic nuclear protein critical for the embryonic development and postnatal viability of melanocytes. It serves as a master regulator in modulating extracellular signals, such as those triggered by alpha-MSH and c-Kit ligand. Because of its central role in melanocyte survival and to assess its potential use as a histopathological marker for melanoma, Mitf expression was examined in histologically confirmed human melanoma specimens. Western blot analysis of melanoma cell lines revealed consistent expression of two Mitf protein isoforms differing by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In a series of 76 consecutive human melanoma surgical specimens, 100% stained positively for Mitf with a nuclear pattern of reactivity. In a side-by-side comparison, Mitf staining was positive in melanomas that failed to stain for either HMB-45 or S-100, the most common currently used melanoma markers. Of 60 non-melanoma tumors, none displayed nuclear Mitf staining and two displayed cytoplasmic staining.

This mutation occurs in most patients with mastocytosis, a myeloproliferative neoplasm, and is detected at lower frequencies in acute myeloid leukemia and in germ cell tumors. Other KIT mutations occur in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and mucosal melanoma. KIT is considered as a bona fide therapeutic target as c-kit mutations are driving oncogenes in these pathologies. However, several evidences suggest that KIT-D816V mutant is not as aggressive as other KIT mutants. Here, we show that an intracellular docking site in the juxtamembrane region of KIT maintains a negative regulation on KIT-D816V transforming potential. Sixteen signaling proteins were shown to interact with this motif. We further demonstrate that mutation of this site results in signaling modifications, altered gene expression profile and increased transforming activity of KIT-D816V mutant. This result was unexpected as mutations of the homologous sites on wild-type (WT) KIT, or on the related oncogenic FLT3-ITD receptor, impair their function. Our results support the hypothesis that, KIT-D816V mutation is a mild oncogenic event that is sufficient to confer partial transforming properties, but requires additional mutations to acquire its full transforming potential.",

Deletion of the p16 locus has been observed in tumor cell lines and, less frequently, in primary human neoplasms. We analyzed 31 glioblastomas and identified 6 cases with hemizygous and 6 with homozygous deletions of the p16 locus. Eight of these cases showed a concurrent amplification of the EGFR gene (epidermal growth factor receptor) while the overall frequency was 35%. This close correlation suggests that deletion of the p16 chromosomal region constitutes another genetic hallmark of the primary glioblastoma, which rapidly develops de novo, without a less malignant precursor lesion and for which EGFR amplification is a characteristic genetic change. The p16 protein was not detectable in 15 of 22 glioblastomas but only 4 of these showed homozygous deletion of the gene. The alternative transcript p16 beta, for which a growth-suppressing function has been suggested, was co-expressed with p16 alpha mRNA in most cases. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the 5' region of the p16 gene was identified in only 1 case, suggesting that this alternative mechanism of gene silencing is rarely responsible for loss of p16 expression in glioblastomas. Likewise, only 1 glioblastoma carried a p16 mutation and in addition, unexpectedly, a homozygous deletion of p16 in approximately 80% of tumor cells. This mutation, Arg24Pro, has previously been identified in a melanoma kindred.",

All tumors were composed of solid sheets of loosely cohesive, \"melanoma-like\" cells with only limited infiltration. ePXAs showed lower grade foci with classic features of PXA. Both tumor types showed focal expression of epithelial and glial markers, retained INI1 and BRG1 expression, occasional CD34 positivity, and lack of mutant IDH1 (R132H) immunoreactivity.

Three different TCR alpha chains and 7 TCR beta chains were found among the 84 alpha and 162 beta cDNA clones tested. By screening different combination of the alpha/beta chains using RNA electroporation, TRAV9-1 (Valpha22.1) and TRBV20-1 (Vbeta2) were found to be the functional pair in line SG6. Antibody blocking experiments confirmed that the specificity of TRAV9-1/TRBV20-1 mRNA-transfected T cells were CD4 dependent and HLA-DP4 restricted. A retroviral vector expressing both TRAV9-1 and TRBV20-1 was constructed and used for transduction of OKT3-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from melanoma patients. TCR-transduced CD4 T cells were capable of recognizing peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-cells, dendritic cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and protein-pulsed dendritic cells. Transduced cells were also capable of proliferation upon peptide stimulation and recognized peptide concentrations that were recognized by the parental line (0.2 microM).

        "Doc_abstract":"Notch1 is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor involved in melanoma growth. Notch1 is first cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus to produce the biologically active heterodimer. Following ligand binding, Notch1 is cleaved at the cell membrane by proteases such as ADAM10 and -17 and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), the latter of which we recently identified as a novel protease involved in Notch1 processing. The final cleavage is γ-secretase dependent and releases the active Notch intracellular domain (NIC). We now demonstrate that Notch1 directly regulates furin expression. Aside from activating Notch1, furin cleaves and activates several proteases, including MT1-MMP, ADAM10, and ADAM17. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and a reporter assay, we demonstrate that Notch1 binds at position -1236 of the furin promoter and drives furin expression. The Notch1-dependent enhancement of furin expression increases the activities of MT1-MMP and ADAM10 but not that of ADAM17, as demonstrated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of furin, and promotes the cleavage of Notch1 itself. These data highlight a novel positive-feedback loop whereby Notch1-dependent furin expression can induce Notch1 signaling by increasing Notch1 processing and by potentiating the activity of the proteases responsible for Notch1 activation. This leads to Notch1 signal amplification, which can promote melanoma tumor growth and progression, as demonstrated by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion upon furin inhibition downstream of Notch1. Disruption of such feedback signaling might represent an avenue for the treatment of melanoma. ",

This prospective, open-label, phase II study included patients with previously untreated MM or unresectable melanoma. Patients received dacarbazine and bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy variable was the overall response rate. The secondary efficacy parameters included duration of response, duration of stable disease, time to progression/progression-free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The safety analysis included recordings of adverse events and exposure to study treatment. The intention-to-treat population included 37 patients (24 men and 13 women, mean age 54.2±13.1 years). Overall response rate was 18.9% (seven patients achieved a response) and clinical benefit was 48.6%. In patients who achieved a response, the median duration of response was 16.9 months and the median duration of stable disease was 12.5 months.

Antibodies with increased sensitivity and specificity for detection of C-Kit-negative GIST cases may be of value, especially because some of these cases may also benefit from TKI therapy.;Immunohistochemical staining for DOG-1, C-Kit (CD117) and protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) was performed on FNA cell-block preparations representing 30 GISTs, 17 leiomyosarcomas, 16 melanomas, 16 schwannomas, 11 adenoid cystic carcinomas, and 8 leiomyomas.;DOG-1 was found to have 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in diagnosis of GIST. C-Kit demonstrated 70% sensitivity and 76% specificity, and PKCθ showed 40% sensitivity and 86% specificity. When only spindle-cell neoplasms were considered (adenoid cystic carcinomas excluded), the specificity of C-Kit increased to 89%. Of interest, all C-Kit-negative cases showed DOG-1 positivity.;DOG-1 was the most sensitive and specific of the 3 markers for the diagnosis of GIST in cell-block preparations and may be of particular use in the diagnosis of C-Kit-negative GIST.",

We investigated this by assessing the contribution of rare variants in genes involved in CMM to PD risk. We studied rare variation across 29 CMM risk genes using high-quality genotype data in 6875 PD cases and 6065 controls and sought to replicate findings using whole-exome sequencing data from a second independent cohort totaling 1255 PD cases and 473 controls. No statistically significant enrichment of rare variants across all genes, per gene, or for any individual variant was detected in either cohort. There were nonsignificant trends toward different carrier frequencies between PD cases and controls, under different inheritance models, in the following CMM risk genes: BAP1, DCC, ERBB4, KIT, MAPK2, MITF, PTEN, and TP53. The very rare TYR p.V275F variant, which is a pathogenic allele for recessive albinism, was more common in PD cases than controls in 3 independent cohorts. Tyrosinase, encoded by TYR, is the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of neuromelanin, and has a role in the production of dopamine. These results suggest a possible role for another gene in the dopamine-biosynthetic pathway in susceptibility to neurodegenerative Parkinsonism, but further studies in larger PD cohorts are needed to accurately determine the role of these genes/variants in disease pathogenesis.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate LOH at 10q23.3 as a marker of cancer progression in node-positive prostate cancer. Genetic alterations in the region of 10q23.3 were assessed in 23 node-positive (pT2-3, N+) and 44 node-negative prostate (pT2-3, N0) cancers with D10S532, D10S1687, D10S541, and D10S583 flanking polymorphic genetic markers; PTENCA, a genetic marker within PTEN/MMAC1, was also tested. Using DNA from paired normal and microdissected tumor samples, LOH at microsatellite loci was determined after polymerase chain reaction amplification. LOH in at least 1 marker was identified in 14% (6 of 44) of lymph node-negative and 43% (10 of 23) of lymph node-positive prostate cancers (chi-square test, P = .007).

Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon BRAF inhibition might contribute to the relative unresponsiveness of colorectal cancer to the first-generation BRAF inhibitors. Here, we report characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigation. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits BRAF(V600E)-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harboring BRAF(V600E) and EGFR mutation/amplification. In BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. In vivo, BGB-283 treatment leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both cell line-derived and primary human colorectal tumor xenografts bearing BRAF(V600E) mutation.

However, the majority of such patients either exhibit de novo resistance from the beginning of the treatment or acquire resistance and eventually relapse. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance, overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors remains an unmet medical need. Constitutive activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 as a result of genetic aberrations including CDKN2A inactivation and CCND1 amplification is common across many cancer types and frequently co-occurs with oncogenic BRAF mutations. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression is a common feature of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here we review CDK4/6 as a therapeutic target in BRAF mutant cancers and discuss emerging evidence supporting a critical role of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 axis in de novo and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Co-targeting CDK4/6 and BRAF could be a more effective therapy to augment clinical response of BRAF inhibitors and overcome resistance in BRAF mutant cancers. ",

Different categories of cancer-associated antigens have been described as targets for CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo: (1) 'cancer-testis' (CT) antigens expressed in different tumors and normal testis; (2) melanocyte differentiation antigens; (3) point mutations of normal genes; (4) antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and (5) viral antigens. Clinical trials with antigenic peptides have been initiated to induce specific immunological responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of peptide-specific reactions have been defined: DTH, CD8+ T cell, autoimmune and tumor regression responses. Preliminary results show that tumor-associated peptides alone elicit specific DTH and CD8+ T cell responses associated with tumor regression after intradermal vaccination. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been shown to enhance peptide-specific immune reactions by amplification of dermal antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Complete tumor regressions have been observed after the induction of CD8+ T cell responses by peptide immunization. Based on these results, active immunotherapy with tumor-associated antigens may be a promising approach for patients in adjuvant treatment situations, who are at high risk for tumor recurrence. Recently, a strategy utilizing spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX) has led to the identification of a new CT antigen, NY-ESO-1. NY-ESO-1-specific spontaneous humoral and cellular immune responses were found in approximately 50% of patients with NY-ESO-1-positive tumors.

CRC cell lines with mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA were less sensitive to growth inhibition by PLX4720 (P = 0.03), and knockdown of PTEN expression in sensitive CRC cells reduced growth inhibition by the drug. Combined treatment of PLX4720 with PI3K inhibitors caused synergistic growth inhibition in BRAF-mutant CRC cells with both primary and secondary resistance. In addition, methyltransferase inhibition was synergistic with PLX4720 and decreased AKT activation. In vivo, PLX4720 combined with either inhibitors of AKT or methyltransferase showed greater tumor growth inhibition than PLX4720 alone.

The general problems in this distinction include histological mimicry of other mesenchymal tumors with GIST, occasional KIT-negativity of GIST, and KIT-positivity of non-GISTs. Up to 5% to 10% gastric GISTs and <2% of intestinal GISTs can be KIT-negative. The identification of these tumors as GISTs is based on knowledge of the spectrum of GIST morphology, and can be supported by molecular diagnosis of KIT and PDGFRA mutations (the latter pertain to gastric tumors). True smooth muscle tumors (rare in GI tract except in esophagus and colon) can be separated from GISTs by the eosinophilic tinctorial quality of tumor cells, positivity for smooth muscle markers, and negativity for KIT. Desmoids can form large GIST-like masses, but are composed of spindled or stellate-shaped cells in a densely collagenous stroma. Negativity for KIT and nuclear positivity for beta-catenin are differentiating features. GI schwannomas, melanoma, and rare primary clear cell sarcoma are S100-positive, usually with characteristic histology. The latter two can be KIT-positive. KIT-positive non-GISTs include some sarcomas, especially angiosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, extramedullary myeloid tumor, seminoma, and a few carcinomas, notably small cell carcinoma of lung. Spurious KIT-positivity, seen with some polyclonal KIT antibodies, has been a source of confusion leading to probable false-positive results in fibroblastic tumors and occasional other sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcomas. Integration of histological features with carefully standardized immunohistochemistry, supported by KIT and PDGFRA mutation analysis, is the cornerstone of state-of-the art differential diagnosis of GIST. To comprehensively capture all GISTs, KIT immunostains should be performed on all unclassified epithelioid and mesenchymal tumors of the abdomen. This is a US government work.

        "Doc_abstract":"Modern pathomorphology tumour diagnostics involve comprehensive cytology cell examination and, importantly, tissue biopsy examination using the most up-to-date assessment techniques. To correctly classify a tumour process, it is essential not only to define its histological typology and identify its biological character but, at the same time, using immunohistochemistry and diagnostic molecular pathology, to evaluate prognostic and predictive indicators. As regards the prognostic indicators, it is mainly grading and staging as part of the TNM system, the sentinel lymph node assessment, if it is assessed, and other nodes extracted in this context. Histological specimens of invasive carcinomas and skin melanomas are assessed with respect to the depth of the invasion. Endocrine oestrogen and progesterone receptors are assessed in endocrine-dependent breast carcinomas. Predictive pathology uses biomarkers; biomarkers confirm the presence of target molecules following their reaction with the administered small molecule-like drugs, usually protein kinases or antibodies. HER2 gene amplification is estimated using the FISH method and predicts effectiveness of breast cancer therapies. In patients with a colon carcinoma, HER1 oncogene is identified immunohistochemically and the presence of a mutated K-ras is subsequently tested using the RT-PCR technique. CD 117 (c-kit) expression is determined in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and CD 20, 33 and 52 in malignant lymphomas and leukaemias. The most difficult task for a pathologist is defining the primary focus of the tumour in cases where only a fraction of a metastasis is available for examination. Nevertheless, at present, it is feasible to track the tumour differentiation down and, using an antibody battery, particularly against specific cytokeratines and vimentine and including organ-specific markers, to identify the primary source or at least to establish an assumption about the most likely organ affected by the tumour process.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Transcriptional targeting of cytotoxic genes is an important way to control toxicity associated with gene transfer therapies, but supposedly, tissue-specific promoters are often either very weak and/or leaky. In addition, the phenotypic leakiness of such tissue-specific promoters is dependent upon the toxicity of the gene being used. Therefore, we devised a transcriptional feedback loop to restrict gene expression of very potent genes to melanoma cells. We screened different elements of the human tyrosinase promoter to find one which gave no detectable expression in non-melanoma cells but was active in melanoma cell lines. This weak, but highly tissue specific, element (Tyr-300) was then used as the basis for a transcriptional amplification feedback loop in which a consensus heat shock element (HSE) was cloned upstream of Tyr-300. The cytotoxic gene was cloned downstream of the HSE-Tyr-300 element along with a mutated form of the heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) transcription factor, which no longer requires cellular stress to activate its trimerisation, nuclear localisation and transcriptional activation properties. Low levels of expression from Tyr-300 initiated expression of both the cytotoxic and the HSF-1 genes in melanoma cells. Gradual build up of HSF-1 amplified expression through binding to the HSE to give levels of cytotoxicity similar to that provided by a CMV promoter. However, no leakiness was observed in multiple non-melanoma cell lines tested. In addition to amplifying low levels of weak tissue-specific expression, the use of HSF-1 also leads to activation of endogenous stress-related genes such as hsp70. Induction of these genes, in the presence of cell killing by the cytotoxic gene, is a highly immunostimulatory event which enhances the antitumour vaccination effects of direct tumour cell destruction. Having demonstrated the compatibility of the component elements in plasmid form, we incorporated the feedback loop into a hybrid LTR-modified retroviral vector and confirmed that the system can be effective in the form of a viral vector. The format of the feedback loop described here could be exploited for any tissue type in which a highly tissue-specific element can be identified but which is itself too weak to be effective therapeutically.",

Data representing chromosomes 3 and 8q were analyzed in depth since their association with CM patient survival is well-known. Unsupervised k-means cluster analysis was performed to detect latent structure in the data set. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed to determine the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. Survival analyses of the identified clusters were performed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) and log-rank statistical tests. Correlation with largest basal tumor diameter (LTD) was investigated.;Chromosome 3: A two-cluster (bimodal) solution was found in chromosome 3, characterized by centroids at unilaterally normal probe values and unilateral deletion. There was a large, significant difference in the survival characteristics of the two clusters (log-rank, p<0.001; 5-year survival: 80% versus 40%). Both clusters had a broad distribution in LTD, although larger tumors were characteristically in the poorer outcome group (Mann-Whitney, p<0.001). Threshold values of 0.85 for deletion and 1.15 for gain optimized the classification of the clusters. PCA showed that the first principal component (PC1) contained more than 80% of the data set variance and all of the bimodality, with uniform coefficients (0.28±0.03). Chromosome 8q: No clusters were found in chromosome 8q. Using a conventional threshold-based definition of 8q gain, and in conjunction with the chromosome 3 clusters, three prognostic groups were identified: chromosomes 3 and 8q both normal, either chromosome 3 or 8q abnormal, and both chromosomes 3 and 8q abnormal. KM analysis showed 5-year survival figures of approximately 97%, 80%, and 30% for these prognostic groups, respectively (log-rank, p<0.001). All MLPA probes within both chromosomes were significantly correlated with each other (Spearman, p<0.001).;Within chromosome 3, the strong correlation between the MLPA variables and the uniform coefficients from the PCA indicates a lack of evidence for a signature gene that might account for the bimodality we observed. We hypothesize that the two clusters we found correspond to binary underlying states of complete monosomy or disomy 3 and that these states are sampled by the complete ensemble of probes. Consequently, we would expect a similar pattern to emerge in higher-resolution MLPA data sets. LTD may be a significant confounding factor. Considering chromosome 8q, we found that chromosome 3 cluster membership and 8q gain as traditionally defined have an indistinguishable impact on patient outcome.",

SCF and its c-kit receptor are expressed by some tumor cells, including myeloid leukemia, breast carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, gynecological tumors, and testicular germ cell tumors. Previous studies of SCF in neuroblastoma have produced conflicting conclusions. To explore the role of SCF in neuroblastoma, we studied five neuroblastoma lines (IMR-5, SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE, AF8, and SJ-N-KP) and the neuroepithelioma line CHP-100. All lines expressed mRNA for c-kit and c-kit protein at low intensity as measured by flow cytometry, and secreted SCF in medium culture as shown by ELISA. Exogenous SCF did not modify 3H thymidine uptake in the neuroblastoma and neuroepithelioma cell lines. After 6 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, the number of viable neuroblastoma cells was significantly lower than the control, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay showed a substantial increase of apoptotic cells: The percentage of positive cells was 1-3% in the control lines, whereas in the presence of anti c-kit it varied from 29% of SK-N-BE to 92% of CHP-100.

        "Doc_abstract":"A model of the gene-regulatory-network (GRN), governing growth, survival, and differentiation of melanocytes, has emerged from studies of mouse coat color mutants and melanoma cell lines. In this model, Transcription Factor Activator Protein 2 alpha (TFAP2A) contributes to melanocyte development by activating expression of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit. Next, ligand-bound Kit stimulates a pathway activating transcription factor Microphthalmia (Mitf), which promotes differentiation and survival of melanocytes by activating expression of Tyrosinase family members, Bcl2, and other genes. The model predicts that in both Tfap2a and Kit null mutants there will be a phenotype of reduced melanocytes and that, because Tfap2a acts upstream of Kit, this phenotype will be more severe, or at least as severe as, in Tfap2a null mutants in comparison to Kit null mutants. Unexpectedly, this is not the case in zebrafish or mouse. Because many Tfap2 family members have identical DNA-binding specificity, we reasoned that another Tfap2 family member may work redundantly with Tfap2a in promoting Kit expression. We report that tfap2e is expressed in melanoblasts and melanophores in zebrafish embryos and that its orthologue, TFAP2E, is expressed in human melanocytes. We provide evidence that Tfap2e functions redundantly with Tfap2a to maintain kita expression in zebrafish embryonic melanophores. Further, we show that, in contrast to in kita mutants where embryonic melanophores appear to differentiate normally, in tfap2a/e doubly-deficient embryonic melanophores are small and under-melanized, although they retain expression of mitfa. Interestingly, forcing expression of mitfa in tfap2a/e doubly-deficient embryos partially restores melanophore differentiation. These findings reveal that Tfap2 activity, mediated redundantly by Tfap2a and Tfap2e, promotes melanophore differentiation in parallel with Mitf by an effector other than Kit. This work illustrates how analysis of single-gene mutants may fail to identify steps in a GRN that are affected by the redundant activity of related proteins.",

From the analysis of patients carrying deletions and translocations involving the distal short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.3) we have identified a region of approximately 110 kb in which the OA1 gene must lie. We have extensively searched for genes in this region using a variety of techniques which included exon amplification, cDNA selection and direct hybridization of cosmid inserts to cDNA libraries. Putative exons identified by exon amplification were used to screen a human retina cDNA library and several cDNA clones corresponding to an approximately 7.5 kb transcript were isolated and characterized. Transcripts of this newly identified gene were found to be abundant in retina and melanoma and could also be detected in brain, placenta, lung, kidney and pancreas. Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed that this new gene encodes a 1616 amino acid protein sharing significant similarities with the Apical Protein from Xenopus laevis (APX) which is implicated in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity. The gene, termed APXL (APX-Like), spans approximately 160 kb, contains 10 exons and covers over 70% of the 110 kb critical region for OA1. A truncated pseudogene sharing very high levels of homology with the rat eIF-5 gene, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, was found to lie in the middle of intron 1. APXL was found deleted in two patients with contiguous gene syndromes including OA1 and in one patient with isolated OA1. Mapping, expression and patient analysis data led us to consider the APXL gene a strong candidate for the OA1 gene. DNA from 57 unrelated patients with OA1 was, therefore, scanned for mutations in the coding region, using both SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. No functionally significant mutation was identified, suggesting that APXL is not directly involved in OA1. Further studies are needed to clarify the physiologic role of this highly conserved gene.",

In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of the factors that regulate melanocyte development on the stem cells or the precursors of these non-cutaneous melanocytes. In general, a reduction in KIT receptor tyrosine kinase signaling leads to disordered melanocyte development. However, melanocytes in the eye, ear and harderian gland were revealed to be less sensitive to KIT signaling than cutaneous melanocytes. Instead, melanocytes in the eye and harderian gland were stimulated more effectively by endothelin 3 (ET3) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signals than by KIT signaling, and the precursors of these melanocytes expressed the lowest amount of KIT. The growth and differentiation of these non-cutaneous melanocytes were specifically inhibited by antagonists for ET3 and HGF. In transgenic mice induced to express ET3 or HGF in their skin and epithelial tissues from human cytokeratin 14 promoters, the survival and differentiation of non-cutaneous and dermal melanocytes, but not epidermal melanocytes, were enhanced, apparently irrespective of KIT signaling. These results provide a molecular basis for the clear discrimination between non-cutaneous or dermal melanocytes and epidermal melanocytes, a difference that might be important in the pathogenesis of melanocyte-related diseases and melanomas.",

BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 to constitute a RING heterodimer-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that also regulates similar cellular events, including cell-cycle control, transcription, chromatin modification and DNA damage response. Germline mutations in BRCA1 predispose individuals to breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal, pancreatic and prostate cancers, whereas BAP1 mutations combined with certain types of DNA damage provoke malignant mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Although BAP1 was initially discovered as a BRCA1-associated protein, recent mass-spectrometric screens of BAP1 interactors failed to detect BRCA1, raising questions about their presumed endogenous interaction. However, in addition to physical interaction, new evidence indicates a functional correlation between the two proteins. This review summarizes BAP1 function in histone modification and the DNA damage response, focusing on BAP1's relevance to BRCA1 function. An understanding of the cooperative functions between BRCA1 and BAP1 may uncover opportunities for new drug targets in a variety of related cancers. ",

It is also strongly expressed on platelets, among other cells, where it shows the property of mediating platelet activation and aggregation upon binding with mAbs. The primary structure has been elucidated by cloning the cDNA from a lambda gt11 expression vector library constructed with megakaryocytic mRNA. Monoclonal antibodies were used as probes with an APAAP amplification of the signal. The 5' region was further cloned in a lambda gt10 randomly primed cDNA library. The initiation codon was immediately followed by a sequence coding for the tetrapeptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence identified in a microsequencing procedure. Only one species of mRNA was found with an estimated size of 1.4 kilobase. CD9 antigen appears to be a 227-amino acid molecule with four hydrophobic domains and one N-glycosylation site. Sequence and structural comparisons showed extensive similarity of the CD9 antigen with a 237-amino acid molecule described previously as the human melanoma-associated antigen ME491 and a Schistosoma mansoni membrane protein of 218 amino acids.

However, therapy with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, is limited in practice due to adverse systemic effects. Spatially-restricted gene expression circumvents this problem by enabling localized amplification. Intracellular co-delivery of gold nanorods (AuNR) and a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter-driven expression vector enables gene expression in response to near infrared (NIR) light. AuNRs absorb the light, convert it into heat and thereby stimulate photothermal expression of the cytokine. As proof-of-concept, human HeLa and murine B16 cancer cells were transfected with a HSP70-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) plasmid and polyethylenimine (PEI)-conjugated AuNRs. Exposure to either 42 °C heat-shock or NIR light induced significant expression of the reporter gene. In vivo NIR driven expression of the reporter gene was confirmed at 6 and 24 h in mice bearing B16 melanoma tumors using in vivo imaging and flow-cytometric analysis. Overall, we demonstrate a novel opportunity for site-directed, heat-inducible expression of a gene based upon the NIR-absorbing properties of AuNRs and a HSP70 promoter-driven expression vector. ",

It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed. In this review, we aim to survey relevant research, the molecular mechanisms of signalling, including upstream activation and downstream effectors, and the role of mTOR in cancer, mainly in melanoma.",

Nevi and thin (< 1 mm) primary melanomas showed little expression of ligands except weak reactivity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and reactivity of TGF-betaR and c-kit.

The objective of the present work was to demonstrate intertumour heterogeneity under conditions of microenvironment-induced energy deprivation and to investigate whether the heterogeneity can be attributed to differences in the capacity of the tumour cells to generate energy in an oxygen-deficient microenvironment. Cultures of four human melanoma cell lines (BEX-c, COX-c, SAX-c, WIX-c) were exposed to hypoxia in vitro at pHe 7.4, 7.0 or 6.6 for times up to 31 h by using the steel-chamber method. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assess adenylate energy charge as a function of exposure time. Cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate release were determined by using standard enzymatic test kits. The adenylate energy charge decreased with time under hypoxia in all cell lines. The decrease was most pronounced shortly after the treatment had been initiated and then tapered off. BEX-c and SAX-c showed a significantly higher adenylate energy charge under hypoxic conditions than did COX-c and WIX-c whether the pHe was 7.4, 7.0 or 6.6, showing that tumours can differ in the ability to avoid energy deprivation during microenvironmental stress. There was no correlation between the adenylate energy charge and the rates of glucose uptake and lactate release. Intertumour heterogeneity in the ability to withstand energy deprivation in an oxygen-deficient microenvironment cannot therefore be attributed mainly to differences in the capacity of the tumour cells to generate energy by anaerobic metabolism. The data presented here suggest that the heterogeneity is rather caused by differences in the capacity of the tumour cells to reduce the rate of energy consumption when exposed to hypoxia.",

The association between miRNAs and clinico-pathological features were studied using univariate and multivariate analysis. miRNA-gene targets were predicted using Target-scan and MiRanda database. Significantly dys-regulated miRNAs were validated in FFPE UM (n = 86) and mRNAs were validated in frozen UM (n = 10) by qRT-PCR. Metastasis free-survival and miRNA expressions were analysed by Kaplen-Meier analysis in UM tissues (n = 52).;Unsupervised analysis revealed 585 differentially expressed miRNAs while supervised analysis demonstrated 82 miRNAs (FDR; Q = 0.0). Differential expression of 8 miRNAs: miR-214, miR-149*, miR-143, miR-146b, miR-199a, let7b, miR-1238 and miR-134 were studied. Gene target prediction revealed SMAD4, WISP1, HIPK1, HDAC8 and C-KIT as the post-transcriptional regulators of miR-146b, miR-199a, miR-1238 and miR-134. Five miRNAs (miR-214, miR146b, miR-143, miR-199a and miR-134) were found to be differentially expressed in M3/ D3 UM tumors. In UM patients with liver metastasis, miR-149* and miR-134 expressions were strongly correlated.;UM can be stratified using miRNAs from FFPE sections. miRNAs predicting liver metastasis and survival have been identified. Mechanistic linkage of de-regulated miRNA/mRNA expressions provide new insights on their role in UM progression and aggressiveness.",

Appearance at birth or later of a nodular or hyperpigmented area within a CMN simulates malignant melanoma and prompts biopsy. Although their clinical and pathologic features seem ominous, proliferative nodules (PNs) typically are benign and may regress, although atypical features cause greater concern. Here we report clinical and pathologic findings with outcome in 10 children who had multiple biopsies of large CMN with PNs. We reviewed 78 separate samples from the 10 patients and classified the 60 PNs according to published criteria. A subset of 30 samples containing both the CMN and a PNs was analyzed for immunohistochemical reactivity for melanocytic (S-100 protein, HMB45, melan-A), lymphocytic (CD45), cell-cycle/proliferative (Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc), apoptotic (p53, Bax, c-kit, CD95), and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) markers. Both CMN and PNs had similar expression of melanocytic, lymphocytic, and most cell-cycle/proliferative and apoptotic markers, including Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc, Bax, CD95, and bcl-2. A greater proportion of PNs than CMN were reactive for p53 (67% vs. 30%, P < 0.0098) and c-kit (97% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001). p53 and p21 expression in CMN and all types of PNs were inversely correlated. When ordinary and atypical PNs were compared, the atypical PNs more frequently expressed p53, Mib-1, Bax, and bcl-2, but less frequently expressed p21. The c-kit expression in nearly all PNs and its absence in nearly all CMN is potentially useful for recognition of PN, suggests a delayed melanocytic maturation process in proliferative nodules, and may be likely indicative of their benign nature. p53 reactivity in concert with a lack of p21 up-regulation by immunohistochemistry suggests that a p53 mutation may be present in PN, although the immunohistochemical findings alone cannot exclude possible overexpression of wild-type p53. Regressive, involutional, or maturational changes were observed in sequential samples from 4 patients. No patient developed malignant melanoma or another melanocytic nevus-associated malignancy during the follow-up period. These findings underscore the similarities between PNs and the underlying CMN and suggest that maturational, proliferative, and apoptotic processes are involved in their clinical evolution.",

It has activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR-alpha and -beta), and c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor. We have used a standardized ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay and immunohistochemistry to determine the cytotoxicity of imatinib mesylate in tumor-derived cells from cutaneous and uveal melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Imatinib mesylate was tested at concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 0.0625 micromol/l alone and in combination with a cytotoxic drug (cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel or treosulfan). Imatinib mesylate showed low inhibition (IndexSUM>300) across the range of concentrations tested in this study, with few tumors exhibiting increasing inhibition with increased drug concentration. The median IC90 values for cutaneous and uveal melanoma and ovarian carcinoma were 13.2 micromol/l (4.0-294.3 micromol/l), 12.0 micromol/l (2.0-285.4 micromol/l) and 7.71 micromol/l (6.51-11.02 micromol/l), respectively. Imatinib mesylate potentiated the effect of different cytotoxics in 9% (5/54) of cases and had a negative effect in 13% (7/54) of cases, with no effect in the remainder. No correlation of effect was noted with c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry. The signaling pathways mediated by activation of c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor may act as antiapoptotic survival signals in some cancers and inhibition of these pathways may potentiate the activity of some cytotoxic drugs by inhibiting the survival signal. Growth inhibition, however, may reduce the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs, which tend to target proliferating cells preferentially, and clinical effects are therefore difficult to predict.",

Complementary DNA's for topoisomerase IIalpha were cloned from both FEM-X and FVP3, the most resistant mutant. Deletion of nucleotides 1320-1322 (or Ala429 from the resulting topoisomerase IIalpha protein) was unique to the cDNA from the drug resistant cell line. Expression of the mutant mRNA increases in parallel with VP-16 resistance in this series of cell lines. Restriction analysis and Southern analysis with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes were used to quantify the ratio of wild-type to mutant topoisomerase IIalpha alleles present in DNA amplified by PCR from both FEM-X and the drug resistant sublines. This analysis shows that in cell lines of increasing drug resistance, the number of mutant topoisomerase IIalpha alleles increases incrementally along with a concomitant decrease in the number of wild-type alleles. By quantitative Southern analysis of genomic DNA the total number of topoisomerase IIalpha alleles in FVP3 is approximately 2-fold that in the parental cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome l7 paint reveals that amplification of the topoisomerase IIalpha locus in FVP3 correlates with an increase in the number of chromosome 17's, specifically the long arm. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrates that FEM-X contains three copies of chromosome 17, two of which are morphologically normal. During drug selection, FVP3 has gained 2-3 additional copies of the long arm of chromosome 17, the chromosomal location of the topoisomerase IIalpha locus. In this subline it is likely that three copies of the topoisomerase IIalpha gene are found on normal chromosome 17's and two on an isochromosome of the long arm of 17. By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, we were able to detect changes in the restriction pattern of the region of the long arm of chromosome 17 around the topoisomerase IIalpha locus that correlate with observed cytogenetic changes in FVP3. These results suggest that the acquisition of the mutant allele of topoisomerase IIalpha confers a selective advantage to cells in the presence of VP-16. As the drug concentration increased during the selection process, surviving sublines show preferential expression of the mutant topoisomerase IIalpha mRNA over that of the wild-type which is associated with a concomitant increase in the number of mutant topoisomerase IIalpha alleles.",

However, frequency of mutations varies among the reported studies, which might be due to presence of undetected gross rearrangements of BAP1 gene that might escape detection by sequencing strategy. We investigated the presence and frequency of gross genomic rearrangements in the BAP1 gene by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 17 Japanese cases of MM tumors. We found five tumors with partial deletion of BAP1 gene; each tumors displayed partial deletion of exons 1-4 (MM39), exons 1-5 (MM48), exons 11-17 (MM57), exons 1-15 (MM19) and exons 1-16 (MM21). Two tumors (MM34, MM14) had biallelic deletion and four tumors (MM29, MM35, MM45 and MM56) had monoallelic deletion of entire BAP1 gene. Therefore, MLPA analysis revealed large gene rearrangements of BAP1 gene in 65% of MM (11/17). Unusually high frequency of large deletions indicates that the 3p21 chromosomal region surrounding BAP1 gene is structurally unstable.

A novel approach to achieve this goal is the targeting of cytokines into the tumor microenvironment with antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, called immunocytokines. This report summarizes therapeutic efficacy and immune mechanisms involved in targeting IL-2 to syngeneic tumors and describes their extended use as a synergistic treatment modality for cancer vaccines and antiangiogenesis. Treatment of established melanoma and colon carcinoma metastases with IL-2 immunocytokines resulted in eradication of disease, followed by a vaccination effect protecting mice from lethal challenges with wild-type tumor cells. In a syngeneic neuroblastoma model, targeted IL-2 elicited effective antitumor responses mediated by NK cells in the absence of a T-cell memory. Interestingly, targeted IL-2 was effective in amplification of memory immune responses previously induced by cancer vaccines. Furthermore, a synergistic effect achieved by combining targeted IL-2-immunotherapy with an antiangiogenic inhibitor of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) extends the potential of this immunotherapeutic strategy in combination with antiangiogenesis as demonstrated in three syngeneic tumor models.

Monkey kidney COS-7 cells and human amelanotic and melanotic melanoma cells were then cotransfected by both HT and TRP-1 or transfected individually with each gene. The transfectants were examined for mRNA expression by reverse transcription-mediated RNA-PCR amplification. HT or TRP-1 mRNA was strongly expressed in HT or TRP-1 transfectants and cotransfectants of the two genes. Both light and electron microscopic observations indicated that degeneration and premature death of melanocytes occurred in HT transfectants, but not in TRP-1 transfectants or in HT and TRP-1 cotransfectants. Cotransfected cells from five cell lines revealed numerous granular reaction products with an anti-TRP-1 antibody and lysosomal granules with electron-dense material. Our melanin assay confirmed the new production of melanin pigments in these cells, indicating that the lysosomal granules would contain melanin pigments. The gene expression studies of lysosomal protein (beta-galactosidase, CD63, Lamp-1, and Lamp-2) revealed a dramatically elevated gene expression of Lamp-1, which is associated with the membrane receptor of lysosomal granules, in HT- and TRP-1-cotransfected cells. Conversely, the treatment of melanoma cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against Lamp-1 resulted in a decreased expression of TRP-1 protein by immunoprecipitation, supporting the observations of the HT and TRP-1 cotransfection study regarding the up-regulation of Lamp-1 expression. We conclude that HT, TRP-1, and Lamp-1 gene products may function together, being expressed as a multiprotein complex within the melanosomal compartment. Specifically, HT and TRP-1 may function together via Lamp-1 by stabilizing the enzyme-protein complex within the melanosome and prevent the premature death of melanocytes due to tyrosinase-mediated cytotoxicity.",

Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently observed in many types of cancer. Pathway activation can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gene amplification or rearrangement, loss of negative regulators, epigenetic alterations, and point mutations in key pathway components. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells, CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Moreover, combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with other targeted therapies may help overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance. Ongoing studies include combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancers, and with selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for tumors with alterations in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as melanoma. In particular, the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, such as palbociclib's recent first-line approval in combination with letrozole, is expected to transform the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219). Here we describe the current preclinical and clinical data for these novel agents and discuss combination strategies with other agents for the treatment of cancer. ",

Plasma- and serum-derived cfDNA samples from 221 advanced melanoma patients were analyzed for BRAF c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation using ARMS in two stages in a blinded fashion. cfDNA-specific mutation calling criteria were defined in stage 1 and validated in stage 2. cfDNA concentrations in serum and plasma, and the sensitivities and specificities of BRAF mutation detection in these two clinical matrices were compared. Sensitivity of BRAF c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation detection in cfDNA was increased by using mutation calling criteria optimized for cfDNA (these criteria were adjusted from those used for archival tumor biopsies) without compromising specificity. Sensitivity of BRAF mutation detection in serum was 44% (95% CI, 35% to 53%) and in plasma 52% (95% CI, 43% to 61%). Specificity was 96% (95% CI, 90% to 99%) in both matrices.

We found elevated MCT1 mRNA levels in fresh neuroblastoma biopsy samples that correlated positively with risk of fatal disease and amplification of the \"proto-oncogenic\" transcription factor MYCN. We further investigated MCT as a potential therapeutic target in vitro. The neuroblastoma cell lines evaluated were Sk-N-SH, CHP134, IMR32, and NGP. All lines exhibited decreased intracellular pH at low tumor-like extracellular pH. Lonidamine or exogenous lactate further lowered intracellular pH. Immediate early lowering of intracellular pH with lonidamine or lactate at extracellular pH 6.5 correlated positively with diminished cell viability within 48 h. These findings indicate that MCT1 is a potential therapeutic target and that neuroblastoma therapy may be enhanced by therapeutic strategies to inhibit or overwhelm MCT. Additional experiments indicated that the mechanism of cell death by lonidamine or exogenous lactate is similar to that obtained using alpha-cyano-4-OH-cinnamate, a well established MCT inhibitor. Because lactate production is also high in melanoma and many other tumor types, MCT inhibitors may have broad application in cancer treatment. Such treatment would have selectivity by virtue of the acidic milieu surrounding tumors, because MCT is increasingly active as extracellular pH decreases below 7.0 and lactic acid production increases.",

We evaluated photothermal (PT) scanning cytometry for color-coded imaging, spectral identification, and quantitative detection of individual nanoparticles and abnormal cells in histological samples with and without staining. Using this tool, individual carbon nanotubes, gold nanorods, and melanoma cells with intrinsic melanin markers were identified in unstained (e.g. sentinel lymph nodes) and conventionally-stained tissues. In addition, we introduced a spectral burning technique for histology through selective laser bleaching areas with nondesired absorption background and nanobubble-based PT signal amplification. The obtained data demonstrated the promise of PT cytometry in the analysis of low-absorption samples and mapping of various individual nanoparticles' distribution that would be impossible with existing assays. Comparison of PT cytometry and photoacoustic (PA) cytometry previously developed by us, revealed that these methods supplement each other with a sensitivity advantage (up to 10-fold) of contactless PT technique in assessment of thin (≤100 μm) histological samples, while PA imaging provides characterization of thicker samples which, however, requires an acoustic contact with transducers.

The most commonly detected virus was cloned, sequenced and designated as HPV197. Type-specific real-time PCR detected HPV197 in 34/91 specimens. For comparison, a pool of the same samples after general primer PCR amplification was also sequenced. This revealed 40 different HPVs, but only two HPV types were detected both with sequencing without prior PCR and with sequencing PCR amplicons, suggesting that sequencing without prior PCR gives a more unbiased representation of the HPVs present.

Two independent groups have reported genome-wide association studies identifying variants associated to an increased risk of melanoma. Tumor stem cells were found to have an increased frequency when compared to previously reported studies, and also a greater plasticity. The Merkel cell polyoma virus seems rather ubiquitous, since it has been evidenced, without clonal integration, in several other types of cutaneous tumors, and even in healthy skin, with an increased frequency in photo-exposed skin and in immunodepressed patients. A recent study demonstrates for the first time a link between the exposure to pesticides and the occurrence of lymphomas. Another study has evidenced the association between topical treatments with steroids and the occurrence of lymphomas, especially cutaneous lymphomas. The risk is increased with the length of treatment and the potency of steroids. Adjuvant treatment of high-risk melanomas with alpha interferon does not achieve better results with the adjunction of a 4 weeks high-dose induction period, and development of autoantibodies is not significantly associated to an increased relapse free survival after correction of the time related biais. In contrast, the effect of interferon on relapse free survival, distant metastasis free survival and overall survival seems better in the subgroup of melanoma with primary ulceration. The development of new specific inhibitors of c-kit or BRAF is a great hope for the targeted treatment of peculiar groups of advanced melanomas.

The antitumor activities in vitro of the fermentation broth extracts from the 145 test strains were detected in 6 human tumor cell lines (gastric cancer GXF251L, lung cancer LXFL529L, mammary cancer MAXF401NL, melanoma cancer MEXF462NL, renal cancer RXF486L and uterus cancer UXF1138L). Out of 145 test strains, 26 strains were positive in antitumor activities (17.9%), among them 19 strains belong to the genus Nocardiopsis, 7 strains belong to the genus Streptomyces. Then 8 antitumor-positive strains were submitted for 16S rRNA gene amplification and phylogenetic analysis after a comparison of antitumor activities, morphological, physiological characteristics and whole cell amino acids analysis. The results suggested that strain YIM 80139 is a member of a known Streptomyces species S. griseus, while strain YIM 80038 may represent a potential new Streptomyce species, and that the other 6 strains may represent 4 potential new species of the genus Nocardiopsis. The results presented above showed that actinomycetes isolated from saline and alkaline samples are important resources for bioactive compounds, and the abundant microbial diversity in the saline and alkaline environments in the Qinghai Province, Northwestern China is attractive for further investigation.",

However, the timing of the use of the tools available in the presented cases should be discussed. An algorithm of which time to use, which tool to detect the correct SN by preoperative ultrasound (US) in combination with an US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) will be proposed and demonstrated using five clinical examples. All examples prove the advantage of a combined strategy to track down the correct and involved SN. A sensitive US power mode, for the amplification of even the slightest changes in vascularization, is the most important tool in our diagnostic preoperative approach. First, reliable US criteria, as recently published must consequently be applied. Second, a FNAC should be performed early enough, even when only early signs are visible. Third, a swift overnight cytology before sentinel lymph node biopsy should be available. US is a method for the early detection of clinically nonevident metastases. Using the proposed algorithm when to perform which part of the multimodality approach, we demonstrated the enormous information out of additionally performed US. In the case of a suspicious US finding, we always perform a FNAC of the node. In the event of a negative finding, the SLND will take place as scheduled. In the case of a positive finding, the patient can directly undergo completion lymph node dissection.",

Patterns of specific and non-specific repetitive sequences change in many types and stages of tumor cells, characterized by band loss, gain, and (de) increased staining of pre-existing bands. In this work, repetitive DNA was studied in search of genome instability of skin cancers: basal and squamous cell carcinomas (BCC and SCC), malignant melanoma (MM), melanocytic nevus (MN), and actinic keratosis (AK) lesions. DNAs were extracted from blood and tumor samples from 21 BCC, 7 SCC, 11 MM and 7 lesions. Banding patterns were obtained by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and specific D9S50 and D9S52 microsatellites (9p21). D9S50 patterns revealed microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 36% BCC, 25% SCC, and 57% MM tumors. D9S52 microsatellite showed 28.5%; 42.8%; and 71.4% altered tumors, respectively. No microsatellite alterations were found in MN and AK. On the other hand, genomic rearrangements detected by RAPD were present in 100% tumors. In BCC, the mean number of tumor DNA alterations showed predominant gain of bands. On the contrary, MM samples presented loss, or decreased intensity signal of RAPD bands. Genome alterations in skin cancers would result from chromosomal rearrangements, aneuploidy and/or polysomies. The low-cost and quick RAPD technique may reveal unknown genes or DNA sequences associated with tumor development and progression, and may be easily implemented in clinical diagnosis.",

On the other hand, normal diploid cells respond to PALA by arresting in G1 and G2 of the cell cycle. It was previously suggested that growth control mechanisms might exist to prevent cells from entering S phase under toxic conditions and that genes involved in such mechanisms were mutated or deleted in tumor cells. Interestingly, the tumor suppressor gene p53, a putative G1 control gene, was shown to mediate PALA-induced growth arrest. However, growth arrest occurs in cells that lack wild-type p53, suggesting that other genes are involved as well. To identify these genes, we have generated whole cell hybrids between mouse melanoma and normal human fibroblast cells. At early passage, a whole cell hybrid (BHF12) responds to PALA with growth arrest, while at later passage, the same hybrid undergoes apoptosis. To determine which human chromosomes are required for the PALA-induced growth arrest phenotype, we isolated subclones of the hybrid and tested them for their PALA response. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification have been used to identify the human chromosome content of BHF12 and its subclones. Several human chromosomes, in addition to chromosome 17 (the location of p53), are consistently associated with the growth arrest phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

High telomerase activity was found in cancer cells, but not in differentiated homologous nonmalignant tissues. We demonstrated previously that the disappearance of telomerase activity is a reliable marker of tumor cell killing in human cancer cell lines. We have investigated the possibility of evaluating chemosensitivity of neoplastic cells of different origin [ovary, lung, breast, gastrointestinal, skin (melanoma)] obtained from cancer patients, by measuring residual telomerase activity after drug treatment in vitro. Using the classical telomeric repeat amplification protocol (\"TRAP\") assay based on polymerase chain reaction, we examined telomerase activity of untreated or drug-treated tumor cell suspensions, derived from the processing of surgical specimens. Feasibility and reproducibility of the assay were evaluated according to various parameters, including drug concentration, time of in vitro culture, and type of tumor. The results indicated that the assay is highly sensitive and reproducible, and can be performed using surgical specimens in a reasonable percentage of cases, ranging from 40% (breast cancer) to 100% (ovarian cancer). Moreover, the assay provides comparable results using a wide range of tumor cells, and the presence of normal cells does not interfere with the results. Prolonged tumor cell culture is not required because the assay can be completed within 24 to 72 hours after sample collection. In conclusion, the present investigation provides the technical bases for future studies to evaluate whether this assay would be able to predict patient's response to antitumor agents.",

(4) During ex vivo expansion, TILs undergo three stages of differentiation converting from TILs with high cytotoxic activity and relative resistance to combined EP2R/A(2A)R suppression (stage I) to TILs retaining high cytotoxicity and gaining sensitivity to combined suppression (stage II) and then to TILS that are less cytotoxic and very sensitive to combined suppression (stage III). (5) Finally, we find that pretreatment of TILs with non-inhibitory concentrations of EP2R agonists (such as PGE(2) or butaprost) or A(2A)R agonists (such as CADO or CGS21680) increases their cytotoxic activity and induces resistance to EP2R and A(2A)R inhibitory signaling (cross-resistance) due to homologous and heterologous desensitization and internalization of EP2Rs and A(2A)Rs, thus preventing their inhibitory signaling.

RNA extracted from serum of six healthy donors or from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of choroidal melanocytes from four uveal melanomas (epithelioid cells) and from three unaffected eyes were used as controls.;We identified the presence of 94 circulating small RNAs in the vitreous, some of which (miR-9, miR-9*, miR-125a-3p, miR-184, miR-211, miR-214, miR-302c, miR-452, miR-628, miR-639) are particularly abundant in the VH but downrepresented or not detectable in serum. MiR-146a and miR-26a were overexpressed more than threefold in VH from patients with uveal melanomas compared to the other pathological groups (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p value < 0.05).;Our experimental data suggest that a specific set of circulating miRNAs is secreted in the vitreous, which is quite different from the miRNA pattern in serum, and that the quantity of vitreal miRNAs could change, depending on the pathologies of the eye.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite progress in detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs), existing assays still have low sensitivity (1-10 CTC/mL) due to the small volume of blood samples (5-10 mL). Consequently, they can miss up to 103-104 CTCs, resulting in the development of barely treatable metastasis. Here we analyze a new concept of in vivo CTC detection with enhanced sensitivity (up to 102-103 times) by the examination of the entire blood volume in vivo (5 L in adults). We focus on in vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) of CTCs using label-free or targeted detection, photoswitchable nanoparticles with ultrasharp PA resonances, magnetic trapping with fiber-magnetic-PA probes, optical clearance, real-time spectral identification, nonlinear signal amplification, and the integration with PAFC in vitro. We demonstrate PAFC's capability to detect rare leukemia, squamous carcinoma, melanoma, and bulk and stem breast CTCs and its clusters in preclinical animal models in blood, lymph, bone, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the release of CTCs from primary tumors triggered by palpation, biopsy or surgery, increasing the risk of metastasis. CTC lifetime as a balance between intravasation and extravasation rates was in the range of 0.5-4 h depending on a CTC metastatic potential. We introduced theranostics of CTCs as an integration of nanobubble-enhanced PA diagnosis, photothermal therapy, and feedback through CTC counting. In vivo data were verified with in vitro PAFC demonstrating a higher sensitivity (1 CTC/40 mL) and throughput (up to 10 mL/min) than conventional assays. Further developments include detection of circulating cancer-associated microparticles, and super-rsesolution PAFC beyond the diffraction and spectral limits. ",

Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas.",

Here, FGF signaling network, cancer genetics/genomics of FGF receptors (FGFRs), and FGFR-targeted therapeutics will be reviewed. FGF signaling to RAS-MAPK branch and canonical WNT signaling cascade mutually regulate transcription programming. FGF signaling to PI3K-AKT branch and Hedgehog, Notch, TGFβ, and noncanonical WNT signaling cascades regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. Gene amplification of FGFR1 occurs in lung cancer and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and that of FGFR2 in diffuse-type gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Chromosomal translocation of FGFR1 occurs in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, as with FGFR3 in multiple myeloma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. FGFR1 and FGFR3 genes are fused to neighboring TACC1 and TACC3 genes, respectively, due to interstitial deletions in glioblastoma multiforme. Missense mutations of FGFR2 are found in endometrial uterine cancer and melanoma, and similar FGFR3 mutations in invasive bladder tumors, and FGFR4 mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. Dovitinib, Ki23057, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are orally bioavailable FGFR inhibitors, which have demonstrated striking effects in preclinical model experiments. Dovitinib, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are currently in clinical trial as anticancer drugs. Because there are multiple mechanisms of actions for FGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance, FGFR-targeted therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory cancer. Whole exome/transcriptome sequencing will be introduced to the clinical laboratory as the companion diagnostic platform facilitating patient selection for FGFR-targeted therapeutics in the era of personalized medicine.

While interventional studies have demonstrated great efficacy of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in inhibiting metastasis, no information is available on how tumor biology may be affected by congenital bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A. We therefore used a syngeneic model to study experimental metastasis and primary tumor growth in factor VIII (FVIII)-deficient mice. By conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and one-stage clotting assays, we demonstrated constitutive expression of TF mRNA, antigen, and procoagulant activity in the murine B16F10 melanoma cell line. In hemophilic mice, B16F10 lung metastasis was significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced by a single dose of human FVIII (100 U kg(-1)), suggesting that FVIII played a critical role during the early blood-borne phase of the metastatic cascade. In contrast, lung seeding was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by lepirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, suggesting that thrombin generation contributed to pulmonary metastasis even in the absence of FVIII. Consistent with this finding, intravenous injection of B16F10 cell-evoked laboratory changes of a hemolytic thrombotic microangiopathy and consumptive coagulopathy in both hemophilic and non-hemophilic mice. Subcutaneous implantation of B16F10 cells into mice with hemophilia A gave rise to primary tumors in an exponential growth pattern similar to that observed in non-hemophilic mice. Although TF expression by B16F10 cells may promote thrombin-dependent metastasis in mice with hemophilia A, amplification of coagulation by host FVIII appears to be necessary for maximum lung seeding.",

The products of the Cdc2L genes encode almost identical protein kinases, the PITSLRE kinases, which have functions that may be relevant to the regulation of transcription/splicing and apoptotic signaling. These genes are deleted/translocated in neuroblastomas with MYCN gene amplification, a subset of malignant melanomas, and in a newly delineated deletion syndrome. Here we report that the p36.3 region of human chromosome 1 consists of two identical genomic regions, each of which contain a Cdc2L gene linked to a metalloprotease (MMP) gene in a tail-to-tail configuration. This duplicated genomic region is also linked tightly to D1Z2, a genetic marker containing a highly polymorphic VNTR (variable number tandem repeat) consisting of an unusual 40-bp reiterated sequence. Thus, these genes and the polymorphic marker D1Z2 are organized as follows: telomere-D1Z2-5'-MMP22-3'-3'-Cdc2L2-5'-5'-Cdc2L1 -3'- 3'-MMP21-5'-centromere. Remarkably, the introns and exons of Cdc2L1 and Cdc2L2, as well as their flanking regions, are essentially identical. A total of 15 amino acid differences, 12 nonconservative and 3 conservative, can be found in the 773-786 amino acids specified by the various products of the Cdc2L genes. Two separate promoter/5' untranslated (UT) regions, CpG1 and CpG2, are identical to a reported previously methylated genomic CpG sequence and are used to express >20 different Cdc2L transcripts from the two genes. The expression of CpG2 transcripts from Cdc2L1 and Cdc2L2 is tissue/cell-line specific. CpG1 transcripts are expressed ubiquitously from both genes, with perhaps some bias towards the expression of CpG1 Cdc2L1 mRNAs in certain hematopoietic cells.",

We have designed a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) application to study homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A/ARF in 186 urinary bladder cancer patients.;Real-time QPCR, based on simultaneous amplification of ARF and a reference gene, GAPDH, was developed and evaluated in three melanoma cell lines with HDs at the CDKN2A/ARF locus (IGR-1, SK-MEL-5, and WM-266-4). In addition, loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D9S942, D9S1748, and D12S99 markers. Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications.

The hypothesis is supported by data from the literature reporting that both PEComas and GISTs, as well as telocytes, share the expression of several markers. These data were supplemented by original immunohistochemical tests on selected series. Specifically: (1) Melanoma markers (Melan A, MiTF) typical of PEComas are expressed by a substantial fraction of GISTs. A fraction of GISTs was also found positive for CD63, a tetraspanin protein originally described in melanomas and marking exosomes. (2) c-KIT (CD117), proper of the vast majority of GISTs, can be expressed by PEComas (as well as by telocytes). (3) Markers described in telocytes (CD34, S-100, smooth muscle actin and vascular endothelial growth factor) have been reported as positive in cases of PEComas and GISTs. Telocytes show distinctive ultrastructural features with thin, extended, telopodes and are likely involved in inter-cellular signalling via paracrine secretion as well as by shed vesicles and exosomes. These cells have been described in many locations (cavitary and non-cavitary organs) and might display potentialities of a wide spectrum of differentiation (and function). In conclusion we propose that telocytes could be the common cells of origin for both PEComas and GISTs.",

Search for new biological markers is important for diagnosis and prognosis in eye tumors. Cystatin C, an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, plays an important protective role in several tumors. Lactoferrin was shown to express anti-tumor and antiviral activities. It was hypothesized that cystatin C and lactoferrin could serve as possible biomarkers in the diagnosis of malignant and benign eye tumors.;A total of 54 patients with choroidal melanoma and benign eye tumors were examined (part of them undergoing surgical treatment). Serum, tear fluid and intraocular fluid samples obtained from the anterior chamber of eyes in patients with choroidal melanoma were studied.;Cystatin C concentration in serum and eye biological fluids was measured by commercial ELISA kits for human (BioVendor, Czechia); lactoferrin concentration--by Lactoferrin-strip D 4106 ELISA test systems (Vector-BEST, Novosibirsk Region, Russia).;Cystatin C concentration in serum of healthy persons was significantly higher as compared to tear and intraocular fluids. In patients with choroidal melanoma, increased cystatin C concentration was similar in tear fluid of both the eyes. Lactoferrin level in tear fluid of healthy persons was significantly higher than its serum level. Significantly increased lactoferrin concentration in tear fluid was noted in patients with benign and malignant eye tumors.;Increased level of cystatin C in tear fluid seems to be a possible diagnostic factor in the eye tumors studied. However, it does not allow us to differentiate between malignant and benign eye tumors. Similar changes were noted for lactoferrin in tear fluid.",

To date, expression of human IL-10 has been attributed primarily to helper T lymphocytes, activated monocytes, and neoplastic B cells, and was often found to be associated with IL-6 expression. In this study we sought to determine whether non-hematopoietic human tumor cell lines produce IL-10 and, if so, what is the relationship between IL-10 and IL-6. Using ELISA, we determined IL-10 and IL-6 levels in culture supernatants of 48 cell lines established from carcinomas of the kidney, colon, breast and pancreas, malignant melanomas and neuroblastomas. IL-6 protein was secreted by 28 of the tumor cell lines; IL-10 was measurable in 15 cell lines. IL-6 secretion was maximal and most frequent in renal-cancer cell lines, while IL-10 production was found to be highest and most common among cell lines derived from colon carcinomas. IL-10 in conditioned medium of one of the colon carcinoma cell lines (CCL222) was bio-active, as demonstrated in the mouse MC/9 mast-cell-line assay and in human mixed-lymphocyte reactions. In both assays, IL-10 bio-activity was neutralized by an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody. Expression of IL-6 and IL-10 was confirmed by RNA analysis using message amplification by PCR and sequencing of amplified cDNA. LPS, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha strongly enhanced the release of IL-6 by RCC cells, but only marginally affected IL-10 production in colon-carcinoma cells. IL-10 secretion by colon-carcinoma cells was moderately stimulated by IFN-gamma and IL-4. Dexamethasone suppressed the release of IL-6, but had no inhibitory effect on IL-10 secretion. Our results demonstrate that tumor cell lines established from certain types of human carcinomas are capable of expressing and releasing IL-6 and/or IL-10, suggesting a role of these cytokines in solid-tumor development and anti-tumor immunity.",

Several categories of cancer-associated antigens have been described as targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro and in vivo: \"cancer-testis\" (CT) antigens expressed in different tumors and normal testis, melanocyte differentiation antigens, point mutations of normal genes, antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and viral antigens. Clinical studies using peptides derived from these antigens have been initiated to induce specific CTL responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of peptide-specific reactions have been defined, i.e., induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), CTL, autoimmune, and tumor regression responses. Preliminary results demonstrate that tumor-associated peptides alone elicit specific DTH and CTL responses leading to tumor regression after intradermal injection. GM-CSF was proved to be effective in enhancing peptide-specific immune reactions by amplification of dermal peptide-presenting dendritic cells. Long-lasting complete tumor regressions have been observed after induction of CTLs by peptide immunization. However, in a few cases where there was disease progression after initial tumor response, loss of either the tumor antigen targeted by CTLs or of the presenting MHC class I molecule was detected as the mechanism of immune escape under immunization in vivo. Based on these observations, cytokines to enhance antigen and MHC class I expression in vivo are being evaluated to prevent immunoselection. Recently, a strategy utilizing spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX) has led to the identification of a new CT antigen, NY-ESO-1. In a melanoma patient with high titer antibody against NY-ESO-1, strong HLA-A2-restricted CTL reactivity against the same antigen was also found. Clinical studies involving tumor antigens that induce both antibody and CTL responses will show whether these are better candidates for immunotherapy of cancer.",

EGFR over-expression is frequently associated with gene mutation or amplification, thereby constituting a major target for molecular therapies. Recently, a new generation of EGFR inhibitors has been developed with pan-HER properties and irreversible actions. Allitinib® (AST1306) is an orally active, highly selective irreversible inhibitor of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases with promising efficacies. In the present study we aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of allitinib in a large panel of human cancer-derived cell lines and to correlate its efficacy to the mutational status of the EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA and PTEN genes. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the functional role of KRAS mutations in the response to this new inhibitor.;In total 76 different cancer-derived cell lines, representing 11 distinct histological types, were analyzed and classified into three groups: highly sensitive (HS), moderately sensitive (MS) and resistant (R). We found that 28 (36.8 %) cancer-derived cell lines exhibited a HS phenotype, 19 (25.0 %) a MS phenotype and 29 (38.1 %) a R phenotype. Allitinib showed a stronger cytotoxicity in head and neck, esophageal, melanoma and lung cancer-derived cell lines. We found that KRAS mutations were significantly associated with the R phenotype. To substantiate these results, an allitinib-sensitive lung cancer-derived cell line (H292) was transfected with plasmids carrying the two most common activating KRAS mutations (p.G12D and p.G12S). We found that both mutations reverted the allitinib-sensitive phenotype in these cells.;The current study represents the largest in vitro assessment of allitinib cytotoxicity performed to date. Through this study, we identified cancer types that could potentially benefit from this drug. Additionally, our findings suggest that prevalent KRAS mutations constitute potential predictive biomarkers for allitinib response.",

Therefore, detection of promoter hypermethylation is becoming important for diagnosis, prognosis, and aiding the design of cancer therapies. We describe a novel isothermal method for the detection of DNA hypermethylation.;Methylation-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MS-LAMP) is a novel adaptation of LAMP. MS-LAMP was used for the highly specific detection of hypermethylated CpGs in the promoters of the CDKN2A [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4)], GATA5 (GATA binding protein 5), and DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1) genes. The reactions occurred under isothermal conditions with 3 primer sets specific for methylated promoters. Both turbidimetry and fluorescence were used for detection. The MS-LAMP assay was validated with bisulfite-treated plasmid and genomic DNA controls of known methylation status and was applied to detect hypermethylation in 18 clinical tumor samples. A multiplex MS-LAMP for CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1 was also validated with the aid of synthetic positive and negative controls.;The MS-LAMP assay showed high specificity with plasmid and genomic DNA targets in reactions carried out in <1 h. The assay had a detection limit of approximately 30 copies of methylated target sequence and a selectivity of 0.5% methylated DNA in a mixture with unmethylated DNA. Compared with methylation-specific PCR, the MS-LAMP assay detected lower rates of methylation in lung adenocarcinoma samples. Simultaneous multiplex detection of hypermethylation in the 3 targets (CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1) was readily achieved with the MS-LAMP assay in both the turbidimetric and fluorescence detection formats.;MS-LAMP provides a highly specific isothermal method for methylation detection and is well suited for multiplex approaches.",

In addition to UV-induced C3H mouse skin tumors, we also analyzed skin tumors induced in the same strain of mice by other carcinogenic agents such as 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA, angelicin + UVA, dimethylbenz-[a]anthracene + UV + croton oil, and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. We found that 4 of 20 UV-induced skin tumors contained either C----A or A----G base substitutions at N-ras codon 61. In addition, 2 of 5 melanomas possessed a G----A transition in N-ras codon 13 and an A----T transversion in N-ras codon 61, respectively. Interestingly, none of the 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA- or angelicin + UVA-induced tumors we analyzed contained mutations in any of the ras genes. However, 1 of 4 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-induced tumors exhibited a G----T transversion at Ki-ras codon 12, a potential site for formation of a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide adduct with a guanine residue. We also found that 2 nonmelanoma tumors induced by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene + UV + croton oil contained an A----T transversion at Ha-ras codon 61 position 2, which is characteristic of most dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced tumors. These results suggest that UV-induced C3H mouse tumors display mutations preferentially in the N-ras oncogene. Since most N-ras mutations in UV-induced tumors occurred opposite dipyrimidine sequences (T-T or C-C), one can infer that these sites are the targets for UV-induced mutation and transformation.",

This confirms that, as in the case of chicken, TN is mainly made up of three groups of sequences with a high homology to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) fibronectin (FN) type III repeat and fibrinogen. Furthermore, we have determined the amino-terminal sequence of the mature peptide directly on purified TN. The main differences with respect to the chicken TN molecule are that in the human there are 14 and half EGF-like repeats compared to 13 and half in the chicken and that, as previously reported, there are 15 FN-like repeats compared to 11 in the chicken. By Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification we have also studied the different splicing patterns of the TN pre-mRNA in cultured cells. The results show the presence of at least four different isoforms containing different numbers of FN-like type III repeats. Using purified human TN as immunogen, we have obtained numerous monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to TN. By screening a human melanoma cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11 with these Mabs and subsequently sequencing the insert of the positive clones, we have been able to localize, within the TN molecule, the epitopes recognized by two of these Mabs: BC-4, which recognizes an epitope within the EGF-like sequence and BC-2 which recognizes an epitope within the FN like type III repeats whose expression is regulated by alternative splicing of the TN pre-mRNA. Thus, while the Mab BC-4 may be useful in studies on TN distribution (since it recognizes all different TN isoforms) BC-2 may be useful in the study of the expression of particular TN isoforms generated by the alternative splicing of the TN primary transcript.",

In this project we have elucidated the organization of the mouse ATPase II gene and identified its promoter. Located within chromosome 5, this gene spans about 224 kb and consists of 38 exons, three of which are alternatively spliced (exons 7, 8 and 16), giving rise to two transcript variants. Translation of these transcripts results in two ATPase II isoforms (1 and 2) composed of 1164 and 1149 amino acids, respectively. Using RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) we identified multiple transcription start sites (TSS) in messages obtained from heart, lung, liver, and spleen. The mouse ATPase II promoter is TATA-less and lacks a consensus initiator sequence. Luciferase reporter analysis of full and core promoters revealed strong activity and little cell type specificity, possibly because more flanking, regulatory sequences are required to cause such tissue specificity. In the neuronal HN2, N18, SN48 cells and the NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, but not in the B16F10 melanoma cells, the core promoter (-318/+193 with respect to the most common TSS) displayed significantly higher activity than the full promoter (-1026/+193). Serial 5' deletion of the core promoter revealed significant cell type-specific activity of the fragments, suggesting differential expression and use of transcription factors in the five cell lines tested. Additionally distribution of the TSS was organ specific. Such observations suggest tissue-specific differences in transcription initiation complex assembly and regulation of ATPase II gene expression. Information presented here form the groundwork for further studies on the expression of this gene in apoptotic cells.",

This method was designed to amplify three products in a single reaction tube: a 200 bp common product serving as an amplification control, a 144 bp BRAF V600E specific product, and a 97 bp wild-type (wt) specific product. The sensitivity of this method was determined to be as low as 0.5% for the BRAF V600E allele in a wild-type background. This method was successfully validated in 72 thyroid tumors. It detected V600E mutation in 22 out of 33 (67%) of the conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 8 out of 12 (75%) of the tall-cell variant of PTC, whereas none of the 10 follicular variant of PTC showed BRAF V600E mutation. In addition, none of the 14 follicular adenomas and 3 follicular carcinomas had BRAF V600E mutation.

These novel targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the management of advanced refractory cancer. The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. In this review, the role of Raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an overview is given of Raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate (BAY 43-9006 or sorafenib). Sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed that targets Raf kinases (Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and b-raf V600E), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-beta) or tumor progression (Flt-3, c-kit).

Mast cells are abundant surrounding solid tumors where they are often protumorigenic and enhance tumor angiogenesis. However, antitumor roles for mast cells have also been documented. The impact of mast cells may be dependent on their activation status and mediator release in different tumors. Using an orthotopic melanoma model in wild-type C57BL/6 and mast cell-deficient Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice and a complementary Matrigel-tumor model in C57BL/6 mice, mast cells were shown to be crucial for TLR2 agonist (Pam(3)CSK(4))-induced tumor inhibition. Activation of TLR2 on mast cells reversed their well-documented protumorigenic role. Tumor growth inhibition after peritumoral administration of Pam(3)CSK(4) was restored in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice by local reconstitution with wild-type, but not TLR2-deficient, mast cells. Mast cells secrete multiple mediators after Pam(3)CSK(4) activation, and in vivo mast cell reconstitution studies also revealed that tumor growth inhibition required mast cell-derived IL-6, but not TNF. Mast cell-mediated anticancer properties were multifaceted. Direct antitumor effects in vitro and decreased angiogenesis and recruitment of NK and T cells in vivo were observed. TLR2-activated mast cells also inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells in vivo. Unlike other immune cells, mast cells are relatively radioresistant making them attractive candidates for combined treatment modalities. This study has important implications for the design of immunotherapeutic strategies and reveals, to our knowledge, a novel mechanism of action for TLR2 agonists in vivo.",

A large number of new entities, especially in soft tissue tumors, have been published over the past years, including nodular mesothelial hyperplasia, which is a tumor-like lesion derived from peritoneal macrophages; infantile myofibromatosis, which can mimic leiomyosarcoma; intermediate grade fibrohistiocytic tumors, like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-related giant-cell fibroblastoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor and angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma displaying evidence of myogeneous differentiation; finally, the high-grade intraabdominal desmoplastic small cell tumor. With modern methods we can gain better insights into the biology of tumors. For example, tumors of the Ewing's sarcoma family have in common a characteristic t(11; 22) chromosomal translocation, the Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) (22q12) gene rearrangement, and the MIC2 gene. The EWS gene rearrangement is not restricted to tumors of the Ewing's sarcoma family (classic Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor), however, but occurs in malignant melanoma of the soft tissue and in intraabdominal desmoplastic small cell tumor. Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) can be divided into two basic types with different prognoses: embryonal RMS, including botryoid and spindle-cell variants, and alveolar RMS, including the solid variant. The prognosis of alveolar RMS is poorer than that of classic embryonal RMS, mainly due to early tumor dissemination in alveolar RMS. The prognosis of neuroblastoma is mainly based on chromosomal and molecular biologic findings. Structural chromosome 1 abnormalities, double minute chromosomes, homogeneously staining regions, N-myc amplifications, and DNA diploidy are indications for an unfavorable outcome. Despite progress in childhood solid tumor pathology, many questions remain open, including those relating to basic chromosomal defects in germ cell tumors and the obscure nature of tumor heterogeneity.",

Several categories of cancer-associated antigens have been described as targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro and in vivo: (1) 'Cancer-Testis' (CT) antigens expressed in different tumors and normal testis, (2) melanocyte differentiation antigens, (3) point mutations of normal genes, (4) antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and (5) viral antigens. Clinical studies with peptides derived from these antigens have been initiated to induce specific CTL responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of peptide-specific reactions have been defined, i.e. induction of DTH-, CTL-, autoimmune-, and tumor-regression responses. Preliminary results demonstrate that tumor-associated peptides alone elicit specific DTH- and CTL-responses leading to tumor regression after intradermal injection. GM-CSF was proven effective to enhance peptide-specific immune reactions by amplification of dermal peptide-presenting dendritic cells. Long lasting complete tumor regressions have been observed after induction of CTL by peptide immunization. Based on these results, active immunotherapy with tumor-associated antigens may be a promising approach for patients with minimal residual disease, who are at high risk for tumor recurrence. However, in single cases with disease progression after an initial tumor response either a loss of the respective tumor antigen targeted by CTL or of the presenting MHC class I molecule was detected as mechanisms of immune escape under immunization in vivo. Based on these observations, cytokines to enhance antigen- and MHC-class I expression in vivo are being evaluated to prevent immunoselection. Recently, a strategy utilizing spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX) has led to the identification of a new CT antigen, NY-ESO-1. In a melanoma patient with high titer antibody against NY-ESO-1 also a strong HLA-A2 restricted CTL reactivity against the same antigen was found. Clinical studies involving tumor antigens that induce both antibody- and CTL-responses will show whether these are better candidates for immunotherapy of cancer.",

We investigated the mechanisms for this differential type I IFN production in cells infected with representative MV strains. The overexpression of the wild-type V protein suppressed melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-induced IFN-β promoter activity, while this was not seen in A549 cells expressing CD150 transfected with the V protein of the vaccine strain. The V proteins of the wild-type also suppressed poly I:C-induced IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) dimerization. The V proteins of the wild-type and vaccine strain did not affect retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)- or toll-IL-1R homology domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1)-induced IFN-β promoter activation. We identified an amino acid substitution of the cysteine residue at position 272 (which is conserved among paramyxoviruses) to an arginine residue in the V protein of the vaccine strain. Only the V protein possessing the 272C residue binds to MDA5. The mutation introduced into the wild-type V protein (C272R) was unable to suppress MDA5-induced IRF-3 nuclear translocation and IFN-β promoter activation as seen in the V proteins of the vaccine strain, whereas the mutation introduced in the vaccine strain V protein (R272C) was able to inhibit MDA5-induced IRF-3 and IFN-β promoter activation. The other 6 residues of the vaccine strain V sequence inconsistent with the authentic sequence of the wild-type V protein barely affected the IRF-3 nuclear translocation. These data suggested that the structural difference of laboratory-adapted [corrected] MV V protein hampers MDA5 blockade and acts as a nidus for the spread/amplification of type I IFN induction. Ultimately, measles vaccine strains have two modes of IFN-β-induction for their attenuation: V protein mutation and production of defective interference (DI) RNA.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) represent a promising new modality for the treatment of cancer. A key contribution in this regard was the introduction of tumor-selective viral replication for amplification of the initial inoculum. Specifically, following cellular infection, the virus replicates selectively in the infected tumor cells and kills the cells by cytolysis. Next, the progeny virions infect surrounding target cells, replicate and eradicate the infected tumor cells, leaving normal cells unaffected. However, to date there have been two limitations to clinical application of these CRAd agents; i.e., both infectivity and tumor specificity are poor. Survivin protein is a novel member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, which plays an important role in the survival of cancer cells and progression of malignancies. Previous data have shown the survivin promoter has high activities in multiple cancer cells with a low activity in mouse liver. In this study, we propose an improved CRAd agent to circumvent the obstacles. We constructed a novel CRAd agent, CRAd-Survivin-RGD, which contains both the survivin promoter (either the short version, S-S, or the long version, S-L) to selectively drive E1 gene expression in tumor cells and a capsid modification and RGD4C to specifically enhance the tumor infectivity of CRAd agents. Both CRAd agents (S-S and S-L) showed high replication rates in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-361, and low promoter activity in both normal mouse and human liver, thus signifying the CRAd agents have the phenotype of 'tumor on/liver off'. In cytocidal experiments, the CRAd agents demonstrated a high cytocidal effect on multiple cancer cell lines, including the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231; the glioma cell line, D65, the melanoma cell line, MEL-28; and mesothelioma, Meso2374. The results also showed the tumor growth was dramatically inhibited by intertumoral administration of the CRAd agents in a breast cancer (MDA-MB-361) xenograft animal model. These data clearly demonstrate that CRAd-Survivin-RGD is a potential novel therapeutic agent for treatment in many, but not all, human cancers.",

Survivin, another protein involved in angiogenesis, is strongly expressed in most human cancers, where it promotes tumor survival by reducing apoptosis as well as favoring endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The mechanisms by which cancer cells induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis upon survivin up-regulation remain to be fully established. Since the PI3K/Akt signalling and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef dependent transcription have been implicated in the expression of many cancer-related genes, including survivin and VEGF, we evaluated whether survivin may favor VEGF expression, release from tumor cells and induction of angiogenesis in a PI3K/Akt-β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence linking survivin expression in tumor cells to increased β-catenin protein levels, β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and expression of several target genes of this pathway, including survivin and VEGF, which accumulates in the culture medium. Alternatively, survivin downregulation reduced β-catenin protein levels and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Also, using inhibitors of PI3K and the expression of dominant negative Akt, we show that survivin acts upstream in an amplification loop to promote VEGF expression. Moreover, survivin knock-down in B16F10 murine melanoma cells diminished the number of blood vessels and reduced VEGF expression in tumors formed in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, in the chick chorioallantoid membrane assay, survivin expression in tumor cells enhanced VEGF liberation and blood vessel formation. Importantly, the presence of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies precluded survivin-enhanced angiogenesis in this assay. These findings provide evidence for the existance of a posititve feedback loop connecting survivin expression in tumor cells to PI3K/Akt enhanced β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription followed by secretion of VEGF and angiogenesis.

Because of the requirement of high cell amounts for the generation of cartilage implants or for the extensive experimental studies to investigate the culture parameters, the initial cells have to be expanded, which leads to high population doubling numbers. It is known that hMSC can differentiate into chondrocytes at least up to the 15th population doubling. To monitor the differentiation status, the protein MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity), which is only synthesized by malignant melanomas and chondrocytes, can be used. In this study the chondrogenic differentiation potential of hMSC beyond the 15th population doubling was investigated using MIA as a chondrocyte marker. A chondrogenic potential of hMSC at higher population doubling numbers may be of interest due to the requirement of less frequent isolations of cells. Therefore hMSC were cultured in a monolayer until the 37th population doubling. Cells of different passages were cultured as pellets for two weeks in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta3 containing differentiation medium. The MIA contents in medium on the last three cultivation days were measured for each case using an MIA-ELISA-kit. A significant difference between MIA content in medium of the pellet and nonstimulated monolayer reference cultures was detectable until the 32nd population doubling. In addition, the hMSC were seeded at lower densities to investigate whether the cells may be expanded faster and with less amount of work due to higher population doubling numbers per passage. The reduced inoculation density led to an increased growth rate.",

The approach used by the Partners in Health Sciences program at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science is to both \"train\" and, importantly, \"equip\" classroom teachers and school nurses in a \"Healthy Skin\" professional development curriculum. Each participant not only received face-to-face interactive content training in a workshop setting that lasted 6 h; each also received a resource kit of supplies, materials, and equipment used in the workshop and designed for the trainee to use with students in a classroom/school setting. This single \"hit\" professional development event then can be replicated by each trainee annually for the span of her/his teaching/school-nursing career. A total of 588 trainees participated in \"Healthy Skin\" workshops that were held in 17 communities throughout the state. Participants attended from 188 different towns/cities. Of those in attendance, 511 (87 %) were females, 77 (13 %) males, 81 % Caucasian, 16 % African Americans, and the remaining 3 % self-identified as \"other\". There were 471 teachers, 85 nurses, and 32 \"others\" (administrators, school counselors). Trainees completed anonymous pre/post test measures with an increase in knowledge of 28.5 %. A short-term evaluation was conducted at the end of the workshop. After a minimum of 6 months had elapsed, a long-term evaluation was used to capture data on how the workshop experience transferred into new curricular/learning activities for the students of the workshop participants. There was a high level of satisfaction with the workshop experience and use of workshop content and resource kits. Our experiences in this type of professional development outreach provide a model of how institutions of higher education could contribute to the professional development of K-12 teachers and their students in any content area.",

Heparanase activity has been detected by means of UV absorption, radiolabeled substrates, electrophoretic migration, and heparan sulfate affinity assays. However, those methods have proven to be somewhat problematic with regards to application to actual biological samples, the accessibility of the immobilized substrates, experimental sensitivity, and the separation of degraded products. Rather than focusing on heparanase activity, then, we have developed a rapid, alternative colorimetric heparinase assay, on the basis of the recent finding that sulfated disaccharides generated from heparin by bacterial heparinase exhibit biological properties comparable to those from heparan sulfate by mammalian heparanase. In this study, the concentrations of porcine heparin and bacterial heparinase I were determined using a Sigma Diagnostics Kit. Morus alba was selected as a candidate through this assay system, and an inhibitor, resveratrol, was purified from its methanol extract. Its anti-metastatic effects on the pulmonary metastasis of murine B16 melanoma cells were also evaluated. Our findings suggest that this assay may prove useful as a diagnostic tool for heparinase inhibition, as an alternative anti-metastatic target.",

Among these, the microplate adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) has gained particular merits for ex vivo chemosensitivity testing of native nonhematological tumors including cancers of the breast, ovary, gastrointestinal tract, cervix and corpus uteri, and lung; malignant melanomas; gliomas; sarcomas; and mesotheliomas. For this indication, the ATP-TCA can now be considered the best documented and validated technology. This assay, which is now commercially available, provides a highly reproducible, easy-to-handle kit technique; low technical failure rates; and a high methodological efficacy requiring only 1 x 106 tumor cells to test four to six different drugs or combinations. In ovarian and breast carcinomas, the predictive accuracy is > 90%, with a positive predictive value of 85-90% and a negative predictive value near 100%, respectively. In primary ovarian cancers, the ATP-TCA has been found to accurately predict both clinical response and survival. In two prospective clinical trials in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, chemotherapy individually selected by the ATP-TCA has been found to triple the response rates and nearly double the survival compared to empirically chosen regimens. Consequently, this assay, which is now under phase III evaluation, has successfully been used in new agent development to screen for novel chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of patients with breast and ovarian carcinoma and melanoma, respectively. This chapter highlights the recent preclinical and clinical experience with this promising technology and gives a detailed description of all the technical aspects of the ATP-TCA.",

Triptolide, a major active component isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii, has been proven to possess multiple antitumor activities. Here, we investigated the effect of triptolide on regulatory T cells and on the level of IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-bearing mice. Fifty male C57BL/6 mice were randomly grouped as follows: normal control group, model group with B16-F10 cells implanted, and three treatment groups with cyclophosphamide, triptolide-high dose, triptolide-low dose. The proportion of regulatory T cells in the spleen and axillary lymph nodes was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. Production of cytokines IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor in serum was measured using enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay kits. The mRNA levels of Foxp3, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-β in the spleen and vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor tissue were detected by real-time PCR. The results showed that triptolide significantly decreased the proportion of regulatory T cells and lowered the Foxp3 level in the spleen and axillary lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice. Production of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β in peripheral blood, and the mRNA level of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β in the spleen were also decreased. Additionally, triptolide could remarkably inhibit production of vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that triptolide might inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting regulatory T cells and some cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β, as well as production of vascular endothelial growth factor.

Further, among such metastatic tumors, the metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the stomach is an extremely rare disease, and it is usually reported in autopsy series. We report a rare case of metastatic gastric tumor derived from right renal carcinoma. Gastric endoscopy confirmed a large, polypoid, friable mass (type 1 tumor, about 7 cm in diameter) in the middle part of the stomach body. The mass was surgically excised and pathological examination showed that the gastric tumor was derived from a metastasis from the right kidney, because it was composed of malignant cells that were identical to those from the removed RCC. In addition, the tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD10, CD15, Ecadherin, early membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin, but no reactivity was observed for cytokeratins 7 and 20 or c-KIT.

Twelve of the studied compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity, with selectivity against K562 but not the remaining two cancer cell lines. Four compounds were not active in cytotoxicity assays, presumably due to high predicted lipophilicity and low solubility. To rationalize the observed cytotoxic effects, structure-based virtual screening was carried out against a pool of potential targets constructed using the inverse docking program Tarfisdock and bibliographical references. The putative targets were identified on the basis of the best correlation between docking scores and in vitro cytotoxicity. It is proposed that the mechanism of action of the studied aminopyridines involves the disruption of signaling pathways and cancer cell cycle through the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and several tyrosine kinases, namely Bcr-Abl kinase and KIT receptor kinase. The obtained results can guide further structural modifications of the studied compounds aimed at developing selective agents targeting proteins involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation.",

Histologically, the tumor was rich in vasculature and exclusively composed of perivascular epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor expressed diffusely a melanocyte marker, human melanoma black-45, and focally a myogenic marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin, but not an epithelial marker, AE1/AE3. Fontana-Masson-positive melanin pigments were present and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (CD117), involved in the development of melanocytes but not myogenic cells, was expressed in tumor cells. These findings indicate that the tumor is PEComa with some differentiation into melanocytes. Notably, owing to the unique location of the occurrence, the tumor occupied bone marrow tissues of the rib, resulting that the tumor has the potential for hematogenous metastasis.

The lamella terminates in ruffling lamellipodia that face the direction of migration. Although the role of actin in the formation of lamellipodia is well established, it remains unclear to what degree microtubules contribute to this process. Herein, we have studied the contribution of microtubules to cell motility by time-lapse video microscopy on green flourescence protein-actin- and tubulin-green fluorescence protein-transfected melanoma cells. Treatment of cells with either the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole or with the stabilizing agent taxol showed decreased ruffling and lamellipodium formation. However, this was not due to an intrinsic inability to form ruffles and lamellipodia because both were restored by stimulation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in a Rac-dependent manner, and by stem cell factor in melanoblasts expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit. Although ruffling and lamellipodia were formed without microtubules, the microtubular network was needed for advancement of the cell body and the subsequent retraction of the tail. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the formation of lamellipodia can occur via actin polymerization independently of microtubules, but that microtubules are required for cell migration, tail retraction, and modulation of cell adhesion.",

A comparison of tissue sources, including periodontal ligament (PDL) versus pulp (P), could provide critical information to select an appropriate MSC population for designing predictable regenerative therapies. The purpose of this study is to compare the proliferation and stemness and the MSC-specific and mineralized tissue-specific gene expression of P-MSCs and PDL-MSCs.;MSCs were obtained from PDL and P tissue of premolars (n = 3) extracted for orthodontic reasons. MSC proliferation was evaluated using a real-time cell analyzer for 160 hours. Telomerase activity was evaluated by a telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total RNA was isolated from the MSCs on day 3. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to compare the expression of MSC-specific genes. The expression of mineralized tissue-associated genes, including Type I collagen (COL I), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RunX2), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin (OCN) messenger RNA (mRNA), was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR.;Higher proliferation potential and telomerase activity were observed in the P-MSCs compared to PDL-MSCs of premolar teeth. Fourteen of 84 genes related to MSCs were expressed differently in the PDL-MSCs versus the P-MSCs. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and BMP6; sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9); integrin, alpha 6 (ITGA6); melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM); phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class S (PIGS); prominin 1 (PROM1); ribosomal protein L13A (RPL13A); and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were higher in the P-MSCs compared to the PDL-MSCs, and higher expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), interleukin (IL)-6, insulin (INS), alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase (ANPEP), and IL-10 were observed in the PDL-MSCs. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the expression of mineralized tissue-associated genes, including BSP and RunX2, between the P-MSCs and the PDL-MSCs. Higher expression of COL I and lower expression of OCN mRNA transcripts were noted in the PDL-MSCs compared to the P-MSCs.;The results of this study suggest that MSCs isolated from P and PDL tissues show different cellular behavior. To increase the predictability of MSC-based regenerative treatment, differences in dental tissue-derived MSCs and favorable aspects of cell sources should be further clarified.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Azoospermic factor c (AZFc) deletions are the underlying cause in 10% of azoo- or severe oligozoospermia. Through extensive molecular analysis the precise genetic content of the AZFc region and the origin of its deletion have been determined. However, little is known about the effect of AZFc deletions on the functionality of germ cells at various developmental steps. The presence of normal, fertilization-competent sperm in the ejaculate and/or testis of the majority of men with AZFc deletions suggests that the process of differentiation from spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) to mature spermatozoa can take place in the absence of the AZFc region. To determine the functionality of AZFc-deleted spermatogonia, we compared in vitro propagated spermatogonia from six men with complete AZFc deletions with spermatogonia from three normozoospermic controls. We found that spermatogonia of AZFc-deleted men behave similar to controls during culture. Short-term (18 days) and long-term (48 days) culture of AZFc-deleted spermatogonia showed the same characteristics as non-deleted spermatogonia. This similarity was revealed by the same number of passages, the same germ cell clusters formation and similar level of genes expression of spermatogonial markers including ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha 1 (GFRA1), as well as germ cell differentiation markers including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), spermatogenesis and oogenesis specific basic helix-loophelix 2 (SOHLH2), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) and synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3). The only exception was melanoma antigen family A4 (MAGEA4) which showed significantly lower expression in AZFc-deleted samples than controls in short-term culture while in long-term culture it was hardly detected in both AZFc-deleted and control spermatogonia. These data suggest that, at least in vitro, spermatogonia of AZFc-deleted men are functionally similar to spermatogonia from non-deleted men. Potentially, this enables treatment of men with AZFc deletions by propagating their SSCs in vitro and autotransplanting these SSCs back to the testes to increase sperm counts and restore fertility.

Bio 30, a propolis produced in New Zealand, contains CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester) as the major anti-cancer ingredient which directly down-regulates RAC, leading to the inactivation of PAK1. Since PAK1 is essential for the growth of RAS cancer cells such as A549 cell line which carry an oncogenic K-RAS mutant, and the melanogenesis in skin cells, here using these PAK1-blockers as model compounds, we introduce a new approach to the quick assessment of PAK1-blockers in cell culture. First, combining the immuno-precipitation (IP) of PAK1 from cell lysate and the in vitro ATP_Glo kinase assay kit (called \"Macaroni-Western\" assay), we confirmed that both CBI and Bio 30 inactivate PAK1 in A549 lung cancer cells in 24 h, and inhibit their PAK1-dependent growth in 72 h. Furthermore, we verified that CBI inhibits the PAK1/PAK4-dependent melanogenesis in melanoma cells by far more than 50%, while Bio 30 inhibits the melanogenesis only by 50%, with only a merginal effect on their growth per se. Since the \"Macaroni-Western\" kinase assay and melanogenesis are both rather simple and quick, the combination of these two cell culture assays would be highly useful for selecting both \"potent\" (highly cell-permeable) and \"safe\" (non-toxic) natural or synthetic PAK1-blockers.

As several malignant tumors lead to impaired blood coagulation, we hypothesized if kisspeptin acts also as a potential anticoagulant. The effect was studied in vivo through intraperitoneal administration of kisspeptin to laboratory rats, and application of kisspeptin ex vivo to rat and human blood. In another set of experiments, clotting factors in the form of rat fresh plasma were injected into rats' prior to kisspeptin administration. Standard anticoagulation parameters were studied through established methods and commercially available kits. Herein, we demonstrate dose-dependent anticoagulation effect following in vivo kisspeptin administration. Coagulation time, bleeding time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were significantly (P < 0.0002) prolonged, international normalized ratio increased, while plasma calcium concentration and mean platelet count were significantly decreased (P < 0.001). Mean platelet volume increased only at the highest tested dose while platelet distribution width remained unaltered. Where fresh plasma was administered prior to kisspeptin treatment, results were similar to kisspeptin alone treatment except for significantly (P < 0.001) increased plasma calcium concentration. Application of kisspeptin ex vivo to rat and human blood produced similar results. This is the first report on kisspeptin's role in the anticoagulation of blood and suggests that it may increase the bleeding tendency possibly via modulation of calcium-signaling or inactivating calcium action, inhibition of thrombin and quick reduction in platelet numbers. A detailed investigation of the anticoagulation role of kisspeptin would help to clarify its use as an anticoagulant and thrombolytic agent.",

To date, several cell carriers have been tested based largely upon their predicted tumor-localizing properties. However, cell types may exist which can be mobilized from the circulation by a tumor which have not yet been identified. Here we use an unbiased screen of bone marrow (BM) cells to identify cells which localize to tumors and which might serve as effective candidate cell carriers without any prior prediction or selection.;Unsorted BM cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic donor mice were adoptively transferred into C57Bl/6 mice bearing pre-established subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumors. Forty-eight hours and eight days later, tumors, organs and blood were analyzed for GFP-expressing cells by flow cytometry. The phenotype of GFP cells in organs was determined by co-staining with specific cell surface markers.;CD45(+) hematopoietic cells were readily detected in tumor, spleen, bone marrow, blood and lung at both time points. Within these CD45(+) cell populations, preferential accumulation in the tumor was observed of cells expressing Sca-1, c-kit, NK1.1, Thy1.2, CD14, Mac-3 and/or CD11c. Lymphodepletion increased homing to spleen and bone marrow, but not to tumors.;We have used an in vivo screen to identify populations of BM-derived donor cells which accumulate within tumors.

In an attempt to find a novel anti-melanogenic agent, we synthesized (Z)-5-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione (MHY498). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of MHY498 on NO levels and on the NO-mediated signaling pathway using an in vitro model of melanogenesis. MHY498 inhibited 200 μM sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor)-induced NO generation, dose-dependently and suppressed tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis induced by SNP in B16F10 melanoma cells. To investigate the effect of MHY498 on NO-mediated signaling pathway, guanosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) activities were measured using a cGMP EIA Kit and western blotting was performed to determine the effects of MHY498 on the gene expressions of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). The increased activity of cGMP by SNP was reduced dose-dependently by pretreatment with MHY498. Furthermore, MHY498 suppressed the expressions of tyrosinase and MITF stimulated by SNP. This study shows that enhancement of tyrosinase gene expression via the cGMP pathway is a probable primary mechanism of NO-induced melanogenesis and that the NO-mediated signaling pathway with the expression of MITF enhances melanogenesis. In addition, MHY498 was found to scavenge NO and to suppress the activity of the NO-mediated signaling pathway, and thus, to subsequently down-regulate tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis. This study suggests that MHY498 is a promising anti-melanogenic agent that targets the NO-induced cGMP signaling pathway.",

Among the most sensitive dasatinib targets are ABL, the SRC family kinases (SRC, LCK, HCK, FYN, YES, FGR, BLK, LYN, and FRK), and the receptor tyrosine kinases c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), c-FMS, and ephrin receptors. Dasatinib inhibits cell duplication, migration, and invasion, and it triggers apoptosis of tumoral cells. As a consequence, dasatinib reduces tumoral mass and decreases the metastatic dissemination of tumoral cells. Dasatinib also acts on the tumoral microenvironment, which is particularly important in the bone, where dasatinib inhibits osteoclastic activity and favors osteogenesis, exerting a bone-protecting effect. Several preclinical studies have shown that dasatinib potentiates the antitumoral action of various drugs used in the oncology clinic, paving the way for the initiation of clinical trials of dasatinib in combination with standard-of-care treatments for the therapy of various neoplasias. Trials using combinations of dasatinib with ErbB/HER receptor antagonists are being explored in breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. In hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, trials using combinations of dasatinib with antihormonal therapies are ongoing. Dasatinib combinations with chemotherapeutic agents are also under development in prostate cancer (dasatinib plus docetaxel), melanoma (dasatinib plus dacarbazine), and colorectal cancer (dasatinib plus oxaliplatin plus capecitabine).

These tumors are both phenotypically and genotypically different from true leiomyomas and usually express CD34, a hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen. CD34, however, is also present in a wide variety of fibroblastic and endothelial cell tumors. In this immunohistochemical study of CD117, we evaluated 85 cases of GIST and more than 150 other mesenchymal tumors, including leiomyomas and schwannomas. CD117, the c-kit proto-oncogene product, is expressed in subsets of hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal of the GI tract. CD117 was almost always (85%) expressed in both benign and malignant GISTs. CD117 was observed both in the spindle cell and epithelioid subtypes of GISTs in all locations. In addition to reacting with the CD34-positive GISTs, CD117 was positive in some CD34-negative cases. Approximately one-third of GISTs coexpressed CD117 and smooth muscle actins. In contrast, true leiomyomas (desmin and actin-positive) and schwannomas in both GI and peripheral locations were consistently negative for CD117. Solitary fibrous tumors and Kaposi's sarcomas, which are typically CD34 positive, were consistently CD117 negative. Among the CD34-positive tumors that showed occasional CD117 reactivity were dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (1 of 7) and hemangiopericytoma (2 of 10). Other mesenchymal tumors that were variably CD 117 positive included clear cell sarcoma (7 of 15), metastatic melanoma (9 of 25), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1 of 20). These results indicate that CD117 is a specific marker for GIST among tumors that occur in the GI tract and adjacent regions. CD117 expression also separates GISTs from true leiomyomas and gastric schwannomas.",

The current work is devoted to explore both the biological activity of some previously obtained compounds and the search for an explanation of their target(s) in hypoxic pathways. In this work the biological activity of some benzimidazole-4,7-diones was evaluated. These compounds were examined as potential bioreductive agents specific for the hypoxic environment found in tumor cells. The main aim was concerned with establishing their cytotoxic properties by using proliferation, apoptosis and DNA destruction tests on selected tumor cells. Their cytotoxic effects on two tumor cell lines (human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells line and human malignant melanoma WM115) was compared by means of a WST-1 test. Next, the mode of cytotoxicity behind the selected tumor cells' death was determined by the caspase 3/7 test. The last point referred to the DNA destruction of A549 and WM115 cells and the in situ DNA Assay Kit test was applied. The cytotoxic tests confirmed their activity against the tumor cells and target hypoxia (compounds 2b, 2a, 2d). The screening test of the caspase-dependent apoptosis proved that the exposure of the tested tumor cells in hypoxia to these benzimidazole-4,7-diones promoted the apoptotic cell death. Additionally, the DNA damage test established that benzimidazole-4,7-diones can be potential hypoxia-selective agents for tumor cells, especially compound 2b. All results classify the tested benzimidazole-4,7-diones as promising, lead molecules and provide a rationale for further molecular studies to explain their usefulness as potential inhibitors of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1).

We hypothesized that hypomelanosis in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides may have a similar mechanism as in vitiligo, a condition in which it is believed that alterations in expression of CD117 (stem cell factor receptor/KIT protein) on epidermal melanocytes and abnormal interactions between melanocytes and surrounding keratinocytes may play a pathogenic role. To test the hypothesis that similar mechanisms might also explain hypopigmentation in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides, skin specimens from five cases each of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and vitiligo were studied immunohistochemically for immunophenotype of the infiltrating cells, CD117 (expressed by epidermal melanocytes), and pan melanoma cocktail of antigens (gp100, tyrosinase, and MART-1) expression; cases of conventional mycosis fungoides and normal skin were studied in parallel as controls. Our findings confirm a predominance of CD8+ neoplastic T cells in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides. Similarly, the epidermal lymphocytic infiltrate in vitiligo was also composed of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, in contrast to an epidermal infiltrate composed of CD4+ T cells in conventional mycosis fungoides. The average number of epidermal CD117 expressing cells followed the same pattern of decreased expression in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides as in vitiligo, whereas the levels in conventional mycosis fungoides were higher, and similar to that observed in normal skin. Furthermore, a decreased number of melanocytes per high-power field of the length of the biopsy was present in hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and vitiligo, as compared with either conventional mycosis fungoides or normal skin, suggesting a correlation between decreased expression of CD117 and decreased number of melanocytes. We propose that decreased expression of CD117 and its downstream events in melanocytes may be initiated by cytotoxic effects of melanosomal-antigen-specific CD8+ neoplastic T lymphocytes, resulting in destabilization of CD117 and leading to dysfunction and/or loss of melanocytes in the epidermis of hypopigmented mycosis fungoides.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In April 2013 our group published a review on predictive molecular pathology in this journal. Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

        "Doc_abstract":"In bone metastatic lesions, osteoclasts play a key role in the development of osteolysis. Previous studies have shown that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is important for the differentiation of osteoclasts. In this study, we investigated whether an inhibitor of M-CSF receptor (c-Fms) suppresses osteoclast-dependent osteolysis in bone metastatic lesions. We developed small molecule inhibitors against ligand-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fms and examined the effects of these compounds on osteolytic bone destruction in a bone metastasis model. We discovered a novel quinoline-urea derivative, Ki20227 (N-{4-[(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinolyl)oxy]-2-methoxyphenyl}-N'-[1-(1,3-thiazole-2-yl)ethyl]urea), which is a c-Fms tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The IC(50)s of Ki20227 to inhibit c-Fms, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (KDR), stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta were found to be 2, 12, 451, and 217 nmol/L, respectively. Ki20227 did not inhibit other kinases tested, such as fms-like tyrosine kinase-3, epidermal growth factor receptor, or c-Src (c-src proto-oncogene product). Ki20227 was also found to inhibit the M-CSF-dependent growth of M-NFS-60 cells but not the M-CSF-independent growth of A375 human melanoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, in an osteoclast-like cell formation assay using mouse bone marrow cells, Ki20227 inhibited the development of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells in a dose-dependent manner. In in vivo studies, oral administration of Ki20227 suppressed osteoclast-like cell accumulation and bone resorption induced by metastatic tumor cells in nude rats following intracardiac injection of A375 cells. Moreover, Ki20227 decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells on bone surfaces in ovariectomized (ovx) rats. These findings suggest that Ki20227 inhibits osteolytic bone destruction through the suppression of M-CSF-induced osteoclast accumulation in vivo. Therefore, Ki20227 may be a useful therapeutic agent for osteolytic disease associated with bone metastasis and other bone diseases.",

An additional goal was to study the effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).;The expression of TLR-3, TLR-7, RIG-I, and MDA5 in cultured FLS was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Transcription factors were studied using the ELISA-based TransAM transcription factor kit. The expression of IFNβ, CXCL8 (interleukin-8), and MMP-3 was analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA.;FLS expressed TLR-3, TLR-7, RIG-I, and MDA5. The expression of TLR-3 and RIG-I was higher in RA FLS, while the expression of TLR-7 and MDA5 was higher in OA FLS. Stimulation with poly(I-C) induced the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), NF-κB, and activator protein 1 (AP-1) c-Jun as well as the subsequent production of IFNβ, CXCL8, and MMP-3. VIP reduced the activation of IRF-3 and the production of IFNβ in both OA and RA FLS. Imiquimod induced the activation of NF-κB, AP-1 c-Fos, and AP-1 c-Jun and the synthesis of CXCL8 and MMP-3. VIP significantly diminished MMP-3 production only in imiquimod-treated RA FLS.;The results of this study revealed a prominent function of FLS in the recognition of both dsRNA and ssRNA, which may be present in the joint microenvironment. This study also advances the healing function of the endogenous neuroimmune peptide VIP, which inhibited TLR-3-, RIG-I-, MDA5-, and TLR-7-mediated stimulation of antiviral, proinflammatory, and joint destruction mediators.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The aim of this trial was to measure the pH value of the skin of burn patients using a non-invasive method, from the acute phase through to complete re-epithelialization. The research was then completed by treating the patients with new materials and innovative methods to verify whether this had an effect on the skin pH and on re-epithelialization time. In this clinical trial, the patients were medicated repeatedly with hydrogel (Burnshield®) kept in place by a transparent, semipermeable adhesive film with a moisture vapour transmission rate equivalent to 1600 until day 5 or 6 post-burn. In one patient, treated silk (DermaSilk®) was applied several times until re-epithelialization; in another patient, synthetic hyaluronic acid (Hyalomatrix®) was applied. Various studies using Dermasilk® have confirmed that the fibroin in silk stimulates re-epithelialization, in addition to keeping the burned skin disinfected, thanks to the antimicrobial agent contained in the treated silk. Hyalomatrix® was used on the other patient, as in other studies, as a temporary substitute for the skin in deep burns. Late complications (keloids and hypertrophic scars) can give rise, even after prolonged periods of time, to Marjolin's ulcer (carcinoma but also melanoma and sarcoma), which can develop in the course of a year. A recent Danish trial affirms that appropriate burn treatment facilitates re-epithelialization and decreases the incidence of Marjolin's ulcer. For the trial, we used a centimetre-wide strip of reactive paper sensitive to pH variations and an acid test (Duotest® kit) as a reference, applied for more than one minute on the patient's burned and slightly damp skin. We performed control procedures on the patient's normal skin, away from the wound site. The pH was measured from day 1 post-burn and every other day thereafter until complete re-epithelialization. We found alkaline pH values for the burned skin from the day of the burn until day 12, with an alkaline pH peak on day 4 (10.5 in the first patient, 9.5 in the second). The values then gradually returned to normal (pH, 5.5) from day 13 onwards. The mean re-epithelialization time was similar in the two patients, equivalent to 24.5 days (25 days in the first patient, 24 in the second), with a mean follow-up of 21 months (33 months in the first case, 9 in the second).

No recent series has critically reevaluated putative FSs to estimate their true incidence. One hundred ninety-five cases diagnosed as adult FS in somatic soft tissue were retrieved from our institutional archives for the period 1960 to 2008. Thirty-two cases with insufficient material were excluded. On the basis the morphology of the final 163 cases, immunohistochemical studies (IHC) was conducted using some combination of: wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5 y, range 2 to 99 y), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females (median 50 y, range 6 to 74 y), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range <1 to 35 y). Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease (median follow-up 1-year; range <1 to 8 y), 6 patients (25%) were alive without disease (median follow-up 11.5 y; range 2.5 to 35 y), and 6 patients (25%) died of other causes (median follow-up 10 y; range 9 to 18 y) (). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great caution.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm that occurs in lymph nodes, skin, and the gastrointestinal tract. Many previously published cases were likely misdiagnosed examples of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Only small numbers of bona fide examples exist in the world literature; cases arising primarily at extranodal sites are not well described and often seem to go unrecognized. To characterize these tumors further, 14 extranodal histiocytic sarcomas were analyzed. Hematoxylin and eosin sections were reexamined, immunohistochemistry was performed, and clinical details were obtained from referring hospitals. Eight patients were female and 6 male (median age, 55 years; range, 15-89 years). All patients presented with a solitary mass, ranging in size from 1.8 to 12 cm (median 6.8 cm). Seven tumors arose in soft tissue (6 lower limb; 1 upper limb), 5 in the gastrointestinal tract (1 involving both stomach and colon, 1 ileum, 2 rectum, 1 anus), 1 in the nasal cavity, and 1 in the lung. Three gastrointestinal tract tumors also involved regional lymph nodes, and 1 involved the liver. Most cases had infiltrative margins. The tumors were generally composed of sheets of large epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval to irregular nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and large nucleoli. Binucleated cells were common, and 6 cases contained tumor giant cells. Mitoses ranged from 1 to 64 per 10 HPF (median 11 per 10 HPF). Necrosis was present in 8 cases. Nearly all tumors showed a striking inflammatory infiltrate, most often of neutrophils or lymphocytes. All cases were reactive for LCA, CD45RO, and CD68 (KP1 and PG-M1); 13 of 14 (93%) expressed CD4, 12 of 14 (86%) lysozyme, 8 of 10 (80%) CD31, 7 of 14 (50%) S-100 protein, and 5 of 14 (36%) focal CD1a. Two tumors showed weak, focal cytoplasmic positivity for CD30, and 1 for epithelial membrane antigen. The tumors were negative for ALK-1, CD21, CD35, CD3, CD20, CD34, myeloperoxidase, HMB-45, and keratins. Gastrointestinal tract cases were negative for c-kit and desmin. Six patients were treated with postoperative radiation and 7 with chemotherapy (CHOP or ProMACE-MOPP). Follow-up was available for 10 patients (median, 24 months; range, 4 months to 11 years). Two tumors recurred locally, and 5 patients developed distant spread: 3 to lymph nodes, 1 to lung, and 1 to bone. At the last follow-up, 2 patients have died of disseminated disease, 4 and 5 months following initial diagnosis. The patients who died thus far had the largest primary tumors. Histiocytic sarcoma may arise primarily in soft tissue and shows reproducible histologic features, including abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. Metastatic carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and large cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas should be excluded by immunohistochemistry. Histiocytic sarcoma has the potential for an aggressive clinical course, most often with lymph node involvement. However, a subset of cases presenting with clinically localized disease have a favorable long-term outcome. Tumor size may be a prognostic factor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years the idea of using gene therapy as a modality in the treatment of diseases other than genetically inherited, monogenic disorders has taken root. This is particularly obvious in the field of oncology where currently more than 100 clinical trials have been approved worldwide. This report will summarize some of the exciting progress that has recently been made with respect to both targeting the delivery of potentially therapeutic genes to tumor sites and regulating their expression within the tumor microenvironment. In order to specifically target malignant cells while at the same time sparing normal tissue, cancer gene therapy will need to combine highly selective gene delivery with highly specific gene expression, specific gene product activity, and, possibly, specific drug activation. Although the efficient delivery of DNA to tumor sites remains a formidable task, progress has been made in recent years using both viral (retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus) and nonviral (liposomes, gene gun, injection) methods. In this report emphasis will be placed on targeted rather than high-efficiency delivery, although those would need to be combined in the future for effective therapy. To date delivery has been targeted to tumor-specific and tissue-specific antigens, such as epithelial growth factor receptor, c-kit receptor, and folate receptor, and these will be described in some detail. To increase specificity and safety of gene therapy further, the expression of the therapeutic gene needs to be tightly controlled within the target tissue. Targeted gene expression has been analyzed using tissue-specific promoters (breast-, prostate-, and melanoma-specific promoters) and disease-specific promoters (carcinoembryonic antigen, HER-2/neu, Myc-Max response elements, DF3/MUC). Alternatively, expression could be regulated externally with the use of radiation-induced promoters or tetracycline-responsive elements. Another novel possibility that will be discussed is the regulation of therapeutic gene products by tumor-specific gene splicing. Gene expression could also be targeted at conditions specific to the tumor microenvironment, such as glucose deprivation and hypoxia. We have concentrated on hypoxia-targeted gene expression and this report will discuss our progress in detail. Chronic hypoxia occurs in tissue that is more than 100-200 microns away from a functional blood supply. In solid tumors hypoxia is widespread both because cancer cells are more prolific than the invading endothelial cells that make up the blood vessels and because the newly formed blood supply is disorganized. Measurements of oxygen partial pressure in patients' tumors showed a high percentage of severe hypoxia readings (less than 2.5 mmHg), readings not seen in normal tissue. This is a major problem in the treatment of cancer, because hypoxic cells are resistant to radiotherapy and often to chemotherapy. However, severe hypoxia is also a physiological condition specific to tumors, which makes it a potentially exploitable target. We have utilized hypoxia response elements (HRE) derived from the oxygen-regulated phosphoglycerate kinase gene to control gene expression in human tumor cells in vitro and in experimental tumors. The list of genes that have been considered for use in the treatment of cancer is extensive. It includes cytokines and costimulatory cell surface molecules intended to induce an effective systemic immune response against tumor antigens that would not otherwise develop. Other inventive strategies include the use of internally expressed antibodies to target oncogenic proteins (intrabodies) and the use of antisense technology (antisense oligonucleotides, antigenes, and ribozymes). This report will concentrate more on novel genes encoding prodrug activating enzymes, so-called suicide genes (Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, Escherichia coli nitroreductase, E.
