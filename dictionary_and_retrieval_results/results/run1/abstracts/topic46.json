Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell lung cancer (n = 155), but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples (22% of cases). Using cell-based screening with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large (n = 83) panel of lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an FGFR1-resistant allele (FGFR1(V561M)), which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.",

We hypothesized             that FGFR1 overexpression may be correlated with the clinicopathological features             of lung cancers. The increased copy number of the FGFR1 gene was analyzed by real-time             polymerase chain reaction amplifications in 100 surgically treated non-small cell             lung cancer cases from Nagoya City University Hospital. Sixty-five squamous cell             carcinoma cases were included. An increased FGFR1 gene copy number was found in             32 (32%) lung cancer patients. The increased FGFR1 copy number status significantly             correlated with gender (females 13.8% vs. males 39.4%, p=0.0173), smoking status             (never smoker 4.2% vs. smoker 40.8%, p=0.0004) and pathological subtypes (squamous             cell carcinoma 41.5% vs. non-squamous cell carcinoma 14.3%, p=0.0066).

These findings make FGFR1 amplification a potential biomarker for lung cancer treatment. Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung are characterized by an uneven FGFR1 gene copy number distribution.

Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

We found that, in contrast with other recurrent amplifications, the 8p12 region included multiple centers of amplification, suggesting marked genomic heterogeneity. FGFR1-amplified tumor cells were dependent on FGFR ligands in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ectopic expression of FGFR1 was oncogenic, which was enhanced by expression of MYC. We found that MYC was coexpressed in 40% of FGFR1-amplified tumors. Tumor cells coexpressing MYC were more sensitive to FGFR inhibition, suggesting that patients with FGFR1-amplified and MYC-overexpressing tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibitor therapy.

In this study, we deployed RNAi-based functional genomic screens to identify protein kinases controlling the intrinsic sensitivity of FGFR1-dependent lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cells to ponatinib, a multikinase FGFR-active inhibitor. We identified and validated a synthetic lethal interaction between MTOR and ponatinib in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. In addition, treatment with MTOR-targeting shRNAs and pharmacologic inhibitors revealed that MTOR is an essential protein kinase in other FGFR1-expressing cancer cells. The combination of FGFR inhibitors and MTOR or AKT inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth suppression in vitro. Notably, tumor xenografts generated from FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cells exhibited only modest sensitivity to monotherapy with the FGFR-specific TKI, AZD4547, but when combined with the MTOR inhibitor, AZD2014, significantly attenuated tumor growth and prolonged survival. Our findings support the existence of a signaling network wherein FGFR1-driven ERK and activated MTOR/AKT represent distinct arms required to induce full transformation.

High FGFR1 gene copy number (amplification or high-level polysomy) was significantly more frequent in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (24.8%) and large cell carcinomas (LCC) (25%) compared to adenocarcinomas (11.3%) (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively). Among NSCLC there was no significant correlation between FGFR1-positive status and other clinicopathological features including age, gender, smoking history, tumour size, lymph node status, stage, grade, vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion. FGFR1-positive patients showed a tendency to longer overall survival in univariate analysis (p = 0.14). Multivariate survival analysis using Cox regression model confirmed FGFR1-positive patients had a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to FGFR1-negative patients (HR 0.6; p = 0.02). High FGFR1 gene copy number is a common finding in SCC and LCC and is an independent favourable prognostic factor.",

Among the several factors associated with breast cancer development, angiogenesis plays an essential role and has currently emerged as a potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic target. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have important activities in tumor angiogenesis and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of these two receptors, hypothesising significant correlations between receptor expression in tumor angiogenesis and clinicopathological parameters customarily used in breast cancer prognosis and prediction. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of ductal invasive breast carcinomas were used to analyze the expression of PAR1 and FGFR1, in the tumor cells as well as in the tumor stroma, and further determine intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD) to quantify intratumoral angiogenesis. Correlations between PAR1 and FGFR1 expression in tumor cells and stroma, iMVD and several clinicopathological parameters and molecular markers used in breast cancer diagnosis have been addressed. The correlation between PAR1 and FGFR1 suggests an association of the two receptors with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and, consequently, a potential role during tumor progression. The results reported in the present study also emphasize the importance of microenvironmental factors in tumor progression, while precluding the positive association between iMVD and breast cancer aggressiveness.",

Survival rates are poor and have remained stagnant owing to chemoresistance and the high propensity to form lung metastases. In this study, we used in vivo transgenic models of c-fos oncogene-induced osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma in addition to c-Fos-inducible systems in vitro to investigate downstream signalling pathways that regulate osteosarcoma growth and metastasis. Fgfr1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) was identified as a novel c-Fos/activator protein-1(AP-1)-regulated gene. Induction of c-Fos in vitro in osteoblasts and chondroblasts caused an increase in Fgfr1 RNA and FGFR1 protein expression levels that resulted in increased and sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), morphological transformation and increased anchorage-independent growth in response to FGF2 ligand treatment. High levels of FGFR1 protein and activated pFRS2α signalling were observed in murine and human osteosarcomas. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 signalling blocked MAPK activation and colony growth of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Orthotopic injection in vivo of FGFR1-silenced osteosarcoma cells caused a marked twofold to fivefold decrease in spontaneous lung metastases. Similarly, inhibition of FGFR signalling in vivo with the small-molecule inhibitor AZD4547 markedly reduced the number and size of metastatic nodules. Thus deregulated FGFR signalling has an important role in osteoblast transformation and osteosarcoma formation and regulates the development of lung metastases. Our findings support the development of anti-FGFR inhibitors as potential antimetastatic therapy. ",

In this study, we evaluated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and ligand expression in primary SCLC samples.;FGFR1 protein expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, and gene copy number were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mRNA in situ hybridization, and silver in situ hybridization, respectively, in primary tumors from 90 patients with SCLC. Protein and mRNA expression of the FGF2 and FGF9 ligands were determined by IHC and mRNA in situ hybridization, respectively. In addition, a second cohort of 24 SCLC biopsy samples with known FGFR1 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization was assessed for FGFR1 protein expression by IHC. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate associations of FGFR1, FGF2 and FGF9 protein levels, respective mRNA levels, and FGFR1 gene copy number.;FGFR1 protein expression by IHC demonstrated a significant correlation with FGFR1 mRNA levels (p < 0.0001) and FGFR1 gene copy number (p = 0.03).

Although amplification of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 has been reported in breast cancers, their role in the progression of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma is unclear. To investigate this question we compared the amplification frequencies of these genes in pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma.;We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization of the selected genes on tissue microarrays composed of 179 pure DCIS and 438 invasive carcinomas. Two hundred and sixteen of the latter had DCIS components, and in those cases we compared gene amplification in the intraductal and invasive components of each carcinoma.;The rate of amplification of FGFR1 was higher in invasive carcinomas than in the pure DCIS, but the opposite was true for HER2 amplification. These findings applied consistently to high-grade tumors, but not to low/intermediate-grade tumors. The amplification status of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 was generally similar in the matched invasive and DCIS components of the same tumors. However, FGFR1 amplification was more common in the invasive components than in the DCIS components. In survival analyses, FGFR1 amplification was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-free survival for all patients with invasive carcinoma and for the hormone receptor-positive subgroup.;Amplification of HER2, C-MYC and CCND1 seems to play a role in the early development of breast cancer, but not in its progression. However, the increased frequency of FGFR1 amplification in invasive carcinomas compared with pure DCIS and in the invasive components of individual tumors, and its association with decreased disease-free survival, suggests a role for FGFR1 amplification in the progression of breast cancer including in situ-to-invasive transition, as well as initiation.",

This prospective study aimed to assess the pathological response after preoperative radiochemotherapy (5FU-Navelbine-radiotherapy) for large breast cancers. The expression of FGFR1 and FGF2 in tumor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Tumors in which no staining was seen, were considered as negative for that protein. We used the Khi-2 test or the Fisher test to compare the qualitative variables and the Student t test or the non-parametric Wilcoxon test for the quantitative variables. We included in the present study all the 32 patients from the S14 cohort for whom the tissue blocks from the biopsy specimens were available with sufficient tumoral tissue. FGFR1 and FGF2 staining were observed respectively in 17 (56%) and 22 (68%) of the 32 tumoral biopsies. The expression of FGFR1 was associated with the hormone receptor positive status (p=0.0191).

However, tumor recurrence due to development of nintedanib resistance might occur. Hence, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired nintedanib resistance in FGFR1-driven lung cancer. Chronic nintedanib exposure of the FGFR1-driven SCLC cell line DMS114 (DMS114/NIN) but not of two NSCLC cell lines induced massive overexpression of the multidrug-resistance transporter ABCB1. Indeed, we proved nintedanib to be both substrate and modulator of ABCB1-mediated efflux. Importantly, the oncogenic FGFR1 signaling axis remained active in DMS114/NIN cells while bioinformatic analyses suggested hyperactivation of the endothelin-A receptor (ETAR) signaling axis. Indeed, ETAR inhibition resensitized DMS114/NIN cells against nintedanib by downregulation of ABCB1 expression. PKC and downstream NFκB were identified as major downstream players in ETAR-mediated ABCB1 hyperactivation. Summarizing, ABCB1 needs to be considered as a factor underlying nintedanib resistance. Combination approaches with ETAR antagonists or switching to non-ABCB1 substrate FGFR inhibitors represent innovative strategies to manage nintedanib resistance in lung cancer.",

Although SOX2 has been postulated as a key regulator of basal stem cells transformation and tumor progression, it seems to confer a good prognosis in SQCCL. It is known that each patient might carry a different length of 3q chromosome amplicon. Thus, we suggest that the number and the biological importance of the genes spanned along each patient's 3q amplicon might help to explain inter-individual outcome variations of the disease and its potential predictive value, especially when relevant oncogenes such as those mentioned above are implicated. Currently, there is no clinical predictive data available from clinical trials. In this review, we have focused on the potential role of FGFR1 in SQCCL prognosis. Additionally, we have explored recently available public data on the comprehensive genomic characterization of SQCCL, in relation to the protein-coding genes that have a strong gene copy number - mRNA correlation in 3q chromosome, that were previously described as potential driver oncogenes or its modifiers in SQCCL.

Clinical trials testing specific FGFR inhibitors are in progress, and patients are selected based on their FGFR1 gene copy number status. Fluorescent in situ hybridization is the most commonly used method for detecting FGFR1 amplifications, but it has its limitations. In this paper, we describe a new non-fading and easy to assess assay for detecting FGFR1 amplification using a combination of chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization. We assessed 394 patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with the new assay and compared the results with those obtained by FGFR1 fluorescent in situ hybridization. We could assess copy number by the fluorescent in situ hybridization in 86.8 % (342/394) of cases, whereas with chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization, this was 79.4 % (313/394). By fluorescent in situ hybridization, a FGFR1 amplification was detected in 12.6 % (43/342) of cases, a low-level amplification (LLA) in 7.6 % (26/342) and a high-level amplification (HLA) in 5.0 % (17/342). By chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization, a FGFR1 amplification was found in 10.2 % (32/313) (5.7 % LLA, 4.5 % HLA). The two techniques showed highly concordant results (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.971, p < 0.01).",

The aim of this study was to determine which FGFs and FGFRs play functional roles in epithelial ovarian cancer. Restriction enzyme analysis of mRNA revealed that transformation was associated with a switch in FGFR2 and FGFR3, from the IIIc to the IIIb isoform. There was widespread expression of FGFs, including FGF7, in all tissues but, FGF3 and FGF19 were expressed by malignant cell lines and cancer tissue but were not present in normal tissue. Using FGFR-specific shRNAi we demonstrated that reductions in FGFR2 inhibited proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro (>50%, p < 0.006) and reduced cisplatin IC(50) (>60%, p < 0.0001). Cell cycle analysis revealed increased cisplatin sensitivity was associated with increased G(2)/M arrest and increased apoptosis. FGFR2 shRNAi reduced growth rates of ovarian tumor xenografts by 20% (p < 0.006) and when combined with cisplatin caused a 40% reduction in proliferation rates (p < 0.007). In contrast, RNAi-induced reductions in FGFR1 increased SKOV3 cell numbers, with associated changes in cell cycle but had no effect on ES2 cells. However, the cisplatin IC(50) was reduced (>50%, p < 0.0001) by FGFR1 shRNAi in both cell lines and there was increased apoptosis (46-50%) compared with control cells (35%) (p < 0.004). Together our data suggest that combining FGFR2 inhibitors with platinum-containing cytotoxic agents for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer may yield increased antitumor activity. However, data on the inhibition of FGFR1 suggest that broad spectrum FGFR inhibitors may have unexpected effects on proliferation.",

Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the primary tumors and, where present, of the corresponding lymph node metastasis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects chromosomal alterations that underlie the development and progression of cancer, and pinpoints targets of new anticancer drugs. Detection of such targets by FISH can be of diagnostic utility in morphologically difficult cases. Multitarget FISH with four different chromosomal probes improves the sensitivity of cytology in the diagnosis of lung cancer and clarifies equivocal cytological findings. FISH is becoming increasingly important in the field of predictive marker analysis. FISH is the gold standard to identify ALK rearrangements for treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori). EGFR mutation analysis is the method of choice for selecting patients for therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas the EGFR gene copy number has not been confirmed as a reliable predictive marker. MET amplification is an important mechanism of secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs and a candidate predictive marker for targeted second-line treatment of TKI-resistant non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. FGFR1 amplification is a promising new marker in squamous cell carcinoma that may predict the response to FGFR1 inhibitors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 1-4 are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that can serve as drivers of tumorigenesis. In particular, FGFR1 gene amplification has been implicated in squamous cell lung and breast cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting FGFR1, including AZD4547 and E3810 (Lucitanib), are currently in early phase clinical trials. Unfortunately, drug resistance limits the long-term success of TKIs, with mutations at the \"gatekeeper\" residue leading to tumor progression. Here we show the first structural and kinetic characterization of the FGFR1 gatekeeper mutation, V561M FGFR1. The V561M mutation confers a 38-fold increase in autophosphorylation achieved at least in part by a network of interacting residues forming a hydrophobic spine to stabilize the active conformation. Moreover, kinetic assays established that the V561M mutation confers significant resistance to E3810, while retaining affinity for AZD4547. Structural analyses of these TKIs with wild type (WT) and gatekeeper mutant forms of FGFR1 offer clues to developing inhibitors that maintain potency against gatekeeper mutations. We show that AZD4547 affinity is preserved by V561M FGFR1 due to a flexible linker that allows multiple inhibitor binding modes. This is the first example of a TKI binding in distinct conformations to WT and gatekeeper mutant forms of FGFR, highlighting adaptable regions in both the inhibitor and binding pocket crucial for drug design. Exploiting inhibitor flexibility to overcome drug resistance has been a successful strategy for combatting diseases such as AIDS and may be an important approach for designing inhibitors effective against kinase gatekeeper mutations.

We identified a functional role of FGFR1 in influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) and A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1) virus replication. Our results showed that FGFR1 silencing by siRNA interference promoted influenza A/PR8 and H5N1 virus replication in A549 cells, while lentivirus-mediated exogenous FGFR1 expression significantly suppressed influenza A virus replication; however, FGFR4 did not have the same effects. Moreover, FGFR1 phosphorylation levels were downregulated in A549 cells by influenza A virus infection, while the repression of FGFR1 kinase using PD173074, a potent and selective FGFR1 inhibitor, could enhance virus replication. Furthermore, we found that FGFR1 inhibits influenza virus internalization, but not binding, during viral entry.

The aim of this study was to characterize CLCs at the molecular genetic level and identify putative therapeutic targets.;We subjected 13 cases of CLC to a comprehensive molecular analysis including immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2/neu and p53; high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH); microarray-based CGH (aCGH); and fluorescent and chromogenic in situ hybridization for CCND1 and FGFR1.;All cases lacked the expression of E-cadherin, p53, and HER2, and all but one case was positive for estrogen receptors. HR-CGH revealed recurrent gains on 1q and losses on 16q (both, 85%). aCGH showed a good agreement with but higher resolution and sensitivity than HR-CGH. Recurrent, high level gains at 11q13 (CCND1) and 8p12-p11.2 were identified in seven and six cases, respectively, and were validated with in situ hybridization. Examination of aCGH and the gene expression profile data of the cell lines, MDA-MB-134 and ZR-75-1, which harbor distinct gains of 8p12-p11.2, identified FGFR1 as a putative amplicon driver of 8p12-p11.2 amplification in MDA-MB-134.

However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities.

We established afatinib-resistant cell lines after chronic exposure of activating EGFR mutation-positive PC9 cells to afatinib. Afatinib-resistant cells showed following specific characteristics as compared to PC9: [1] Expression of EGFR family proteins and their phosphorylated molecules was markedly downregulated by selection of afatinib resistance; [2] Expression of FGFR1 and its ligand FGF2 was alternatively upregulated; [3] Treatment with anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibody blocked enhanced phosphorylation of FGFR in resistant clone; [4] Both resistant clones showed collateral sensitivity to PD173074, a small-molecule FGFR-TKIs, and treatment with either PD173074 or FGFR siRNA exacerbated suppression of both afatinib-resistant Akt and Erk phosphorylation when combined with afatinib; [5] Expression of twist was markedly augmented in resistant sublines, and twist knockdown specifically suppressed FGFR expression and cell survival.

It is important to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of HBV-related HCC and to identify new biomarkers for clinical treatment. The important role of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) has been widely recognized in many types of cancers, but the association between FGFR polymorphisms and HCC carcinogenesis has been rarely reported. In this study, 199 patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis, 203 with HBV-associated HCC, and 184 healthy controls with no liver diseases were enrolled as participants. Using SNaPshot assays, five SNPs (rs13317, rs7825208, rs1047057, rs1047111, and rs1966265) of growth factor receptor genes were genotyped. Our results showed that the G/A and G/G genotypes at rs7825208 of FGFR1 were negatively correlated with HBV-related HCC (odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.22-0.93, P = 0.027). However, after Bonferroni correction, these significant differences no longer existed (P > 0.05). Our results indicated that these five polymorphisms of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes do not play any independent roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of HBV-related HCC in Han Chinese patients.",

Extensive molecular and genetic work-up of the two tumors yielded divergent lesions in the two tumors: an activating KRAS mutation in the responsive tumor and an amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) locus in the treatment-refractory tumor. These findings provide an insight to possible mechanisms of resistance to antiestrogen therapy in ER+ breast cancers. First, they illustrate the necessity of clinically approved assays to identify FGFR1 gene amplification, which occur in approximately 5% of breast tumors and have been linked to antiestrogen resistance. It is quite possible that the addition of FGFR inhibitors to ER-targeted therapy will yield a superior antitumor effect and improved patient outcome.

Ovarian cancer represents a promising target for virotherapy, since the virus can be delivered locally into the peritoneal cavity. Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) are overexpressed in the majority of human tumors, including ovarian cancer. To generate adenoviral vectors with improved tumor specificity, we generated a panel of Ad5 vectors with altered tropism for EGFR and FGFR, rather than the natural Ad5 receptor, hCAR. We have included mutations within AB loop of the viral fiber knob (KO1 mutation) to preclude interaction with hCAR, combined with insertions in the HI loop to incorporate peptides that bind either EGFR (peptide YHWYGYTPQNVI, GE11) or FGFR1 (peptides MQLPLAT, M*, and LSPPRYP, LS). Viruses were produced to high titers, and the integrity of the fiber protein was validated by Western blotting. The KO1 mutation efficiently ablated hCAR interactions, and significantly increased transduction was observed in hCAR(low)/EGFR(high) cell lines using Ad5.GE11, while transduction levels using Ad5.M* or Ad5.LS were not increased. In the presence of physiological concentrations of human blood clotting factor X (hFX), significantly increased levels of transduction via the hFX-mediated pathway were observed in cell lines, but not in primary tumor cells derived from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) ascites samples. Ad5-mediated transduction of EOC cells was completely abolished by the presence of 2.5% serum from patients, while, surprisingly, incorporation of the GE11 peptide resulted in significant evasion of neutralization in the same samples. We thus speculate that incorporation of the YHWYGYTPQNVI dodecapeptide within the fiber knob domain may provide a novel means of circumventing preexisting Ad5 immunity that warrants further investigation.

We propose that autocrine growth signaling pathways distinct from EGFR are active in NSCLC cells. To this end, gene expression profiling revealed frequent coexpression of specific fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in NSCLC cell lines. It is noteworthy that FGF2 and FGF9 as well as FGFR1 IIIc and/or FGFR2 IIIc mRNA and protein are frequently coexpressed in NSCLC cell lines, especially those that are insensitive to gefitinib. Specific silencing of FGF2 reduced anchorage-independent growth of two independent NSCLC cell lines that secrete FGF2 and coexpress FGFR1 IIIc and/or FGFR2 IIIc. Moreover, a TKI [(+/-)-1-(anti-3-hydroxy-cyclopentyl)-3-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-7-phenylamino-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimido-[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2-one (RO4383596)] that targets FGFRs inhibited basal FRS2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, two measures of FGFR activity, as well as proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC cell lines that coexpress FGF2 or FGF9 and FGFRs. By contrast, RO4383596 influenced neither signal transduction nor growth of NSCLC cell lines lacking FGF2, FGF9, FGFR1, or FGFR2 expression.

Furthermore, a quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of 41 analogs demonstrated that the specific structural substitutions alter their bioactivities.

Evaluation for anti-gastric cancer efficacy of D12 and D15 indicated effective inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest.

Ectopic expression of constitutively active FGFR1 mutant (caFGFR1) at low levels in prostate epithelial cells induces low- to intermediate-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) within 6-8 months and high-grade PIN in 20-25 months. Depression of the FGFR2 signaling in the prostate also disturbs homeostasis in the prostate and induces prostate hyperplasia. To study whether PIN lesions induced by the caFGFR1 were expression-level dependent, and whether expression of the caFGFR1 and depression of the FGFR2 signaling in the prostate synergistically disturbed prostate homeostasis, we generated two new strains of ARR2PBi-caFGFR1 transgenic mice, which highly expressed caFGFR1 in prostatic epithelial cells. The mice were crossed with KDNR mice to generate ARR2PBi-caFGFR1/KDNR bigenic mice. The ARR2PBi-caFGFR1 mice developed high-grade PIN within 8 months, which was significantly faster than the mice expressing caFGFR1 at low levels. In addition, depression of the FGFR2 signaling clearly promoted perturbation of cellular homeostasis induced by the caFGFR1. The results demonstrated that the PIN development in caFGFR1 transgenic mice was caFGFR1 dosage-dependent, and indicated that the ectopic FGFR1 and the resident FGFR2 in epithelial cells had opposite impacts on intercompartmental homeostasis in the prostate. The bigenic mice provide a model with cooperative aberrations in the fibroblast growth factor signaling axis for evaluation of tumor-initiating events in prostate tumorigenesis.",

Here, FGF signaling network, cancer genetics/genomics of FGF receptors (FGFRs), and FGFR-targeted therapeutics will be reviewed. FGF signaling to RAS-MAPK branch and canonical WNT signaling cascade mutually regulate transcription programming. FGF signaling to PI3K-AKT branch and Hedgehog, Notch, TGFβ, and noncanonical WNT signaling cascades regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. Gene amplification of FGFR1 occurs in lung cancer and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and that of FGFR2 in diffuse-type gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Chromosomal translocation of FGFR1 occurs in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, as with FGFR3 in multiple myeloma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. FGFR1 and FGFR3 genes are fused to neighboring TACC1 and TACC3 genes, respectively, due to interstitial deletions in glioblastoma multiforme. Missense mutations of FGFR2 are found in endometrial uterine cancer and melanoma, and similar FGFR3 mutations in invasive bladder tumors, and FGFR4 mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. Dovitinib, Ki23057, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are orally bioavailable FGFR inhibitors, which have demonstrated striking effects in preclinical model experiments. Dovitinib, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are currently in clinical trial as anticancer drugs. Because there are multiple mechanisms of actions for FGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance, FGFR-targeted therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory cancer. Whole exome/transcriptome sequencing will be introduced to the clinical laboratory as the companion diagnostic platform facilitating patient selection for FGFR-targeted therapeutics in the era of personalized medicine.

Overexpression in tumoral breast cells was observed for 13 genes.

Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in PCa metastasis and hold great promise as therapeutic targets. In this study, we found that miR-573 expression is significantly lower in metastatic tissues than matched primary PCa. Its downregulation is correlated with high Gleason score and cancer-related mortality of PCa patients (P = 0.041, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Through gain- and loss-of function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-573 inhibits PCa cell migration, invasion and TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, miR573 directly targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene. Knockdown of FGFR1 phenocopies the effects of miR-573 expression on PCa cell invasion, whereas overexpression of FGFR1 partially attenuates the functions of miR-573. Consequently, miR-573 modulates the activation of FGFR1-downstream signaling in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Importantly, we showed that GATA3 directly increases miR-573 expression, and thus down-regulates FGFR1 expression, EMT and invasion of PCa cells in a miR-573-dependent manner, supporting the involvement of GATA3, miR-573 and FGFR1 in controlling the EMT process during PCa metastasis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-573 modulates EMT and metastasis of PCa cells, and suggest miR-573 as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for PCa management.

One of the target genes, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), has been reported to be amplified in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype breast cancer, and is considered one possible mechanism of endocrine resistance through cross-talk between ER and growth factor receptor signaling. We performed a comprehensive analysis of FGFR1 at the levels of gene copy number, transcript and protein expression, and examined the relationships between FGFR1 status and clinicopathological parameters, including prognosis in 307 ER-positive/HER2-negative primary breast cancer patients treated with standard care at our institute. Most notably, a high level of FGFR1 protein expression was observed in 85 patients (27.7%), and was positively associated with invasive tumor size (P = 0.039). Furthermore, univariate analysis revealed that high FGFR1 protein expression was significantly correlated with poor relapse-free survival rate (P = 0.0019, HR: 2.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-5.98), and showed a tendency towards an increase in recurrent events if the observation period extended beyond the 5 years of the standard endocrine treatment term. FGFR1 gain/amplification was found in 43 (14.0%) patients, which was only associated with higher nuclear grade (P = 0.010). No correlation was found between FGFR1 mRNA expression levels and any clinicopathological factors. Overall, the level of FGFR1 protein expression may be a biomarker of ER-positive/HER2-negative primary breast cancer with possible resistance to standard treatment, and may be a useful tool to identify more specific patients who would benefit from FGFR-1 targeted therapy.

These receptors are therefore potential therapeutic targets in the development of inhibitors to this pathway. To identify the most relevant targets, we simultaneously investigated FGFR1-4 expression using a prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) and in laser capture microdissected (LCM) prostate epithelial cells. In malignant prostates (n = 138) we observed significant FGFR1 and FGFR4 protein over-expression in comparison with benign prostates (n = 58; p < 0.0001). FGFR1 was expressed at high levels in the majority of tumours (69% of grade 3 or less, 74% of grade 4 and 70% of grade 5), while FGFR4 was strongly expressed in 83% of grade 5 cancers but in only 25% of grade 1-3 cancers (p < 0.0001). At the transcript level we observed a similar pattern, with FGFR1 and FGFR4 mRNA over-expressed in malignant epithelial cells compared to benign cells (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.05, respectively). While total FGFR2 was increased in some cancers, there was no association between expression and tumour grade or stage. Transcript analysis, however, revealed a switch in the predominant isoform expressed from FGFR2IIIb to FGFR2IIIc among malignant epithelial cells. In contrast, protein and transcript expression of FGFR3 was very similar between benign and cancer biopsies. The functional effect of targeting FGFR4 in prostate cancer cells has not previously been investigated. In in vitro experiments, suppression of FGFR4 by RNA interference effectively blocked prostate cancer cell proliferation (p < 0.0001) and invasion (p < 0.001) in response to exogenous stimulation. This effect was evident regardless of whether the cells expressed the FGFR4 Arg388 or Gly388 allele. In parallel experiments, FGFR3 suppression had no discernible effect on cancer cell behaviour. These results suggest evidence of selective over-expression of FGFR1 and FGFR4 in clinical prostate cancer and support the notion of targeted inhibition of these receptors to disrupt FGF signalling.",

Two independent pathologists evaluated FGFR1, FGF2, and PI3K (p110α) expressions in both tumor and stromal tissues from 99 of the patients with sufficient tissue samples, using immunohistochemistry. Considering survival analysis separately for patients with both early and advanced stage diseases, the relationship between the clinical features of the patients and expressions were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.;FGFR1 expression was found to be low in 59 (60%) patients and high in 40 (40%) patients. For FGF2; 12 (12%) patients had high, 87 (88%) patients had low expression and for IP3K; 31 (32%) patients had high and 66 (68%) patients had low expressions. In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was significantly associated with stage of the disease and the performance status of the patient (P<0.0001 and P<0.001). There was no significant difference in OS of the patients with either low or high expressions of FGFR1, FGF2, and IP3K. When the patients with early or advanced stage disease were separately taken into consideration, the relationship did not differ, either. Any of FGFR1, FGF2 or IP3K expressions was not found predictive for the treatment of early or advanced staged patients. On the other hand, the expressions of both FGFR1 and FGF2 were significantly different with respect to smoking, scar of tuberculosis and scar of radiotherapy (P=0.002; P=0.06 and P=0.05, respectively).;There has not been identified an effective individualized treatment for SqCLC yet. Therefore, in order to be able to develop such a treatment in the future, it is essential to identify the genetic abnormalities that are responsible for the biological behaviors and carcinogenesis of SqCLC.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms associated with the MUC4-induced invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Stable silencing of MUC4 in multiple pancreatic cancer cells resulted in the downregulation of N-cadherin and its interacting partner fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) through downregulation of partly by pFAK, pMKK7, pJNK and pc-Jun pathway and partly through PI-3K/Akt pathway. The downregulation of FGFR1 in turn led to downregulation of pAkt, pERK1/2, pNF-κB, pIkBα, uPA, MMP-9, vimentin, N-cadherin, Twist, Slug and Zeb1 and upregulation of E-cadherin, Occludin, Cytokeratin-18 and Caspase-9 in MUC4 knockdown BXPC3 and Capan1 cells compared with scramble vector transfected cells. Further, downregulation of FGFR1 was associated with a significant change in morphology and reorganization of the actin-cytoskeleton, leading to a significant decrease in motility (P < 0.00001) and invasion (P < 0.0001) in vitro and decreased tumorigenicity and incidence of metastasis in vivo upon orthotopic implantation in the athymic mice. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that MUC4 promotes invasion and metastasis by FGFR1 stabilization through the N-cadherin upregulation.",

Cancer Res. 70(5), 2085-2094 (2010). FGF receptor (FGFR) family members are aberrantly activated during carcinogenesis due to gene amplification, chromosomal translocation and missense mutation. FGFR1 is preferentially amplified in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, whereas FGFR2 is amplified in triple-negative breast cancer and diffuse-type gastric cancer. Gene amplification of FGFRs results in ligand-independent FGFR signaling to RAS-ERK, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT cascades due to the overexpression of wild-type or C-terminally deleted FGFRs. Cediranib, TKI258, Ki23057, MK-2461 and brivanib are broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting FGFRs and other receptors.

However, in squamous cell lung cancer, the incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutant and ALK fusion gene are low,and targeted therapy like Tarceva and crizotinib, can hardly work. Since the fibroblast growth factors (fibroblast growth factor, FGF) pathway is considered to be related to tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, more and more researches proved the amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in squamous cell lung cancer. Experiments in vivo and in vitro found that blocking FGF pathway could reduce the proliferation of tumor cells and inhibit metastasis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapeutic targeting of late-stage breast cancer is limited by an inadequate understanding of how tumor cell signaling evolves during metastatic progression and by the currently available small molecule inhibitors capable of targeting these processes. Herein, we demonstrate that both β3 integrin and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) are part of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program that is required to facilitate metastatic outgrowth in response to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2). Mechanistically, β3 integrin physically disrupts an interaction between FGFR1 and E-cadherin, leading to a dramatic redistribution of FGFR1 subcellular localization, enhanced FGF2 signaling and increased three-dimensional (3D) outgrowth of metastatic breast cancer cells. This ability of β3 integrin to drive FGFR signaling requires the enzymatic activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Consistent with these mechanistic data, we demonstrate that FGFR, β3 integrin, and FAK constitute a molecular signature capable of predicting decreased survival of patients with the basal-like subtype of breast cancer. Importantly, covalent targeting of a conserved cysteine in the P-loop of FGFR1-4 with our newly developed small molecule, FIIN-4, more effectively blocks 3D metastatic outgrowth as compared with currently available FGFR inhibitors. In vivo application of FIIN-4 potently inhibited the growth of metastatic, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts and murine-derived metastases growing within the pulmonary microenvironment. Overall, the current studies demonstrate that FGFR1 works in concert with other EMT effector molecules to drive aberrant downstream signaling, and that these events can be effectively targeted using our novel therapeutics for the treatment of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.

Personalized therapy encompasses the strategy of matching these subtypes with effective targeted therapies. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation are the most effectively targeted oncogenes in NSCLC. EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are successfully being targeted with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of molecular subgroups of NSCLC continues to grow.

However, there are very few reports on the molecular profiles of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). We therefore conducted the present Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze genomic aberrations in patients with thoracic malignancies.;We collected samples of SCLC from a biobank system and analyzed their molecular profiles. We assessed 23 mutations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis. We also amplified EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the fusion genes ALK, ROS1, and RET using reverse transcription PCR.;Between July 2011 and January 2013, 60 SCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6). EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in patients with combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of patients with and without genomic aberrations. However, serum neuron-specific enolase and progastrin-releasing peptide levels were significantly higher in patients without genomic aberrations than in those with aberrations (p=0.01 and 0.04, respectively).;Genomic aberrations were found in 15% SCLC patients, with PIK3CA amplifications most frequently observed. To further our understanding of the molecular profiles of SCLC, comprehensive mutational analyses should be conducted using massive parallel sequencing.",

However, the prognostic significance of FGFRs has not been elucidated yet in cervical cancer. In the present study, we investigate the expression of FGFRs and their prognostic value in cervical cancer patients.;FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in conjunction with quantitative digital image analysis of 336 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues and 61 normal cervical tissues, as well as NCI60 cell microarray. Subsequently, the association between clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival was assessed.;FGFRs proteins were differentially expressed in the NCI60 cell line panel and showed considerable correlation between protein and mRNA expression. The expression of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 were higher in cancer tissues than in normal tissues, whereas the expression of FGFR3 was higher in normal tissues. FGFR1 was highly expressed in adeno-/adenosquamous carcinoma (P = 0.020), while FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 expression were more prominent in squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.020, respectively). FGFR2 expression was significantly higher in small sized tumors (P = 0.020). Additionally, high FGFR2 and FGFR4 were correlated with negative lymph node metastasis (P = 0.048 and P = 0.040, respectively). FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 were highly expressed in tumors without parametrial involvement (P = 0.030, P = 0.005, and P = 0.010, respectively). In survival analysis, high expressions of FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 was associated with longer disease-free survival (P = 0.006, P = 0.035, P = 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (P = 0.003, P = 0.002, P = 0.003, respectively). Notably, the co-expression of all three FGFRs was significantly associated with favorable disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P < 0.001), compared to the negative expressions of the three FGFRs.

Although granzyme B can cleave and activate caspases to induce apoptosis, granzyme B can also cause caspase-independent cell death. Thirteen prospective granzyme B substrates were identified from a cDNA expression-cleavage screen, including Hsp70, Notch1, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), poly-A-binding protein, cAbl, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H', Br140, and intersectin-1. Validation revealed that Notch1 is a substrate of both granzyme B and caspases, whereas FGFR1 is a caspase-independent substrate of granzyme B. Proteolysis of FGFR1 in prostate cancer cells has functionally relevant consequences that indicate its cleavage may be advantageous for granzyme B to kill prostate cancer cells.

In contrast, FGFR2 is down-regulated in neoplastic thyroid cells through DNA promoter methylation. Reexpression of FGFR2 competes with FGFR1 for the immediate substrate FGFR substrate 2 to impede signaling upstream of the BRAF/MAPK pathway.

The aim of the present study was to characterize interactions between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells focusing on the Ig-domain III variants of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) 1.;Expression of FGF ligands and FGFR1-III isoforms was determined by immunoblotting and specific RT-PCR analysis, respectively.;PSCs and COLO-357, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells expressed and secreted FGF2 and FGF5. Both FGFR1-III isoforms were coexpressed in PSCs and cancer cells. Conditioned medium of COLO-357 cells induced expression of both FGFR1- III isoforms in PSCs. In contrast, conditioned medium of PSCs induced FGFR1-IIIc, but reduced FGFR1- IIIb expression in the cancer cells. Neutralizing the effects of FGFs by heparin-sepharose precipitation abolished these effects completely. FGF2 and other growth factors secreted by PSCs resulted in upregulation of FGFR1-IIIc and downregulation of FGFR1-IIIb in pancreatic cancer cells.;We identified in this study a mechanism based on tumor-stroma interactions involving PSCs that can contribute to enhance the malignant phenotype of human pancreatic cancer.",

Amplification of FGFR1 was found in 2.6% (4/155) of cases. Four per cent of tumours (5/125) were shown to express FGFR1 by immunohistochemistry. Sequence analysis demonstrated an activating KRAS mutation (exon 2) in all FGFR1-amplified cases. The FGFR1-amplified pancreatic carcinoma cell line PT45P1 showed high levels of FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression. Proliferation of this cell line can be inhibited using the FGFR1 inhibitor BGJ398.;FGFR1 represents a potential new therapeutic target in a subset of patients harbouring FGFR1-amplified tumours.

Despite recent improvements in their management, UC remain an aggressive disease associated with a poor outcome. Following disease progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, very few effective treatment options are available and none of them have shown significant improvement in overall survival. Alterations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway including amplification, mutations and overexpression are common in UC. Pre-clinical data suggest that the presence of such dysregulations may confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors.;We present here the case of a patient with a metastatic UC of the renal pelvis with lymph node metastases treated with the selective FGFR inhibitor AZD4547.;To date, the patient has been on a study drug for 32 months with acceptable tolerance and maintained radiological partial response as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Exploratory biomarker analysis showed FGFR3, FGFR1, FGF-ligand and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) expression in the patient's tumour, together with the presence of a germ-line mutation in the FGFR3 extracellular binding domain.

Many urothelial carcinomas contain activating point mutations or increased expression of FGFR3. However, little is known about the role of other FGFRs. We examined FGFR expression in telomerase-immortalized normal human urothelial cells, urothelial carcinoma cell lines, and tumor samples and showed that FGFR1 expression is increased in a high proportion of cell lines and tumors independent of stage and grade. To determine the role of FGFR1 in low-stage bladder cancer, we overexpressed FGFR1 in telomerase-immortalized normal human urothelial cells and examined changes in proliferation and cell survival in response to FGF2. FGFR1 stimulation increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for these alterations, we examined the signaling cascades activated by FGFR1. FRS2alpha and PLCgamma were activated in response to FGF2, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The level of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation correlated with the level of cyclin D1, MCL1, and phospho-BAD, which also correlated with FGFR-induced proliferation and survival. Knockdown of FGFR1 in urothelial carcinoma cell lines revealed differential FGFR1 dependence. JMSU1 cells were dependent on FGFR1 expression for survival but three other cell lines were not. Two cell lines (JMSU1 and UMUC3) were dependent on FGFR1 for growth in soft agar. Only one of the cell lines tested (UMUC3) was frankly tumorigenic; here, FGFR1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth. Our results indicate that FGFR1 has significant effects on urothelial cell phenotype and may represent a useful therapeutic target in some cases of urothelial carcinoma.",

The prognostic value of FGFR aberrations was compared among studies.;The initial search yielded 1568 publications of which 12 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four studies reported FGFR1 gene amplification (9.3-17.4 %) and FGFR1 protein overexpression (11.8 %) in HNSCC. FGFR1 protein expression by cancer-associated fibroblasts correlated with poor survival outcome in one study (p < 0.01). Eight studies reported high rates of FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphisms (32.5-54.2 %) and FGFR4 protein overexpression (16-35 %), with varying correlations with survival. So far, no studies assessed the prognostic role of FGFR2, FGFR3, or FGFR5 in HNSCC.;Significant risk of bias has been identified among included studies. Therefore, cautious interpretation of the results is recommended.;In conclusion, evidence was found for prognostic value of FGFR1 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts in HNSCC.

MPT0L145 decreased the phosphorylation of FGFR1, FGFR3 and their downstream proteins (FRS2, ERK and Akt). Mechanistically, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that MPT0L145 decreased genes associated cell cycle progression, and increased genes associated with autophagy pathway. Accordingly, the data revealed that MPT0L145 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased protein levels of cyclin E. Moreover, we provided the evidence that autophagy contributes to FGFR inhibitor-related cell death. Finally, MPT0L145 exhibited comparable antitumor activity to cisplatin with better safety in a RT-112 xenograft model.

Mutated genes were correlated with clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier methods (PFS, OS) and logistic regression (chemo-response). RB1 protein expression was detected by either western blotting of cultured cell lysates or immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens.;In all, 39 patients had ES-SCLC; 15 patients had either primary refractory/resistant disease and 21 patients had sensitive disease. The two most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (86%) and RB1 (58%); other frequently mutated genes (>10% patients) were involved in epigenetic regulation as well as the mTOR pathway. We identified a number of low-frequency, targetable mutations, including RICTOR, FGFR1, KIT, PTCH1 and RET. Using multivariate analysis, RB1 was the only significant factor (P = 0.038) in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy, with an odds ratio of 5.58 comparing mutant RB1 with wild-type. Patients with mutant RB1 had both better OS (11.7 versus 9.1 months P = 0.04) and PFS (11.2 versus 8.6 months, P = 0.06) compared with patients with wild-type RB1. Interestingly, ∼25% of SCLC cell lines and tumor specimens expressed RB1 protein, possibly representing the subgroup with wild-type RB1.;We found that SCLC tumors harboring no mutation in RB1 had a poor response to chemotherapy.",

For most primary tumors that commonly metastasize to the CNS, molecular biomarker analyses are recommended in the clinical setting for selection of appropriate targeted therapies. Therapeutic efficacy of some of these agents has been documented in patients with brain metastases, and molecular testing of CNS metastases should be considered in the clinical setting. Here, we summarize the clinically relevant biomarker tests that should be considered in neurosurgical specimens based on the current recommendations of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the most relevant primary tumor types: lung cancer (EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement, BRAF mutations), breast cancer (HER2 amplification, steroid receptor overexpression), melanoma (BRAF mutations), and colorectal cancer (RAS mutations). Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic targets including novel oncogenic alterations (ROS1 rearrangements, FGFR1 amplifications, CMET amplifications, and others) and molecular features of the tumor microenvironment (including immune-checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1). We also discuss the potential role of advanced biomarker tests such as next-generation sequencing and \"liquid biopsies\" for patients with CNS metastases. ",

Aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of FGF/FGFR-mediated signals to the malignant growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to assess their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions. Multiple FGFR mRNA splice variants were coexpressed in NSCLC cells (n = 16) with predominance of FGFR1. Accordingly, both expression of a dominant-negative FGFR1 (dnFGFR1) IIIc-green fluorescent protein fusion protein and application of FGFR small-molecule inhibitors (SU5402 and PD166866) significantly reduced growth, survival, clonogenicity, and migratory potential of the majority of NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, dnFGFR1 expression completely blocked or at least significantly attenuated s.c. tumor formation of NSCLC cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Xenograft tumors expressing dnFGFR1 exhibited significantly reduced size and mitosis rate, enhanced cell death, and decreased tissue invasion. When FGFR inhibitors were combined with chemotherapy, antagonistic to synergistic in vitro anticancer activities were obtained depending on the application schedule. In contrast, simultaneous blockage of FGFR- and epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signals exerted synergistic effects. In summary, FGFR-mediated signals in cooperation with those transmitted by epidermal growth factor receptor are involved in growth and survival of human NSCLC cells and should be considered as targets for combined therapeutic approaches.",

Gene expression profiling at distinct stages of tumor progression revealed an increase in EMT-associated Sox9 and changes in the Wnt signaling pathway, including Fzd4, which was validated in human PCa.

Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) are considered to be interesting candidates. However, the establishment of such model systems requires highly specialized research facilities and introduces logistic challenges. We aimed to establish an extensive well-characterized panel of NSCLC xenograft models in the context of a long-distance research network after careful control of the preanalytical steps. One hundred fresh surgically resected NSCLC specimens were shipped in survival medium at room temperature from a hospital-integrated biobank to animal facilities. Within 24 h post-surgery, tumor fragments were subcutaneously xenografted into immunodeficient mice. PDX characterization was performed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, aCGH and next-generation sequencing approaches. For this model system, the tumor take rate was 35%, with higher rates for squamous carcinoma (60%) than for adenocarcinoma (13%). Patients for whom PDX tumors were obtained had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients for whom no PDX tumors (P = 0.039) were obtained. We established a large panel of PDX NSCLC models with a high frequency of mutations (29%) in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MEK1, BRAF, PTEN, and PI3KCA genes and with gene amplification (20%) of c-MET and FGFR1. This new patient-derived NSCLC xenograft collection, established regardless of the considerable time required and the distance between the clinic and the animal facilities, recapitulated the histopathology and molecular diversity of NSCLC and provides stable and reliable preclinical models for human lung cancer research.

Binding of FGFs triggers the intracellular Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation. Down-regulation of FGFR1 and, consequently, inactivation of its signaling pathways represent novel treatment strategies for glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the internalization and endocytic trafficking of FGFR1 in the human glioma cell line U373. Stimulation with FGF-2 induced cell rounding accompanied by increased BrdU and pERK labeling. The overexpression of FGFR1 (without FGF treatment) resulted in enhanced phosphorylated FGFR1 suggesting receptor autoactivation. Labeled ligand (FGF-2-Cy5.5) was endocytosed in a clathrin- and caveolin-dependent manner. About 25 % of vesicles carrying fluorescently tagged FGFR1 represented early endosomes, 15 % transferrin-positive recycling endosomes and 40 % Lamp1-positive late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. Stimulation with FGF-2 increased the colocalization rate in each of these vesicle populations. The treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin resulted in FGFR1 accumulation in lysosomes, but did not enhance receptor recycling as observed in neurons. Analysis of vesicle distributions revealed an accumulation of recycling endosomes in the perinuclear region. In conclusion, the shuttling of receptor tyrosine kinases can be directly visualized by overexpression of fluorescently tagged receptors which respond to ligand stimulation and follow the recycling and degradation pathways similarly to their endogenous counterparts.",

The phenotypic uniqueness (and thus the heterogeneity of clinical behavior) among patients' tumors may be traceable to the underlying variation in gene copy number of these genes. To obtain a more complete view of gene copy number changes and their relation to phenotype, we analyzed 20 breast cancer-related genes in 104 invasive breast cancers with the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). We identified MYC gene amplification in 48% of patients, PRDM14 in 34%, topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) in 32%, ADAM9 in 32%, HER2 in 28%, cyclin D1 (CCND1) in 26%, EMSY in 25%, IKBKB in 21%, AURKA in 17%, FGFR1 in 17%, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) in 16%, CCNE1 in 12% and EGFR in 9% of patients. There was a significant correlation between the number of amplified genes and the histological grade and mitotic index of the tumor. Gene amplifications of EGFR, CCNE1 and HER2 were negatively associated with estrogen receptor status whereas FGFR1, ADAM9, IKBKB and TOP2A revealed a positive association. Amplifications of ESR1, PRDM14, MYC and HER2 were associated with a high mitotic index, and PRDM14 and HER2 amplifications with high histological grade. MYC amplification was detected more frequently in ductal tumors and high-level MYC amplifications were significantly associated with large tumor size. HER2/MYC, HER2/CCNE1 and EGFR/MYC co-amplified tumors were significantly larger than tumors with either of these amplifications. Gene loss occurred most frequently in E-cadherin (CDH1) (20%) and FGFR1 (10%). In conclusion, MLPA analysis with this 'breast cancer kit' allowed to simultaneously assess copy numbers of 20 important breast cancer genes, providing an overview of the most frequent (co)amplifications as well as interesting phenotypic correlations, and thereby data on the potential importance of these genes in breast cancer.",

Several cell models were used to investigate FGFR1 inhibition in vitro and in combination with cisplatin and irradiation. Mouse intraperitoneal xenotransplant models were used for in vivo validation.;FGFR1, FGF2, and FGF18 were overexpressed in mesothelioma. Stimulation with FGF2 led to increased cell proliferation, migration, and transition to a more sarcomatoid phenotype in subsets of mesothelioma cell lines. In contrast, inhibition of FGFR1 by a specific kinase inhibitor or a dominant-negative FGFR1 construct led to significantly decreased proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, spheroid formation, and G1 cell cycle arrest in several mesothelioma cell lines, accompanied by apoptosis induction and decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity. Reduced tumor growth, proliferation, mitogenic signaling, and apoptosis induction were observed in vivo. Inhibition of FGFR1 synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation and cisplatin.;Our data suggest that the malignant phenotype of mesothelioma cells depends on intact FGF signals, which should be considered as therapeutic targets with a promising chemo- and radiosensitizing potential.",

Thus, tumor genotyping could be a valuable approach to define breast tumor subtypes. It has been shown that it is possible to delineate subgroups of breast tumors according to specific sets of DNA amplifications. The aim of the present work was to study the prognostic significance of these DNA amplifications. We studied DNA amplification at eight genes or loci (AIB1, CCND1, EMS1, ERBB2, FGFR1, MDM2, MYC, and RMC20C001) as well as p53 mutations in a series of 640 breast cancer patients who had not received presurgical therapy and analyzed the correlations with survival DNA amplification was assessed by Southern blotting and was scored positive when exceeding three to five copies. Mutations in the p53 gene were searched by four-color fluorescent single. strand conformational polymorphism, using an automated sequencer. Of the nine genetic alterations tested, four (CCND1, EMS1, FGFR1, and p53 mutations) showed a significant association with reduced disease-free (DFS) and/or overall survival (OVS) in the unselected set of patients by univariate test. Correlations for p53 were found only when selecting mutations in exons 5 or 7. Analysis of node-negative and -positive subgroups of patients showed that MDM2 amplification and p53 mutations bore prognostic significance in node-negative patients, whereas amplification of CCND1, EMS1, and FGFR1 correlated with poor outcome in node-positive patients. Multivariate analysis on an unselected set of patients retained significance for the amplification of EMS1, FGFR1, and MDM2 with DFS, of CCND1 with OVS, and of RMC20C001 with both DFS and OVS. Interestingly, stratified analysis according to nodal status confirmed results obtained in the univariate tests: significance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutations in node-negative and that of CCND1, EMS1, and FGFR1 in node-positive patients. We also observed an association between the number of genetic alterations observed in a tumor and poor prognosis. Patients with two or more amplified loci had a worsened outcome. Strongly correlating coamplifications such as CCND1 and FGFR1, as well as ERBB2 and MYC, were associated with a significant reduction of patient survival, thus indicating cooperative effects. Our data support the idea that genetic alterations in breast cancer are not only helpful for phenotyping purposes, but can also represent powerful prognostic indicators in the clinical practice.",

Proliferation assays confirmed that MCF-7 cells were highly responsive to FGF-2 complexed with GAGB, whereas migration assays indicated that FGF-1/HSGAGA combinations were stimulatory for the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the levels of FGF receptor (FGFR) isoforms revealed that MCF-7 cells have greater levels of FGFR1 and that MDA-MB-231 cells have greater relative levels of FGFR2. Cross-linking demonstrated that FGF-2/HSGAGB primarily activated FGFR1, which in turn up-regulated the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase; in contrast, FGF-1/HSGAGA led to the phosphorylation of equal proportions of both FGFR1 and FGFR2, which in turn led to the up-regulation of Src and p125(FAK). MDA-MB-231 cells were particularly responsive to vitronectin substrates in the presence of FGF-1/HSGAGA, and blocking antibodies established that they used the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin to bind to it.

In adult parenchymal organs, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase isotypes are partitioned between stroma and epithelium, respectively, and mediate communication between the two compartments to maintain organ homeostasis. The ectopic appearance of stromal FGFR1 is a hallmark of epithelial cells from model transplantable rat prostate tumors that progress to malignancy. Here we show that, despite the fact that it is transcriptionally active, the appearance of FGFR1 in nonmalignant prostate tumor epithelial cells at first does not drive cell proliferation or support a malignant phenotype. These properties develop over time with proliferative aging of the cell population coincident with FGFR1-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Phospholipase Cgamma-interactive phosphotyrosine 766 of FGFR1 is required for the age-dependent acquisition of the proliferative response to FGFR1, although it appears not to be required for the mitogenic response. Although of little utility in late-stage therapy, this suggests that pathways linked to FGFR1 tyrosine 766 may be specific targets for prevention of progression of latent nonmalignant tumors to the life-threatening malignant state.",

However, mechanistic strategies to target tumor cells carrying such mutations are yet to be developed. This study proposes a synthetic-lethality therapy for treating cancers deficient in the SWI/SNF catalytic (ATPase) subunit, BRG1/SMARCA4. The strategy relies upon inhibition of BRM/SMARCA2, another catalytic SWI/SNF subunit with a BRG1-related activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) indicated that 15.5% (16 of 103) of the cohort, corresponding to preferentially undifferentiated tumors, was deficient in BRG1 expression. All BRG1-deficient cases were negative for alterations in known therapeutic target genes, for example, EGFR and DDR2 gene mutations, ALK gene fusions, or FGFR1 gene amplifications. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of BRM suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient cancer cells relative to BRG1-proficient cancer cells, inducing senescence via activation of p21/CDKN1A. This growth suppression was reversed by transduction of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient BRG1. In support of these in vitro results, a conditional RNAi study conducted in vivo revealed that BRM depletion suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient tumor xenografts. Our results offer a rationale to develop BRM-ATPase inhibitors as a strategy to treat BRG1/SMARCA4-deficient cancers, including NSCLCs that lack mutations in presently known therapeutic target genes.",

Similarly, in skin, FGF-2 was expressed within the dermis whereas FGFR1 mRNA and peptide were most apparent in the stratum germinativum of the epidermis. In kidney and lung, FGFR1 mRNA was located in the tubular and alveolar epithelia respectively, whereas FGF-2 was expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations. Both growth factor and receptor were widespread in both neuroblasts and glioblasts in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Immunoreactivity for FGF-2 and FGFR1 was seen in all vascular endothelial cells of major vessels and capillaries. Within the skin, kidney, lung, and intestine FGF-2 immunoreactivity was found in basement membranes underlying epithelia, and was associated with the extracellular matrix and plasma membranes of many cell types. The results show that FGF-2 and one of its receptors are widely expressed anatomically in the mid-trimester human fetus.",

A significant reduction in FGFR2(IIIc) expression is also observed in 80% of tumors (P = 0.001).

It has been reported that epithelial mesenchymal-transition (EMT) plays a significant role during multiple types of tumor metastasis and progression induced by inflammatory factor from tumor microenvironment. Previous researches implied that fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) can promote tumor progression and cause poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors via interacting with its receptor fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, the effects of FGF1-FGFR1 on tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) are not yet completely understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects and function of FGF1-FGFR1 axis on TSCC metastasis. In addition, we investigated whether the EMT pathway is involved in these effects, thus modulating the TSCC progression. The expression of FGFR1 was measured both in tongue cancer cell lines and tissues by qRT-PCR and western blot. We found that FGFR1 was up-regulated in TSCC tissues compared to non-neoplastic tongue tissues. Additionally, overexpression of FGFR1 is positively associated with poor differentiation and metastasis potential. Furthermore, the function of FGF1-FGFR1 was examined in TSCC cell line. The results implied that FGF1 can obviously promote Cal27 cells migration and invasion abilities through FGFR1, while the motile and invasive capabilities can be severely attenuated when knockdown the expression of FGFR1 by specific siRNAs. Further investigation results show that FGF1-FGFR1 axis promotes TSCC metastasis by modulating EMT pathway. However, this effect can be inhibited by blocking the FGF1-FGFR1 axis using FGFR1 specific siRNAs. In conclusion, our findings of the present study provide the evidences that FGF1-FGFR1 axis promotes the TSCC metastasis through the EMT pathway. ",

Recently, small-molecule inhibitors that can inhibit the FGFR family as well as the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family displayed clinical benefits in cohorts of patients with FGFR genetic alterations. However, to achieve more potent and prolonged activity in such populations, a selective FGFR inhibitor is still needed. Here, we report the identification of CH5183284/Debio 1347, a selective and orally available FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 inhibitor that has a unique chemical scaffold. By interacting with unique residues in the ATP-binding site of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3, CH5183284/Debio 1347 selectively inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 but does not inhibit kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) or other kinases. Consistent with its high selectivity for FGFR enzymes, CH5183284/Debio 1347 displayed preferential antitumor activity against cancer cells with various FGFR genetic alterations in a panel of 327 cancer cell lines and in xenograft models. Because of its unique binding mode, CH5183284/Debio 1347 can inhibit FGFR2 harboring one type of the gatekeeper mutation that causes resistance to other FGFR inhibitors and block FGFR2 V564F-driven tumor growth.

Aberrant angiogenesis leads to enormous pathological conditions such as ischemia and cancer. MicroRNAs (also known as miRNAs or miRs) play key roles in regulation of a range of cellular processes by posttranscriptional suppression of their target genes. Recently, new studies have indicated that miRNAs are involved in certain angiogenic settings and signaling pathways use these non-coding RNAs to promote or suppress angiogenic processes. Herein, VEGFR2 and FGFR1 were identified as miR-129-1 and miR-133 targets using bioinformatic algorithms, respectively. Afterwards, using luciferase reporter assay and gene expression analysis at both mRNA and protein levels, VEGFR2 and FGFR1 were validated as miR-129-1 and miR-133 targets. In addition, we showed that miR-129-1 and miR-133 suppress angiogenesis properties such as proliferation rate, cell viability, and migration activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. We conclude that these miRNAs can suppress key factors of angiogenesis by directly targeting them.

Here, we find CRIPTO expression as especially high in a subgroup of primary prostate carcinomas with poorer outcome, wherein resides cancer cell clones with mesenchymal traits. Experimental studies in PCa models showed that one notable function of CRIPTO expression in prostate carcinoma cells may be to augment PI3K/AKT and FGFR1 signaling, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and sustains a mesenchymal state. In the observed signaling events, FGFR1 appears to function parallel to AKT, and the two pathways act cooperatively to enhance migratory, invasive and transformation properties specifically in the CRIPTO overexpressing cells.

This crosstalk enforces aggressive CD44(+)IGF1R(+)CSF1R(+) LC phenotypes, including extranodal invasion and chemoresistance. Inducible EC-selective deletion of Fgfr1 or Jag1 in the Eμ-Myc lymphoma model or impairing Notch2 signaling in mouse and human LCs diminished lymphoma aggressiveness and prolonged mouse survival.

A total of 39 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between 16 primary CRC tissues with liver metastases and 16 CRC tissues without liver metastases from 32 patients by Affymetric miRNA microarrays. A panel of eight miRNAs were confirmed to be significantly and differentially expressed between CRC tissues with and without liver metastases through quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in the 32 patients. In a validated cohort of 99 CRC patients (44 with and 55 without liver metastases), only miR-214 was validated to be significantly down-regulated in CRC with liver metastases, which was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Ectopic expression of miR-214 suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, tumor growth and liver metastasis in an in vivo xenograft mouse model, whereas miR-214 knockdown promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRC cell lines. Further studies indicated that fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was a potential target of miR-214. Restoring miR-214 expression in CRC cells decreased endogenous FGFR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. FGFR1 knockdown mimicked the tumor suppressive effect of miR-214 on CRC cells, while reintroduction of FGFR1 abolished the tumor suppressive effect of miR-214 on CRC cells. Moreover, miR-214 expression levels were inversely correlated with FGFR1 in CRC patients.;Down-regulation of miR-214 expression was correlated with increased FGFR1 expression levels, which may contribute to increased CRC liver metastasis. miR-214 may serve as a potential marker to predict survival, and the miR-214-FGFR1 axis may be a therapeutic target in CRC patients.",

To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B, BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and TP53 are representative miR-125b targets.

Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.

HPV-positive tumors showed unique mutations in DDX3X, FGFR2/3 and aberrations in PIK3CA, KRAS, MLL2/3, and NOTCH1 were enriched in HPV-positive tumors. Currently targetable genomic alterations were identified in FGFR1, DDR2, EGFR, FGFR2/3, EPHA2, and PIK3CA. EGFR, CCND1, and FGFR1 amplifications occurred in HPV-negative tumors, whereas 17.6% of HPV-positive tumors harbored mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (FGFR2/3), including six recurrent FGFR3 S249C mutations. HPV-positive tumors showed a 5.8% incidence of KRAS mutations, and DNA-repair gene aberrations, including 7.8% BRCA1/2 mutations, were identified.;The mutational makeup of HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC differs significantly, including targetable genes. HNSCC harbors multiple therapeutically important genetic aberrations, including frequent aberrations in the FGFR and PI3K pathway genes. See related commentary by Krigsfeld and Chung, p. 495.",

Elevated levels of FGF8 mRNA were found in malignant compared to non-malignant breast tissues with significantly more malignant tissues expressing FGF8 (P=0.019) at significantly higher levels (P=0.031). In situ hybridization of breast cancer tissues and analysis of purified populations of normal epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines showed that malignant epithelial cells expressed FGF8 mRNA at high levels compared to non-malignant epithelial and myoepithelial cells and fibroblasts. Although two of the receptors which FGF8 binds to (FGFR2-IIIc, FGFR3-IIIc) are not expressed in breast cancer cells, an autocrine activation loop is possible since expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 4 and FGFR1 are retained in malignant epithelial cells.

Although microRNAs regulate all the major biological mechanisms, their influence on tumor microenvironment is largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the role of microRNAs in the tumor-supportive capacity of stromal cells. We demonstrated that miR-15 and miR-16 are downregulated in fibroblasts surrounding the prostate tumors of the majority of 23 patients analyzed. Such downregulation of miR-15 and miR-16 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promoted tumor growth and progression through the reduced post-transcriptional repression of Fgf-2 and its receptor Fgfr1, which act on both stromal and tumor cells to enhance cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration. Moreover, reconstitution of miR-15 and miR-16 impaired considerably the tumor-supportive capability of stromal cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest a molecular circuitry in which miR-15 and miR-16 and their correlated targets cooperate to promote tumor expansion and invasiveness through the concurrent activity on stromal and cancer cells, thus providing further support to the development of therapies aimed at reconstituting miR-15 and miR-16 in advanced prostate cancer.",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

Given its role in the activation of critical signaling pathways, aberrant FGFR signaling has been implicated in multiple cancer types. A comprehensive search of PubMed and congress abstracts was conducted to identify reports on FGFR pathway components in breast cancer. In breast cancers, FGFR1 and FGFR4 gene amplification and single nucleotide polymorphisms in FGFR2 and FGFR4 have been detected. Commonly, these FGFR aberrations and gene amplifications lead to increased FGFR signaling and have been linked with poor prognosis and resistance to breast cancer treatments. Here, we review the role of FGFR signaling and the impact of FGFR genetic amplifications/aberrations on breast tumors. In addition, we summarize the most recent preclinical and clinical data on FGFR-targeted therapies in breast cancer. Finally, we highlight the ongoing clinical trials of the FGFR-targeted agents dovitinib, AZD4547, lucitanib, BGJ398, and JNJ-42756493, which are selected for patients with FGFR pathway-amplified breast cancer. Aberrant FGFR pathway amplification may drive some breast cancers.

Concurrently, the level of FGFR2 gene expression is reduced and lost altogether in over 30% of cells, whereas all malignant cells abnormally express FGFR1, which is normally confined to stromal cells (S. Feng et al., Cancer Res., 57:5369-5378, 1997). To determine the relative roles of the FGFR2 and FGFR1 kinases in growth of malignant cells, we transfected malignant prostate epithelial cells with the wild-type FGFR2IIIb kinase and an artificial chimeric construct (FGFR2IIIb/R1) composed of the FGFR2IIIb ectodomain and the FGFR1 kinase domain. Population growth kinetics, in both the absence and presence of FGF-7, which binds only the FGFR2IIIb ectodomain, were then examined in the transfected cell populations. In contrast to the untransfected malignant tumor cells and those expressing the FGFR2IIIb/R1 chimera, FGF-7 caused a dose-dependent net inhibition of the population growth rates of cells expressing the full-length FGFR2IIIb kinase. The results suggest that although the FGFR2 kinase can mediate positive mitogenic effects, it mediates a net restriction on the growth of prostate tumor epithelial cells relative to FGFR1. Highly malignant prostate tumor cells, which have lost the FGFR2 tyrosine kinase, retain the cellular response mechanisms to it. Restoration of the FGFR2 kinase to malignant tumors that are refractory to treatment may present a new avenue for gene therapy.",

The basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family comprises at least 4 high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors that require syndecans for their function. Mounting evidence indicates that syndecans, that bind both bFGF and their FGFRs, will act as stimulators, whereas syndecans that only bind bFGF will act as inhibitors of signaling by sequestering the growth factor. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of syndecans in urological cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of bFGF, its receptors (R1 and R2) and syndecans (1-4) in invasive urothelial carcinoma and normal-looking urothelium by Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses. Interestingly, bFGF, FGFR1 and FGFR2 protein levels statistically increased in bladder cancer tissues. mRNA of FGFR1 and syndecans (1-4), showed a statistically significant increase while an mRNA increase in the other molecules analysed was not significant. bFGF, its receptors and syndecan immunostaining were mainly present in the urothelium both in normal-looking tissues and urothelial neoplastic cells.

However, there is little information available as to the function and signaling of RTKs in colon cancers. In the present study, we performed protein array technology to determine the expression status of various RTKs that are activated in colon cancer compared to normal colonic cells and tissues. Of the 42 different phospho-RTKs, 5 (ErbB2, FGFR1, FGFR2a, FGFR3 and MSPR) were activated in Caco-2, SW480, WiDr, Lovo colon cancer cell lines and cancerous tissues. In order to determine the effect of inhibition of RTKs, especially ErbB2, athymic nude mice bearing xenograft tumors were treated with the ErbB2-targeting drug trastuzumab alone, or in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Similar to the treatment of 5-FU alone, trastuzumab suppressed the growth of colon cancer. Combination therapy of trastuzumab and 5-FU inhibited tumor growth significantly compared to the treatment of 5-FU alone or trastuzumab alone. In addition, xenograft tumors were also analyzed by phospho-MAPK protein array. The activity of Akt3/PKBgamma was inhibited with 5-FU alone and trastuzumab, indicating that trastuzumab may inhibit colon cancer growth through ErbB2-Akt3/PKBgamma signaling. These data demonstrate that ErbB2 could be an important candidate for colon cancer therapy and the addition of trastuzumab to 5-FU therapy might augment the clinical response in colon cancer patients. Therefore, the analysis of phospho-RTK expression by protein array as a useful tool might identify novel therapies for individual patients with colon cancer.",

To address these problems and improve clinical outcomes of current personalized gene-targeted cancer therapy, we have developed a micropillar/microwell chip platform, which is ideally suited for encapsulating primary cancer cells in nanoscale spots of hydrogels on the chip, generating efficacy data with various drugs, eventually allowing for a comparison of the in vitro data obtained from the chip with clinical data as well as gene expression data. As a proof of concept in this study, we have encapsulated a U251 brain cancer cell line and three primary brain cancer cells from patients (448T, 464T, and 775T) in 30 nL droplets of alginate and then tested the therapeutic efficacy of 24 anticancer drugs by measuring their dose responses. As a result, the IC50 values of 24 anticancer drugs obtained from the brain cancer cells clearly showed patient cell-specific efficacy, some of which were well-correlated with their oncogene overexpression (c-Met and FGFR1) as well as the in vivo previous results of the mouse xenograft model with the three primary brain cancer cells.

An anti-FGFR3 antibody was redesigned here to create function-blocking antibodies that bind with dual specificity to FGFR3 and FGFR2 but spare FGFR1 and FGFR4. R3Mab, a previously developed monospecific anti-FGFR3 antibody, was modified via structure-guided phage display and acquired additional binding to FGFR2. The initial variant was trispecific, binding tightly to FGFR3 and FGFR2 and moderately to FGFR4, while sparing FGFR1. The X-ray crystallographic structure indicated that the antibody variant was bound to a similar epitope on FGFR2 as R3Mab on FGFR3. The antibody was further engineered to decrease FGFR4-binding affinity while retaining affinity for FGFR3 and FGFR2. The resulting dual-specific antibodies blocked FGF binding to FGFR3 and FGFR2 and inhibited downstream signaling. Moreover, they displayed efficacy in mice against human tumor xenografts overexpressing FGFR3 or FGFR2. Thus, a monospecific antibody can be exquisitely tailored to confer or remove binding to closely related targets to expand and refine therapeutic potential.",

Pericellular matrix heparan sulfate (HS) is an integral subunit of the FGFR tyrosine kinase complex that restricts activity in absence of FGF, facilitates binding of an activating FGF, and confers specificity for FGF isoforms. In this report, we isolated and purified HS proteoglycan (HSPG) from premalignant prostate tumor epithelial cells based on the ability of the HS chains to form a binary complex with immunoglobulin module II of the ectopic and progression-promoting FGFR1 that was competent to bind FGF. The FGFR1 affinity-purified product exhibited a specific activity of over 600 times that of crude cellular HSPG enriched from cell lysates by ion exchange chromatography. The purified preparation exhibited a single NH(2)-terminal sequence with 11 of 13 residues identical to syndecan-1. The activity of purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged syndecan-1 expressed in premalignant epithelial cells confirmed that syndecan-1 bears HS chains that exhibit the rare motif that forms the FGF-binding complex with ectopic FGFR1. These results are the first to identify by affinity purification a specific HSPG core protein, the HS chains of which act as an integral subunit of the FGFR complex. The results suggest that syndecan-1 provides HS chains in premalignant epithelial cells to both the FGFR2- and FGFR1-signaling complexes that are integral to their dual roles in progression to malignancy.",

This transfection eliminated FGF signaling within the breast cancer cells without interfering with their ability to produce FGF-1, thereby allowing possible paracrine effects to still be observed in vivo. Truncated FGFR1 overexpression inhibited the acquired ability of FGF-1-overexpressing cells to form colonies in soft agar in estrogen-depleted or antiestrogen-containing medium. However, soft agar colony formation was still stimulated by estrogen treatment in cells expressing up to 6 x 10(5) truncated FGFR1 sites per cell. In vivo, truncated receptor expression severely inhibited the ability of the FGF-1-overexpressing cells to form tumors without estrogen in ovariectomized mice, indicating that the mitogenic effect of FGF-1 on the breast tumor cells was important in the estrogen-independent in vivo growth of these transfectants. However, rapid formation of large tumors was still observed in estrogen-supplemented mice injected with the truncated FGFR1-expressing cells, suggesting that the paracrine effects of FGF production could act in synergy with mitogenic effects mediated by estrogen. Truncated FGFR1-overexpressing cells also continued to form tumors in tamoxifen-treated mice, raising the possibility that the paracrine effects of FGF-1 expression may allow the partial agonist properties of this antiestrogen to be more readily observed. We conclude that autocrine effects of FGF-1 increase the ability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to grow in vitro and in vivo under estrogen-depleted conditions but that paracrine effects of FGF-1 are also involved in the enhancement of tumor growth in estrogen-supplemented or tamoxifen-treated animals.",

We previously demonstrated that opioid binding protein cell adhesion molecule (OPCML) was frequently epigenetically inactivated in epithelial ovarian cancers, with tumor suppressor function in vitro and in vivo. Here, we further show the clinical relevance of OPCML and demonstrate that OPCML functions by a novel mechanism in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and normal ovarian surface epithelial cells by regulating a specific repertoire of receptor tyrosine kinases: EPHA2, FGFR1, FGFR3, HER2, and HER4. OPCML negatively regulates receptor tyrosine kinases by binding their extracellular domains, altering trafficking via nonclathrin-dependent endocytosis, and promoting their degradation via a polyubiquitination-associated proteasomal mechanism leading to signaling and growth inhibition. Exogenous recombinant OPCML domain 1-3 protein inhibited the cell growth of epithelial ovarian cancers cell in vitro and in vivo in 2 murine ovarian cancer intraperitoneal models that used an identical mechanism. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of OPCML-mediated tumor suppression and provide a proof-of-concept for recombinant OPCML protein therapy in epithelial ovarian cancers.;The OPCML tumor suppressor negatively regulates a specific spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases in ovarian cancer cells by binding to their extracellular domain and altering trafficking to a nonclathrin, caveolin-1–associated endosomal pathway that results in receptor tyrosine kinase polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

This report describes the results of clinical tumor and germline WES for a patient with a rare tumor diagnosis, rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor of the fourth ventricle (RGNT). Three pathogenic gene alterations with implications for clinical care were identified: somatic activating hotspot mutations in FGFR1 (p.N546K) and PIK3CA (p.H1047R) and a germline pathogenic variant in PTPN11 (p.N308S) diagnostic for Noonan syndrome. The molecular landscape of RGNT is not well-described, but these data are consistent with prior observations regarding the importance of the interconnected MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in this rare tumor. The co-occurrence of FGFR1, PIK3CA, and PTPN11 alterations provides further evidence for consideration of RGNT as a distinct molecular entity from pediatric low-grade gliomas and suggests potential therapeutic strategies for this patient in the event of tumor recurrence as novel agents targeting these pathways enter pediatric clinical trials. Although RGNT has not been definitively linked with cancer predisposition syndromes, two prior cases have been reported in patients with RASopathies (Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]), providing an additional link between these tumors and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In summary, this case provides an example of the potential for genome-scale sequencing technologies to provide insight into the biology of rare tumors and yield both tumor and germline results of potential relevance to patient care.

Alternative splicing of the human FGF-8 gene potentially allows coding for four protein isoforms (a, b, e, and f). These isoforms differ in their binding to FGF receptors (FGFR) and in their mitogenic and transforming capacity in transfection assays. Here, we used RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to study the expression of FGF-8 and FGFR isoforms in human prostate cancer (n = 31). Nonmalignant prostate specimens from cystoprostatectomies (n = 24) were examined as controls. Most prostate cancer samples and some control prostates also contained prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions. FGF-8a and e were expressed at significantly higher frequencies in prostate cancer (FGF-8a, 55%; FGF-8e, 45%) than in control samples (FGF-8a, 17%, p = 0.0052; FGF-8e, 8%, p = 0.0031). On the contrary, FGF-8b was found at an equal frequency in prostate cancer (55%) and in control prostates (50%). Furthermore, a combination of two or three FGF-8 isoforms (a, b, and/or e) was also expressed at a higher frequency in prostate cancer than in control samples (45% and 8%, respectively, p = 0.0031). Immunohistochemistry with an antibody recognizing all FGF-8 isoforms was more strongly immunoreactive in prostate cancer cells and PIN lesions than in normal-type epithelium. The receptor splicing variants FGFR1IIIc and FGFR2IIIc, which are activated by FGF-8, were found both in prostate cancer and control samples. Interestingly, immunoreactivity for FGFR1 and FGFR2 was much stronger in prostate cancer cells and PIN than in normal epithelium. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that FGF-8 isoforms and their receptors FGFR1IIIc and FGFR2IIIc are expressed at an increased level not only in prostate cancer but also in premalignant PIN lesions. These data suggest that FGF-8 may have an important autocrine role in the development of human prostate cancer. In addition to FGF-8b, the FGF-8 isoforms a and e may be involved in this process.",

We investigated the extent to which protein mutations with functional consequences are enriched in clusters at conserved positions across related proteins. We found that disease-causing mutations form clusters more than random mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms, confirming that mutation hotspots occur at the domain level. In addition to helping to identify functionally significant mutations, analysis of clustered mutations can indicate the mechanism and consequences for protein function. Our analysis focused on somatic cancer mutations suggests functional impact for many, including singleton mutations in FGFR1, FGFR3, GFI1B, PIK3CG, RALB, RAP2B, and STK11.

Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) regulates the last step of glycolysis that generates lactate and permits the regeneration of NAD(+). LDH-A gene expression is believed to be upregulated by both HIF and Myc in cancer cells to achieve increased lactate production. However, how oncogenic signals activate LDH-A to regulate cancer cell metabolism remains unclear. We found that the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1 directly phosphorylates LDH-A. Phosphorylation at Y10 and Y83 enhances LDH-A activity by enhancing the formation of active, tetrameric LDH-A and the binding of LDH-A substrate NADH, respectively. Moreover, Y10 phosphorylation of LDH-A is common in diverse human cancer cells, which correlates with activation of multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, cancer cells with stable knockdown of endogenous LDH-A and rescue expression of a catalytic hypomorph LDH-A mutant, Y10F, demonstrate increased respiration through mitochondrial complex I to sustain glycolysis by providing NAD(+). However, such a compensatory increase in mitochondrial respiration in Y10F cells is insufficient to fully sustain glycolysis. Y10 rescue cells show decreased cell proliferation and ATP levels under hypoxia and reduced tumor growth in xenograft nude mice.

By intersecting genome-wide gene expression and genomic alteration data with cell line-sensitivity data across an annotated collection of cancer cell lines called the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, we show that genetic alterations for FGFR family members predict for sensitivity to NVP-BGJ398. For the first time, we report oncogenic FGFR1 amplification in osteosarcoma as a potential patient selection biomarker. Furthermore, we show that cancer cell lines harboring FGF19 copy number gain at the 11q13 amplicon are sensitive to NVP-BGJ398 only when concomitant expression of β-klotho occurs. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for the clinical development of FGFR inhibitors in selected patients with cancer harboring tumors with the identified predictors of sensitivity.;The success of a personalized medicine approach using targeted therapies ultimately depends on being able to identify the patients who will benefit the most from any given drug.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients' primary (n = 4) or metastatic (n = 2) breast cancers were utilized for targeted next-generation sequencing and reversed phase protein microarray. Two patients received capecitabine monotherapy. Four patients received capecitabine in combination with paclitaxel; three of these continued single-agent capecitabine after stopping paclitaxel. Capecitabine was discontinued for progressive disease after a mean of 66 months in four patients (range 54-86 months), and two patients remain on therapy, having received capecitabine for >91 months and >122 months, respectively. Three patients' cancers (50%) had likely functional alterations in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling genes, while three other patients' cancers had variants of unknown significance in these pathways. Mutations in PIK3CA, amplifications of FGFR1 or ZNF703, or phosphorylation of HER family receptors and their downstream proteins did not preclude exceptional responses to capecitabine. None of the patients' tumors harbored TP53 or PTEN mutations. Four of the patients had breast cancer tissue available for PTEN immunohistochemistry, and all four patients' cancers were positive for PTEN. These surprising findings in a group of phenotypically similar patients with ER-positive, endocrine therapy-pretreated, HER2-negative metastases, are supported by preclinical data showing that sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil is enhanced by deficiencies in chromatin remodeling and homologous recombination genes. Our findings suggest that mutations that inactivate homologous recombination and/or chromatin remodeling genes within ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers may predict for highly durable responses to capecitabine.",

The utility of agents modulating hormone receptors, synthesis of steroid hormones, or HER2-targeting agents has been greatly enhanced by the detection of predictive biomarkers in diagnostic tumor samples. Based on deeper understanding of breast cancer biology multiple drug candidates have been developed to modulate additional molecular targets which may associate with specific biomarker profiles. Accordingly, exploratory biomarkers are increasingly incorporated in early clinical trials, thus demanding a new process of patient selection. Here, we describe the implementation of preemptive, multiplexed biomarker profiling linked to standard diagnostic algorithms for metastatic breast cancer patients treated at the West German Cancer Center. Profiling for experimental biomarkers was prospectively offered to patients with metastatic breast cancer who met generic clinical trial inclusion criteria. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were retrieved and studied for potentially “actionable” biomarkers related to active clinical trials by immunohistochemistry, amplicon sequencing, and in situ hybridization. The clinical course of those “profiled” patients was closely monitored to offer trial participation whenever applicable. Here, we report results from the first 131 patients enrolled in this program. PIK3CA mutations (23 %) and amplifications (2 %), loss of PTEN expression (13 %), and FGFR1 amplifications (8 %) were detected next to established biomarkers such as estrogen (67 %) and progesterone receptor expression (52 %), and HER2 overexpression or amplification (23 %). So far 16 “profiled” patients (12 %) have been enrolled in biomarker-stratified early clinical trials. Preemptive profiling of investigational biomarkers can be integrated into the diagnostic algorithm of a large Comprehensive Cancer Center. Extensive administrative efforts are required to successfully enroll “profiled” patients with metastatic breast cancer in early clinical trials stratified by exploratory biomarkers.",

Many of the cell lines displayed prominent, localized DNA amplifications by CGH. One-third of these loci affected breast cancer oncogenes, whose amplifications were validated with specific probes: 17q12 (two cell lines with ERBB2 amplifications), 11q13 (two with cyclin-D1), 8p11-p12 (two with FGFR1) and 10q25 (one with FGFR2). Gains and amplifications affecting 8q were the most common genetic alterations in these cell lines with the minimal, common region of involvement at 8q22-q23. No high-level MYC (at 8q24) amplifications were found in any of the cell lines. Two-thirds of the amplification sites took place at loci not associated with established oncogenes, such as 1q41-q43, 7q21-q22, 7q31, 8q23, 9p21-p23, 11p12-p14, 15q12-q14, 16q13-q21, 17q23, 20p11-p12 and 20q13. Several of these locations have not been previously reported and may harbour important genes whose amplification is selected for during cancer development. In summary, this set of breast cancer cell lines displaying prominent DNA amplifications should facilitate discovery and functional analysis of genes and signal transduction pathways contributing to breast cancer development.",

Regarding histologic type, characteristic patterns of copy number changes were revealed. They correlated with histologic tumor type and with intratumoral heterogeneity. Gain of FGF3/4 and CCNE1 was found in all serous carcinomas. Endometrioid carcinomas most frequently showed gain of JUNB (83%), KRAS2 (67%), MYCN (50%), ESR (50%), and CCND2 (50%). Of the serous borderline tumors, 80% harbored amplification of FGFR1 and MDM2 and a 75% gain of PIK3CA.

However, the mechanisms of EMT-mediated drug resistance remain poorly defined. Therefore, we conducted long-term treatments of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2)-transformed breast cancer cells with either the EGFR/Her2 kinase inhibitor, Lapatinib or TGF-β, a known physiological inducer of EMT. Both of these treatment regimes resulted in robust EMT phenotypes, but upon withdrawal a subpopulation of TGF-β induced cells readily underwent mesenchymal-epithelial transition, where as Lapatinib-induced cells failed to reestablish an epithelial population. The mesenchymal population that remained following TGF-β stimulation and withdrawal was quickly selected for during subsequent Lapatinib treatment, manifesting in inherent drug resistance. The Nanostring cancer progression gene panel revealed a dramatic upregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and its cognate ligand FGF2 in both acquired and inherent resistance. Mechanistically, FGF:Erk1/2 signaling functions to stabilize the EMT transcription factor Twist and thus maintain the mesenchymal and drug resistant phenotype. Finally, Lapatinib resistant cells could be readily eliminated using recently characterized covalent inhibitors of FGFR. Overall our data demonstrate that next-generation targeting of FGFR can be used in combination with Her2-targeted therapies to overcome resistance in this breast cancer subtype.",

Therefore, with the hope of targeting unique aspects of metastatic tumor outgrowth, we sought to identify molecular markers that could identify tumor cells that had completed the EMT:MET cycle.;An in vivo reporter system for epithelial cadherin (E-cad) expression was used to quantify its regulation in metastatic BC cells during primary and metastatic tumor growth. Exogenous addition of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) was used to induce EMT in an in situ model of BC. Microarray analysis was employed to examine gene expression changes in cells chronically treated with and withdrawn from TGF-β1, thus completing one full EMT:MET cycle. Changes in fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 (FGFR1) isoform expression were validated using PCR analyses of patient-derived tumor tissues versus matched normal tissues. FGFR1 gene expression was manipulated using short hairpin RNA depletion and cDNA rescue. Preclinical pharmacological inhibition of FGFR kinase was employed using the orally available compound BGJ-398.;Metastatic BC cells undergo spontaneous downregulation of E-cad during primary tumor growth, and its expression subsequently returns following initiation of metastatic outgrowth. Exogenous exposure to TGF-β1 was sufficient to drive the metastasis of an otherwise in situ model of BC and was similarly associated with a depletion and return of E-cad expression during metastatic progression. BC cells treated and withdrawn from TGF-β stably upregulate a truncated FGFR1-β splice variant that lacks the outermost extracellular immunoglobulin domain. Identification of this FGFR1 splice variant was verified in metastatic human BC cell lines and patient-derived tumor samples. Expression of FGFR1-β was also dominant in a model of metastatic outgrowth where depletion of FGFR1 and pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR kinase activity both inhibited pulmonary tumor outgrowth. Highlighting the dichotomous nature of FGFR splice variants and recombinant expression of full-length FGFR1-α also blocked pulmonary tumor outgrowth.;The results of our study strongly suggest that FGFR1-β is required for the pulmonary outgrowth of metastatic BC. Moreover, FGFR1 isoform expression can be used as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic application of its kinase inhibitors.",

Here we demonstrate that miR-1188 is significantly down-regulated in mouse hepatoma cells compared with normal liver tissues. Enhanced miR-1188 suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibits the tumor growth of HCC cells in vivo. Moreover, overexpressed miR-1188 promotes apoptosis, enhances caspase-3 activity, and also up-regulates the expression of Bax and p53. MiR-1188 directly targets and negatively regulates Bcl-2 and Sp1. Silencing of Bcl-2 and Sp1 exactly copies the proapoptotic and anti-invasive effects of miR-1188, respectively.

Functional genomics approaches offer a means to discover specific molecules mediating the aberrant growth and survival of cancer cells. Thus, using a loss-of-function RNA interference genomic screen, we identified the aberrant expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a crucial element in AML pathogenesis. We found HGF expression leading to autocrine activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, MET, in nearly half of the AML cell lines and clinical samples we studied. Genetic depletion of HGF or MET potently inhibited the growth and survival of HGF-expressing AML cells. However, leukemic cells treated with the specific MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib developed resistance resulting from compensatory upregulation of HGF expression, leading to the restoration of MET signaling. In cases of AML where MET is coactivated with other tyrosine kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET blocked this compensatory HGF upregulation, resulting in sustained logarithmic cell killing both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Our results show a widespread dependence of AML cells on autocrine activation of MET, as well as the key role of compensatory upregulation of HGF expression in maintaining leukemogenic signaling by this receptor. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the design of additional strategies to block adaptive cellular responses that drive compensatory ligand expression as an essential component of the targeted inhibition of oncogenic receptors in human cancers.",

A number of different genes have been shown to be associated with cases of tooth agenesis including AXIN2, IRF6, FGFR1, MSX1, PAX9, and TGFA. Of particular interest is AXIN2, which was linked to two families segregating oligodontia and colorectal cancer. We studied two collections of families affected with tooth agenesis and tested them for association with AXIN2. Significant association between tooth agenesis and AXIN2 was found (p=0.02) in cases with at least one missing incisor. Our work further supports a role of AXIN2 in human tooth agenesis and for the first time suggests AXIN2 is involved in sporadic forms of common incisor agenesis. Future studies should identify which specific tooth agenesis sub-phenotypes are consequence of AXIN2 genetic variations. A sub-set of these cases could have an increased susceptibility for colon cancer or other types of tumours and this knowledge would have significant clinical implications.",

Tumor relapse in patients with initially excised skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) is characterized by increased metastatic potential, and SCC progression is associated with an expansion of CSC. Here, we used genetically and chemically-induced mouse models of skin SCC to investigate the signaling pathways contributing to CSC function during disease progression. We found that CSC regulatory mechanisms change in advanced SCC, correlating with aggressive tumor growth and enhanced metastasis. β-Catenin and EGFR signaling, induced in early SCC CSC, were downregulated in advanced SCC. Instead, autocrine FGFR1 and PDGFRα signaling, which have not been previously associated with skin SCC CSC, were upregulated in late CSC and promoted tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. Finally, high-grade and recurrent human skin SCC recapitulated the signaling changes observed in advanced mouse SCC. Collectively, our findings suggest a stage-specific switch in CSC regulation during disease progression that could be therapeutically exploited by targeting the PDGFR and FGFR1 pathways to block relapse and metastasis of advanced human skin SCC.",

An issue is the optimal tissue source (primary tumor or metastasis) for testing. We compared the DNA copy number and mutational profiles of primary breast cancers and paired metastases from 23 patients using whole-genome array-comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing of 365 \"cancer-associated\" genes. Primary tumors and metastases harbored copy number alterations (CNAs) and mutations common in breast cancer and showed concordant profiles. The global concordance regarding CNAs was shown by clustering and correlation matrix, which showed that each metastasis correlated more strongly with its paired tumor than with other samples. Genes with recurrent amplifications in breast cancer showed 100% (ERBB2, FGFR1), 96% (CCND1), and 88% (MYC) concordance for the amplified/non-amplified status. Among all samples, 499 mutations were identified, including 39 recurrent (AKT1, ERBB2, PIK3CA, TP53) and 460 non-recurrent variants. The tumors/metastases concordance of variants was 75%, higher for recurrent (92%) than for non-recurrent (73%) variants. Further mutational discordance came from very different variant allele frequencies for some variants. We showed that the chosen targeted therapy in two clinical trials of personalized medicine would be concordant in all but one patient (96%) when based on the molecular profiling of tumor and paired metastasis. Our results suggest that the genotyping of primary tumor may be acceptable to guide systemic treatment if the metastatic sample is not obtainable. However, given the rare but potentially relevant divergences for some actionable driver genes, the profiling of metastatic sample is recommended. ",

Observations from clinical samples indicate that such resistance correlates with an increase in Src, EGFR, and PI3K/Akt activities and a decrease in PTEN activity. Furthermore, Akt survival signaling activation is also found in tumors treated by toxic chemotherapeutic agents. Because cotreatment with a PI3K inhibitor is a promising strategy to delay acquired resistance by preventing secondary gene activation, we therefore investigated the effects of a newly identified compound, (-)-Liriopein B (LB), on PI3K/Akt signaling activity in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that nontoxic doses of LB are able to inhibit AKT activation in both luminal-like MCF-7 and basal-like MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Low doses of LB also inhibited cell migration, invasion, and cancer-stem cell sphere formation. Suppression of EGF-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation by LB might contribute in part to retardation of cancer progression. Furthermore, LB increases sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to gefitinib in vitro, suggesting that EGFR may not be the only target of LB. Finally, a small scale in vitro kinase assay screen demonstrated that LB has a potent inhibitory effect on multiple kinases, including PI3K, Src, EGFR, Tie2, lck, lyn, RTK5, FGFR1, Abl, and Flt. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that the compound LB improves tumor therapeutic efficacy and suggests LB as a promising candidate for studying new leads in the development of kinase inhibitors.

However, on rare occasions, pmucBC pursues an aggressive clinical course. We queried whether comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) would uncover clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) that could lead to targeted therapy treatment for patients with an advanced and metastatic form of pmucBC.;From a series of 51,238 total cancer samples, which included 5605 cases of clinically advanced BC and 22 cases of stage IV pmucBC, DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed using a hybrid-capture, adaptor ligation-based next generation sequencing assay to a mean coverage depth of 564X. The results were analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (GA) including base substitutions, insertions and deletions, select rearrangements, and copy number changes. Clinically relevant genomic alterations were defined as those indicating possible treatment with anti-cancer drugs on the market or in registered clinical trials.;Samples were obtained from breast (11), lymph nodes (3), chest wall (2), liver (2), soft tissue (2), bone (1), and pleura (1). The median age of the 22 pmucBC patients was 57 years (range 32-79 years). Three pmucBCs were grade 1, 17 were grade 2, and 2 were grade 3. Twenty-one (95 %) pmucBC were ER+, 18 (82 %) were PR+, and 3 (14 %) were HER2+ by IHC and/or FISH. A total of 132 GA were identified (6.0 GA per tumor), including 53 CRGA, for a mean of 2.4 GA per tumor. Amplification of FGFR1 or ZNF703, located within the same amplicon, was found in 8 of 22 cases (36 %). This enrichment of FGFR1 amplification in 36 % of pmucBC versus 11 % of non-mucinous ER+ BC (601 cases) was significant (p < 0.005). Other frequently altered genes of interest in pmucBC were CCND1 and the FGF3/FGF4/FGF19 amplicon (27 %), often co-amplified together. ERBB2/HER2 alterations were identified in 5 pmucBC (23 %): ERBB2 amplification was found in 3 of 3 cases (100 %) that were HER2+ by IHC and/or FISH; 1 pmucBC was negative for HER2 overexpression by IHC, but positive for amplification by CGP; and 2 pmucBC harbored the ERBB2 substitutions D769Y and V777L (one sample also featured ERBB2 amplification). The enrichment of ERBB2 GA in metastatic pmucBC versus non-metastatic primary pmucBC was significant (p = 0.03). CRGA were also found in 20 additional genes including PIK3CA (5), BRCA1 (1), TSC2 (1), STK11 (1), AKT3 (1), and ESR1 (1).;Metastatic pmucBC is a distinct form of breast cancer that features a relatively high frequency of CRGA, including a significant enrichment of FGFR1 alterations and a high frequency of ERBB2 alterations when compared with non-metastatic pmucBC.

WHSC1L1 is ubiquitously expressed and, like WHSC1, generates two major transcripts, a short (s-type) and a long (l-type). The WHSC1L1 l-type transcript encodes a 1437-amino-acid protein containing 2 PWWP (proline-trypto-phan-proline-tryptophan) domains, 5 PHD (plant-home-domain)-type zinc finger motifs, a SAC (SET-associated Cys-rich) domain, and a SET (Suppressor of Variegation, Enhancer of Zeste and Trithorax) domain. The s-type transcript encodes a protein of 645 amino acids containing a PWWP domain only. WHSC1L2P is an unexpressed, intronless pseudogene of a WHSC1L1 s-type transcript. The 8p11.2 region around WHSC1L1 contains a set of genes including TACC1, FGFR1, LETM2, and WHSC1L1, which seems to be derived from a recent duplication involving 4p16.3 where a similar set of genes is located.

However, responses are not durable and resistance develops within months. In this study, we outline a two-step model of resistance whereby extrinsic microenvironmental proteins FLT3 ligand (FL) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) protect FLT3-ITD+ MOLM14 cells from AC220, providing time for subsequent accumulation of ligand-independent resistance mechanisms. FL directly attenuated AC220 inhibition of FLT3, consistent with previous reports. Conversely, FGF2 promoted resistance through activation of FGFR1 and downstream MAPK effectors; these resistant cells responded synergistically to combinatorial inhibition of FGFR1 and FLT3. Removing FL or FGF2 from ligand-dependent resistant cultures transiently restored sensitivity to AC220, but accelerated acquisition of secondary resistance via reactivation of FLT3 and RAS/MAPK signaling. FLT3-ITD AML patients treated with AC220 developed increased FGF2 expression in marrow stromal cells, which peaked prior to overt clinical relapse and detection of resistance mutations. Overall, these results support a strategy of early combination therapy to target early survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment, in particular FGF2, to improve the depth of response in FLT3-ITD AML.

Comprehensive and sensitive detection of CNAs is challenging because of often low quality and quantity of DNA isolated from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) solid tumor samples. Here, in a clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory, we tested the utility and validated a molecular inversion probe-based (MIP) array to routinely screen for CNAs in solid tumors. Using low-input FFPE DNA, the array detects genome-wide CNAs with a special focus on 900 cancer-related genes. A cohort of 76 solid tumors of various types and tumor cellularity (20% to 100%), and four cancer cell lines were used. These harbored CNAs in clinically important genes (ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, KRAS, MYC) as detected by orthogonal techniques like next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Results of the MIP array were concordant with results from orthogonal techniques, and also provided additional information regarding the allelic nature of the CNAs. Limit-of-detection and assay reproducibility studies showed a high degree of sensitivity and reproducibility of detection, respectively. FFPE compatibility, ability to detect CNAs with high sensitivity, accuracy, and provide valuable information such as loss of heterozygosity along with relatively short turnaround times makes the MIP array a desirable clinical platform for routine screening of solid tumors in a clinical laboratory.

In previous experiments, cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans extracted from human lung fibroblasts could not be shown to promote high affinity binding of bFGF when added to heparan sulfate-deficient cells that express FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) (Aviezer, D., D. Hecht, M. Safran, M. Eisinger, G. David, and A. Yayon. 1994. Cell 79:1005-1013). In alternative tests to establish whether cell-surface proteoglycans can support the formation of the required complexes, K562 cells were first transfected with the IIIc splice variant of FGFR1 and then transfected with constructs coding for either syndecan-1, syndecan-2, syndecan-4 or glypican, or with an antisense syndecan-4 construct. Cells cotransfected with receptor and proteoglycan showed a two- to three- fold increase in neutral salt-resistant specific 125I-bFGF binding in comparison to cells transfected with only receptor or cells cotransfected with receptor and anti-syndecan-4. Exogenous heparin enhanced the specific binding and affinity cross-linking of 125I-bFGF to FGFR1 in receptor transfectants that were not cotransfected with proteoglycan, but had no effect on this binding and decreased the yield of bFGFR cross-links in cells that were cotransfected with proteoglycan. Receptor-transfectant cells showed a decrease in glycophorin A expression when exposed to bFGF. This suppression was dose-dependent and obtained at significantly lower concentrations of bFGF in proteoglycan-cotransfected cells. Finally, complementary cell-free binding assays indicated that the affinity of 125I-bFGF for an immobilized FGFR1 ectodomain was increased threefold when the syndecan-4 ectodomain was coimmobilized with receptor. Equimolar amounts of soluble syndecan-4 ectodomain, in contrast, had no effect on this binding. We conclude that, at least in K562 cells, syndecans and glypican can support bFGF-FGFR1 interactions and signaling, and that cell-surface association may augment their effectiveness.",

Multiple gain-of-function mutations in FGF receptors have been implicated in a variety of severe skeletal disorders and in many cancers. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which a missense mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR2, described in the sporadic case of LADD syndrome, leads to reduced tyrosine kinase activity. In this report, we describe the crystal structure of a FGFR2 A628T LADD mutant in complex with a nucleotide analog. We demonstrate that the A628T LADD mutation alters the configuration of key residues in the catalytic pocket that are essential for substrate coordination, resulting in reduced tyrosine kinase activity. Further comparison of the structures of WT FGFR2 and WT FGFR1 kinases revealed that FGFR2 uses a less stringent mode of autoinhibition than FGFR1, which was also manifested in faster in vitro autophosphorylation kinetics. Moreover, the nearly identical conformation of WT FGFR2 kinase and the A628T LADD mutant to either the phosphorylated FGFR2 or FGFR2 harboring pathological activating mutations in the kinase hinge region suggests that FGFR autoinhibition and activation are better explained by changes in the conformational dynamics of the kinase rather than by static crystallographic snapshots of minor structural variations.",

Protein phosphorylation is a key component of cellular signal transduction and plays a critical role in processes that control cancer cell growth and survival. We used shotgun LC/MS to compare phosphorylation between a human MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell line (NB10), modeling a resistant tumor, and a human neural precursor cell line (NPC), modeling a normal baseline neural crest cell. 2181 unique phosphorylation sites representing 1171 proteins and 2598 phosphopeptides were found. Protein kinases accounted for 6% of the proteome, with a predominance of tyrosine kinases, supporting their prominent role in oncogenic signaling pathways. Highly abundant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphopeptides in the NB10 cell line relative to the NPC cell line included RET, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor (IGF-1R/IR), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Multiple phosphorylated peptides from downstream mediators of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS pathways were also highly abundant in NB10 relative to NPC. Our analysis highlights the importance of RET, IGF-1R/IR and FGFR1 as RTKs in neuroblastoma and suggests a methodology that can be used to identify potential novel biological therapeutic targets. Furthermore, application of this previously unexploited technology in the clinic opens the possibility of providing a new wide-scale molecular signature to assess disease progression and prognosis.

TMPP demonstrated potent inhibition of binding of soluble FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) to FGF2 immobilized on heparin at submicromolar concentrations.

ENMD-2076 inhibited the growth in vitro of a wide range of human solid tumor and hematopoietic cancer cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 0.025 to 0.7 μmol/L. ENMD-2076 was also shown to induce regression or complete inhibition of tumor growth in vivo at well-tolerated doses in tumor xenograft models derived from breast, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines.

Aberrant expression of the transcription factor SOX2 has recently been observed in several cancer types, but its role in CRC has not been fully elucidated. Here we studied the expression of SOX2 in 441 CRC patients by immunohistochemistry and related the expression to clinicopathological and molecular variables and patient prognosis. SOX2 was expressed in 11% of the tumors and was significantly associated to BRAFV600E mutation, but not to KRAS mutations (codon 12 and 13). SOX2 positivity was correlated to poor patient survival, especially in BRAFV600E mutated cases. In vitro studies showed that cells expressing the constitutively active BRAFV600E had increased SOX2 expression, a finding not found in cells expressing KRASG12V. Furthermore, blocking downstream BRAF signalling using a MEK-inhibitor resulted in a decreased expression of SOX2. Since SOX2 overexpression has been correlated to increased migration and invasion, we investigated the SOX2 expression in human CRC liver metastasis and found that a SOX2 positive primary CRC also had SOX2 expression in corresponding liver metastases. Finally we found that cells overexpressing SOX2 in vitro showed enhanced expression of FGFR1, which has been reported to correlate with liver metastasis in CRC. Our novel findings suggest that SOX2 expression is partly regulated by BRAF signalling, and an increased SOX2 expression may promote CRC metastasis and mediate a poor patient prognosis. ",

Of 391 patients, 56 (14.3%) had aberrant FGF (N = 38, all amplifications) and/or FGFR (N = 22 including 5 mutations and one FGFR3-TACC3 fusion). FGF/FGFR aberrations were most frequent in breast cancers (26/81, 32.1%, p = 0.0003). In multivariate analysis, FGF/FGFR abnormalities were independently associated with CCND1/2, RICTOR, ZNF703, RPTOR, AKT2, and CDK8 alterations (all P < 0.02), as well as with an increased median number of alterations (P < 0.0001). FGF3, FGF4, FGF19 and CCND1 were co-amplified in 22 of 391 patients (5.6%, P < 0.0001), most likely because they co-localize on the same chromosomal region (11q13). There was no significant difference in time to metastasis or overall survival when comparing patients harboring FGF/FGFR alterations versus those not. Overall, FGF/FGFR was one of the most frequently aberrant pathways in our population comprising patients with diverse malignancies. These aberrations frequently co-exist with anomalies in a variety of other genes, suggesting that tailored combination therapy may be necessary in these patients.",

Using aCGH, we performed karyotype analysis of 33 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors, 13 SCLC cell lines, 19 bronchial carcinoids, and 9 gastrointestinal carcinoids. In contrast to the relatively conserved karyotypes of carcinoid tumors, the karyotypes of SCLC tumors and cell lines were highly aberrant. High copy number (CN) gains were detected in SCLC tumors and cell lines in cytogenetic bands encoding JAK2, FGFR1, and MYC family members. In some of those samples, the CN of these genes exceeded 100, suggesting that they could represent driver alterations and potential drug targets in subgroups of SCLC patients. In SCLC tumors, as well as bronchial carcinoids and carcinoids of gastrointestinal origin, recurrent CN alterations were observed in 203 genes, including the RB1 gene and 59 microRNAs of which 51 locate in the DLK1-DIO3 domain. These findings suggest the existence of partially shared CN alterations in these tumor types. In contrast, CN alterations of the TP53 gene and the MYC family members were predominantly observed in SCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the aCGH profile of SCLC cell lines highly resembles that of clinical SCLC specimens. Finally, by analyzing potential drug targets, we provide a genomics-based rationale for targeting the AKT-mTOR and apoptosis pathways in SCLC.",

Overexpression of one isoform did not alter the expression of the corresponding FGFR1-III isoform.

Recently, MET was suggested to be a potential target for the personalized treatment of HCC with an active HGF-MET signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms of resistance to MET inhibitors need to be elucidated to provide effective treatment. Here, we show that HCC cells exhibit different sensitivities to the MET inhibitor PHA665752, depending on the phosphorylation status of FGFR. Treatment of cells expressing both phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET with the inhibitor PHA665752 did not cause growth inhibition and cell death, whereas treatment with AZD4547, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, resulted in decreased colony formation and cleavage of caspase-3. Moreover, silencing of endogenous FGFR1 and FGFR2 by RNAi of HCC cells expressing phospho-FGFR, phospho-FGFR2, and phospho-MET overcame the resistance to PHA665752 treatment. Treatment of primary cancer cells from patients with HCC expressing both phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET with PHA665752 did not induce cell death, whereas AZD4547 treatment induced cell death through the cleavage of caspase-3. In addition, treatment of cells resistant to PHA665752 with AZD4547 abrogated the activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the FGFR pathway is critical for HCC survival, and that targeting this pathway with AZD4547 may be beneficial for the treatment of patients with HCC-expressing phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET.",

L1 actions in cancer cells have been attributed mainly to integrin receptors, and we demonstrated previously that L1-stimulated glioma cell migration correlates with integrin expression, increased focal adhesion kinase activation and focal complex turnover. Our analyses of datasets revealed FGFR is overexpressed in glioma regardless of grade, while ADAM10 metalloprotease expression increases with glioma grade. Here, we used dominant-negative and short hairpin RNA approaches to inhibit the activation of FGFR1 and expression of L1, respectively. An L1 peptide that inhibits L1-FGFR interaction and PD173074, a chemical inhibitor of FGFR1 activity, also were used to elucidate the involvement of L1-FGFR interactions on glioma cell behavior. Time-lapse cell motility studies and flow cytometry cell cycle analyses showed that L1 operates to increase glioma cell motility and proliferation through FGFR activation. Shutdown of both L1 expression and FGFR activity in glioma cells resulted in a complete termination of cell migration in vitro. These studies show for the first time that soluble L1 ectodomain (L1LE) acts on glioma cells through FGFRs, and that FGFRs are used by glioma cells for increasing motility as well as proliferation in response to activation by L1LE ligand. Thus, effective treatment of high-grade glioma may require simultaneous targeting of L1, FGFRs, and integrin receptors, which would reduce glioma cell motility as well as proliferation.",

Overall, 119 variants were observed in 20 of 50 tested genes. Each patient had a unique molecular profile, with numerous (n=58) variants not previously reported in breast cancer. VaF detected in more than 2 patients included: TP53 (n=21), PIK3CA (n=20), and FGFR1 (n=3). VaF comprised 46 single nucleotide variants (79%), 7 amplifications (12%), 3 frameshifts (5%), 1 insertion (2%), and 1 deletion (2%). The tested samples had very high Ki67 index (average 57%±23%) and approximately half were hormone receptor and HER2 negative (25/46, 54%). Metastatic breast carcinomas showed a higher average VaF versus breast-localized tumors (1.3±0.99 vs. 0.18±0.60, P<0.05). Next-generation sequencing reports were promptly reported and reviewed (average 1 to 2 d) and 7 (∼25%) of potentially eligible patients received targeted therapy. Advanced breast cancers show unique landscapes of genetic variants. Most testing was done in late disease, often in metastatic and receptor-negative carcinomas. Next-generation sequencing results were promptly reported and reviewed, but the utilization of targeted therapies was limited.",

The complex molecular pathways and gene expression changes associated with these events in canine mammary tumors are still largely undetermined. In this study, the transcriptome of 13 lymph node positive canine mammary carcinomas and corresponding non-neoplastic mammary glands were compared to identify the molecular pathways associated with metastatic progression. Differential gene expression was analyzed using gene set enrichment and pathway analysis and compared with gene expression data from human breast cancer. Metastatic canine carcinomas had 1312 significantly differentially expressed genes compared to normal mammary glands. This expression profile included a significant up-regulation of cell division and matrix invasion genes (MMP, SERPINE1, TIMP3). In contrast, genes associated with epithelial differentiation (EGF, EGFR, MAP2K6, STAT 5), cell adhesion (CLDN5, CTNNAL1, MUC1, PECAM1) and angiogenesis (ANGPT 2, ANGPTL1-4, FIGF, TIE1) were mostly down-regulated. Tumors had a significant decrease in membrane receptors and pathway gene expression (EGFR, FGFR1, GHR, PDGFR, TGFBR, TIE1) indicating a tendency towards independence from these proliferative stimuli. A number of the identified deregulated pathways overlapped with gene expression profiles of human breast cancer. Gene expression profiling of metastatic carcinomas, therefore, identified molecular pathways and functional gene families that are deregulated during malignant progression in canine mammary tumors.",

We screened light-oxygen-voltage (LOV)-sensing domains for their ability to activate RTKs by light-activated dimerization. Incorporation of LOV domains found in aureochrome photoreceptors of stramenopiles resulted in robust activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and rearranged during transfection (RET). In human cancer and endothelial cells, light induced cellular signalling with spatial and temporal precision.

Low stringency screening of a complementary DNA library prepared from the human colon cancer-derived cell line HT-29 with a probe containing the tyrosine kinase domain of human c-src kinase led to the identification and isolation of a clone containing a receptor class tyrosine kinase. This putative receptor was found to be identical to the human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) except for a region of 150 nucleotides (50 amino acids) encoding the presumptive ligand-binding domain, where it exhibited only 32% homology with the previously described FGFR3. The variant domain corresponded precisely to the splicing junctions of the exon encoding the carboxyl terminal half of the third immunoglobulin-like domain, suggesting that two forms of FGFR3 result from splicing of alternate exons in a manner similar to that previously found for FGFR1 and FGFR2. By prior convention, the previously reported from of FGFR3 was designated IIIc due to its high degree of homology with the IIIc domain of FGFR1 (83% homology) and the IIIc domain of FGFR2 (81% homology). However, the ligand-binding domain of FGFR3 found in the HT-29 cell line was more highly divergent from all previously reported FGFR immunoglobulin-like domain IIIs than any other two members of this receptor family. Therefore, we propose to designate the newly reported form as the FGFR3 IIIb variant. Genomic polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the IIIb-containing exon occupies a position 5' relative to the IIIc-containing exon within the FGFR3 gene. Northern blot analysis using a probe encompassing sequences unique to the FGFR3 IIIb mRNA confirmed the expression of a 4.4-kilobase transcript in two colon cancer-derived cell lines as well as normal human colonic mucosa. Using a technique combining reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with restriction endonuclease digestion, cell lines, primary cells, and tissues were assessed for IIIb and IIIc transcripts; expression of the IIIb variant was associated with an epithelial lineage, while the IIIc variant was expressed predominantly in nonepithelial cells and tissues.",

PLAG1 and HMGA2 alterations were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PLAG1-positive tumors were tested by FISH for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) rearrangement. Thirty-nine tumors were analyzed using a commercial panel for mutations and copy number variations in 50 cancer-related genes.;On the basis of combined morphologic and molecular evidence of PA, 4 subsets of SDC emerged: 1) carcinomas with morphologic evidence of PA but intact PLAG1 and HMGA2 (n = 22); 2) carcinomas with PLAG1 alteration (n = 18) or 3) HMGA2 alteration (n = 12); and 4) de novo carcinomas, without morphologic or molecular evidence of PA (n = 14). The median disease-free survival was 37 months (95% confidence interval, 28.4-45.6 months). Disease-free survival and other clinicopathologic parameters did not differ for the subsets defined above. Combined Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α (HRAS/PIK3CA) mutations were observed predominantly in de novo carcinomas (5 of 8 vs 2 of 31 tumors; P = .035).

The 518 protein kinases encoded by the human genome play a central role in various diseases, a fact that has encouraged extensive investigations on their biological function and three dimensional structures. Selenium (Se) is an important nutritional trace element involved in different physiological functions with antioxidative, antitumoral and chemopreventive properties. The mechanisms of action for selenocompounds as anticancer agents are not fully understood, but kinase modulation seems to be a possible pathway. Various organosulfur compounds have shown antitumoral and kinase inhibition effects but, in many cases, the replacement of sulfur by selenium improves the antitumoral effect of compounds. Although Se atom possesses a larger atomic volume and nucleophilic character than sulfur, Se can also formed interactions with aminoacids of the catalytic centers of proteins. So, we propose a novel chemical library that includes organoselenium compounds as kinase modulators. In this study thirteen selenocompounds have been evaluated at a concentration of 3 or 10 µM in a 24 kinase panel using a Caliper LabChip 3000 Drug Discover Platform. Several receptor (EGFR, IGFR1, FGFR1…) and non-receptor (Abl) kinases have been selected, as well as serine/threonine/lipid kinases (AurA, Akt, CDKs, MAPKs…) implicated in main cancer pathways: cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, angiogenesis regulation among them. The obtained results showed that two compounds presented inhibition values higher than 50% in at least four kinases and seven derivatives selectively inhibited one or two kinases. Furthermore, three compounds selectively activated IGF-1R kinase with values ranging from -98% to -211%. In conclusion, we propose that the replacement of sulfur by selenium seems to be a potential and useful strategy in the search of novel chemical compound libraries against cancer as kinase modulators.",

Dependence on secreted FGF2 for cell growth was tested with FP-1039, an FGFR1-Fc fusion protein. FGFR and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dependence was defined by sensitivity to multiple inhibitors selective for FGFRs or EGFR.;FGF2 was expressed in eight of the nine HNSCC cell lines examined. Also, FGFR2 and FGFR3 were frequently expressed, whereas only two lines expressed FGFR1. FP-1039 inhibited growth of HNSCC cell lines expressing FGF2, identifying FGF2 as an autocrine growth factor. FGFR inhibitors selectively reduced in vitro growth and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in three HNSCC cell lines, whereas three distinct lines exhibited responsiveness to both EGFR and FGFR inhibitors. Combinations of these drugs yielded additive growth inhibition. Finally, three cell lines were highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with no contribution from FGFR pathways.;FGFR signaling was dominant or codominant with EGFR in six HNSCC lines, whereas three lines exhibited little or no role for FGFRs and were highly EGFR dependent. Thus, the HNSCC cell lines can be divided into subsets defined by sensitivity to EGFR and FGFR-specific TKIs.

The apoA-I mimetic peptide L-5F had no affect on proliferation and cell viability of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the basal state; however, treatment with L-5F at 1, 3, and 10 μg ml(-1), dose-dependently inhibited both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced proliferation, cell viability, migration, invasion and tube formation in HUVECs. L-5F inhibited VEGF- and bFGF-induced activation of their corresponding receptors, VEGFR2 and FGFR1, as well as downstream signaling pathways, including Akt and ERK1/2. MicroCT scanning and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that daily injection of L-5F (10 mg kg(-1)) decreased both the quantity and size of tumor vessels in mice. L-5F treated mice showed significantly reduced levels of VEGF in both tumor tissue and the circulation, which is consistent with in vitro data showing that L-5F inhibited production and secretion of VEGF from mouse and human ovarian cell lines in the absence and presence of exogenously added lysophosphatidic acid, a potent tumor promoter.

Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified a 19-gene signature enriched in indolent prostate tumors. We then further classified this signature with a decision tree learning model to identify three genes--FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A--that together accurately predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Validation of this three-gene panel on independent cohorts confirmed its independent prognostic value as well as its ability to improve prognosis with currently used clinical nomograms.

Activating alterations in a variety of potential oncogenic driver genes have also been identified in NSCLC, including ROS1, RET, MET, HER2, and BRAF. Together with EGFR and ALK, these mutations account for ∼20% of NSCLCs. The identification of these oncogenic drivers has led to the design of rationally targeted therapies that have produced superior clinical outcomes in tumours harbouring these mutations. Many patients, however, have de novo or acquired resistance to these therapies. In addition, most NSCLCs are genetically complex tumours harbouring multiple potential activating events. For these patients, disease subsets are likely to be defined by combination strategies involving a number of targeted agents. These targets include FGFR1, PTEN, MET, MEK, PD-1/PD-L1, and NaPi2b. In light of the myriad new biomarkers and targeted agents, multiplex testing strategies will be invaluable in identifying the appropriate patients for each therapy and enabling targeted agents to be channelled to the patients most likely to gain benefit. The challenge now is how best to interpret the results of these genomic tests, in the context of other clinical data, to optimize treatment choices in NSCLC.",

However, it is also frequently mutated in various cancers and is now generating significant interest as a potential therapeutic target. Unfortunately, biochemical characterization of its role in disease, and further evaluation as a drug target is hampered by lack of a specific inhibitor. We aimed to discover new inhibitors for FGFR4 ab initio using a strategy combining in silico, in vitro and cell-based assays. We used the homologous FGFR1 to calculate docking scores of a chemically-diverse library of approximately 2000 potential kinase inhibitors. Nineteen potential inhibitors and ten randomly- selected negative controls were taken forward for in vitro FGFR4 kinase assays. All compounds with good docking scores significantly inhibited FGFR4 kinase activity, some with sub-micromolar (most potent being V4-015 with an IC(50) of 0.04 μM). Four of these compounds also demonstrated substantial activity in cellular assays using the FGFR4- overexpressing breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB453. Through immunoblot assays, these compounds were shown to block the phosphorylation of the FGFR4 adaptor protein, FGFR substrate protein-2α (FRS2α). The most potent compound to date, V4-015, suppressed proliferation of MDA-MB453 cells at sub-micromolar concentrations, activated the pro-apoptotic caspases 3/7 and inhibited cellular migration. While achieving complete selectivity of this compound for FGFR4 will require further lead optimization, this study has successfully identified new chemical scaffolds with unprecedented FGFR4 inhibition capacities that will support mechanism of action studies and future anti-cancer drug design.",

The reactivity of the selected scFvs with a recombinant FGFR3 was characterized by an enzyme immunoassay and surface plasmon resonance analysis and with RT112 bladder carcinoma cells by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The capacity of the selected scFvs to block RT112 cell proliferation was determined.;We have isolated six human scFv antibody fragments directed against FGFR3. These human scFvs specifically bound FGFR3, but not the homologous molecule FGFR1. Biacore analysis was used to determine the affinity constants, which ranged from 12 to 40 nmol/L. Competition analysis showed that the FGF9 ligand was able to block the binding of two scFvs, 3C and 7D, to FGFR3, whereas FGF1 only blocked 7D. Immunoprecipitation and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the specificity of the antibodies to native membrane FGFR3. Two scFvs, 3C and 7D, gave an strong immunofluorescence staining of RT112 cells. Moreover, they recognized equally well wild-type and mutant FGFR3 containing the activating mutation S249C.

These recent advances in NSCLC targeted therapy require the analysis of a panel of molecular abnormalities in tumor specimens, including gene mutations (e.g., EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, DDR2), gene amplifications (e.g., MET, FGFR1), and fusions (e.g., EML4-ALK) by applying different methods to tumor tissue (biopsy) and cell (cytology) samples. However, the biopsy and cytology samples available for molecular testing in advanced metastatic NSCLC tumors are likely to be small specimens, including core needle biopsies and/or fine needle aspiration, which may limit the molecular and genomic analysis with currently available methods and technologies. In this process, the role of the pathologist is becoming increasingly important to adequately integrate both routine histopathologic assessment and molecular testing into the clinical pathology for proper tumor diagnosis and subsequent selection of the most appropriate therapy.

Understanding the mechanism of the angiogenic signaling pathway and neovascularization for breast cancer cell proliferation and growth would help to develop molecular interventions and achieve disease free survival. Our hypothesis is that the surviving cancer cell(s) after radiotherapy can initiate angiogenic signaling pathway in the neighboring endothelial cells resulting in neovascularization for breast cancer cell growth. The angiogenic signaling pathway is initiated by angiogenic factors, VEGF and FGF-2, through activation of a transcriptional regulator NF-κB, which in turn is triggered by therapeutic doses of radiation exposure Human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7 cells) were exposed to Cesium-137 ((137)Cs) γ rays to a total dose of 2 Gy at a dose rate of 1.03 Gy/min. The results of mobility shift assay showed that radiation at clinical doses (2 Gy) could induce NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Then, we examined the communication of angiogenic signals from irradiated MCF-7 cells to vascular endothelial cells. At the protein level, the western blot showed induction of angiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2 in MCF-7 cells irradiated with 2 Gy. Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuated VEGF and FGF-2 levels. These factors are secreted into the medium. The levels of VEGF and FGF-2 in the extra cellular medium were both increased, after 2 Gy exposures. We also observed corresponding expression of VEGFR2 and FGFR1 in non-irradiated endothelial cells that were co-cultured with irradiated MCF-7 cells. In support of this, in vitro tube formation assays provided evidence that irradiated MCF-7 cells transmit signals to potentiate cultured non-irradiated endothelial cells to form tube networks, which is the hallmark of neovascularization. Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuated irradiated MCF-7-induced tube network formation. The data provide evidence that the radiation exposure is responsible for tumor growth and maintenance by inducing an angiogenic signaling pathway through activation of NF-κB.",

To test the hypothesis that bFGF may play a role in human ovarian cancer cell growth, three ovarian cancer cell lines, A90, A121(P), and A121(A), were investigated for their ability to respond to bFGF as a mitogen, to express endogenous bFGF protein or message for FGF proteins, and to exhibit FGF receptor or its message. Addition of bFGF to cultures of all three cell lines maintained in chemically defined media resulted in a statistically significant increase in cell number. Cell extracts from A90, A121(P), and A121(A) contained an immunoreactive protein that comigrated with hr-bFGF by Western blot analysis. Several bands of higher molecular weight were also noted. Immunohistochemical staining for bFGF demonstrated a cytoplasmic distribution of bFGF in the three cell lines. Both high- and low-affinity binding sites for human recombinant bFGF (hr-bFGF) were expressed by all three lines. High-affinity sites varied from 2700 sites per cell (Kd = 29 pM) to 13,500 sites per cell (Kd = 71 pM). All three cell lines were screened for mRNA expression for seven FGF proteins and four FGF receptors. In all three lines, mRNA for FGF2 (bFGF) was detected by PCR analysis, and in two lines, mRNA for FGF1 (aFGF) and FGF5 were also found. The FGFR1 receptor subtype (flg) was common to all of the cell lines. Finally, suramin inhibited proliferation of A90 and A121 (P and A) with IC50's of 60 and 210 micrograms/ml, respectively. This is consistent with the A90 cell line having higher levels of endogenous bFGF and flg and therefore being more responsive to suramin inhibition than the A121 cell line. The results indicate that these ovarian cancer cell lines can produce bFGF as well as other members of the FGF family of genes and have the ability to respond to bFGF.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mosaic mutant analysis, the study of cellular defects in scattered mutant cells in a wild-type environment, is a powerful approach for identifying critical functions of genes and has been applied extensively to invertebrate model organisms. A highly versatile technique has been developed in mouse: MASTR (mosaic mutant analysis with spatial and temporal control of recombination), which utilizes the increasing number of floxed alleles and simultaneously combines conditional gene mutagenesis and cell marking for fate analysis. A targeted allele (R26(MASTR)) was engineered; the allele expresses a GFPcre fusion protein following FLP-mediated recombination, which serves the dual function of deleting floxed alleles and marking mutant cells with GFP. Within 24 hr of tamoxifen administration to R26(MASTR) mice carrying an inducible FlpoER transgene and a floxed allele, nearly all GFP-expressing cells have a mutant allele. The fate of single cells lacking FGF8 or SHH signaling in the developing hindbrain was analyzed using MASTR, and it was revealed that there is only a short time window when neural progenitors require FGFR1 for viability and that granule cell precursors differentiate rapidly when SMO is lost. MASTR is a powerful tool that provides cell-type-specific (spatial) and temporal marking of mosaic mutant cells and is broadly applicable to developmental, cancer, and adult stem cell studies.",

We analysed 8p rearrangements in 48 breast, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization, with a tiling path of 0.2 Mb resolution over 8p12 and 1 Mb resolution over chromosome 8. Selected breast lines (MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-361, T-47D and ZR-75-1) were analysed further. Most cell lines showed loss of 8p distal to a break that was between 31 Mb (5' to NRG1) and the centromere, but the translocations were accompanied by variable amplifications, deletions and inversions proximal to this break. The 8p12 translocation in T-47D was flanked by an inversion of 4 Mb, with a 100 kb deletion at the proximal end. The dicentric t(8;11) in ZR-75-1 carries multiple rearrangements including interstitial deletions, a triplicated translocation junction between NRG1 and a fragment of 11q (unconnected to CCND1), and two separate amplifications, of FGFR1 and CCND1 . We conclude that if there is a tumour suppressor gene on 8p it may be near 31 Mb, for example WRN; but the complexity of 8p rearrangements suggests that they target various genes proximal to 31 Mb including NRG1 and the amplicon centred around ZNF703/FLJ14299.",

Activating mutations and/or overexpression of FGFR3 are common in urothelial tumours with low malignant potential and low-stage and -grade urothelial carcinomas (UCs) and are associated with a lower risk of progression and better survival in some subgroups. FGFR1 is not mutated in UC, but overexpression is frequent in all grades and stages and recent data indicate a role in urothelial epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that FGFR inhibition has cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects in FGFR-dependent bladder cancer cells and FGFR-targeted agents are currently being investigated in clinical studies for the treatment of UC. Urine-based tests detecting common FGFR3 mutations are also under development for surveillance of low-grade and -stage tumours and for general population screening.

QSulf1 and its mammalian orthologs are cell surface HS 6-O-endosulfatases that are expressed in embryonic mesodermal and neural progenitors and promote Wnt signal transduction. In this study, we have investigated the function of QSulf1 in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which requires 6-O-sulfated HS for FGF receptor (FGFR) dimerization and tyrosine kinase activation. Here, we report that QSulf1 inhibits FGF2- and FGF4-induced mesoderm formation in the Xenopus embryo and FGF-dependent angiogenesis in the chicken embryo through 6-O-desulfation of cell surface HS. QSulf1 regulates FGF signaling through inhibition of HS-mediated FGFR1 activation by interfering with FGF-HS-FGFR1 ternary complex formation. Furthermore, QSulf1 can produce enzymatically modified soluble heparin that acts as a potent inhibitor of FGF2-induced angiogenesis in the chicken embryo. QSulf1, therefore, has dual regulatory functions as a negative regulator of FGF signaling and a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. Therefore, QSulf1 provides another reagent to produce enzymatically modified heparin compounds, in vivo and in vitro, to modulate cellular signaling in stem cell-based therapies to promote tissue regeneration and in cancer therapies to control cell growth and block angiogenesis.",

To discover new therapeutic targets for hormone-refractory prostate tumor growth under androgen ablation therapy, androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells and the derived sublines, E9 (androgen-low-sensitive), and AIDL (androgen-insensitive), were recombined with androgen-dependent embryonic rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme (UGM). Tumors of E9 + UGM and AIDL + UGM were approximately three times as large as those of LNCaP + UGM. Tumors grown in castrated hosts exhibited reduced growth as compared with those in intact hosts. However, in castrated hosts, E9 + UGM and AIDL + UGM tumors were still approximately twice as large as those of LNCaP + UGM. Cell proliferation in tumors of E9 + UGM and AIDL + UGM grown in castrated host, was significantly higher than that in tumors of LNCaP + UGM. In vitro, expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and IGF-I, but not FGF-7 mRNA, was significantly reduced in UGM under androgen starvation. In cell culture, E9 cells were responsive to FGF-2 and FGF-7 stimulation, while AIDL responded to FGF-7 and IGF-1. Expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 was considerably higher in E9 than those in LNCaP, similarly expression of FGFR2 and IGF-IR were elevated in AIDL.

Cytosolic calcium oscillations were monitored through the endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- channel activity from both RNA injected systems, under FGF2 treatment. The Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- channel was demonstrated using the Cl- channel blocker SITS (250 microM) and by the determination of the reversal potential of the Cl- ions close to -20 mV. The FGF2-evoked Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- current was abolished by external application of genistein (10 microM, tyrosine kinase inhibitor), neomycin (10 mM, phosphatidylinositol turnover inhibitor), caffeine (10 mM, inhibitor of Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated release of intracellular calcium), and injection of BAPTA (50 microM, calcium chelator) or heparin (2 micrograms/ml, inhibitor of the binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3). The recorded current was independent of extracellular Ca2+ but involved tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and intracellular Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitive stores.

Based on their role in B cell biology, the progression of CLL, or immune regulation, a few genes of this 83-gene signature were selected for further analyses. We observed a significant correlation between the clinical outcomes and the expression of CAV1 (P = 0·041), FGFR1 isoform 8 (P = 0·032), PTPN6 (P = 0·031) and ZWINT (P < 0·001). CAV1, a molecule involved in the regulation of tumour progression in other cancers, was seven-fold higher in LN-CLL cells compared to BM- and PB-CLL cells. Knockdown of CAV1 expression in CLL cells resulted in significantly decreased migration (P = 0·016) and proliferation (P = 0·04). When CAV1 was knocked down in B and T cell lines, we observed an inability to form immune synapses. Furthermore, CAV1 knockdown in CLL cells impaired their ability to form immune synapses with autologous T lymphocytes and allogeneic, healthy T cells. Subsequent analyses of microarray data showed differential expression of cytoskeletal genes, specifically those involved in actin polymerization. Therefore, we report a novel role for CAV1 in tumour-induced immunosuppression during the progression of CLL.",

R50E suppressed DNA synthesis and cell proliferation induced by WT FGF1. We tested if WT FGF1 and R50E generate integrin-FGF1-FGFR ternary complex. WT FGF1 induced ternary complex formation (integrin-FGF-FGFR1) and recruitment of SHP-2 to the complex in NIH 3T3 cells and human umbilical endothelial cells, but R50E was defective in these functions. It has been reported that sustained ERK1/2 activation is integrin-dependent and crucial to cell cycle entry upon FGF stimulation. We thus determined the time-course of ERK1/2 activation induced by WT FGF1 and R50E. We found that WT FGF1 induced sustained activation of ERK1/2, but R50E was defective in this function.;Our results suggest that 1) R50E is a dominant-negative mutant, 2) Ternary complex formation is involved in FGF signaling, 3) The defect of R50E to bind to integrin may be directly related to the antagonistic action of R50E.

Molecular alterations were correlated with overall survival (OS) using the Cox proportional hazards regression models.;The median follow-up was 6.4 years (range 0.5-26.6 years). Genomic analysis of P tumors revealed somatic mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, AKT1, FGFR3, HRAS and BRAF at frequencies of 41%, 6%, 5%, 2%, 1% and 2%, respectively, and CN amplification of CCND1, ZNF703, FGFR1, RSF1 and PAK1 at 23%, 19%, 17%, 12% and 11%, respectively. Mutations and CN amplifications were largely concordant between P and matched M (>84%). ESR1 mutations were found in 10.8% of the M but none of the P. Thirteen genes, among which ESR1, FOXA1, and HIF1A, showed significant differential expression between P and M. In P, the differential expression of 18 genes, among which IDO1, was significantly associated with OS (FDR < 0.1).;Despite the large concordance between P and matched M for the evaluated molecular alterations, potential actionable targets such as ESR1 mutations were found only in M. This supports the importance of characterizing the M disease. Other targets we identified, such as HIF1A and IDO1, warrant further investigation in this patient population.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inappropriate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is involved in most tissue-specific pathologies including cancer. Previously we showed that inappropriate expression and chronic activity of FGF receptor (FGFR) 1 in hepatocytes accelerated diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis. Here we showed that although widely expressed FGF1 and FGF2 are frequently upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), germline deletion of both FGF1 and FGF2 had no effect on DEN-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus overexpression of FGF1 or FGF2 may be a consequence rather than contributor to hepatoma progression. FGF21 is the first of 22 homologues whose expression has been reported to be preferentially in the liver. We showed that similar to FGF1 and FGF2, FGF21 mRNA was upregulated in neoplastic and regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy (PH) and CCl4 administration. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed that in contrast to FGF1 and FGF2, expression of FGF21 mRNA was limited to hepatocytes. Forced overexpression of FGF21 in hepatocytes by gene targeting had no apparent impact on normal liver development and compensatory response to injury. Surprisingly, overexpression of FGF21 delayed the appearance of DEN-induced liver tumors. At 8 and 10 mo, only 10% and 30% of transgenic mice, respectively, developed adenomas compared to 50% (all adenomas) and 80% (60% adenoma/20% HCC) in the wild-type (WT) mice. However, the incidence and burden of HCC at 10 mo and later was equal in the FGF21 transgenic and WT mice. We propose that FGF21 may delay development of adenomas through activation of resident hepatocyte FGFR4 at early times, but counteracts the delay by acceleration of progression to HCC through interaction with ectopic FGFR1 once it appears in hepatoma cells. This indicates a dual function of FGF21 that may reflect changes in FGFR isotype during progression of differentiated hepatoma cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The therapeutic efficacy of combined antiangiogenic and immune therapy was tested against weakly immunogenic and highly metastatic 4T1 breast tumor using SU6668, an angiogenesis inhibitor and recombinant murine (rm) B7.2-IgG fusion protein, an immunostimulator. SU6668 inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of three angiogenic receptors VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR), PDGFRbeta, and FGFR1, which play a crucial role in tumor-induced vascularization. rmB7.2-IgG is a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of B7.2, and the hinge and constant domains of murine IgG2a. Intermolecule disulfide linkages are maintained so that it forms a dimer. Our studies showed that three weekly immunizations of BALB/c mice bearing 0.5-0.8 cm 4T1 breast tumors with rmB7.2-IgG and irradiated 4T1 tumor cells (B7.2-IgG/TC) resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth and formation of pulmonary metastases. T-cell depletion experiments revealed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes are required for stimulation of the antitumor and antimetastatic immune response by B7.2-IgG/TC. Treatment of mice with SU6668 substantially inhibited tumor vascularization but did not inhibit tumor infiltration by T lymphocytes or the T-cell response to rmB7.2-IgG therapy. On the contrary, tumors in mice immunized with B7.2-IgG/TC and treated with SU6668 had higher numbers of tumor infiltrating T cells than tumors of other groups. SU6668 treatments initiated either on day 3 or day 10 after inoculation of 4T1 tumor cells resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth. Similarly, three weekly immunizations with B7.2-IgG/TC starting either on day 7 or 12 inhibited growth of 4T1 tumors. However, the most potent antitumor effects were observed in mice treated with a combination of SU6668 and B7.2-IgG/TC. Analysis of pulmonary metastases revealed that combined therapy also had a more potent antimetastatic effect than each modality alone. These results indicate that antiangiogenic and immune therapies using SU6668 and B7.2-IgG/TC are compatible, and manifest complementary antitumor and antimetastatic effects. Combined antiangiogenic and immune therapy might represent a new strategy for cancer treatment.",

Several tumor types, including breast carcinoma, demonstrate amplification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-related genes. There are no approved drugs for molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1- or FGF3/4/19-amplified) tumors.;This open-label phase I/IIa study involved a dose-escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and pharmacokinetics of lucitanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a dose-expansion phase to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients who could potentially benefit from treatment (i.e. with tumors harboring FGF-aberrant pathway or considered angiogenesis-sensitive).;Doses from 5 to 30 mg were evaluated with dose-limiting toxic effects dominated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition-related toxic effects at the 30 mg dose level (one case of grade 4 depressed level of consciousness and two cases of grade 3 thrombotic microangiopathy). The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts) were hypertension (91%), asthenia (42%), and proteinuria (57%). Exposure increased with dose and t½ was 31-40 h, suitable for once daily administration. Seventy-six patients were included. All but one had stage IV; 42% had >3 lines of previous chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients were assessable for response; 58 had measurable disease. Clinical activity was observed at all doses tested with durable Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial responses in a variety of tumor types. In the angiogenesis-sensitive group, objective RECIST response rate (complete response + partial response) was 26% (7 of 27) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 weeks. In assessable FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients, 50% (6 of 12) achieved RECIST partial response with a median PFS of 40.4 weeks for all treated patients.;Lucitanib has promising efficacy and a manageable side-effect profile. The spectrum of activity observed demonstrates clinical benefit in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations. A comprehensive phase II program is planned.",

The amounts of extracellular signal kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt, p38, and beta-tubulin were measured. T47D cells were inoculated into a 24-well plate, co-transfected with luciferase vector OB-HRE containing HIF-1 functional sequence (HRE) and pRL-SV40 (as inner marker), pretreated with SU5402, inhibitor of FGFR1, SB203580, inhibitors of PI-3K, PD98059, inhibitors of MEK1, or LY294002, inhibitors of p38, treated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and then lysed. The amounts of ERK1/2, Akt, p38, and beta-tubulin were measured. Western blotting was used to detect the HIF-1alpha level in total protein. Dual luciferase assay was used to analyze the transactivity of HIF-1. The firefly/renilla luciferase ratio was measured to access the transcription activity of HIF-1. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of HIF-1alpha protein and phosphorylated Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 in whole cell extract.;After the addition of bFGF Western blotting showed that the and phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2 and p38 in the T47D cells were increased time- and dose-dependent manner, and dual luciferase assay showed that the fluorescent intensity was increased, signifying the increase of expression of HIF-1alpha protein. Ten minutes after the addition of CHX the expression of HIF-1alpha protein began to be decreased and ceased 90 minutes after. SU5402 remarkably dose-dependently blocked the bFGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and p38. 15 micromol/L LY294002 completely blocked the bFGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt. 5 micromol/L PD98059 blocked 80% of the bFGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. 10 approximately 20 micromol/L SB203580 basically blocked the bFGF-induced phosphorylation of p38. SU5402 and LY294002 100% inhibited the bFGF-induced expression of HIF-1alpha protein. However, PD98059 and SB203580 did not significantly influence the expression of HIF-1alpha protein induced by bFGF. Luciferase assay showed that SU5402 and PD98059 inhibited the bFGF-induced transcription activity of HIF-1 by 94.8% and 81.7% respectively. LY294002 not only completely inhibited the bFGF-induced transcription activity of HIF-1 but also inhibited the basic transcription of HIF-1, and SB203580 did not significantly influence the transcription activity of HIF-1.;bFGF activates HIF-1 via the PI-3K/Akt and MEK1/ERK pathways that co-operatively and differentially regulate this process with PI-3K/Akt pathway playing a more important role.",
