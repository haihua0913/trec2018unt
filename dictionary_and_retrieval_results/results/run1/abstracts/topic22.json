As novel treatments evolve, surgeons may be asked to perform metastasectomy not only for palliation or potential cure but also for isolation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This study was undertaken to examine outcomes of patients with melanoma undergoing thoracic metastasectomy in preparation for investigational immunotherapy.;A retrospective review identified 107 consecutive patients who underwent 116 thoracic metastasectomy procedures from April 1998 to July 2009. Indications for surgical intervention included procurement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, rendering of patients to no evaluable disease status, palliation, and diagnosis. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were used to assess tumor response.;Thoracotomy, lobectomy, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with nonanatomic resection were the most common procedures. Major complications included 1 death and 1 coagulopathy-induced hemothorax. Seventeen patients were rendered to no evaluable disease status. Virtually all patients with residual disease had tumor specimens cultured for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; approximately 70% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures exhibited antitumor reactivity. Of the 91 patients with residual or recurrent disease, 24 (26%) underwent adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, of whom 7 exhibited objective responses (29% response rate and 8% based on intent to treat). Rapid disease progression precluded tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy in most cases. Actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates for patients rendered to no evaluable disease status or receiving or not receiving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were 93% and 76%, 64% and 33%, and 43% and 0%, respectively.;Relatively few patients currently having thoracic metastasectomy undergo adoptive cell transfer. Continued refinement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte expansion protocols and improved patient selection might increase the number of patients with melanoma benefiting from these interventions.",

In an attempt to delineate the histologic diagnostic criteria, to classify different categories of lymphocytic infiltrates, previously described by Elder et al. at brisk, nonbrisk, and absent, and to verify their prognostic significance, we reviewed 285 consecutive cases of primary cutaneous melanomas (American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage I and II).;In addition to clinical variables (age, sex, and location of tumor) and the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the vertical growth phase, the histopathologic attributes reviewed included mitotic rate, thickness, and regression. The results were derived from independent histopathologic review by two pathologists (C.G.C., M.C.M., Jr.) on separate occasions. A multivariate analysis of survival was performed with the Cox's regression model.;The 5- and 10-year rates for melanoma with a vertical growth phase and a brisk infiltrate were 77% and 55%, respectively. For tumors with a nonbrisk infiltrate, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 53% and 45%, respectively, and for tumors with absent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 37% and 27%, respectively. Mitotic index, thickness, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were statistically (univariate analysis) significant prognostic factors (P = 0.003, 0.000001, 0.0003, respectively), whereas the presence or absence of regression is not. In the univariate statistical analysis, the sex of patients and site of melanoma also were statistically significant (P = 0.00001 and 0.002 respectively), whereas age (P = 0.98) was not statistically significant. The multivariate analysis of thickness, mitotic rate, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed that thickness and presence tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were significant and independent histologic prognostic factors. With regard to the clinical factors, sex retained its independent prognostic significance. The histologic characteristics of melanoma with vertical growth phase (brisk, nonbrisk, and absent) are exemplified.;We demonstrated that when categories of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are strictly defined, they indeed have very strong predictive value for primary cutaneous melanomas with a vertical growth phase. This work confirms the work of Clark et al. and fully illustrates the brisk, nonbrisk, and absent categories of infiltration. Finally, a multivariate analysis comparing thickness, mitotic rate and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed that only thickness and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are significant and independent positive histologic prognostic factors.",

Dendritic cells infiltrate melanomas, but their ability to induce host antitumor immunity remains obscure. In a previous study, we have observed that melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells have the capacity to process antigens and migrate to lymph nodes to prime T lymphocytes. Here, we observed that melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells extracted from melanoma without any additional manipulations were able to protect naive mice against a lethal challenge with the tumor. Remarkably, this was achieved with reinjection of 10(5) melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells, a number that did not exceed the total number of melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells recovered from one single tumor. Three observations indicate that protection was due to the natural loading of melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells with tumor antigens. First, the protective effect was not observed with equivalent numbers of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Second, the protection induced was specific for the tumor from which the tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells were isolated. Third, depletion experiments indicate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were required during the effector phase of the antitumor response.

In the first 2 years after enucleation, previously irradiated tumors showed increased numbers of lymphocytes compared with primarily enucleated eyes.;Numbers of infiltrating T lymphocytes and macrophages varied widely between tumors, but tumors with high numbers of macrophages also contained more lymphocytes. Irradiation had no effect on the number and type of macrophages, but led to an increased amount of T lymphocytes up to 24 months postirradiation.

Similar results were obtained in certain subsets of cases with respect to lymphocytic infiltration at the tumor margins and to the presence of partial regression. Although the nature of the association between these histological features and NK activity in blood is unknown, it is suggested that previously unexplained associations between histological features and prognosis may be accounted for by their association with NK activity.

Lymphocyte migration from blood into peripheral tissues is mainly regulated by vascular endothelium. However, the blood vessels and mechanisms governing the recruitment of TILs in melanoma tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte extravasation into lymphoid tissues, are frequently found in melanoma tumors and are associated with high levels of lymphocyte infiltration. The analysis of 225 primary melanomas revealed that lymphocytes specifically infiltrated HEV-rich areas of melanoma tumors and that the density of MECA-79+ HEVs was variable among patients and strongly correlated with CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TIL densities. Inflammatory (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and lymphoid (CCL21, CCL19 and CXCL13) chemokines as well as TH1 and naïve T-cell genes were overexpressed in melanoma samples with high densities of tumor HEVs. Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) were frequently found around tumor HEVs and densities of HEVs and DC-LAMP+ mDCs within tumor stroma were strongly correlated. DCs which maintain HEVs in lymph nodes, may thus also contribute to the regulation of HEVs in melanomas. Finally, we found significantly higher densities of tumor HEVs in melanomas with tumor regression, low Clark level of invasion and thin Breslow thickness (all p < 0.001). The strong association between tumor HEVs, TILs, mDCs and clinical parameters of melanoma, supports a critical role for HEVs in limiting malignant melanoma development through both naïve and effector T-lymphocyte recruitment and activation.",

Whereas metastatic melanoma deposits typically are not inflamed and contain relatively few lymphocytes and dendritic immune cells, immunization with autologous melanoma-cell vaccine may induce a clinical inflammatory response associated with mononuclear-cell infiltration. In this study, we characterize immune responses to dermal and subcutaneous melanoma metastases in dinitrophenyl (DNP)-pre-sensitized patients immunized with DNP-conjugated melanoma cells. Patients so treated develop cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity responses to DNP-conjugated autologous mononuclear cells, and approximately one-half show clinical evidence of inflammation and regression of metastases within 2-4 months. Whereas pre-vaccination biopsies of metastatic melanoma failed to reveal significant infiltration by lymphocytes, biopsies obtained after vaccination and coincident with clinical inflammation were markedly infiltrated preponderantly by T cells with a CD8+ phenotype. Clustering of these cells about individual degenerating melanoma cells in a manner analogous to \"satellitosis\" was a consistent feature of this reaction. Enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR by melanoma cells were invariably associated with zones of T-cell infiltration, whereas diminished or absent expression was observed in relatively unaffected regions of tumors. Numerous HLA-DR+, CD4+, CD1-, Leu-1- dendritic cells were also associated with zones of early T-cell infiltration. These data indicate that clinical inflammation and regression of metastatic melanoma induced by autologous melanoma-cell vaccine involves activated T cells with cytotoxic-suppressor phenotype and dendritic cells putatively capable of local antigen presentation. ICAM-1 upregulation on melanoma cells is a likely mediator of ligand interaction between infiltrating T cells and target cells in this model of antigen-induced host anti-tumor response. Structural alterations identified in this setting (e.g., tumor cell satellitosis) may provide additional insight into identifying features of naturally occurring host immune responses to primary cutaneous melanomas.",

We have characterized the expression of the C-type lectin natural killer receptor CD94/NKG2 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary and metastatic melanoma lesions. By immunohistochemistry, 5-10% of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, both in primary and metastatic lesions, expressed CD94. More than 95% of these CD94+ cells coexpressed CD8 and the percentage of CD94 expression within the CD8+ cell population ranged from 5 to 20% with a higher expression in metastatic lesions. CD94/NKG2 exists both in an inhibitory and an activating form; thus, it was necessary to determine whether the inhibitory CD94/NKG2-A/B, the activating CD94/NKG2-C/E, or both were expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for NKG2-A/B and C/E mRNA revealed the presence of NKG2-C/E in all primary and metastatic lesions. In contrast, the inhibitory NKG2-A/B was only present in 50% of primary tumors whereas 80% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in metastatic lesions expressed these transcripts. In healthy humans, the mean number of inhibitory natural killer receptors is higher than that of activating receptors, but the opposite was true for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma. The reversal of the ratio of inhibitory to activating natural killer receptors among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes suggests a regulated event due to either specific factors within the tumor microenvironment, preferential homing of T cell subsets, or certain stages of T cell activation.",

Consistent with our previous observations in human melanoma xenografts, propranolol induces a decrease in cell proliferation and vessel density in the primary tumors and in metastases. In this immunocompetent model, propranolol significantly reduced the infiltration of myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, in the primary tumor. Inversely, cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were more frequent in the tumor stroma of treated mice. In a consistent manner, we observed the same shift in the proportions of infiltrating leukocytes in the metastases of treated mice.

We further observed that in early lesions (< 0.75 mm) of superficial spreading melanoma the vast majority of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) belong to the CD4+ subset and frequently express CD45RA antigens. In more advanced tumors, the contribution of CD8+ TIL gradually increases, indicating that the quality of the anti-tumor immune response changes during the course of the disease. Finally, we found that a varying percentage of cutaneous TIL express the cutaneous leukocyte antigen which is defined by the monoclonal antibody HECA 452 and preferentially expressed by skin-seeking memory T cells.

These in vitro activated T cells depend on the growth factor, interleukin (IL)-2, and may undergo apoptosis in vivo when they are transferred. The authors previously reported that the need for an exogenous source of IL-2 could be abrogated in vitro by retrovirally transducing antitumor T lymphocytes with an exogenous IL-2 gene. Here they report that this growth of IL-2 transductants depended on restimulation of the T-cell receptor complex and appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level of the transduced IL-2 gene. The transduced IL-2 transcript was barely detectable in IL-2-transductants just before they died without restimulation, and they expressed a low level of the CD25 molecule, the alpha chain of the IL-2 trimeric receptor complex. Melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (either bulk or CD8+ cells alone), when transduced with an IL-2 retroviral vector, could produce IL-2 upon tumor stimulation and proliferated after the destruction of autologous tumor cells in the absence of added IL-2. Control vector-transduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes failed to do so under the same conditions. These findings provide a foundation for the development of clinical efforts to adoptively transfer melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes transduced with an IL-2 retroviral vector for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma to evaluate the fate and therapeutic effect of these IL-2 gene-modified antitumor T lymphocytes in vivo.",

Seventeen melanoma cell lines and 11 nonmelanoma cell lines were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HLA-A2.1 gene. Infection by the vaccinia virus resulted in expression of functional HLA-A2 molecules on the cell surface of virtually 100% of infected cells within a 3.5-h period. The results showed that 11 of 17 (65%) naturally HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were specifically lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific TIL after infection with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus. None of the nine human nonmelanoma cell lines tested (three colon cancer, four breast cancer, or two immortalized non-tumor cell lines) or two murine melanoma cell lines were lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted TIL after vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 infection. Coinfection of the vaccinia virus containing the beta 2-microglobulin gene with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus increased the surface expression of HLA-A2 and subsequent lysis by melanoma-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. With this new method we could extend previous findings demonstrating that shared melanoma Ag recognized by HLA-A2-restricted tumor infiltrating lymphocytes exist among melanoma cells from different patients regardless of HLA type.

Expression of MAGE mRNA in melanocytic tumors is said to be restricted to invasive malignant tumors and absent in nevi. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (57B) has become available to examine MAGE protein expression in archival material. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on 132 melanocytic nevi and 205 melanomas (85 primary cutaneous melanomas and 120 metastatic tumors) to determine the frequency of MAGE expression and to explore a potential correlation with various prognostic parameters. None of the melanocytic nevi and none of the 20 in situ melanomas was immunopositive with the antibody 57B. Immunoreactivity was present in 17 of 65 (26%) primary invasive melanomas of the skin and in 30 of 120 (25%) metastatic tumors. Positive immunostaining did not correlate with tumor stage (P = .66), Breslow thickness (P = .39), Clark level (P = .5), or the histologic type of melanoma (P = .23) but was associated with a brisk infiltrate of lymphocytes involving the vertical growth phase of melanomas (P = .01). Because tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma are associated with longer survival, our findings suggest a potential prognostic role for MAGE. Furthermore, the seeming restriction of immunopositivity to invasive malignant tumors suggests a potential diagnostic role for the antibody 57B in confirming the malignant potential of a melanocytic tumor.",

In vitro, melanoma cells stained for LIGHT in the intracellular compartment, with weak or negative cell surface expression. However, LIGHT was expressed on tumor-derived microvesicles released from melanoma cells. In vivo, LIGHT was found in metastatic lesions, and the extent of lymphotoxin beta receptor expression on the stromal cells was significantly associated with a \"brisk\" T-cell infiltrate in the neoplastic tissue. In the lesions with a brisk T-cell infiltrate, stromal cells surrounding the tumor also stained for the T-cell attractant chemokine CCL21. The intratumoral T lymphocytes frequently expressed herpesvirus entry mediator and were characterized by a differentiated phenotype. Coculture of lymphocytes with LIGHT(+) melanoma-derived microvesicles or even with LIGHT(+) melanoma cells in the presence of interleukin-2 costimulated LIGHT-dependent CD3(+)CD8(+) T-cell proliferation. However, lymphocyte coculture with LIGHT(+) microvesicles in the presence of interleukin-2 was also associated with an apoptotic response as documented by increased binding of Annexin V by CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells.

The median age of the patients was 51 years, ranging in age from 16 to 104 years. The majority of them had lesions without regression (n=495; 74.5%) and others had lesions with regression (n=169; 25.5%). Melanoma patients with regression were more frequently males (60.1 vs 51.7%; P=0.038) and had axial localized lesions (67.5 vs 53.7%; P=0.002), superficial spreading histologic subtype (73.2 vs 49.1%; P=0.000), thin Breslow depth (<2 mm) (44.6 vs 33.5%; P=0.01), and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (74.4 vs 60.0%; P=0.001) than those without regression. However, regression was not significantly associated with age, Clark level, mitotic rate, ulceration, vertical growth phase, neurotropism, lymphovascular invasion, nor association with a pre-existing melanocytic nevus. Similarly, no significant correlations were found between regression and lymph node involvement, recurrence, nor metastasis of disease. Patients with, nodular pathology, advanced Clark invasion level (IV-V), thick Breslow depth (≥2 mm), high mitotic rate (>3/mm), ulceration, vertical growth phase, neurotropism, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node involvement, metastasis, and recurrence of disease, and male patients had poor prognostic variables for both relapse-free survival and overall survival. However, the presence of regression was not associated with relapse-free survival (P=0.093) nor overall survival (P=0.113) similar to other factors such as age, tumor localization, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and association with a pre-existing melanocytic nevus.

A phase I clinical trial of this immunization strategy in patients with disseminated melanoma revealed the consistent induction in distant metastases of dense T and B cell infiltrates that effectuated substantial tumor necrosis and fibrosis. To delineate the target antigens of this vaccine-stimulated tumor destruction, we screened a melanoma cDNA expression library with postimmunization sera from a long-term responding patient (K030). High-titer IgG antibodies recognized melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP), a caspase antagonist containing a single baculoviral IAP repeat and a COOH-terminal RING domain. Although K030 harbored antibodies to ML-IAP at the time of study entry, multiple courses of vaccination over 4 years increased antibody titers and elicited isotype switching. Moreover, lymphocyte infiltrates in necrotic metastases included CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for ML-IAP, as revealed by proliferation, tetramer, enzyme-linked immunospot, and cytotoxicity analysis. Whereas melanoma cells in densely infiltrated lesions showed strong ML-IAP expression by immunohistochemistry, lethal disease progression was associated with the loss of ML-IAP staining and the absence of lymphocyte infiltrates. These findings demonstrate that ML-IAP can serve as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction, but that antigen-loss variants can accomplish immune escape.",

However, the majority of patients receiving BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) manifest disease progression within a year. We have recently shown that melanoma patients treated with BRAFi exhibit an increase in melanoma-associated antigens and in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in response to therapy. To characterize such a T-cell infiltrate, we analyzed the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) β chain-coding genes in tumor biopsies obtained before the initiation of BRAFi and 10-14 d later. We observed an increase in the clonality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of 8 patients receiving BRAFi, with a statistically significant 21% aggregate increase in clonality. Over 80% of individual T-cell clones detected after initiation of BRAFi treatment were new clones. Interestingly, the comparison of tumor infiltrates with clinical responses revealed that patients who had a high proportion of pre-existing dominant clones after the administration of BRAFi responded better to therapy than patients who had a low proportion of such pre-existing dominant clones following BRAFi. These data suggest that although the inhibition of BRAF in melanoma patients results in tumor infiltration by new lymphocytes, the response to treatment appears to be related to the presence of a pre-existing population of tumor-infiltrating T-cell clones.",

One major limitation of these current therapies is the frequent inability to isolate tumor-reactive lymphocytes for treatment. Genetic engineering of peripheral blood lymphocytes with retroviral vectors encoding tumor antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) bypasses this restriction. To evaluate the efficacy of TCR gene therapy, a murine treatment model was developed. A retroviral vector was constructed encoding the pmel-1 TCR genes targeting the B16 melanoma antigen, gp100. Transduction of C57BL/6 lymphocytes resulted in efficient pmel-1 TCR expression. Lymphocytes transduced with this retrovirus specifically recognized gp100-pulsed target cells as measured by interferon-gamma secretion assays. Upon transfer into B16 tumor-bearing mice, the genetically engineered lymphocytes significantly slowed tumor development. The effectiveness of tumor treatment was directly correlated with the number of TCR-engineered T cells administered. These results demonstrated that TCR gene therapy targeting a native tumor antigen significantly delayed the growth of established tumors. When C57BL/6 lymphocytes were added to antigen-reactive pmel-1 T cells, a reduction in the ability of pmel-1 T cell to treat B16 melanomas was seen, suggesting that untransduced cells may be deleterious to TCR gene therapy. This model may be a powerful tool for evaluating future TCR gene transfer-based strategies.",

Local tumor control of uveal melanoma is excellent, yet this malignancy is associated with relatively high mortality secondary to metastasis. Various clinical, histopathological, cytogenetic features and gene expression features help in estimating the prognosis of uveal melanoma. The clinical features associated with poor prognosis in patients with uveal melanoma include older age at presentation, male gender, larger tumor basal diameter and thickness, ciliary body location, diffuse tumor configuration, association with ocular/oculodermal melanocytosis, extraocular tumor extension, and advanced tumor staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. Histopathological features suggestive of poor prognosis include epithelioid cell type, high mitotic activity, higher values of mean diameter of ten largest nucleoli, higher microvascular density, extravascular matrix patterns, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating macrophages, higher expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, and higher expression of human leukocyte antigen Class I and II. Monosomy 3, 1p loss, 6q loss, and 8q and those classified as Class II by gene expression are predictive of poor prognosis of uveal melanoma.

We have previously shown that RhoA GTPase and its effector ROCK negatively control FasL membrane expression in murine melanoma B16F10 cells. In this study, we found that B16F10 treatment with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 reduced melanoma development in vivo through FasL membrane overexpression. Although H1152 treatment did not reduce tumor growth in vitro, pretreatment of tumor cells with this inhibitor delayed tumor appearance, and slowed tumor growth in C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice. Thanks to the use of mice-bearing mutated Fas receptors (B6/lpr), we found that reduced tumor growth, observed in immunocompetent mice, was linked to FasL overexpression induced by H1152 treatment. Tumor growth analysis in immunosuppressed NUDE and IFN-γ-KO mice highlighted major roles for T lymphocytes and IFN-γ in the H1152-induced tumor growth reduction. Histological analyses of subcutaneous tumors, obtained from untreated versus H1152-treated B16F10 cells, showed that H1152 pretreatment induced a strong intratumoral infiltration of leukocytes. Cytofluorometric analysis showed that among these leukocytes, the number of activated CD8 lymphocytes was increased. Moreover, their antibody-induced depletion highlighted their main responsibility in tumor growth reduction. Subcutaneous tumor growth was also reduced by repeated intravenous injections of a clinical ROCK inhibitor, Fasudil. Finally, H1152-induced ROCK inhibition also reduced pulmonary metastasis implantation independently of T cell-mediated immune response. Altogether, our data suggest that ROCK inhibitors could become interesting pharmacological molecules for melanoma immunotherapy. ",

The identification of specific melanoma antigens was an important step in the development of these new approaches.

The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment has recently been shown: melanoma cells render their immediate environment immunotolerant, undermining the effectiveness of stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The mechanisms responsible for this state of immune tolerance are a major focus of research. Current therapeutic strategies are based on early adjuvant approaches, destruction of regulatory T cells by lymphodepletion prior to immunotherapy, selection of the melanoma antigens inducing the best cytotoxic T cell responses, and combining cellular therapy with monoclonal antibodies that block molecules inhibiting T lymphocyte activation. Immune therapy for melanoma is thus moving towards adjuvant strategies for early-stage disease and combined treatments for metastatic melanoma.

We examined the role of cellular immunity in melanoma-associated vitiligo by expanding infiltrating lymphocytes from fresh biopsy specimens of vitiligo patches in melanoma patients. The vitiligo-infiltrating lymphocytes were almost exclusively T lymphocytes, and most were CD8(+). Following in vitro expansion, vitiligo-infiltrating lymphocytes remained predominantly CD8(+) and expressed the cutaneous homing receptor CLA. Furthermore, vitiligo-infiltrating lymphocytes had a clonal or oligoclonal T cell receptor profile, possibly reflecting specific antigenic stimulation. Finally, vitiligo- infiltrating lymphocytes specifically recognized differentiation antigens shared by normal melanocytes and melanoma cells.

The first effective immunotherapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in melanoma included interleukin-2 for metastatic disease and interferon alpha in the adjuvant setting. These were followed by a group of new therapies, including checkpoint-blocking antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and programmed cell death protein 1. Therapies intended to 'reeducate' T cells, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, oncolytic viruses and tumor vaccines, have yielded promising results and are under development. Finally, the integration of the above therapies as well as development of new coinhibitory and costimulatory agents, though in early stages, appear very promising and likely represent the next phase in drug development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"The immune system attempts to prevent or limit tumor growth, yet efforts to induce responses to tumors yield minimal results, rendering tumors virtually invisible to the immune system [1]. Several mechanisms may account for this subversion, including the triggering of tolerance to tumor antigens [2, 3], TGF-alpha or IL-10 production, downregulation of MHC molecules, or upregulation of FasL expression [4, 5]. Melanoma cells may in some instances use FasL expression to protect themselves against tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) [4, 5]. Here, we show another, chemokine-dependent mechanism by which melanoma tumor cells shield themselves from immune reactions. Melanoma-inducible CCL5 (RANTES) production by infiltrating CD8 cells activates an apoptotic pathway in TIL involving cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase-9 and -3. This process, triggered by CCL5 binding to CCR5, is not mediated by TNFalpha, Fas, or caspase-8. The effect is not unique to CCL5, as other CCR5 ligands such as CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) also trigger TIL cell death, nor is it limited to melanoma cells, as it also operates in activated primary T lymphocytes. The model assigns a role to the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) in this process, as this melanoma cell-produced chemokine upregulates CCL5 production by TIL, initiating TIL cell death.",

However, numerous H3K27me3 peak-associated TSS regions remained devoid of DNA methylation in tumors. There was no relationship between BRAF mutations and the number of methylation peaks. Gene expression analysis showed upregulated immune response genes in melanomas presumably as a result of lymphocyte infiltration.

These findings led us to investigate apoptosis, and to histochemically analyze involvement of Fas and FasL in the induction of apoptosis, in human malignant melanoma tissues. The percentages of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive melanoma cells and of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive melanoma cells in melanoma tissues (n = 22) were greater than those in melanocytes in uninvolved skin (n = 6) and nevus cells in nevi tissues (n = 9). The infiltrating lymphocytes around melanomas were also TUNEL positive. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of Fas and FasL in melanoma cells and lymphocytes, whereas no Fas or FasL expression was detected in normal skin melanocytes and nevus cells. There was significant correlation between Fas-positive indices and TUNEL indices in melanoma tissues. Moreover, TUNEL-, Fas-, and FasL-positive indices of melanoma cells from patients with Stage 3 melanomas were significantly lower than those with Stage 2 melanomas. The PCNA index of Stage 1 melanoma was significantly lower than that of the other stages, although the difference of PCNA index was insignificant among Stages 2 to 4. Among Stages 1 to 4, there was no difference in the PCNA, TUNEL-, and Fas-positive indices of lymphocytes, although the FasL-positive index of lymphocytes from Stage 3 melanomas was significantly lower than in that from Stage 2. These data reveal that melanoma cells and infiltrating lymphocytes have the potential to induce their own apoptosis regulated by Fas and FasL in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion and that the decline of Fas-mediated apoptosis of melanoma cells, rather than the apoptosis of infiltrating lymphocytes, may affect the prognosis of melanoma patients, possibly through the accumulation of more aberrant cells acquiring metastatic activity.",

Our study is the first to employ formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections in seeking to determine the ex vivo presence of tumor infiltrating leukocytes, including T lymphocytes, in human melanomas. We established the presence of some type of melanoma infiltrating host's immunological effector cells in all 40 observed melanoma cases'. More specifically, we found NK cells, macrophages and granulocytes in 30 out of 30 PMs and 10 out of 10 MMs. These effector cells represented the vast majority (> 80%) of the melanoma infiltrating immunocompetent cells. T lymphocytes were observed in 20 out of 30 PMs and 6 out of 10 MMs, but their numbers represented only between 5% to 10% of the heterogeneous leukocytic infiltrate. B cells were found in 22 out of 30 PMs and 8 out 10 MMs, their numbers representing less than 5%. Presence of cells of the dendritic reticulum, involved in antigen presentation was not determined in any of the observed PMs and MMs. There were more than enough macrophages and neutrophils, cells which are deeply involved in antigen presentation and, as previously mentioned, we found these cells within the melanomas. Thus defective antigen presentation cannot be the reason for the small proportion of T lymphocytes. What is to blame is probably the increased dedifferentiation of the melanoma immunophenotype (IP) to a degree that MHC class I molecules and the antigens complexed with them are lost and therefore there is nothing to be recognized by the T lymphocytes. In view of these results it is our-opinion that following the initial non-specific immune reaction, which may not be tumor specific, the specific immune response of effector T cells takes over. After significant IP changes by the majority of melanoma cells, including the internalization or shedding of MHC class I antigens, these highly specialized cells are no longer effective and the immune system responds by causing the reappearance of NK cells, macrophages and granulocytes. Thus, the relationship between melanoma and the host's immune system is evolutionarily dynamic: changes are readily made by either side when necessitated.",

Although both approaches have shown considerable promise, response rates to these therapies remain suboptimal. We hypothesized that a combinatorial approach to immunotherapy using both CTLA-4 blockade and nonlymphodepletional ACT could offer additive therapeutic benefit. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with syngeneic B16F10 melanoma tumors transfected to express low levels of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus peptide GP33 (B16GP33), and treated with no immunotherapy, CTLA-4 blockade, ACT, or combination immunotherapy of CTLA-4 blockade with ACT. Combination immunotherapy resulted in optimal control of B16GP33 melanoma tumors. Combination immunotherapy promoted a stronger local immune response reflected by enhanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations, and a stronger systemic immune responses reflected by more potent tumor antigen-specific T-cell activity in splenocytes. In addition, whereas both CTLA-4 blockade and combination immunotherapy were able to promote long-term immunity against B16GP33 tumors, only combination immunotherapy was capable of promoting immunity against parental B16F10 tumors as well. Our findings suggest that a combinatorial approach using CTLA-4 blockade with nonlymphodepletional ACT may promote additive endogenous and exogenous T-cell activities that enable greater therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of melanoma.

In some patients, tumor regression was accompanied by a large in vivo expansion of the administered antitumor lymphocytes, which persisted in peripheral blood at >70% of total lymphocytes for many months after transfer. The cells capable of mediating tumor regression consisted of heterogeneous lymphocyte populations with high avidity for tumor antigens that were derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes cultured for limited times in vitro.

This question was examined further by immunoperoxidase studies on sections from 29 primary and 30 metastatic melanoma with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against different lymphocyte subsets. The results indicated that expression of MHC class II DR* antigens on melanoma cells was associated with increased overall lymphocytic infiltration and that this applied particularly to the CD8+ subset of T cells. The CR3 receptor (CD 11b) was expressed predominantly on T cells and not macrophages but infiltration by CD11b+ cells did not correlate strongly with DR expression on melanoma cells. Dual staining with MAbs to CD8 and CD11b revealed that, whereas most of the CD8+ cells in DR- primary melanoma and DR+ metastatic melanoma were CD11b+, only approximately 50% of the CD8+ cells in DR+ primary melanoma were also CD11b+. Expression of CD11b on T cells was reported to define a suppressor subset of T cells. If the latter is correct the present results suggest that DR expression on primary melanoma is associated with infiltration by the cytotoxic T cell subset, whereas in the absence of DR antigens and in metastases this subset is absent and the predominant subset appears to be CD8+ CD11b+ T cells with suppressor activity.

This approach elicits significant inflammatory responses in metastatic sites and some objective tumor responses. Post-surgical adjuvant immunotherapy with DNP-modified melanoma vaccine in a setting of micrometastatic disease produces significant survival prolongation in stage III melanoma patients. Histologically, the inflammatory responses of the tumor consist of infiltration by lymphocytes, the majority of which are CD8+, HLA-DR+ T cells. T cells from these lesions tend to have mRNA for interferon gamma. T cell receptor analysis suggests that the tumor-infiltrating T cells are clonally expanded. DNP-modified vaccine also induces T cells in the peripheral blood, which respond to DNP-modified autologous cells in a hapten-specific, MHC-restricted manner. Moreover, a T cell line generated from these lymphocytes responded to only a single HPLC fraction of MHC-associated, DNP-modified tumor peptides. Since inflammatory responses in metastases were not consistently associated with dramatic tumor regression, we considered the possibility of immunosuppression at the tumor site. We found that mRNA for the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10) is expressed in most metastatic melanoma tissues and subsequently demonstrated that IL-10 protein is produced by melanoma cells. Thus the efficacy of DNP vaccine could be further enhanced by inhibition of IL-10 production or binding.

G209/g209-2M-reactive CTL were identified in post- but not prevaccination PBL. Limiting dilution analysis identified one predominant CTL clone (C1-35), with TCR Vbeta6s2, recognizing g209/HLA-A*0201-expressing targets. Additionally, two autologous melanoma lines (F001TU-3 and -4) and 20 separate tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures were generated from a fine needle aspirate of a metastatic lesion progressing after initial response to vaccination. Both F001TU did not express gp100 and were not recognized by C1-35. Loss of gp100 by F001TU correlated with a marked reduction of gp100 expression in the same metastatic lesion compared with prevaccination. Thus, ineffectiveness of C1-35 and tumor progression could be best explained by loss of target Ag expression. Interestingly, 12 of 20 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures recognized F001TU, but none demonstrated g209/g209-2M reactivity, suggesting a functional dissociation between systemic and local immune response.

To assess the role of the CC chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/chemokine ligand 2) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α/chemokine ligand 3) in this process, s.c. primary and metastatic B16 F10 melanoma tumor growth levels were examined in mice lacking MCP-1 or MIP-1α. Primary s.c. B16 F10 melanoma growth was augmented by loss of MCP-1 or MIP-1α. Similarly, lung metastasis was enhanced by the deficiency of MCP-1 or MIP-1α. Enhanced tumor outgrowth was associated with decreased percentages of infiltrating CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and natural killer cells. In the absence of MCP-1 or MIP-1α, melanoma outgrowth was correlated with reduced local expression of interferon-γ, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β. Among these cytokines, reduced expression levels of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α on leukocytes from the spleen were associated with the development of lung metastasis in chemokine-deficient mice. The local s.c. administration of these four cytokines significantly augmented another chemokine's expression and suppressed primary melanoma growth in mice deficient for MCP-1 or MIP-1α. The s.c. injection of MCP-1 or MIP-1α significantly inhibited the primary tumor growth in wild-type mice.

However, what regulates immune cell infiltration of tumors remains to be identified. Stat3 is constitutively activated with high frequency in diverse cancers, promoting tumor cell growth and survival. Blocking Stat3 signaling in tumors in vivo results in tumor growth inhibition that involves killing of nontransfected tumor cells and infiltration of immune effector cells, suggesting that Stat3 activity in tumor cells might affect immune cell recruitment. However, dying tumor cells can also attract immune cells. In this study, we show in isogenic murine melanomas that natural Stat3 activity is associated with tumor growth and reduction of T cell infiltration. Blocking Stat3 signaling in the melanoma cells containing high Stat3 activity results in expression of multiple chemoattractants, leading to increased migration of lymphocytes, NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. In addition, blocking Stat3 triggers tumor cells to produce soluble factors capable of activating macrophage production of NO in vitro and in vivo. TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, which are secreted by Stat3-inhibited tumor cells, are able to activate macrophage NO production, whereas neutralizing TNF-alpha in the tumor supernatant from Stat3-blocked tumor cells abrogates nitrite production. Moreover, interrupting Stat3 signaling in tumor cells leads to macrophage-mediated, nitrite-dependent cytostatic activity against nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that tumor Stat3 activity affects recruitment of diverse immune effectors and it can be manipulated to activate the effector phase of innate immune responses.",

Footpad tumors showed no lymphatic or blood vessel growth; however, the tumor-draining popliteal lymph node featured greatly increased lymphatic sinuses. Lymph node lymphangiogenesis began before melanoma cells reached draining lymph nodes, indicating that primary tumors induce these alterations at a distance. Lymph flow imaging revealed that nanoparticle transit was greatly increased through tumor-draining relative to nondraining lymph nodes. Lymph node lymphatic sinuses and lymph flow were increased in mice implanted with unmarked or with foreign antigen-expressing melanomas, indicating that these effects are not due to foreign antigen expression. However, tumor-derived immune signaling could promote lymph node alterations, as macrophages infiltrated footpad tumors, whereas lymphocytes accumulated in tumor-draining lymph nodes.

Analyses for association with clinico-epidemiological and neuroradiological parameters such as patient survival or tumor size were performed. TILs infiltrated brain metastases in three different patterns (stromal, peritumoral, diffuse). While carcinomas often show a strong stromal infiltration, TILs in melanomas often diffusely infiltrate the tumors. Highest levels of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were seen in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and strongest PD-1 levels on RCCs and melanomas. High amounts of TILs, high ratios of PD-1+/CD8+ cells and high levels of PD-L1 were negatively correlated with brain metastases size, indicating that in smaller brain metastases CD8+ immune response might get blocked. PD-L1 expression strongly correlated with TILs and FOXP3 expression. No significant association of patient survival with TILs was observed, while high levels of PD-L1 showed a strong trend towards better survival in melanoma brain metastases (Log-Rank p = 0.0537). In summary, melanomas and RCCs seem to be the most immunogenic entities.

No OX-40R(+) lymphocytes were noted in normal breast tissue. Twenty-one (43%) patients had axillary metastases at the time of resection. High levels of OX-40R expression was seen in 9 (45%) of these 21 axillary node specimens, whereas no such staining was seen in the node-negative specimens (P <0.001). Furthermore, in a patient thought to be without axillary disease, several subcapsular single-cell metastases were retrospectively discovered near a lone cluster of OX-40R(+) lymphocytes. In general, visual inspection showed OX-40R(+) T cells to be in close proximity to tumor and often in direct contact with metastatic cells.;The OX-40R is upregulated on lymphocytes within tumor draining lymph nodes, and these lymphocytes are specifically localized around tumor deposits. These data imply that OX-40R immunostaining may be useful for both determination of occult involvement of lymph nodes by tumor and for identification of potential candidates for future OX-40 based immunotherapy.",

Following in vivo screening of over 100 mutant melanoma clones, a single clone was selected for further study. When transplanted to the anterior segment of the mouse eye, the mutant melanoma (D5.1G4) underwent spontaneous resolution in 20% of the immunologically intact hosts. Tumor rejection involved extensive necrosis and culminated in phthisis of the tumor-containing eye. Histologic analysis revealed a prominent mononuclear cellular infiltrate in contrast to the parental progressor B16 melanoma. Immunologic analysis of tumor-bearing hosts showed variable cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses but potent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses directed against the melanoma cells. Fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells from ocular tumors revealed a cellular response consisting mainly of CD8+ CTLs and macrophages. Cultured D5.1G4 melanoma cells demonstrated: 1) enhanced expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens; 2) increased susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing; and 3) increased susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytolysis. Therefore, the intraocular D5.1G4 mutant melanoma model provides important insights into the immunology and immunopathology of intraocular tumor rejection. More intensive analysis of this intraocular melanoma may yield strategies for directing the immune response toward tumor rejection while minimizing damage to normal ocular components.",

In cutaneous melanoma, microscopic level of invasion (Breslow index), overall architecture of cells (horizontal or vertical growth phase), angiogenesis, vessel invasion are morphological features which may carry prognostic significance. As demonstrated by in vivo studies, stromal reaction in melanoma is mainly characterized by collagen and elastin proteolysis preferentially localized around the tumor at the invasive front along with variable angiogenesis and lymphocyte infiltration. On the basis of recent findings, it becomes increasingly evident that resident stromal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells) are implicated in the metastatic process, including proliferation, matrix degradation, or migration of melanoma cells through cell-cell cross-talk by soluble factors (proteases, cytokines, growth factors) or by direct contact.",

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the effector phase remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule that binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, the co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of antimelanoma immune responses.",

PBLs grew to levels that could be assessed for functional reactivity 9 of 15 times. In seven of nine cases, CD3+CD8+ CTLs grew from MLTCs that were tumor specific; five were restricted by HLA-A2 and two were restricted by HLA-A24. Four of the tumor-specific CTL lines lysed autologous fresh tumor cells. Tumor-specific CTLs from two of three patients had cytolytic activity identical with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from tumor biopsies removed earlier and grown in high concentrations (6000 IU/ml) of IL-2. Three of the HLA-A2-restricted tumor-specific CTLs were shown to recognize 293 cells transfected with HLA-A2.1 cDNA and the gene encoding the melanoma Ag, MART-1. In addition, these CTLs recognized the T2 cell line pulsed exogenously with the peptide MART-1(27-35), which is the nine-amino acid immunodominant epitope of the MART-1 Ag recognized on melanoma tumor cells by nearly all HLA-A2-restricted TIL. Thus, we have demonstrated the ability to generate tumor-specific CTLs from PBLs that are similar in their reactivity to TIL.

Other means of enhancing the activity of interleukin 2-based immunotherapy are suggested by the finding that tumor cell susceptibility to lysis by natural killer cells is depressed following treatment with interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor, but susceptibility to lysis by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is markedly enhanced. Further development of these therapies will require innovative interpretation and application of findings related to the processing and presentation of human tumor antigens and the nature of tumor antigens and careful analysis of the T-cell receptor in antitumor effectors.",

From this group, 26 patients were retrospectively identified to have had untreated brain metastases and extracranial disease before receiving ACT. The response rate and duration of melanoma brain metastases, as well as the overall response rate, response duration, and survival for these patients, are presented.;Seventeen of these 26 patients received ACT with TIL. Seven of these patients (41%) achieved a complete response in the brain, and six patients achieved an overall partial response. In the nine patients that received TCR-transduced lymphocytes, two patients achieved a complete response in the brain (22%) and one of these two achieved an overall partial response. One patient developed a tumor-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage during the thrombocytopenic phase of therapy and had an uneventful metastatectomy.;ACT with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen using either TIL- or TCR gene-transduced cells and interleukin-2 can mediate complete and durable regression of melanoma brain metastases.

Moreover, in vitro culture steps may introduce major biases. New approaches to identify tumor-specific CTL clones would be helpful. As a means to describe the in situ immune status by T-cell repertoire analysis, we developed the Immunoscope approach, a PCR-based method that allows us to determine the spectra of CDR3 lengths of the TCR chains displayed by complex populations of T cells. We review here some of our data about melanoma. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of a melanoma patient were analyzed by different means and melanoma-specific T-cell clones were derived. Two categories of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL clones were derived from the infiltrate of a tumor-proximal invaded lymph node. The majority of T-cell clones specifically lyse the autologous tumor cell lines and predominantly recognize the HLA-A2/MART-1(27-35) peptide complex. The in vivo representativity of such CTL was assessed by the immunoscope technology. Among three MART-1-specific clones, none was detectable in situ. The other kind of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL did not lyse autologous melanoma cell lines but lysed the \"fresh\" autologous tumor cells in a MHC class I dependent manner. The immunoscope approach revealed that one of the latter was detectable in situ among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes although not among PBMC. These data indicate that melanoma-specific lymphocytes that could not have been selected through conventional screening procedures may be important in tumor rejection. Our results suggest that a better characterization of tumor-specific immune responses will be important for the optimization of specific immunotherapy strategies and the long-term follow-up of patients.",

The relationship between anti-PD-L1 tumor exposition and anti-tumor effect represents a challenge that has been addressed in this work through the identification of certain biomarkers implicated in the antibody's mechanism of action, using a syngeneic melanoma mouse model. The development of an in-vitro/in-vivo platform has allowed us to investigate the PD-L1 behavior after its blockage with anti-PD-L1 at cellular level and in animals. In-vitro studies showed that the complex PD-L1/anti-PD-L1 was retained mainly at the cell surface. The antibody concentration and time exposure affected directly the recycling or ligand turnover. In-vivo studies showed that anti-PD-L1 was therapeutically active at all stage of the disease, with a rapid onset, a low but durable efficacy and non-relevant toxic effect. This efficacy measured as tumor shrinkage correlated with tumor-specific infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which increased as antibody tumor concentrations increased. Both, TILS and antibody concentrations followed similar kinetic patterns, justifying the observed anti-PD-L1 rapid onset. Interestingly, peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) behave as infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting that these PBLs might be considered as a possible biomarker for antibody activity.",

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors.

Four predominantly CD8+ and two mixed CD4+, CD8+ population TIL cultures were tested for lysis in short-term 51Cr-release assays against a panel of targets including 29 fresh melanomas, 2 fresh sarcomas, 11 cultured melanoma lines, and 14 nonmelanoma cell lines derived from HLA-typed patients. All six melanoma TILs lysed the autologous melanoma. Two of three TILs from HLA-A2+ patients lysed allogeneic melanomas matched for HLA-A2, giving evidence for shared tumor Ag; one of these TILs also used HLA-B44 as a restriction element. The third HLA-A2+ TIL lysed autologous melanoma but not autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells nor 14 HLA-A2 matched allogeneic melanomas, suggesting the possibility of a unique tumor Ag in this system. The three HLA-A2- TILs each lysed multiple HLA-matched melanomas, using HLA-A24, HLA-A31, and HLA-Cw7 as restriction elements. Blocking of autologous and allogeneic melanoma lysis by TILs with mAb w6/32 (anti-MHC class I) and anti-CD3, as well as cold target inhibition assays, confirmed that specific interaction of the T-cell receptor with MHC class I Ag and the relevant tumor Ag on the target cell surface is required for tumor lysis.

We previously showed that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from human melanoma and renal cell carcinoma demonstrate a dramatic decrease in their spontaneous locomotion through three-dimensional collagen gel when compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and lymph node lymphocytes. To determine if this decrease is caused by contact with tumor cells, or mediated through certain diffusible factors, we examined the effects of autologous tumor cells on the locomotion of PBL in a model system where tumor cells were separated from lymphocytes by a 3-mm layer of gelled collagen. After 21-22 h incubation in chamber slides, locomotion distances were assessed in the presence and absence of tumor and normal cells. In the presence of tumor cells, PBL from 14 of 18 patients displayed substantial (466.5 +/- 2.7 microns compared to control 568.9 +/- 10.9 microns, P < 0.001) loss of motility. Inhibition was more prominent in melanoma patients than in renal cell carcinoma patients. Thus the impaired locomotion previously observed in TIL was at least partially due to the presence of tumor. The locomotion of TIL was restored in four of five melanoma patients treated with liposome-encapsulated muramyl-tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine (L-MTP-PE). Furthermore, in six of seven examined L-MTP-PE-treated patients, an increase in intrinsic PBL locomotion during the first month of the therapy was observed.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are thought to play a crucial rôle in tumor immunosurveillance. In malignant melanoma expression and secretion of monocyte-chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) have been demonstrated. MCP-1 serves as an attractant for monocytes and activated T-cells. In this study we addressed the question whether circulating monocytes show altered chemotaxis to MCP-1. Therefore the chemotactic responsiveness of monocytes towards MCP-1 was investigated in patients with primary and metastatic melanoma and compared to patients with basal cell carcinoma and healthy persons. The results show that monocytes from melanoma patients showed a significantly decreased chemotactic migration towards MCP-1 while chemotaxis to the stimulus N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) remained normal. Patients with basal cell carcinoma showed normal monocyte chemotaxis to all stimuli tested. In primary melanoma, there was no relation of the number of TAM or TIL to the decreased chemotaxis of circulating monocytes to MCP-1. From these data it can be concluded that circulating monocytes from patients with primary and metastatic melanoma show a MCP-1-specific decrease in chemotactic migration. This may be due to deactivation or modulation of the MCP-1-receptor expression on these cells.",

Also, we correlated the presence of tumor-infiltrating γδ T lymphocytes with clinical evolution of melanoma.;Mean frequencies of circulating γδ T cells before and after melanoma removal were very similar and comparable to healthy subjects, but patients who progressed to stage III or IV showed a significantly decreased frequency of circulating Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. The distribution of Vγ9Vδ2 memory and effector subsets was similar in healthy subjects and melanoma patients at diagnosis, but circulating γδ T cells of patients after melanoma removal had a skewed terminally-differentiated effector memory phenotype.

In the present study morphological correlates of tumor-stroma interaction were examined in 344 melanoma lesions metastatic to the skin.

Our results showed that simple infiltration into the surrounding tissue as well as the incorporation of pre-existent stroma tissue without destruction is associated with poor outcome, whereas capsule and fibrous septa are favorable prognostic signs, particularly in subcutaneous lesions. Remarkably, simple infiltration is a prognostic indicator independent of the location of the metastasis (locoregional or distant), as shown by multivariate analysis. These data indicate that morphological aspects of tumor-stroma interaction in metastatic skin lesions of melanoma may reflect biological behavior of the tumor cells, may facilitate a pathological subclassification of metastatic melanoma in addition to clinical data, and are directly related to the patient's outcome.",

Primary melanoma cell lines were obtained from a series of patients with either eye or skin melanoma. The ability of tumor cells to stimulate T cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors was assessed in mixed-lymphocyte tumor cell cultures in which allogeneic lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated ocular or skin melanoma cells. Expression of HLA class I and class II on tumor cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma, was determined by flow cytometry. The ability of tumor cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was determined by adding various concentrations of irradiated tumor cells to standard mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Our results indicate that primary skin melanoma cells induce vigorous proliferation of allo-antigen-specific T cells. By contrast, ocular melanoma cells failed to induce significant T-cell proliferation. The failure of ocular melanoma cells to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation was not due to low levels of either class I or class II on tumor cells since tumor cells treated with IFN-gamma expressed high levels of class I and class II but still failed to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Ocular melanoma cells inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, as shown by experiments in which a small number of tumor cells prevented proliferation of T cells in mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation required cell-to-cell contact, and supernatants from tumor cell cultures did not prevent lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, the ability of ocular melanoma cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was lost when tumor cells migrated from the eye and formed hepatic metastases. We conclude that there is a fundamental difference in the immunogenicity of ocular and skin melanoma cells. Ocular melanomas, but not primary skin melanomas, are poorly immunogenic tumors that inhibit T-cell proliferation. Our results imply that the immunogenicity of melanoma cells is altered when they develop within the unique ocular micro-environment.",

Tumors were excised before treatment (PRE), early during treatment (EDT), and at progression (PROG). Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CD68, FOXP3, LAG3, PD-1, and PD-L1 and correlated with clinical outcome.;Patients' tumors that were PD-L1 positive at baseline showed a significant decrease in PD-L1 expression at PROG (P = 0.028), whereas patients' tumors that were PD-L1 negative at baseline showed a significant increase in PD-L1 expression at PROG (P = 0.008) irrespective of treatment with BRAFi or Combi. Overall PD-L1 expression highly correlated with TIL immune markers. BRAFi-treated patients showed significant increases in CD4(+), CD8(+), and PD-1(+) lymphocytes from PRE to EDT (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.017, respectively), and Combi-treated patients showed similar increases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes from PRE to EDT (P = 0.017, P = 0.021).;The addition of MEKi to BRAFi did not result in significant reduction in immune infiltration in EDT biopsies. This provides support for conducting trials that combine MAPKi with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the hope of improving complete and durable response rates.

Here, using B16F0 melanoma cells stably expressing CCL21 under the control of cytomegalovirus and ubiquitin promoters, we showed that CCL21-activated immune responses depend on the amount of melanoma-derived chemokine, which, in turn, depends on the strength of the promoter. We showed that ubiquitin promoter-driven expression of CCL21 enabled massive infiltration of tumors with CD4(+)CD25(-), CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and CD11c(+) dendritic cells, and consequent activation of cellular and humoral immune responses sufficient for complete rejection of CCL21-positive melanomas within 3 weeks in all tumor-inoculated mice. Mice that rejected CCL21-positive tumors acquired protective immunity against melanoma, which was transferable to naive mice via splenocytes and central memory T cells. Moreover, melanoma-derived CCL21 facilitated immune-mediated remission of preestablished, distant wild-type melanomas. Overall, these results suggest that elevated levels of tumor-derived CCL21 are required for the activation of strong melanoma-specific immune responses and generation of protective immunologic memory.

By analyzing the immune response of a metastatic melanoma patient who achieved a long-term response to vaccination, we identified melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP) as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction. Vaccination stimulated a coordinated cellular and humoral reaction to ML-IAP that was associated with extensive tumor necrosis, whereas lethal disease progression was linked with the loss of ML-IAP expression and the absence of intra-tumoral lymphocyte infiltrates.

Similarly to their CD8(+) counterparts, intra-tumor DP T cells are MHC class-I restricted but differed by a limited lytic activity against autologous melanoma cells. Based on these observations and to further characterize DP T cells, both populations were compared at the transcriptional level. Our results revealed the overexpression of the IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) by DP T cells and prompted us to investigate the impact of IL-9 on their biology. We show that IL-9 favors DP T-cell survival by protecting them from apoptosis and by promoting their proliferation. In addition, IL-9 enhances their ability to produce cytokines and increased their levels of granzyme B/perforin as well as degranulation capacity, leading to a strengthened cytotoxic activity against melanoma cells. Taken together, the IL-9R(high) DP T-cell population could be a new preferential target for IL-9, which could take part in their retention within the melanoma infiltrate while also favoring their anti-tumor activity. More generally, our results extend the pleiotropic effects of IL-9 to IL-9R-expressing intra-tumor T cells, which could further potentiate anti-tumor immune responses. ",

Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. In previous series of experiments, the variability of T cell receptors (TCRs) in the lymphocytes infiltrating a regressive tumor lesion was investigated. Results demonstrated that clonal T cell populations, precisely defined through their V-D-J junctional sequences, were amplified in situ. One clone was predominant, expressing the V beta 16 variable gene segment. A specific anti-V beta 16 TCR mAb was generated here to purify and functionally characterize the corresponding cells. A tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-derived V beta 16+ T cell line was developed using this reagent. These in vitro cultured cells were found to express the in vivo predominant TCR sequence exclusively and to display an HLA-B14-restricted cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor cells. Immunohistochemical experiments, performed with the anti-V beta 16 mAb, showed that the corresponding CTLs are present in the tumor area, some of them being closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrate the existence of a local adaptive immune response clinically associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept in certain human tumors.",

We investigated the potential of colorectal cancer TIL as a source of killer cells and the effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in combination with IL2 on their cytotoxic activity. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated from surgical specimens using a mechanical and enzymatic dissociation process. Autologous lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were used as control. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LPMC were cultured in the presence of IL2 with/without TNF alpha (1000 U/ml each) for 5 to 8 weeks. Cytotoxicity (% lysis) was tested against Daudi target cells in a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay. The combination of IL2 and TNF alpha resulted in a significantly greater-fold expansion of TIL than IL2 alone (P less than 0.01). Lamina propria mononuclear cells expanded less than TIL, and TNF alpha had an inhibitory effect on their growth (P less than 0.05). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LPMC showed comparable cytotoxicity when cultured with IL2 alone. However, the addition of TNF alpha augmented the killer activity of TIL while inhibiting that of LPMC (P = 0.035). These results indicate that TNF alpha selectively increases the IL2-induced growth and cytotoxic function of colorectal cancer TIL, but not those of gut mucosal lymphoid cells, suggesting that TIL and LMPC differ in their response to TNF alpha. Therefore, this combination of cytokines may hold more promise than single agents for the immunotherapy of colorectal cancers with TIL.",

These mice develop primary cutaneous melanomas which grow progressively and metastasize in the absence of immunogenic foreign proteins such as oncogenes or antigens. Primary and metastatic tumors evade innate and adaptive immune defenses, although they naturally express melanocytic antigens which can be recognized by antigen-specific T cells. We found that primary melanomas continued to grow despite infiltration with adoptively transferred, in vivo-activated, tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. To promote tumor immune defense, we developed a treatment protocol consisting of four complementary components: (a) chemotherapeutic preconditioning prior to (b) adoptive lymphocyte transfer and (c) viral vaccination followed by (d) adjuvant peritumoral injections of immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Lymphocyte ablation and innate antiviral immune stimulation cooperatively enhanced the expansion and the effector cell differentiation of adoptively transferred lymphocytes. The efficacy of the different treatment approaches converged in the tumor microenvironment and induced a strong cytotoxic inflammatory response enabling preferential recognition and destruction of melanoma cells. This combination chemoimmunotherapy caused complete regression of advanced primary melanomas in the skin and metastases in the lung with minimal autoimmune side effects.

In this article, we report the presence of MECA 79(+) blood vessels displaying all the phenotypic characteristics of HEVs in most of the 319 human primary solid tumors, including melanomas, breast, ovarian, colon, and lung carcinomas, analyzed. Tumor HEVs were specifically located within lymphocyte-rich areas, and their density within the tumor stroma was a strong predictor of infiltration by CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cells as well as B cells. Large-scale flow cytometric and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses in freshly operated breast tumors revealed that high densities of tumor HEVs correlated with increased naive, central memory and activated effector memory T-cell infiltration and upregulation of genes related to T-helper 1 adaptive immunity and T-cell cytotoxicity. Finally, in a retrospective cohort of 146 invasive breast cancer patients, we found that high densities of tumor HEVs independently conferred a lower risk of relapse and significantly correlated with longer metastasis-free, disease-free, and overall survival rates.

In addition to such targeted therapies, immunotherapeutic approaches have shown promising results. A combination of these two treatment modalities could potentially result in further improvement of treatment outcome. To preclinically identify efficient treatment combinations and to optimize therapy protocols in terms of sequence and timing, mouse models will be required. We have crossed and characterized the Tyr::CreER(T2);PTEN(F-/-);BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma model on a C57BL/6J background. Tumors from this model harbor the BRAF(V600E) mutation and are PTEN-deficient, making them highly suitable for the testing of targeted therapies. Furthermore, we crossed the model onto this specific background for use in immunotherapy studies, because most experiments in this field have been performed in C57BL/6J mice. Selective inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by PLX4720 treatment of melanoma-bearing mice resulted in a strong decrease of tumor outgrowth. Furthermore, the inducible melanomas had immune cell infiltrates similar to those found in human melanoma, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could be cultured from these tumors. Our data indicate that the C57BL/6J Tyr::CreER(T2);PTEN(F-/-);BRAF(F-V600E/+) melanoma model could be used as a standard model in which targeted and immunotherapy combinations can be tested in a high-throughput manner.",

As assessed by these methods, the level of MA expression by the original tumor cell explants correlated with the expression in established in vitro cell lines. Molecular analysis of the established cell lines utilizing PCR technology improved the sensitivity of detection of MA expression.

Notably, we found that tumor-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were dominated by TNF production. TNF reduced CD8(+) T-cell activation in IFNγ-rich environments resembling a tumor site. Conversely, direct CD4(+) T-cell responses had no influence on either the proliferation or viability of melanoma cells. Taken together, our results illustrate a novel immune escape mechanism that can be activated by aberrant expression of MHC class II molecules, which by attracting tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells elicit a local inflammatory response dominated by TNF that, in turn, inhibits cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell responses",

The TCR variable (V) genes, joining (J) segments, and N diversity regions used by five clonal lines and one highly oligoclonal, melanoma-specific, CD8+ TIL line were examined utilizing PCR amplification with V gene subfamily-specific primers and anchor PCR. The TIL lysed multiple allogeneic melanomas expressing matched surface major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. TCR analysis confirmed the clonal nature of the TIL lines; however, the TCR repertoire was diverse. Even among the three HLA-A2 restricted TIL (TIL 1200, TIL F2-2, and TIL-5), no common V gene usage was found. Comparison of the third complementarity-determining regions of the TCRs from the HLA-A2 restricted TIL revealed no homology. Results presented here identify T-cell clonotypes that recognize epitopes on highly prevalent, shared melanoma tumor-associated antigens presented in the context of HLA-B55, HLA-A1, and HLA-A2.

In an attempt to improve persistence of the transferred lymphocytes, we cotransduced human peripheral blood lymphocytes with retroviruses encoding Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, antiapoptotic genes of the BCL2 family, and the MART-1 melanoma tumor antigen-specific TCR, DMF5. Lymphocytes were cotransduced with 38% to 64% cotransduction efficiency, and exhibited a marked delay in apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal. Cotransduction with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL did not affect cytokine secretion or lytic ability of the DMF5-transduced lymphocytes. After 5 days of IL-2 withdrawal, cotransduced lymphocytes produced similar levels of IFN-γ per cell as DMF5-alone transduced lymphocytes in response to tumor cells. Cotransduction did not alter the phenotype of lymphocytes with respect to a panel of T-cell differentiation markers. In a mouse model of melanoma, adoptively transferred T cells transduced with Bcl-2 persisted better in vivo at the site of tumor, 13 and 21 days after adoptive transfer (P=0.0064 and 0.041, respectively), with evidence of enrichment of the Bcl-2-transduced population over time (P<0.0001).

Homing receptor expression on lymphocytes strongly correlated with MMel dissemination. Loss of CCR6 or CXCR3, but not cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), on circulating T cell subsets was associated with skin or lymph node metastases, loss of CXCR4, CXCR5, and CCR9 corresponded with lung involvement, and a rise in CCR10 or CD103 was associated with widespread dissemination. High frequencies of CD8+CCR9+ naive T cells correlated with prolonged OS, while neutralizing the CCR9/CCL25 axis in mice stimulated tumor progression. The expansion of CLA-expressing effector memory CD8+ T cells in response to a single administration of CTLA4 blockade predicted disease control at 3 months in 47 patients with MMel.

The present study aimed at defining the role of tumor SK1 in the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages in melanoma. Herein, we show that downregulation of SK1 in melanoma cells causes a reduction in the percentage of CD206highMHCIIlow M2 macrophages in favor of an increased proportion of CD206lowMHCIIhigh M1 macrophages into the tumor. This macrophage differentiation orchestrates T lymphocyte recruitment as well as tumor rejection through the expression of Th1 cytokines and chemokines. In vitro experiments indicated that macrophage migration is triggered by the binding of tumor S1P to S1PR1 receptors present on macrophages whereas macrophage differentiation is stimulated by SK1-induced secretion of TGF-β1. Finally, RNA-seq analysis of human melanoma tumors revealed a positive correlation between SK1 and TGF-β1 expression. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that melanoma SK1 plays a key role in the recruitment and phenotypic shift of the tumor macrophages that promote melanoma growth.",

Monitoring included blood for clinical, autoimmune, and immunological analyses and core tumor biopsies. Treatment outcome was determined 8 weeks after the first α-gal glycolipid injection. Nine pts received two intratumoral injections of α-gal glycolipids (3 pts/cohort). Injection-site toxicity was mild, and no systemic toxicity or autoimmunity could be attributed to the therapy. Two pts had stable disease by RECIST lasting 8 and 7 months.

To establish the characteristics of Fas ligand expression during the course of melanoma progression we performed a longitudinal study analyzing primary tumors as well as subsequently evolving metastases.

The Fas ligand positive primary melanomas were rather thick, i.e., 8.5 and 3.8 mm, versus a median of 2.4 mm of the remaining tumors. In contrast, for metastatic melanoma Fas ligand expression was present in six of 11 cases investigated. The metastases of primary tumors displaying Fas ligand maintained its expression. As Fas ligand positive melanoma cells are capable of inducing apoptosis in susceptible cells, e.g., Fas positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, we tested for the presence of apoptotic cells in situ by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. This analysis revealed that apoptotic cells were present within the Fas ligand positive tumors. The number of apoptotic cells, however, never exceeded 5% of the total cells.

In current practice, most patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanomas will see both modalities. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combining immunotherapy with MAPK inhibition may have synergistic effects. First, mouse models show that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can be enhanced by vaccination. Rapid tumor destruction by vemurafenib could provide a vaccine-like stimulus to adoptively transferred T cells. Second, both in mice and in early clinical trials, melanoma metastases treated with MAPK inhibitors seem to display increased T-cell infiltrates. Third, MAPK inhibition upregulates the expression of some melanoma antigens and, therefore, may enhance T-cell recognition of vemurafenib-treated melanomas. Fourth, vemurafenib may sensitize tumor cells to immune destruction. Finally, some investigators have found that an optimal antitumor effect from MAPK inhibition is dependent on an intact host immune response. Currently, the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has initiated a phase II trial combining the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ACT using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors to investigate the safety and efficacy of this combination.

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite their well-documented immunogenicity, malignant melanomas belong to the most aggressive tumor types. A potential explanation for this is the suboptimal activation of tumor infiltrating T cells. In order to boost immune responses against tumors, a variety of treatment modalities have been tested in animal models and in clinical setting. Antigen-nonspecific approaches (e.g., IFN-alpha and IL-2), as well as active specific immunotherapeutical modalities based on the use of autologous or allogeneic tumor cell-save been investigated in clinical trials of melanoma. The identification of melanoma-associated antigens has opened new avenues in antigen-specific immunotherapy. A promising alternative for the delivery of different forms of melanoma antigens is the application of dendritic cells, the most potent antigen presenting cells capable of eliciting efficient T-cell response. Beside active immunotherapy, immune response against melanoma antigens could be increased through the adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or antigen specific T-cell clones. The most important conclusion that can be drawn from the results of published immunotherapy studies is that these modalities are able to induce durable complete tumor regressions,mostly with reasonable toxicity; however, generally only in a minority of patients. This points to the importance of appropriate patient selection, with regard to the expression of the targeted antigens and HLA molecules, as well as to the general immunocompetence of the patients. A crucial and still unsolved question is monitoring immune activation during treatment, although there are promising new tools that could prove useful in this respect. The presence of tumor-reactive CTL in the circulation or in the tumors does not guarantee an efficient immune response. It is important to assess if these T cells are in an activated and functional state. Finally, in several single target antigen-based clinical studies a therapy-induced immunoselection of antigen-negative clones, leading to disease progression, was observed. This could be overcome with the use of antigen cocktails or whole tumor approaches. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutical modalities may enhance the success rate of these strategies.",

Sections were examined for MMP-1, -2, -9, and -13 mRNA expression by in situ hybridization with (35)S-radiolabeled riboprobes. Immunohistochemical studies of the same specimens were conducted with MMP-2-specific antibodies. For double-labeling experiments, primary MMP-2-specific antibodies and antibodies binding to fibroblasts and macrophages were used.;MMP-2 mRNA expression was detected in 10 (91%) of 11 eyes with MASS and scleral tumor invasion. In eight (73%) of these cases, the expression signals were seen in numerous scleral fibroblasts. In melanoma cases without MASS, MMP-2 mRNA expression was detected in four (36%) cases, and only one (9%) showed numerous positive cells. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages were found to harbor MMP-2, shown by a double-labeling experiment. The MMP-2 expression by immunostaining coincides with MMP-2 expression by in situ hybridization. No MMP-2 expression was detected in the tumor cells.;MASS is considered a tumor-induced scleral degradation process. There is a significantly higher expression of MMP-2 in MASS-positive areas, indicating that MMP-2 is involved in the development of MASS and that MMP-2 is produced by scleral fibroblasts under the influence of tumor cells and/or tumor-infiltrating macrophages. These changes may represent a step in the invasion of uveal melanoma by facilitating the spread of tumor cells through the sclera.",

For comparison, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from matched melanoma patients. We sorted different CD8(+) subsets found in TIL and determined their effector functions. In addition, we carried out Vβ clonotype expression analysis of T-cell receptors to determine lineage relationship between the CD8(+) TIL subsets.;The majority of CD8(+) TIL was in the early-effector memory stage of differentiation. A significant population consisted of an oligoclonal subset of cells coexpressing CD27, CD28, CD57, and Granzyme B, with little or no perforin. These cells could be induced to proliferate, produce a high level of IFN-γ, and differentiate into CD27(-)CD57(+), perforin(high) mature CTL in vitro. Addition of TGF-β1 prevented further differentiation.;Our studies identified a novel subset of incompletely differentiated CD8(+) CTL coexpressing early effector memory and late CTL markers.

Also, prognostic significance of ADAM-10 expression in primary tumor cells and metastatic lesion cells was evaluated during 5-year observation. It was revealed that high expression of ADAM-10 positive cells was strictly related with lower intensity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P = 0.037), which suggests that ADAM-10 regulates immunoresponse in melanoma initiation and progression. No statistically significant correlations were found between ADAM-10 expression in primary tumor cells and nodal metastases and other histopathological parameters analyzed. Decreased immunoreactivity of ADAM-10 in cancer cells from regional lymph nodes was correlated with worse prognosis; however this correlation was statistically nonsignificant (P = 0.065).

Gene transfection approaches have proved more successful. A gene family named MAGE codes for antigens recognized by autologous CTL on a melanoma tumor. These genes are not expressed in normal tissues except for testis. They are expressed in many tumors of several histological types.

The efficacy of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibodies, anti-programmed cell death 1 antibodies, and the BRAF(V600E) kinase inhibitor has been proven in metastatic melanoma. At the same time, adoptive cell transfer has significant effects against metastatic melanoma; however, it is difficult to apply on a broad scale because of the problems related to cell preparation. To overcome these problems, we developed immune cell therapy using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The benefit of our method is that a large number of cells can be readily obtained. We focused on macrophages for immune cell therapy because macrophage infiltration is frequently observed in solid cancers. In this study, the efficacy of human iPS cell-derived myeloid cell lines (iPS-ML) genetically modified to express type I IFNs against human melanoma cells was examined. The morphology, phagocytic ability, and surface markers of iPS-ML were similar to those of macrophages. The iPS-ML that express type I IFNs (iPS-ML-IFN) showed significant effects in inhibiting the growth of disseminated human melanoma cells in SCID mice. The infiltration of iPS-ML into the tumor nests was confirmed immunohistologically. The iPS-ML-IFNs increased the expression of CD169, a marker of M1 macrophages that can activate antitumor immunity. The iPS-ML-IFNs could infiltrate into tumor tissue and exert anticancer effects in the local tumor tissue. In conclusion, this method will provide a new therapeutic modality for metastatic melanoma.",

In this study, we compared the T cell response to the B16F10 melanoma engrafted into CD5-deficient and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Compared with wild-type mice, CD5 knockout animals displayed delayed tumor growth, associated with tumor infiltration by T cell populations exhibiting a more activated phenotype and enhanced antitumor effector functions. However, control of tumor progression in CD5(-/-) mice was transient due to increased AICD of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. Remarkably, in vivo protection of T cells from TCR-mediated apoptosis by an adenovirus engineered to produce soluble Fas resulted in a dramatic reduction in tumor growth. Our data suggest that recruitment of tumor-specific T cells in the tumor microenvironment occurs at early stages of cancer development and that tumor-mediated AICD of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes is most likely involved in tumor escape from the immune system.",

To determine if T-cell-defined melanoma antigens are expressed on other tumors of neuroectodermal origin, four melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cultures derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were tested for lysis of a panel of 23 HLA-A2+ neuroectodermal tumor cell lines of various histologies, including retinoblastoma (1), neuroblastoma (8), neuroepithelioma (6), astrocytoma (2), neuroglioma (1), and Ewing's sarcoma (5). Low expression of MHC class I and/or ICAM-1 molecules was found on 22 of 23 neuroectodermal tumor lines, and could be enhanced by treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Following IFN gamma treatment, three Ewing's sarcoma lines were lysed by at least one melanoma TIL culture, and levels of lysis were comparable to melanoma lysis by these TIL. Lysis could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC class I molecules and against CD3, indicating specific immune recognition of tumor-associated antigens. None of the other neuroectodermal tumors tested were lysed by TIL, but they could be lysed by non-MHC-restricted lymphokine-activated killer cells. This demonstration of immunological cross-reactivity between melanomas and Ewing's sarcomas, two tumors of distinct histological types with a common embryonic origin, has implications for the developmental nature of these CTL-defined tumor antigens.

While some newer methods have yielded better prognostic information, some insights have evolved as a result of large-scale population-based analyses.;We review current data on several different prognostic factors and divide these factors according to their application in localized primary melanoma or metastatic melanoma. For each prognostic factor, the level of evidence supporting its use and its applicability to clinical practice are considered.;For localized primary melanoma, the dominant predictors of survival include lesion thickness, ulceration, and lymph node involvement. Factors such as age, sex, anatomic location, and satellite/in-transit lesions are important in localized melanoma. Factors currently being investigated are tumor vascularity, vascular invasion, mitotic rate, tumor regression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. For metastatic melanoma, the most important prognostic factors are site of metastases and the presence of elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase. The value of these prognostic factors to clinicians caring for melanoma patients is discussed.;A better understanding of prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma has evolved over the last decade, allowing oncologists to provide appropriate treatment for their patients. Many of the prognostic factors are interrelated. In the near future, it is expected that several molecular genetic factors will provide more insight into the prognosis of patients with melanoma.",

This clone recognized all melanoma cell lines tested and, to a lower extent, melanocytes, in the context of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2), but it did not recognize other tumor cell types. The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called melanoma-overexpressed antigen (meloe). Remarkably, the structure of meloe was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE-1. Using a specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE-1-specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE-1-specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes. Overall, our results suggest that this new antigen is involved in immunosurveillance and, thus, represents an attractive target for immunotherapy protocols of melanoma.",

Tumor cell suspensions from a variety of tumors were able to be separated using enzymatic techniques and they were cultured in medium containing recombinant interleukin-2. Activated infiltrating lymphocytes within these tumors expanded; and, by 6-8 days after initiation of culture, lymphocytes predominated and were able to grow to large numbers. The adoptive transfer of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) made possible mediation of the reduction of established 3-day pulmonary micrometastases from 5 of 7 tumors tested, including two 3-methylcholanthrene (CAS: 56-49-5)-induced sarcomas, one 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (CAS: 540-73-8)-induced colon carcinoma, and the B16 melanoma, all in C57BL/6 mice, as well as the 1660 bladder carcinoma in BALB/c mice. Approximately 2-4 X 10(6) transferred cells were capable of totally eliminating 3-day established metastases. These cells were thus 50 to 100 times more effective than lymphokine-activated killer cells in reducing established metastases; however, they could not be generated from all tumors. The concomitant administration of recombinant interleukin-2 enhanced, by approximately fivefold, the in vivo activity of these cells. The specificity of action of TILs in vivo was different from that determined by classic amputation rechallenge experiments. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that developed this antitumor reactivity appeared to be Thy-1+ and did not bear the asialo GM1 antigen. The potent antitumor effect of these TILs, when transferred in vivo to tumor-bearing hosts, raises the possibility of utilizing similar approaches for the isolation and therapeutic use of lymphocytes with antitumor reactivity from human tumors.",

Antibodies directed against gp100 are an important tool in the diagnosis of human melanoma. Since the gp100 antigen is highly expressed in melanocytic cells, we investigated whether this antigen might serve as a target for antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, we demonstrate that cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from a melanoma patient (TIL 1200) are directed against gp100. HLA-A2.1+ melanoma cells are lysed by TIL from this patient. In addition, murine double transfectants, expressing both HLA-A2.1 and gp100, are lysed by TIL 1200, whereas transfectants expressing only HLA-A2.1 are not susceptible to lysis. Furthermore, the HLA-A2.1+ melanoma cell line BLM, which lacks gp100 expression and is resistant to lysis, becomes susceptible after transfection of gp100 cDNA. Finally, HLA-A2.1+ normal melanocytes are lysed by TIL 1200. These data demonstrate that the melanocyte differentiation antigen gp100 can be recognized in the context of HLA-A2.1 by CTL from a melanoma patient.

Using immunocytochemical techniques on frozen sections, the cellular types and activation status of infiltrating cells within a series of 19 clinically apparent nodal metastases of melanoma were studied. Infiltrating cells were assessed using a semiquantitative grading system. Macrophages (CD68+) and T-lymphocytes (CD3+) (including both CD8+ and probably also CD4+ T-cells) were the predominant cells infiltrating the tumours. B-lymphocytes (CD20+) were generally present in low numbers. CD1a+ putative dendritic cell density and expression of the early lymphocyte activation markers interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2Ralpha) and CD69 was low. However, greater evidence of intermediate lymphocyte activation (CD38) was identified. Expression of interleukin-2 (IL2) by tumour-infiltrating cells was not detected. The paucity of staining for IL2 and IL2Ralpha, with greater expression of CD38 by infiltrating cells, suggests that the usual pathways of lymphocyte activation via IL2 were bypassed or impaired within the lymph node metastases. Low numbers of CD1a+ putative dendritic cells may result in reduced effector cell activation. These findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that antitumour immune responses within clinically involved lymph nodes are reduced in metastatic melanoma.

In response to its cognate antigen, each clone used for treatment secreted large amounts of interferon-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lesser amounts of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and little or no IL-4 and IL-10. Clones also demonstrated recognition of human leukocyte antigen-matched melanomas using cytokine secretion and lysis assays. Twelve patients received 2 cycles of cells alone; 11 patients received additional cycles of cells and were randomized between two schedules of IL-2 (125,000 IU/kg subcutaneously daily for 12 days versus 720,000 IU/kg intravenously every 8 h for 4 days).

The attenuation of T cell activation by cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) further limits the potency of tumor immunity. In murine systems, the administration of antibodies that block CTLA-4 function inhibits the growth of moderately immunogenic tumors and, in combination with cancer vaccines, increases the rejection of poorly immunogenic tumors, albeit with a loss of tolerance to normal differentiation antigens. To gain a preliminary assessment of the biologic activity of antagonizing CTLA-4 function in humans, we infused a CTLA-4 blocking antibody (MDX-CTLA4) into nine previously immunized advanced cancer patients. MDX-CTLA4 stimulated extensive tumor necrosis with lymphocyte and granulocyte infiltrates in three of three metastatic melanoma patients and the reduction or stabilization of CA-125 levels in two of two metastatic ovarian carcinoma patients previously vaccinated with irradiated, autologous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting tumor cells. MDX-CTLA4 did not elicit tumor necrosis in four of four metastatic melanoma patients previously immunized with defined melanosomal antigens.

It was found that melanoma cells from lymph node metastases were unable to induce autologous tumor-cytotoxic cells in 21 cases examined, in 15 of which MLTC also failed to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Patients' lymphocytes, however, were significantly stimulated by allogeneic irradiated lymphocytes and by interleukin 2. To investigate whether the lack of autologous stimulation was restricted to metastatic cells, the immune response of patients with only primary lesions of malignant melanoma was evaluated. It was found that primary melanoma cells were able to induce proliferation in 7 out of 9 (77%) patients, whereas positive cytotoxicity was obtained in 2 out of 4 patients tested. In order to see whether the presence of DR molecules was important for the stimulatory activity, melanoma cells were examined for the expression of DR antigens by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. Positive autologous MLTC was found in all of six DR+ primary melanomas, whereas the two DR-tumors were unable to stimulate autologous lymphocytes. An anti-DR but not an anti-DC monoclonal antibody was able to block the proliferation of lymphocytes induced by an autologous primary melanoma. Neither MLTC nor cell-mediated killing was obtained with either DR+ or DR-metastatic melanoma. In 60% of the cases tested, however, DR+ metastatic melanoma cells were able to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes of normal individuals. Increased expression of DR antigens was induced by in vitro treatment with human gamma-interferon in metastatic tumor cells; this caused an increase in the proliferation of allogeneic but not autologous lymphocytes. These findings indicate that primary but not metastatic DR+ melanoma cells are able to activate the proliferation and cytotoxicity of autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting a potential role of DR antigens in regulating tumor-host relationships in melanoma patients.",

The responsiveness of some patients with metastatic melanoma to treatment with the prototypic T-cell growth factor (TCGF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), indicates that T cells play a role in antitumor immunity. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), another TCGF that has been administered clinically to humans, was not associated with tumor response in our trials conducted at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute. Combination trials of IL-2 with IL-4 have shown no increase in responsiveness of melanoma or other tumors when compared to IL-2 alone. However, enhanced expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in vitro has been observed with combinations of low-dose IL-2 and IL-4. We have begun a study evaluating the trafficking of such expanded lymphocytes following their adoptive transfer in association with systemic administration of IL-2 and IL-4. We have established several TIL cultures from fresh tumor samples, maintained them in long-term culture, and marked them with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene using the LNL6 retroviral vector. Such TILs appear to demonstrate no notable alterations in phenotype or cytolytic activity when compared to their nontransduced counterparts. In addition to IL-2 and IL-4, there are a variety of other novel TCGFs that are now available for evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials.

Antibody inhibition studies showed that two of these TIL clones were restricted by an HLA-A2 molecule which was identified as A2.1 by gene sequencing. The third CTL clone was not restricted by HLA-A2, but by a B or C HLA antigen. HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones M17-1 and M17-2 lysed 5 and 12 out of 15 HLA-A2+ allogeneic melanomas, respectively. Since they did not lyse autologous Epstein-Barr virus B cells, HLA-A2.1-transfected P815 cells, 13 HLA-A2+ non-melanoma tumor cell lines and 10 HLA-A2- melanomas, these clones appeared specific for melanoma-restricted epitopes presented by the HLA-A2.1 molecule. We then tried to determine why a few HLA-A2+ melanomas were refractory to TIL lysis. By using a combination of flow cytometry analysis, partial cloning and sequencing of their HLA-A2 genes, we show that failure to lyse did not result from low expression or polymorphism of the HLA-A2 molecule, or from deficient expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3 by these melanomas. Taken together, our data confirm at the clonal level the existence of shared melanoma antigens recognized by TIL in the HLA-A2.1 context. They further show that individual peptides derived from these antigens are expressed by a large majority of HLA-A2+ melanomas. Identification of such peptides appears crucial for the future of vaccination therapies.",

Generating tumor-reactive lymphocyte cultures is technically difficult and resource intensive; these limitations have restricted the widespread application of ACT. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from melanoma contain tumor antigen-reactive cells. The \"standard\" method for producing TIL cultures for clinical administration requires extended in vitro expansion in interleukin-2, then identification of tumor-reactive cells by immunologic assays. We show here that limitations in reagents and methods during screening underrepresent the actual reactivity of TIL cultures. Furthermore, the extended culture times necessitated by the screening assays resulted in telomere shortening and reduced expression of CD27 and CD28 in the TIL cultures, properties that our prior studies showed are correlated with in vivo persistence and clinical response. We have thus developed an alternative \"young\" TIL method that demonstrated superior in vitro attributes compared with standard TIL. This approach uses the entire resected tumor to rapidly expand TIL for administration without in vitro testing for tumor recognition. Our observations suggest that younger TIL can have an undetermined but high level of antigen reactivity, and other advantageous attributes such as long telomeres and high levels of CD27 and CD28. We suggest that minimally cultured, unselected lymphocytes represent an alternative strategy for generating TIL cultures suitable for use in ACT that, if effective in vivo, may facilitate the widespread application of this approach to a broader population of patients with melanoma.",

Homing of the transferred T cells to all tumor sites in sufficient numbers is of great importance. Here, we seek to exploit endogenous chemotactic signals in order to manipulate and enhance the directional trafficking of transferred T cells toward melanoma. Chemokine profiling of 15 melanoma cultures shows that CXCL1 and CXCL8 are abundantly expressed and secreted from melanoma cultures. However, the complimentary analysis on 40 melanoma patient-derived tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) proves that the corresponding chemokine receptors are either not expressed (CXCR2) or expressed at low levels (CXCR1). Using the in vitro transwell system, we demonstrate that TIL cells preferentially migrate toward melanoma and that endogenously expressing CXCR1 TIL cells are significantly enriched among the migrating lymphocytes. The role of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8 is demonstrated by partial abrogation of this enrichment with anti-CXCL1 and anti-CXCL8 neutralizing antibodies. The role of the chemokine receptor CXCR1 is validated by the enhanced migration of CXCR1-engineered TIL cells toward melanoma or recombinant CXCL8. Cytotoxicity and IFNγ secretion activity are unaltered by CXCR1 expression profile. Taken together, these results mark CXCR1 as a candidate for genetic manipulations to enhance trafficking of adoptively transferred T cells.

Initial studies with a high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy have proved effective in patients with melanoma tumor, although a variety of systemic toxicities were observed. A low-dose IL-2 continuous infusion has shown a similar response in patients with melanoma tumor, but produced lesser toxicity. The low-dose IL-2 therapy has been studied with an adoptive transfer combined with either autologous lymphokine activated killer cells or autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). IL-2 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as flavone acetic acid, dacarbazine, and cyclophosphamide have also been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma. Results have shown a moderate response in patients with metastatic melanoma. TIL therapy, however, has been shown to result in higher objective regression due to potent tumor-specific killing and tumor-specific targeting characters of the TIL. The tumor targeting nature of the TIL creates the possibility of using TIL as a vehicle to deliver gene product specifically to tumor tissue. Safety and toxicity of gene-transduced TIL were addressed by the use of neomycin-resistant, gene-transduced TIL in patients with metastatic melanoma.

Forty-two chemokine, cytokine, angiogenic, and growth factors were measured in the sera of 20 BRAF inhibitor-treated and four combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor-treated metastatic melanoma patients using a multiplex chemokine assay. The changes were correlated with Ki-67 and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor biopsies taken at the same time points, as well as clinical outcome, including response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Serum levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α were significantly increased, whereas CXCL8 significantly decreased from pretreatment (PRE) to early during treatment (EDT) serum samples. The decrease in serum CXCL8 levels from PRE to EDT significantly correlated with decreases in markers of melanoma proliferation (Ki-67) and increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T cells in corresponding tumor biopsies. In addition, a greater fold reduction in CXCL8 serum levels from PRE to EDT serum samples was associated with decreased overall survival. These results suggest that BRAF inhibition causes decreased CXCL8 secretion from melanoma cells and induce an immune response against the tumor associated with increased IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if CXCL8 is predictive of response and to confirm the functions of these chemokine and cytokine in BRAF-mutant melanoma under BRAF inhibition. ",

However, little information exists on the nature of MHC class II-restricted human tumor Ag. In an attempt to develop in vitro systems to characterize such Ag, we examined the ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells to present melanoma-associated Ag to melanoma-specific CD4+ cells. CD4+ T cells cultured from lymphocytes infiltrating a s.c. melanoma metastasis secreted TNF-alpha and GM-CSF specifically in response to autologous cultured melanoma cells expressing MHC class II molecules. These CD4+ cells also recognized MHC class II-compatible EBV-B cells pulsed with extracts of autologous melanoma cells, but failed to recognize EBV-B cells pulsed with autologous non-transformed cells or a variety of allogeneic tumors or normal cells. B cells pre-fixed with paraformaldehyde were incapable of Ag presentation, suggesting that intracellular processing events were occurring. Antibody-blocking studies defined HLA-DR as the dominant if not exclusive restriction locus in this T-B interaction, and HLA-DR genotyping revealed DRBI*0404 to be the probable restriction element. In a second patient, a CD4+ T-cell clone cultured from a melanoma lesion recognized autologous tumor Ag presented by autologous EBV-B; no corss-reactivity was observed with the other tumor system investigated, nor with autologous CD4+ T cells specific for tetanus toxoid. These findings demonstrate that tumor Ag can be processed and presented by EBV-transformed B cells to MHC class II-restricted tumor-specific CD4+ T cells.

There has been much less progress in identifying the tumor antigens on murine tumors that are recognized by T cells, and this has restricted the development of preclinical animal models for immunotherapy. The authors previously described a method for generating tumor-reactive T cells from murine tumors (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) that are CD8+ T cells recognizing autologous tumor and that can inhibit established tumor on adoptive transfer. Here the authors show that the envelope protein of an endogenous murine retrovirus of the AKV family, found in the germline of the C57BL/6 mouse, is recognized by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from two histologically different tumors syngeneic to that mouse strain. Furthermore, the authors identify the specific 9-amino acid peptide from the p15E transmembrane component of this envelope protein that is recognized in the context of major histocompatibility complex Kb, show that it is naturally presented and recognized on several other H-2b tumors, and that cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for this epitope are therapeutic for these antigen-expressing tumors on adoptive transfer.",

Why can early melanoma lesions actually develop in the face of rapid innate responses, and why is neutrophil- and macrophage-attracting chemokine secretion observed in melanoma? A surprisingly similar choice of chemokine receptors and chemokines are present in both innate immune cells and melanoma. Here we focus on analogies and differences between the two. Melanoma cell clusters show active chemokine signalling, with mostly tumor growth-enhancing and leukocyte-attracting effects. However, infiltrating leukocytes have only weak tumoricidal effects. Therefore, the observed leukocyte infiltration in melanoma might be at least in part an epiphenomenon of neoplastic self-stimulation rather than a full-fledged innate anti-tumor immune response.",

This therapeutic approach is aimed at targeting T-cell costimulation to chemotherapy-resistant tumors which are refractory and been considered as untreatable cancers. These tumors are usually defined by an enrichment of cancer stem cells and characterized by the higher expression of chemotherapy-resistant proteins. In this work we develop the first aptamer that targets chemotherapy-resistant tumors expressing MRP1 through a novel combinatorial peptide-cell SELEX. With the use of the MRP1 aptamer we engineer a MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer that is able to bind MRP1-expressing tumors and deliver the CD28 costimulatory signal to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The bi-specific aptamer is able to enhance costimulation in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Melanoma-bearing mice systemically treated with MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer show reduced growth, thus proving an improved mice survival.Besides, we have designed a technically feasible and translational whole-cell vaccine (Aptvax). Disaggregated cells from tumors can be directly decorated with costimulatory ligand aptamers to generate the vaccine Aptvax.

Among these, some malignant cancers such as oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor are often recognized as clinical problems because, despite their high frequencies, current treatments for these cancers may not always achieve satisfying outcomes. The absence of effective systemic therapies against these cancers leads researchers to investigate novel therapeutic modalities, including immunotherapy. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a costimulatory receptor with immunosuppressive function. When it binds its ligands, PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, PD-1 on T cells negatively regulates activating signals from the T cell receptor, resulting in the inhibition of the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Aberrant PD-L1 expression has been reported in many human cancers and is considered an immune escape mechanism for cancers. In clinical trials, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced tumor regression for several malignancies, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In this study, to assess the potential of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for canine cancer immunotherapy, immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression in various malignant cancers of dogs was performed. Here, we show that dog oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, mammary adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma expressed PD-L1, whereas some other types of cancer did not. In addition, PD-1 was highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from oral melanoma, showing that lymphocytes in this cancer type might have been functionally exhausted. These results strongly encourage the clinical application of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against these cancers in dogs. ",

Successful engraftment of BNX mice with human hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated recently. We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification.",

A mouse model of autochthonous melanoma recapitulates some aspects of inflammatory melanoma development in patients. These include a systemic Th2-/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation, recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and acquisition by tumor-infiltrating TCs of an 'exhausted' phenotype characterized by expression of multiple inhibitory receptors including programmed death-1, also expressed on patients' melanoma-infiltrating TCs. Rather than using extracellular blocking reagents to inhibitory surface molecules on TCs, we sought to dampen negative signaling exerted on them. Adoptively transferred TCs presenting increased cytokine receptor signaling due to expression of an active Stat5 transcription factor were efficient at inducing melanoma regression in the preclinical melanoma model. These transferred TCs thrived and retained expression of effector molecules in the melanoma microenvironment, defining a protocol endowing TCs with the ability to resist melanoma-induced immunosuppression.",

However, it still remains to be demonstrated whether the capacity of melanoma cells to express CD95L is acquired during the progression. We addressed this question with a case of acral lentiginous melanoma by employing immunostaining using an antibody directed against CD95L as well as by in situ TUNEL staining. H&E-staining of tumor specimens revealed that there were two different growth patterns. The central part of the tumor showed a deeper invasion into the dermis (Breslow thickness >4 -mm). The horizontally growing edge of the tumor proliferated more superficially (Breslow thickness<3-mm). Relatively fewer lymphocytes were observed around the melanoma nests in central areas, which expressed detectable amounts of CD95L. In contrast, more lymphocytes were observed among the melanoma cells in the peripheral lesion, where CD95L was not detected. To evaluate the relevance of the CD95L expression, in situ TUNEL staining was performed. This indicated a significant correlation of lymphocyte apoptosis with CD95L expression on melanoma cells. Together the data suggest that expression of CD95L is turned on depending on the level of melanoma, and that it may tribute to creating immune privileged circumstances by initiating apoptosis of tumor filrating lymphocytes.",

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma specific CTLs in the effector phase remains still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control anti-melanoma CTL responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific CTLs via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced, and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that anti-melanoma CTL responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of anti-melanoma immune responses.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 12 October 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.404.",

We therefore sought to develop standardized procedures for the selection of well-expressed, high-affinity, and safe human TCRs.

From a panel of human, melanoma-reactive TCRs we subsequently selected the TCR with the highest affinity. Furthermore, a generally applicable assay was used to assess the lack of alloreactivity of this TCR against a large series of common human leukocyte antigen alleles.

In the classic B16 mouse melanoma model, one mechanism underlying this phenomenon is a specific up-regulation and subsequent homophilic interaction mediated by the cell surface glycoprotein MUC18 (also known as melanoma cell adhesion molecule). Presence of B-1 lymphocytes in a panel of tumor samples from melanoma patients directly correlates with MUC18 expression in melanoma cells, indicating that the same protein interaction exists in humans. These results suggest a new but as yet unrecognized functional role for host B-1 lymphocytes in tumor metastasis and establish a biochemical basis for such observations. Our findings support the counterintuitive central hypothesis in which a primitive layer of the immune system actually contributes to tumor progression and metastasis in a mouse model and in melanoma patients.

The results showed a significant stimulation of lymphocytes from healthy donors after incubation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), while no stimulation was observed after incubation with LAMA. On the other hand, lymphocytes from melanoma patients showed a significant stimulation with LAMA, while generally showing minor or no stimulation with PHA. Melanoma specificity of LAMA was demonstrated by no response in lymphocytes from patients of lung, colon, or breast cancer. The purified fraction is therefore considered to be a shared tissue-specific antigen which may be useful in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy of melanoma.",

In this study, we investigate the implication of T(reg) in modulating infiltrating T lymphocytes in human metastatic melanoma. We found that CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells are overrepresented in metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) with a 2-fold increased frequency compared with both tumor-free LNs and autologous PBMCs. These cells express the Foxp3 transcription factor, display an activated phenotype, and display a polyclonal TCR Vbeta chain repertoire. They inhibit in vitro the proliferation and cytokine production of infiltrating CD4(+)CD25(-) and CD8(+) T cells (IL-2, IFN-gamma) through a cell-contact-dependent mechanism, thus behaving as T(reg). In some cases, the presence of T(reg) type 1/Th3-like lymphocytes could also be demonstrated. Thus, T(reg) are a major component of the immunosuppressive microenvironment of metastatic melanoma LNs. This could explain the poor clinical response of cancer patients under immunotherapeutic protocols, and provides a new basis for future immunotherapeutic strategies counteracting in vivo T(reg) to reinforce local antitumor immune responses.",

In contrast, in 74 American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IV melanoma patients, we found that development of lymph node metastases is a key event triggering CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immunity to self-epitopes encoded by melanocyte differentiation antigens. This was shown by the increased peripheral precursor frequency to Melan-A/Mart-1, gp100, and tyrosinase epitopes in stage III and IV compared with stage I and II patients, and by accumulation of functional memory T cells directed to Melan-A/Mart-1(26-35) in tumor-invaded lymph nodes. However, in tumor-invaded lymph nodes of most patients, CD8(+) T cells directed to melanocyte differentiation antigens or to tumor-restricted antigens (MAGE-3 and NY-ESO-1 epitopes), showed a CCR7(+) CD45RA(+) CD27(+) CD28(+) perforin(-) \"precursor\" phenotype. Only in 7 of 23 cases antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in invaded lymph nodes showed a predominant CCR7(-) CD45RA(-) CD27(+) CD28(-) perforin(+) \"preterminally differentiated\" phenotype. In the latter subset of patients, by immunohistochemistry in lymph node lesions, we found that CD8(+) T lymphocytes intermingling with the neoplastic tissue expressed a CCR7(-) CD45RO(+)/RA(-) phenotype, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes did not infiltrate the tumor. Furthermore, perforin and granzyme B were expressed on a higher fraction of the CD8(+) cells surrounding the invading tumor compared with the lymphocytes infiltrating the neoplastic tissue. In addition, no evidence for tumor regression was found in such metastatic lesions, as documented by absence of neoplastic cell necrosis or apoptosis. These data indicate that neoplastic cells in the lymph nodes and/or increased tumor burden in metastatic disease activate CD8(+) T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity to self-epitopes. However, the paucity of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells at tumor site suggests that immunotherapy strategies may require not only the boosting of tumor immunity, but also effective means to promote CD8(+) T-cell differentiation in the neoplastic tissue.",

In our opinion, this case, presenting a very atypical evolution may contribute to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying metastasis and the identification of reliable progression parameters as prognostic markers in primary uveal melanoma. Several histological characteristics and demographic factors have been associated with disease evolution: presence of retinal neovessels and neovascular glaucoma, rapid increasing tumor thickness, scleral invasion, epithelioid cell types with large nucleoli, lymphocytic infiltration, and vascular pattern with networks of loops. Sclera invasion is uncommon in choroid tumors, but it is associated with an unfavorable bad prognosis, giving a great propensity to metastasize and to affect the liver.

Tandem mass spectrometry was used to characterize and sequence one of these three naturally processed melanoma peptides. One of the potential forms of the deduced peptide sequence (XXTVXXGVX, X = I or L) matches positions 32-40 of the recently identified melanoma gene MART-1/Melan-A. This peptide (p939; ILTVILGVL) binds to HLA-A2 with an intermediate-to-low affinity and is capable of sensitizing the HLA-A2+ T2 cell line to lysis by CTL lines and clones derived from five different melanoma patients. A relative high frequency of anti-p939-specific effector cells appear to be present in situ in HLA-A2+ melanoma patients, since p939 is also recognized by freshly isolated tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. p939 represents a good candidate for the development of peptide-based immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with melanoma.",

Here, we analyzed the role of IRF-8 in the cross talk between melanoma cells and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. B16-F10 melanoma cells transplanted into IRF-8-deficient (IRF-8(-/-)) mice grow more rapidly, leading to higher numbers of lung metastasis, with respect to control animals. These events correlated with reduced dendritic cell and T cell infiltration, accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and a chemokine/chemokine receptor expression profile within the tumor microenvironment supporting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Noticeably, primary tumors developing in IRF-8(-/-) mice displayed a clear-cut inhibition of IRF-8 expression in melanoma cells. Injection of the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine into melanoma-bearing IRF-8(-/-) animals induced intratumoral IRF-8 expression and resulted in the re-establishment of a chemokine/ chemokine receptor pattern favoring leukocyte infiltration and melanoma growth arrest. Importantly, intrinsic IRF-8 expression was progressively down-modulated during melanoma growth in mice and in human metastatic melanoma cells with respect to primary tumors. Lastly, IRF-8 expression in melanoma cells was directly modulated by soluble factors, among which interleukin-27 (IL-27), released by immune cells from tumor-bearing mice.

However, most tumors lack significant immune infiltration prior to therapy. Selected chemokines promote T-cell migration into tumors; thus, agents that induce these chemokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may improve responses to systemic immune therapy. CXCL10 has been implicated as a critical chemokine supporting T-cell infiltration into the TME. Here, we show that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can induce chemokine production directly from melanoma cells when combined with IFNγ treatment. We find that TLR2 and TLR6 are widely expressed on human melanoma cells, and that TLR2/6 agonists (MALP-2 or FSL-1) synergize with interferon-gamma (IFNγ) to induce production of CXCL10 from melanoma cells. Furthermore, melanoma cells and immune cells from surgical specimens also respond to TLR2/6 agonists and IFNγ by upregulating CXCL10 production, compared to treatment with either agent alone. Collectively, these data identify a novel mechanism for inducing CXCL10 production directly from melanoma cells, with TLR2/6 agonists +IFNγ and raise the possibility that intratumoral administration of these agents may improve immune signatures in melanoma and have value in combination with other immune therapies, by supporting T-cell migration into melanoma metastases.

In melanocytic tumours different pools of DCs were recognised in the epidermis and in the dermis, particularly in intimate relation with lymphocyte clusters inside the melanocytic proliferation, and more often at the edges of tumours. The number of Langerin-positive DCs showed an inverse correlation with tumour depth (correlation coefficient r= -0.59, P=0.0001) and was significantly lower in thick melanomas compared to thin and intermediate ones (P<0.0005). The density of CD83(+) DCs was significantly lower in thick melanomas compared to thin and intermediate ones (P<0.009). A significant correlation was found between the density of the two DCs subsets (r=0.57, p<0.0001). The number of CD3(+) lymphocytes was inversely correlated to the depth of infiltration (r=-0.596, P<0.0001): melanoma cases with II-III Clark level showed a higher T lymphocyte mean density compared to cases with IV-V Clark level (P<0.0001). T lymphocyte density was significantly lower in thick melanomas compared to thin and intermediate melanomas (P<0.0005). In conclusion, our study indicates a progressive loss of DCs and T lymphocytes in the neoplastic progression of melanomas; further identification of the molecular pathways involved in the functional impairment of these immunitary cells may lead to new immunotherapeutic approaches for melanoma patients that would improve the clinical outcome of the patients.",

After 4 hours of incubation, the percentage of tumor cells with attached leukocytes remained the same, but 2 to 9 per cent of the melanoma cells showed interiorized lymphocytes when kept in suspension, 10 to 25 per cent when maintained in culture dishes. Erythrocytes or fixed lymphocytes were not taken up by the melanoma cells nor were living lymphocytes seen in fibroblasts or endothelial cells which served as controls for the neoplastic cell lines. Thus, melanoma cells did not prove to be randomly phagocytic, and the interiorization displayed by lymphocytes--a process called emperipolesis--appears to be selective. It is postulated that emperipolesis may enhance the tumoricidal effect exerted by cytotoxic lymphocytes on melanoma cells.",

Among the various immunotherapies currently tested, passive immunotherapy (i.e injection of T lymphocytes generated and selected ex-vivo from blood or from the tumor), seems to be particularly promising. Indeed, three recent studies evidence the efficacy of such therapy in melanoma treatment. For the first time, a precise immunological follow-up was carried out, thus showing the correlation between the therapeutic benefit and the injection of tumor antigen specific T lymphocytes, and the survival and the preferential migration of these lymphocytes to the tumor sites. Although all the questions about optimal methods for this mode of therapy are not solved, these recent results constitute a major breakthrough in the field of the tumor immunotherapy.",

These CTLs recognize a common tumor-associated antigen in the presence of HLA class I determinants, suggesting that allogeneic melanomas which express the restricting HLA-A region antigen could substitute for the autologous tumor in the generation of CTLs. This was investigated in the HLA-A2 system. Four T-cell lines were established by stimulation of lymphocytes with either autologous tumor or an HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanoma. Allogeneic stimulated CTLs specifically lysed the autologous tumor and demonstrated an identical pattern of HLA-A2 restriction, when compared to the autologous stimulated CTLs. Lysis by the allogeneic stimulated CTLs was blocked by a monoclonal antibody to HLA class I antigens; lysis was also inhibited by both autologous tumor or HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas when evaluated in cold target competition studies. The allogeneic stimulated CTLs proliferated in response to both autologous tumor and HLA-A2 melanomas, but not in response to HLA-A2 nonmelanomas. By phenotypic analysis these CTLs were CD3+ and predominantly CD8+ cells. We conclude that autologous tumor-specific CTLs can be generated using HLA-A region-matched allogeneic melanomas for stimulation. Since established, HLA-typed melanoma tumor lines can be used in the absence of autologous tumor; this procedure can be applied clinically to a broad patient population and may prove useful in the adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma.",

We tested the hypothesis that improved detection and characterization of neural infiltration into peritumoral or intratumoral location and perineural or intraneural involvement could have a prognostic relevance. We studied 128 primary melanoma cases prospectively accrued and followed at New York University using immunohistochemical detection with antihuman neurofilament protein and routine histology with hematoxylin and eosin. Neural infiltration, defined as the presence of tumor cells involving or immediately surrounding nerve foci, was identified and characterized using both detection methods. Neural infiltration rate of detection was enhanced by immunohistochemistry for neurofilament in matched-pair design (47% by immunohistochemistry versus 25% by routine histology). Immunohistochemical detection of neural infiltration was significantly associated with ulceration (P = .021), desmoplastic and acral lentiginous histologic subtype (P = .008), and head/neck/hands/feet tumor location (P = .037). Routinely detected neural infiltration was significantly associated with local recurrence (P = .010). Immunohistochemistry detected more intratumoral neural infiltration cases compared with routine histology (30% versus 3%, respectively). Peritumoral and intratumoral nerve location had no impact on clinical outcomes. Using a multivariate model controlling for stage, neither routinely detected neural infiltration nor enhanced immunohistochemical characterization of neural infiltration was significantly associated with disease-free or overall survival. Our data demonstrate that routinely detected neural infiltration is associated with local recurrence in all histologic subtypes but that improved detection and characterization of neural infiltration with immunohistochemistry in primary melanoma does not add to prognostic relevance.

Inhibition occurred during the first 24 hours of co-culture and persisted as long as the tumor was present. After being washed free of inhibitory tumor cells, the TIL again were able to grow in the presence of IL-2, indicating that the inhibition was not caused by irreversible toxicity mediated by the tumor. Addition of excess IL-2 did not reverse the inhibitory effect, but addition of indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin synthesis, partially blocked the inhibition.

The autologous 1913 melanoma cell line expressed a mutated HLA-A11 class I gene product that was recognized by the bulk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as a dominant T cell clone derived from this line. A second dominant T cell clone, T1D1, did not recognize the mutated HLA-A11 product, but recognized an allogeneic melanoma cell line that shared expression of HLA-A11 with the parental tumor cell line. Screening of an autologous melanoma cDNA library with clone T1D1 T cells in a cell line expressing the mutated HLA-A11 gene product resulted in the isolation of a p14ARF transcript containing a 2-bp deletion in exon 2. The T cell epitope recognized by T1D1, which was encoded within the frameshifted region of the deleted p14ARF transcript, was also generated from frameshifted p14ARF or p16INK4a transcripts that were isolated from two additional melanoma cell lines. The results of monitoring studies indicated that T cell clones reactive with the mutated HLA-A11 gene product and the mutated p14ARF product were highly represented in the peripheral blood of patient 1913 1 wk following adoptive transfer, indicating that they may have played a role in the nearly complete tumor regression that was observed following this treatment.",

One such lymphocyte population is the IL-2 expanded population of T cells infiltrating tumors. These tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can cause tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer and in murine tumor models when given in adoptive transfer. In patients with melanoma, these TIL have been shown to migrate to sites of tumor and this may be a critical factor in their antitumor activity. In this study, a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber and a 5 microns pore nitrocellulose filter membrane system was utilized to study the motility of murine TIL. A chemotactic response was observed to supernatants from freshly explanted, autologous, and nonautologous tumor cultured for 24 h. Serially passaged autologous and nonautologous tumors also produced supernatants with chemotactic activity. Supernatants from single cell suspensions of normal tissues prepared and cultured identically did not elicit chemotaxis. Chemotactic activity for TIL was not removed by dialysis (2000 MW exclusion limit), its activity was undiminished by heat treatment at 60 degrees C for up to 60 min, and it was trypsin sensitive. Tumor supernatants were also chemotactic for two IL-2-dependent specifically alloreactive CTL lines (CTL-TIM and OE-4), but not two helper T cell lines (D-10 and D-1.5) or normal resting lymphocytes. This is the first demonstration of a chemotactic effect on IL-2-dependent, activated T cells.

This suboptimal activation is classically explained by an inability of tumor cells to provide costimulatory signals. Here we analyzed the responses to synthetic peptides of HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL clones specific for melanoma antigens MART-1 and NA17-A. We showed that peptide concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 10 nM efficiently sensitized the peptide transporter-deficient T2 cells to lysis. T2 cells pulsed with melanoma peptides also induced TIL proliferation and detectable secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, but only for peptide concentrations 10- to 10,000-fold higher than those required for lysis. Hence this suggests that partial triggering of TIL clones by melanoma cells could be due to expression of appropriate MHC-peptide complexes at subthreshold levels. In support of this, we showed that melanoma cells, unable to trigger IL-2 secretion, developed this ability when incubated with the appropriate peptide. These results indicate that the level of antigens expressed on melanoma tumors critically affects TIL activation status and thus, the efficiency of specific immune reactions mediated by these cells.",

The pattern of positivity in breast carcinomas was associated with malignant cells, rather than with the stroma or histiocytes infiltrating the lesions. Nonspecific cross-reactivity of 225.28S with breast carcinomas was excluded using a similar murine antithyreoglobulin MoAb, which gave negative staining in all biopsies.

Therapeutic blockade of immune-inhibitory receptors in patients with preexisting lymphocytic infiltrates prolongs survival, but new complementary strategies are needed to activate cellular antitumor immunity in immune cell-poor melanomas. Here, we show that primary melanomas in Hgf-Cdk4(R24C) mice, which imitate human immune cell-poor melanomas with a poor outcome, escape IFN-induced immune surveillance and editing. Peritumoral injections of immunostimulatory RNA initiated a cytotoxic inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment and significantly impaired tumor growth. This critically required the coordinated induction of type I IFN responses by dendritic, myeloid, natural killer, and T cells. Importantly, antibody-mediated blockade of the IFN-induced immune-inhibitory interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 receptors further prolonged the survival. These results highlight important interconnections between type I IFNs and immune-inhibitory receptors in melanoma pathogenesis, which serve as targets for combination immunotherapies.;Using a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model, we demonstrate that targeted activation of the type I IFN system with immunostimulatory RNA in combination with blockade of immune-inhibitory receptors is a rational strategy to expose immune cell-poor tumors to cellular immune surveillance.",

Natural killer (NK) cells, which were detected by anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), increased in the peritoneal exudate cells after an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with syngeneic B16 melanoma cells. Furthermore, a concurrent i.p. injection with OK432 efficiently sustained the locally infiltrating NK cells. The OK432 treatment also sustained the augmented NK and lymphokine-activated killer activities in the peritoneal exudate cells. This treatment also increased the ability of the locally infiltrating NK cells to produce interferon gamma in response to the tumor cells. In addition, the concurrent i.p. injection with OK432 in combination with the tumor cells enhanced the capacity of the spleen cells to turn into anti-(B16 melanoma) cytotoxic T lymphocytes after in vitro restimulation. This augmenting effect of OK432 was dependent on NK cells. Moreover, the concurrent injection with OK432 at the time of anti-tumor vaccination significantly enhanced the protective immunity against B16 melanoma at the rechallenge.

Monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte subpopulations were used to identify and quantitate lymphoid infiltrates in 15 primary melanomas and 8 cutaneous metastases. These were correlated with histological features identified in routine sections. There was a wide variation in the numbers of mononuclear cells associated with both primary and metastatic melanoma. T cells and to a lesser extent macrophages accounted for the majority of the cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells for only 2% of the infiltrates. The Leu 3a (helper) T cell subpopulation predominated in primary tumours, OKT8 positive (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells in metastases. Infiltrates in which OKT8 cells predominated were associated with ulceration, a high mitotic rate and thick primary tumours. The converse applied to Leu 3a infiltrates. Infiltrates with a high proportion of Leu 3a positive cells tended to be associated with Thy-1 positive, DR antigen negative tumours. Thy-1 antigens were predominantly expressed on primary tumours and rarely on metastases whereas the converse applied to expression of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) on melanoma cells. These findings suggest that certain melanoma antigens may be related to the nature of the lymphoid infiltrate associated with melanoma and possibly with the behaviour of the tumour in the host. They further suggest that identification of cell surface structures and lymphoid infiltrates by these techniques may be a valuable extension of routine histopathological assessment of prognosis in melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma (MM) is a highly aggressive tumour which is particularly prone to specific local immune responses. To determine the microanatomical location and the species of chemokines possibly involved in the intricate control of cell migration and positioning of immune effector cells in primary and metastatic MM lesions, the expression of those chemokines with lymphocyte and/or macrophage chemoattractant properties was analysed by in situ hybridization. GROalpha (growth-related oncogene) and IL-8 (interleukin 8) were expressed at low levels by single melanoma cells, adjacent keratinocytes, and infiltrating leukocytes. In contrast, the lymphocyte-specific chemokine Mig (monokine induced by interferon-gamma) was strongly expressed by mononuclear cells (mainly macrophages) infiltrating the tumour margin in primary MM lesions, whereas expression was less intense in MM metastasis. IP-10 (interferon-gamma inducible protein 10) was expressed in the same loci at lower intensity. Marked infiltration of T cells was exclusively detected in those areas which exhibited strong Mig expression, whereas areas in the vicinity of tumour cells devoid of Mig expression were not infiltrated. In contrast to Mig, expression of MCP-1 (macrophage chemotactic protein-1) was weaker and mainly detected in lesional basal keratinocytes, occasionally at sites of macrophage infiltration, as well as in single melanoma cells. MIP-1alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha) showed similar, albeit weaker expression compared with MCP-1. Other chemokines relevant for the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes, such as RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted) and MIP-1beta, were barely detectable. In summary, the chemokine expression profiles support the notion that particularly in heavily infiltrated primary MM lesions, Mig and to a lesser extent IP-10 are important mediators of an IFN-gamma-dependent pathway. Due to their lymphoattractant properties and the known inhibitory effects on the tumour vasculature, both chemokines may be critical for the control of local melanoma tumour growth.",

Analysis of the variability of T cell receptors (TCR) in the VIL of one patient revealed that the cytotoxic T lymphocytes consisted of a predominant population of TCRBV21S3+ T cells. Enrichment of this subpopulation to more than 99% by specific anti-TCRBV21S3 monoclonal antibody linked immunomagnetic beads and sequencing of the TCR-beta chain disclosed exactly the same V-D-J junctional sequence in all eight TCRBV21 transcripts from these VIL. The identical sequence was also detected in all eight TCRBV21 transcripts from the patient's tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, indicating that the same CTL clone had infiltrated the tumor, circulated in the peripheral blood, and was amplified at the vaccination site. The TCRBV21S3+ T cells were also found to display an MHC class I restricted cytotoxic activity specifically directed against the autologous tumor cells. At the beginning of treatment these cells were undetectable at the vaccination site and delayed-type hypersensitivity testing was negative, contrasting with the positive results after therapy.

The T-cell-stimulatory capacity was found to be strong for Ma-Mel-48a, lower for Ma-Mel-48b, and completely abrogated for Ma-Mel-48c cells. The latter proved to be HLA class I-negative due to an inactivating mutation in one allele of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene and concomitant loss of the other allele by a deletion on chromosome 15q. The same deletion was already present in Ma-Mel-48a and Ma-Mel-48b cells, pointing to an early acquired genetic event predisposing to development of β2m deficiency. Notably, the same chronology of genetic alterations was also observed in a second β2m-deficient melanoma model.;Our study reveals a progressive loss in melanoma immunogenicity during the course of metastatic disease.

In addition, we systematically characterized the responses of a series of TIL products to relevant autologous short term-cultured melanoma cell lines from 12 patients.

IFN-γ selectively enhanced responses to tumor-associated antigens other than melanoma differentiation antigens. In addition, IFN-γ treatment was invariably associated with restored/increased cancer immunogenicity as demonstrated by upregulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules.

This specific killing can be abrogated by monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD8, T-cell receptors (TCRs) and against class I human leucocyte antigens (HLAs). This indicates that these CTLs can recognize the melanoma cells through the TCRs, in an HLA class I-restricted manner. Therefore, these cells and their products both are critical players in T cell-induced melanoma regression and are powerful predictors of survival. This review seeks to examine the characteristics, activation and role of TILs and their associated molecules in melanomas.",

Achieving complete remissions by peptide therapy is frequently hampered by metastases evading immune recognition. The tumor microenvironment seems to favor reduced expression of target antigens by melanoma cells. Among candidate factors, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (10(2) to 10(3) U/ml) suppressed expression of antigens MART-1, TRP-1, and gp100 by M14 melanoma cells as shown by immunohistology and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, reducing MART-1 expression by >65%. Northern blot analysis revealed that reduced expression was regulated at the transcriptional level, demonstrating a 79% reduction in MART-1 transcript abundance after 32 hours of IFN-gamma treatment. To evaluate consequences of IFN-gamma exposure for immune recognition, MART-1-responsive T cells were reacted with pretreated HLA-matched melanoma cells. Cytotoxicity was reduced up to 78% by IFN-gamma pretreatment, and was restored by addition of MART-1 peptide AAGIGILTV for 2 hours. Examination of melanoma lesions by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed up to 188-fold more abundant IFN-gamma transcripts when compared to control skin. Laser capture microdissection and immunohistology localized most IFN-gamma-producing T cells to the tumor stroma. Reduced MART-1 expression was frequently observed in adjacent tumor cells. Consequently, IFN-gamma may enhance inflammatory responses yet hamper effective recognition of melanoma cells.",

These culture conditions did not select for a particular T cell subset. Using these culture conditions, we report here the generation of 66 CD4+ and 36 CD8+ TIL clones from five patients with melanoma. Eighty-five percent of the CD4+ TIL clones were not cytolytic (< 30% lysis, E:T 20:1) as determined by antibody-redirected lysis (ARL), whereas all CD8+ clones showed strong ARL activity (> 30% lysis). Clones were further tested for production of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma after activation for 48 hr by solid-phase anti-CD3. CD8+ clones produced significant amounts of IFN-gamma, little IL-2, and no IL-4. CD4+ clones were classified as Th0, Th1, or Th2, analogous to the classification of T helper cells in the mouse. Sixty-six percent existed as Th0, producing IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. Only 15% existed as Th1, producing IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and 19% as Th2, producing IL-4 but no IL-2 or IFN-gamma. In all cases, unstimulated clones or clones stimulated with the allogeneic B cell line did not produce detectable amounts of cytokines. Solid-phase anti-CD3 activation was compared to activation with autologous melanoma cells. Five of nine CD8+ clones produced low amounts of IL-2 (< 200 pg/ml/10(6) cells) in response to autologous tumor, but none of the CD8 clones produced IFN-gamma or IL-4. Also, 5/7 Th0 clones from one patient produced similar amounts of IL-2 after stimulation with anti-CD3 or autologous tumor. The other two clones produced only 10% or less of the amount produced in response to anti-CD3. No IL-4 or IFN-gamma could be detected in response to autologous tumor. In contrast, none of the 12 T helper clones from two other patients produced any cytokines after stimulation with autologous tumor cells.

Although this therapy yields high response rates resulting in prolonged survival, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DTIC and DNCB resulted in a specific immune response against the tumor. Subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors and lung metastases were induced in C57BL/6 mice by injecting syngeneic B16-melanoma cells s.c. or into the lateral tail vein, respectively. Mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of DTIC followed by epifocal application of DNCB. This therapeutic approach significantly reduced the growth of s.c. tumors as well as lung metastases. Our data showed that the effector mechanisms involved are dependent on T cells. No therapeutic effect was observed in immunodeficient RAG-1(-/-) mice, or when the contact sensitizer DNCB was replaced by skin irritants (croton oil or tributyltin). Splenic lymphocytes obtained from treated mice displayed a three-fold higher specific cytolytic activity against B16 cells than in tumor-bearing controls. Both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were able to lyse B16 cells. No changes were observed in natural killer (NK) cell activity. Likewise, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of treated mice showed higher cytolytic activity than that of controls. Analysis of cytokine expression in s.c. tumors revealed increased mRNA levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in treated tumors. Together, these findings demonstrate the ability of DTIC/DNCB treatment to induce an effective T cell-dependent host immune response against a syngeneic tumor.",

Differences in the distribution of selected parameters between the two groups were investigated by Fisher's exact test; for each parameter sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results showed that all parameters, except poor circumscription, seemed to be significantly associated with melanoma (P<0.05). Cytological atypia, dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, asymmetry, dimension >6 mm and absence of maturation showed a high sensitivity (>90%); absence of maturation, mitoses, necrosis, asymmetrical melanin, suprabasal melanocytes and melanin in deep cells showed a high specificity (>90%); irregular-confluent nests and single melanocytes predominating were poorly sensitive and poorly specific. In melanomas < or =2 mm, two additional parameters were sensitive (> or =90%): suprabasal melanocytes and single melanocytes predominating. We conclude that not all parameters showed to have the same diagnostic value.

The efficacy of TCR gene therapy targeting MAGE family antigens, however, has not yet been evaluated in vivo. Here, we demonstrate the in vivo antitumor activity in immunodeficient non-obese diabetic/SCID/γc(null) (NOG) mice of human lymphocytes genetically engineered to express TCR specific for the MAGE-A4 antigen. Polyclonal T cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were transduced with the αβ TCR genes specific for MAGE-A4, then adoptively transferred into NOG mice inoculated with MAGE-A4 expressing human tumor cell lines. The transferred T cells maintained their effector function in vivo, infiltrated into tumors, and inhibited tumor growth in an antigen-specific manner. The combination of adoptive cell therapy with antigen peptide vaccination enhanced antitumor activity, with improved multifunctionality of the transferred cells. These data suggest that TCR gene therapy with MAGE-A4-specific TCR is a promising strategy to treat patients with MAGE-A4-expressing tumors; in addition, the acquisition of multifunctionality in vivo is an important factor to predict the quality of the T-cell response during adoptive therapy with human lymphocytes.",

Recently, we have demonstrated that the RNA editing protein, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) is down-regulated during metastatic transition of melanoma, which enhances melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Here we investigate the role of ADAR1 in melanoma immune resistance.Importantly, knockdown of ADAR1 in human melanoma cells induces resistance to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a cell contact-dependent mechanism. We show that ADAR1, in an editing-independent manner, regulates the biogenesis of miR-222 at the transcription level and thereby Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, which consequently affects melanoma immune resistance. ADAR1 thus has a novel, pivotal, role in cancer immune resistance. Corroborating with these results, the expression of miR-222 in melanoma tissue specimens was significantly higher in patients who had no clinical benefit from treatment with ipilimumab as compared to patients that responded clinically, suggesting that miR-222 could function as a biomarker for the prediction of response to ipilimumab.These results provide not only novel insights on melanoma immune resistance, but also pave the way to the development of innovative personalized tools to enable optimal drug selection and treatment.

Clinical trails and in vitro studies have focused on CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta lymphocytes since these cells directly kill virally infected- and tumor cells after antigen-specific recognition via their TCR alphabeta. However, increasing evidence suggests that induction of sustained immunity against cancer and viral infections depends on the presence of tumor- or virus-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are restricted by MHC class II. Here, we show that these MHC class II-restricted CD4+ T lymphocytes can efficiently be redirected to MHC class I-restricted tumor cells by retroviral introduction of an HLA-A1/MAGE-A1-specific chimeric two-chain TCR ValphaCalphazeta/VbetaCbetazeta (tcTCR/zeta). However, TCR-transduced CD4+ T lymphocytes were only able to specifically bind to HLA-A1/MAGE-A1 complexes and respond to HLA-A1+/MAGE-A1+ melanoma cells when the CD8alpha gene was cointroduced. These CD4+/CD8alpha+/TCR(POS) T lymphocytes produce IFN-gamma, TNFalpha and IL-2 when specifically stimulated via the introduced TCR with immobilized HLA-A1/MAGE-A1 complexes or HLA-A1+/MAGE-A1+ melanoma cells. Furthermore, introduction of the CD8alpha gene into TCR(POS) T lymphocytes rendered these T lymphocytes cytotoxic for HLA-A1+/MAGE-A1+ melanoma cells. These results demonstrate that human CD4+ T lymphocytes when genetically grafted with an HLA-A1/MAGE-A1-specific TCR and CD8alpha are induced to kill and produce cytokines upon specific interaction with the relevant melanoma cells. Hence, CD4+ T lymphocytes, in addition to CD8+ T lymphocytes, may be critical effector cells for adoptive immuno-gene therapy to generate a sustained tumor-specific immune response in cancer patients.",

Treatment of metastatic melanoma with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-based therapies represents one of the earliest attempts at systemic immunomodulation as a therapy for cancer. Initial studies showed objective response rates with rIL-2 therapy alone in the range of 15 - 20% with some durable responses. A multitude of studies have been undertaken with various rIL-2 regimens, with and without co-administration of lymphokine-activated cells or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. However, the optimum dose and treatment schedule for rIL-2-based therapy in metastatic melanoma, remains controversial. There are also no clear immunological parameters that can reliably predict antitumour response to rIL-2-based therapy. Ongoing research remains active in exploring the role of rIL-2 in the therapy of malignant melanoma (MM), particularly in conjunction with cytotoxic therapy.",

This is based on several observations.1.Spontaneous remissions occur occasionally.2.In about 5% of melanomas no primary tumour is found. The genetic aberrations of these tumours closely resemble those of cutaneous melanomas, and therefore are suggestive of spontaneous regressions of the primary tumours.3.Both primary tumours and metastases often have brisk lymphocytic infiltrates, a phenomenon that is correlated with better outcome.4.Studies of isolates of these tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes have revealed that a proportion of these cells recognise melanoma antigens.5.Melanomas respond to immunotherapy. These observations have led to over 30 years of research on immunotherapy for melanoma; many of these efforts have failed, with only a few exceptions: interleukin-2 (IL-2) and to a lesser degree interferon-a (IFN-〈). Recently, new developments in immunotherapy have revolutionised this treatment modality. Anti-CTLA4 has received approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of stage IV melanomas based on the improvement in overall survival in phase III trials, and more recently blockade of PD1/PDL1 interactions has shown objective clinical responses in a stage IV melanoma in early-phase clinical trials. In addition, several independent single-institution phase I/II trials using adoptive cell therapy have shown a consistently high response rate, including durable complete remissions in a substantial percentage of treated patients. Now, for the first time, immunotherapy has moved beyond the treatment of melanoma as both CTLA4 and PD1 blockade have been shown to induce objective responses in other tumour types as well. This chapter will discuss the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy and side effects of IL-2, the novel treatments consisting of the immune checkpoint blockade drugs anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 and adoptive cell therapy.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are considered a manifestation of the host immune response to tumor, but the role of TILs in melanoma mortality is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate independent prognostic factors for melanoma mortality. We carried out a 10-year cohort study on 4133 melanoma patients from the same geographic area (Lazio) with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2008. The probability of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and prognostic factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma decreased with increasing Breslow thickness (Pfor trend<0.0001) and with age (Pfor trend<0.0001) whereas survival increased with increasing levels of TILs (Pfor trend=0.0001). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma divided into TILs intensity as scanty, moderate, and marked was 88.0, 92.2, and 97.0%, respectively. In the multivariate Cox model, the presence of high levels of TILs in primary invasive melanomas was associated with a lower risk of melanoma death (hazard ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.82) after controlling for sex, age, Breslow thickness, histological type, mitotic rate, and ulceration. After including lymph node status in the multivariate analysis, the protective effect of marked TILs on melanoma mortality remained (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.94). The results of this study suggest that the immune microenvironment affects melanoma survival. ",

A cDNA encoding an antigen recognized by TIL1200 was isolated by screening an HLA-A2+ breast cancer cell line transfected with an expression cDNA library prepared from an HLA-A2+ melanoma cell line.

SCCs develop at a significantly higher rate under chronic immunosuppressive conditions, implicating a role of immune surveillance in controlling SCCs. It remains largely unknown how SCCs evade immune recognition. Here, we established a mouse model by injecting tumor cells derived from primary SCCs harboring KrasG12D mutation and Smad4 deletion into wild-type (wt) or CD8-/- recipients. We found comparable tumor growth between wt and CD8-/- recipients, indicating a complete escape of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses by these SCCs. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cells apparently were not defective in infiltrating tumors given their relatively increased percentage among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). CD8+ TILs exhibited phenotypes of chronic activation and exhaustion, including overexpression of activation markers, co-expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), as well as TCRβ downregulation. Among CD4+ TILs, T regulatory cells (Tregs) were preferentially expanded. Contradictory to prior findings in melanoma, Treg expansion was independent of CD8+ T cells in our SCC model. Unexpectedly, CD8+ T cells were required for promoting NK cell infiltration within SCCs. Furthermore, we uncovered AKT-dependent lymphocyte-induced PD-L1 upregulation on SCCs, which was contributed greatly by combinatorial effects of CD8+ T and NK cells. Lastly, dual blockade of PD-1 and LAG-3 inhibited the tumor growth of SCCs. Thus, our findings identify novel immune evasion mechanisms of SCCs and suggest that immunosuppressive mechanisms operate in a cancer-type specific and context-dependent manner.",

In this study, we systematically evaluated the composition and organization of immune cells that infiltrated melanoma metastases in human patients. Three histologic patterns of immune cell infiltration were identified, designated immunotypes A, B, and C. Immunotype A was characterized by no immune cell infiltrate. Immunotype B was characterized by infiltration of immune cells limited only to regions proximal to intratumoral blood vessels. Immunotype C was characterized by a diffuse immune cell infiltrate throughout a metastatic tumor. These immunotypes represented 29%, 63%, and 8% of metastases with estimated median survival periods of 15, 23, and 130 months, respectively. Notably, from immunotypes A to C, there were increasing proportions of B cells and decreasing proportions of macrophages. Overall, the predominant immune cells were T cells (53%), B cell lineage cells (33%), and macrophages (13%), with natural killer and mature dendritic cells only rarely present. Whereas higher densities of CD8(+) T cells correlated best with survival, a higher density of CD45(+) leukocytes, T cells, and B cells also correlated with increased survival. Together, our findings reveal striking differences in the immune infiltrate in melanoma metastases in patients, suggesting microenvironmental differences in immune homing receptors and ligands that affect immune cell recruitment. These findings are important, not only by revealing how the immune microenvironment can affect outcomes but also because they reveal characteristics that may help improve individualized therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.",

Coping styles were paradoxically related to major life stress such that history of major stresses was associated with greater confrontation of the melanoma diagnosis, greater will to fight the disease, and less avoidance of its frightening aspects. Experience with fewer major life stresses was associated with a defeatist attitude characterized by an expectation of a poor prognosis and little control over outcomes.

In this study, we evaluated the expression of these MAA with a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against MART-1 (M2-7C10) and the commercially available HMB45 mAb directed against gp100. Expression was tested in vitro by intracellular fluorescence analysis and in vivo by immunophenotyping of tissue specimens. Nine melanoma cell lines and 25 tissue specimens from metastatic melanoma were analyzed. One cell line did not express MART-1 or gp100. The expression of both antigens was more heterogeneous and significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes, suggesting progressive loss of expression of MAA by neoplastic cells. None of the nonmelanoma cancer lines tested stained for MART-1 or gp100. Analysis of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry showed significant heterogeneity of expression of both MART-1 and gp100 MAA either as a percentage of cells expressing MAA or as intensity of expression. Ten of 25 frozen sections expressed MART-1 in < 50% of the cells. In 6 of 25 lesions, immunoreactivity for MART-1 was totally absent. Fine needle aspiration of metastatic lesions seemed to yield information accurately about amount and heterogeneity of expression of MAA in tumor lesions in vivo.

Nevertheless, the majority of patients progress either directly upon therapy or after an initial period of tumor control. Recent data have shown that most TIL products that are used for therapy contain only low frequencies of T cells reactive against known melanoma-associated epitopes. Because of this, the development of a technology to create T-cell products that are enriched for reactivity against defined melanoma-associated antigens would seem valuable, both to evaluate the tumoricidal potential of T cells directed against different antigen classes and to potentially increase response rates. Here, we developed and validated a conditional MHC streptamer-based platform for the creation of TIL products with defined antigen reactivities. We have used this platform to successfully enrich both high-frequency (≥1%) and low-frequency (<1%) tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, and thereby created T-cell products with enhanced tumor recognition potential. Collectively, these data demonstrate that selection of antigen-specific T-cell populations can be used to create defined T-cell products for clinical use. This strategy thus forms a highly flexible platform for the development of antigen-specific cell products for personalized cancer immunotherapy. ",

A concordant presence of the two antigens and of an ILI was frequent both in vertical growth pattern melanomas and in melanomas thicker than 1 mm. On the contrary, both antigens and the ILI were frequently absent both in thin melanomas (less than 1 mm) and in radial growth pattern melanomas.

A Gompertz distribution which provided for an appropriate smoothing of the Breslow model estimates was used to derive a simple prognostic index and to predict the survival of individual patients.

HPLC fractionation of this material revealed six T cell epitopes (termed P1-P6) recognized by HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) lines. Three of these fractions (P1, P2, and P4) appeared to represent shared/immunodominant melanoma Ag recognized in the context of HLA-A2 because they were expressed by 4/4 HLA-A2+ melanoma cell lines and were each recognized by all four oligoclonal HLA-A2-restricted TIL lines examined. Interestingly, P1 and P2 (but not P3-P6) could also be recognized by these same TIL when presented by the HLA-Aw69 class I molecule, which is closely related to HLA-A2. P3, P5, and P6 displayed more restricted expression and were differentially recognized by the four oligoclonal TIL lines. These results suggest that synthetic peptide derived from P1, P2, and P4 sequences (when deduced) may form the basis of effective prophylactic or therapeutic melanoma vaccines by stimulating CD8+ CTL in HLA-A2+ individuals.

Large multi-institutional studies have confirmed that when performed by experienced surgeons, it is an accurate, reliable technique for identifying occult regional nodal disease, and that SLN status is the most important prognostic factor in patients with stage I and II melanoma. However, the incidence of occult regional nodal metastasis in patients with thin melanoma (<or= 1.0 mm; approximately 70% of patients with newly diagnosed melanoma) is low, and whether to perform SLN biopsy in these patients remains controversial. Several predictors of SLN metastasis in patients with thin melanoma have been suggested, but none widely accepted. This article reviews current literature on these predictors in patients with thin melanoma. Although the ability to draw conclusions was limited by the size and design of the available studies, the authors tentatively conclude that SLN biopsy can be considered for patients with melanomas 0.75 mm or larger, those with T1b melanomas (i.e., <or= 1.0 mm; Clark level IV/V and/or ulcerated), and those with thin melanomas with an increased tumor mitotic rate (especially >or= 1 mitosis/mm2). Including younger age (e.g., <or= 40 years) in the decision also seems reasonable, particularly if the primary tumor is associated with a high tumor mitotic rate. Tumor regression does not seem to be associated with an increased risk for SLN metastasis. Firm conclusions on the predictive value of vertical growth phase, absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or male gender were not possible, particularly if used as a sole criterion for offering this procedure. SLN biopsy should be discussed with all patients with newly diagnosed thin melanoma.",

Antimelanoma CTL could be generated only with MART-1(27-35) peptide, which has been previously shown to be recognized by a majority of HLA-A2-restricted TIL. Anti-MART-1(35-43)-specific CTL could also be induced, but these T cells did not recognize melanoma cells.

These CTL lines specifically lysed and release cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF) in response to T2 cells pulsed with MART-1(27-35), as well as to HLA-A2+ MART-1+ melanoma cells.

Previous studies show that upon cell contact, various membrane-associated proteins, such as Ras-family proteins, transfer from B to T and NK lymphocytes. Mutations in RAS genes that encode constitutively active, GTP-bound, oncoproteins are rather common in human cancers; for instance, melanoma. Cancer immunoediting has been postulated to contribute to the elimination of malignant melanoma. Thus, we asked whether Ras oncoproteins can transfer from melanoma to T cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and subsequently induce functional effects in the adopting T cells. To explore this issue, we genetically engineered an HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell line, MEL526, to express GFP or GFP-tagged H-Ras mutants stably. In this study, we show by an in vitro coculture system that GFP-tagged H-Ras, but not GFP, transfers from MEL526 to T cells and localizes to the inner aspect of their plasma membrane. This cell-contact-dependent process was increased by TCR stimulation and did not require strict Ag specificity. Importantly, we found a positive correlation between the levels of the acquired constitutively active H-RasG12V and ERK1/2 phosphorylation within the adopting TILs. We also show a significant increase in IFN-γ production and cytotoxic activity in TILs that acquired H-RasG12V compared to TILs that acquired a different H-Ras mutant. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a hitherto unknown phenomenon of intercellular transfer of Ras oncoproteins from melanoma to TILs that consequently augments their effector functions.",

Specimens of melanocytic nevi, primary melanomas and subcutaneous metastases of melanoma were obtained from fifty-eight patients, whereas metastasized lymph nodes were obtained from five patients. Telomerase activity was determined in these specimens by using a Polymerase Chain Reaction-based assay (TRAP). High relative mean telomerase activity levels were detected in metastatic melanoma (subcutaneous metastases = 54.5, lymph node metastases = 56.5). Much lower levels were detected in primary melanomas, which increased with advancing levels of tumor cell penetration (Clark II = 0.02, Clark III = 1.1, and Clark IV = 1.9). Twenty-six formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanocytic lesions were sectioned and analyzed for telomerase RNA with a radioactive in situ hybridization assay. In situ hybridization studies with a probe to the template RNA component of telomerase confirmed that expression was almost exclusively confined to tumor cells and not infiltrating lymphocytes. These results indicate that levels of telomerase activity and telomerase RNA in melanocytic lesions correlate well with clinical stage and could potentially assist in the diagnosis of borderline lesions.",

Adult Balb/C mice recieved 0.1-cm3 doses of BCG prior to intramuscular challenge with 1 x 10-6 S-91 melanoma cells. A 65% reduction in melanoma incidence was noted in BCG-pretreated mice. The possibility of specific protection induced by the BCG against the melanoma exists, since the BCG pretreatment did not protect against challenge with 1 x 10-5 mammary carcinoma cells or 1 x 10-4 MCA fibrosarcoma cells in the same strain of mice. Lack of immunogenicity was not a factor in the inability of the carcinoma and sarcoma to be inhibited by BCG. The strenght of the BCG-induced protection against the S-91 melanoma was demonstrated by significantly decreased tumor incidence following three different log challenge doses of the melanoma. However, reduction of the sarcoma challenge dose to as few as 10-2 cells administered to BCG pretreated mice did not result in decreased tumor incidence. It was further discovered that as few as two doses of 0.1 cm3 of BCG were sufficient to produce a 70% reduction in melanoma incidence compared with the incidence in control animals (P less than .001). Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity studies paralleled the results of the in vivo experiments. Lymphocytes immune to each of the three tumors showed significant cytotoxicity against their respective tumor target cells (p less than .001), while the only tumor cells that lymphocytes from BCG-pretreated mice showed significant cytotoxicity against were S-91 target cells (p less than .01). Nonspecific cytotoxicity was not a factor in the effect of BCG-immune lymphocytes against S-91 target cells, since BCG-immune lymphocytes were not cytotoxic to Balb/C fibroblasts.",

However, diffuse infiltration into tumor occurs in only 8% of melanoma metastases. Little is known about mechanisms governing T-cell infiltration into human melanoma metastases or about how those mechanisms may be altered therapeutically. We hypothesized that T cells in the MME would be enriched for chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3 and homing receptors relevant to the tissue site. Viably cryopreserved single cell suspensions from nineteen melanoma metastases representing three metastatic sites (tumor-infiltrated lymph node, skin and small bowel) were evaluated by multiparameter flow cytometry and compared to benign lymph nodes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Stage IIB-IV melanoma. T cells in the melanoma metastases contained large effector memory populations, high proportions of activated, moderately differentiated cells and few regulatory T cells. Site-specific homing was suggested in bowel, with high expression of CCR9. We neither encounter the anticipated enrichment of integrin α4β7 in bowel, cutaneous leukocyte antigen (CLA) in skin, nor integrin α4β1 or receptor CXCR3 in metastatic sites. Retention integrins αEβ7, α1β1 and α2β1 were significantly elevated in metastases. These data suggest limited tissue site-specific homing to human melanoma metastases, but a significant role for retention integrins in maintaining intratumoral T cells. Our findings also raise the possibility that T-cell homing, infiltration, and retention in melanoma metastases may be increased by increasing expression of ligands for CLA, α4β1 and CXCR3 on intratumoral endothelium.

However, theoretically it should be of greater benefit as adjuvant therapy, especially in high-risk stages (resected stages III and IV). In a preliminary study, 25 patients (aged 23-72 years) with stage III-IV melanoma who underwent resection of metachronous metastases were reinfused with TIL cultivated and expanded in vitro with IL-2 from surgically removed metastases. IL-2 (starting dose 12 x 10 IU/m ) was co-administered as a continuous infusion according to West's scheme. A total of 8/22 (36.3%) evaluable patients were disease-free (DF) at a median follow-up of 5 years. DF survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 44% and 37%, respectively, at 2 years, and 52% and 45% at 3 years. The CNS was the only site of disease recurrence in 57% of patients who relapsed. DF patients received a higher median dose of IL-2 than those who progressed (total dose 110 x 10 versus 86 x 10 IU/m, respectively). The progressive reduction in IL-2 dosage allowed all patients to complete treatment without permanent grade 4 toxicity. Analysis of tumor immunosuppression factors in lymphocytes inside the tumor (TCR zeta and epsilon chains, p56, FAS, and FAS-ligand) confirmed that the immunologic potential of TIL, depressed at the time of metastasectomy, was significantly restored after in vitro culture with IL-2. Adoptive immunotherapy with TIL and IL-2 could improve DFS and OS, although further work is required to determine its role in the treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma.",

In contrast, we showed that inhibition of GJs by oleamide during stimulation of resting PBMCs with Melan-A natural and analog peptides resulted in a decrease in antigen (Ag) specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte induction. These Ag-specific CD8(+) cells displayed paradoxically stronger reactivity as revealed by CD107a degranulation and IFN-γ secretion.

The aim of this research was to determine the level of VEGF expression in skin melanoma in different body regions and in different primary stages of the disease.;The research was conducted on bioptic materials of skin in 39 patients. On excision-made materials a routine histological preparation was done and following parameters were determined: histological type, alteration thickness (according to Breslow), Clark level, TNM (Tumor Nodus Metastasis) stage (pT), alteration width, thickness of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor, mitotic index, phase of the tumor growth, presence of ulcerations, cellular type of the tumor, localization and level of VEGF expression.;Analysis confirmed that 61.54% of skin melanoma showed a high VEGF expression. Nodular and acral lentiginous melanomas showed more frequently a high level of VEGF expression, while superficial spreading melanoma showed a lower level of VEGF expression (p = 0.032, p < 0.05). A higher level of expression was present in thicker melanomas (higher in the Breslow stage; p = 0.011, p < 0.05).

CD3,8 BSMAB cause selective cytolysis of CD8+ lymphocytes by bridging the CD8 molecules of target lymphocytes to the CD3 molecular complex of cytolytic T lymphocytes with concurrent activation and proliferation of residual CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes. Similarly, CD3,4 BSMAB cause selective lysis of CD4+ lymphocytes whereas concurrently activating the residual CD3+CD8+ T cells. Small tumor fragments from four malignant melanoma and three renal cell carcinoma patients were cultured in medium containing CD3,8 + IL-2, CD3,4 + IL-2, or IL-2 alone. CD3,8 led to selective propagation of the CD4+ TIL whereas CD3,4 led to selective propagation of the CD8+ TIL from each of the tumors. The phenotypes of the TIL subset cultures were generally stable when assayed over a 1 to 3 months period and after further expansion with anti-CD3 mAb or lectins. Specific 51Cr release of labeled target cells that were bridged to the CD3 molecular complexes of TIL suggested that both CD4+ and CD8+ TIL cultures have the capacity of mediating cytolysis via their Ti/CD3 TCR complexes. In addition, both CD4+ and CD8+ TIL cultures from most patients caused substantial (greater than 20%) lysis of the NK-sensitive K562 cell line. The majority of CD4+ but not CD8+ TIL cultures also produced substantial lysis of the NK-resistant Daudi cell line. Lysis of the autologous tumor by the TIL subsets was assessed in two patients with malignant melanoma. The CD8+ TIL from one tumor demonstrated cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor but negligible lysis of allogeneic melanoma targets. In conclusion, immunocompetent CD4+ and CD8+ TIL subsets can be isolated and expanded directly from small tumor fragments of malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma using BSMAB.

Although memory T cells have been presumed to be potentially advantageous for ACT, the kinetics of local and systemic T cell responses after effector and memory ACT have not been compared. B16F10 melanoma cells stably transfected to express very low levels of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide GP33 (B16GP33) were inoculated into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice.

The efficacy of ACT immunotherapy was kinetically assessed using serial tumor measurements and flow cytometric analyses of local and systemic CD8+ T cell responses. Control of B16GP33 tumor growth, persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+ cells, intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and systemic CD8+ T cell responsiveness to GP33 were strongest after ACT of memory CD8+ T cells.

Three common gp100 epitopes have been identified that are recognized in the context of HLA-A2 by TIL from different patients: G9154 (KTWGQYWQV), G9209 (ITDQVPFSV), and G9280 (YLEPGPVTA). Upon stimulation with these peptides, melanoma-reactive CTL could be induced in vitro from PBL of some HLA-A2+ melanoma patients. However, numerous restimulations were required, and specific reactivity could not be generated in many patients. Therefore, to enhance the immunogenicity of gp100 peptides, amino acid substitutions were introduced into G9154, G9209, and G9280 at HLA-A*0201-binding anchor positions, but not at TCR contact residues, to increase peptide class I MHC-binding affinity. Several modified gp100 peptides bound with greater affinity to HLA-A*0201 than unmodified peptides and were recognized by TIL specific for the natural epitopes. These peptides were used to sensitize PBL from HLA-A2+ melanoma patients in vitro using peptide-pulsed autologous PBMC as stimulators. After five weekly restimulations with either the native G9209 or G9280 peptide, melanoma-reactive CTL could only be induced from two of seven patients. However, amino acid substitutions in these peptides enabled the induction of melanoma-reactive CTL from all seven patients. These results suggest that modified gp100 peptides may be more immunogenic than the native epitopes, and may be useful in immunotherapy protocols for patients with melanoma.",

Furthermore, the chemokine SDF-1alpha, the ligand of CXCR4, triggered modulation of beta(1) integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin. Additionally, Mig and SDF-1alpha activated MAPKs p44/42 and p38 on melanoma cells.

Four broad histologic patterns of recurrent nevus were identified and classified into type 1: junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with effacement of the retiform epidermis and associated dermal scar, type 2: compound melanocytic proliferation with effacement of the retiform epidermis and associated dermal scar, type 3: junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with retention of the retiform epidermis, and type 4: compound melanocytic hyperplasia with retention of the retiform epidermis and scar. Melanomas with early and intermediate regression were recognizable due to the presence of residual melanoma. Melanomas with late regression had overlapping features of type 1 and 2 recurrent nevi. Type 3 recurrent nevi resembled primary melanoma with scar/fibrosis. Histologically, the vast majority of recurrent nevi are readily identifiable; however, partial biopsies or cases without prior knowledge of the original biopsy may lead to misdiagnosis.

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the tumors were infiltrated by a significant population of CD11c(+) major histocompatibility complex II(+) DCs, especially at an early stage of tumor growth. The allogeneic stimulatory capacity of TIDCs increased with tumor growth, whereas this capacity of DCs in lymph nodes decreased. TIDCs harvested at an early stage of melanoma (early TIDCs) accelerated tumor growth, but those harvested at a late stage (late TIDCs) delayed tumor progression when they were coinjected with melanoma cells. Furthermore, coinjection of early TIDCs failed to induce full immunocompetent maturation of CD8(+) T cells, with much lower expression of IFN-γ, granzyme B, and perforin within the tumor microenvironment.

Careful and precise diagnosis and staging are essential to determine patient's risk and to select appropriate treatments. Fortunately, the recent progress in immunotherapy is very encouraging. In this context, it is important to characterize the intratumoral infiltration of immune cells in each patient, which is however not done routinely due to the lack of standardized methods. In this study, we used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging combined with multivariate statistical analyses to investigate non-metastatic and metastatic lymph nodes from melanoma patients. Our results show that the different cell types have different infrared spectral features allowing automated identification of these cell types. High recognition rates were obtained using a supervised partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model. Melanoma cells were recognized with 87.1% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity, showing that FTIR spectroscopy has similar detection power as immunohistochemistry. Besides, FTIR imaging could also distinguish lymphocyte subpopulations (B and T cells). Finally, we investigated the changes in lymphocytes due to the presence of metastases. Interestingly, specific features of spectra of lymphocytes present in metastatic or tumor-free lymph nodes could be evidenced by PCA. A PLS-DA model was capable of predicting whether lymphocytes originated from invaded or non-invaded lymph nodes. These data demonstrate that FTIR imaging is capable to distinguish known and also novel biological features in human tissues, with potential practical relevance for histopathological diagnosis and biomarker assessment.

Recent results in immunotherapy of metastatic melanoma are impaired by early local recurrence, leading to consolidation surgery. Two patients with solitary liver metastasis were treated by liver resection. In one patient in January 1993, atypical resection was performed after partial remission induced by regional adoptive immunotherapy with LAK-cells and Interleukin-2. In September 1983 right hemihepatectomy was done in one patient for large metastasis without preceding therapy. Until now there is no evidence of disease in both patients. The metastasis were 14 cm without and 3.5 cm after (5.3 cm before) immunotherapy in diameter. On histologic examination we found only a slight necrosis without marked immunological reaction like mononuclear cell infiltration or fibrotic demarcation in the specimen of the patient without forgoing therapy. In the specimen of the patient after immunotherapy, the metastasis was necrotic. It was encapsulated by fibrous tissue which was infiltrated by lymphoid cells. The microscopic evaluation revealed some clots of vital tumorcells. The resection of solitary liver metastasis of melanoma with or without immunotherapy is recommended. The rational for consolidation surgery for melanoma metastases after successful immunotherapy is based on the histologically proven vital tumor cells in necrotic metastasis, which are responsible for early local recurrence.",

These epitope-specific CTL lines were generated following weekly in vitro stimulation with the synthetic decamer G10(476) (V-L-Y-R-Y-G-S-F-S-V) or the nonamers G9(280) (Y-L-E-P-G-P-V-T-A), G9(154) (K-T-W-G-Q-Y-W-Q-V), or G9(209) (I-T-D-Q-V-P-F-S-V) pulsed onto autologous irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Although granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been shown to be a key inducer of Bv8 expression, the basis for Bv8 production in driving tumor angiogenesis is undefined. Because the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1, which is highly expressed on Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid cells, is known to regulate G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) signaling, we hypothesized that CEACAM1 would regulate Bv8 production in these cells. In support of this hypothesis, we found that Bv8 expression was elevated in Gr1(+)CD11b(+) cells from Ceacam1-deficient mice implanted with B16 melanoma, increasing the infiltration of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid cells in melanoma tumors and enhancing their growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with anti-Gr1 or anti-Bv8 or anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibody reduced myeloid cell infiltration, tumor growth, and angiogenesis to levels observed in tumor-bearing wild-type (WT) mice. Reconstitution of CEACAM1-deficient mice with WT bone marrow cells restored tumor infiltration of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) cells along with tumor growth and angiogenesis to WT levels. Treatment of tumor-bearing WT mice with anti-CEACAM1 antibody limited tumor outgrowth and angiogenesis, albeit to a lesser extent. Tumor growth in Ceacam1-deficient mice was not affected significantly in Rag(-/-) background, indicating that CEACAM1 expression in T and B lymphocytes had a negligible role in this pathway. Together, our findings show that CEACAM1 negatively regulates Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid cell-dependent tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting the G-CSF-Bv8 signaling pathway.",

Nonetheless, only a few mutated epitopes efficiently presented by human tumors have thus far been identified. We describe here an approach to identify such epitopes. This approach involves: 1) identifying tumors expressing a ras mutation and isolating the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); 2) transfecting COS cells to induce expression of unknown mutated peptides in the context of a patient's HLA class I molecules; and 3) screening epitope recognition by using TIL from the tumors expressing a ras mutation. By using this approach, there appeared to be a N-ras mutation (a glutamine-to-arginine exchange at residue 61 (Q61R)), detected in a melanoma lesion, which was recognized specifically by the autologous TIL in the HLA-A*0101 context. The ras peptide 55-64(Q61R) was the epitope of these TIL and was regularly presented by Q61R-mutated HLA-A*0101(+) melanoma cell lines. This peptide and its wild-type homolog (55-64(wt)) bound to HLA-A*0101 with similar affinities. However, only the mutated peptide could induce specific CTL expansion from PBL. All the CTL clones specific to the mutated peptide, failed to recognize the wild-type sequence on both COS and melanoma cells. These data thus show that oncogenic protein mutations can create shared tumor-specific CTL epitopes, efficiently presented by tumor cells, and that screening for oncogene-transfected COS cell recognition by TIL (from tumors containing mutations) is a powerful approach for the identification of these epitopes.",

Increasing evidence suggests that the number, type and location of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary tumors has prognostic value, and this has led to the development of an 'immunoscore. As well as providing useful prognostic information, the immunoscore concept also has the potential to help predict response to treatment, thereby improving decision- making with regard to choice of therapy. This predictive aspect of the tumor microenvironment forms the basis for the concept of immunoprofiling, which can be described as 'using an individual's immune system signature (or profile) to predict that patient's response to therapy' The immunoprofile of an individual can be genetically determined or tumor-induced (and therefore dynamic). Ipilimumab is the first in a series of immunomodulating antibodies and has been shown to be associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma. Other immunotherapies in development include anti-programmed death 1 protein (nivolumab), anti-PD-ligand 1, anti-CD137 (urelumab), and anti-OX40. Biomarkers that can be used as predictive factors for these treatments have not yet been clinically validated. However, there is already evidence that the tumor microenvironment can have a predictive role, with clinical activity of ipilimumab related to high baseline expression of the immune-related genes FoxP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These biomarkers could represent the first potential proposal for an immunoprofiling panel in patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 therapy is being considered, although prospective data are required. In conclusion, the evaluation of systemic and local immunological biomarkers could offer useful prognostic information and facilitate clinical decision making. The challenge will be to identify the individual immunoprofile of each patient and the consequent choice of optimal therapy or combination of therapies to be used.",

Two clones from a single patient were sequenced and detected in three different tumor sites (skin biopsies), whereas only one of them was also present in peripheral blood. Biopsies from this patient did not show major repertoire changes during in vivo IL-2 treatment. In contrast, in biopsies from a second patient, the expression of all the detected V beta subfamilies was increased and a larger number of clones expanded, probably as a result of therapy. A similar evolution was found among infiltrating T cells cultured in vitro from a third patient for several weeks in the presence of IL-2, where the largely polyclonal repertoire of fresh T cells (from invaded lymph nodes) was dramatically reduced to mainly clonal expansions in all V beta subfamilies detected. The high resolution method used here enables a rapid, comprehensive, qualitative, and semiquantitative description of the T cell repertoire of heterogeneous cell populations.

All melanoma lesions and the corresponding TIL cultures comprised high numbers of T-cell clonotypes, typically in the range of 40 to more than 60. The subsequent comparison of T-cell clonotypes present in the original lesions and in the corresponding T-cell lines established in vitro demonstrated that a very limited number of the T-cell clonotypes established in vitro are identical to the T-cell clonotypes expanded in situ.

We investigated the expression of COX-2 in uveal melanoma and related the findings to prognostic factors.;In 40 cases of uveal melanoma, immunostaining for COX-2 was done. COX-2 expression was related to histopathological prognostic markers, such as cell type, the presence of lymphocytic infiltration and vascular closed loops in the tumour, and cytomorphometry results.;COX-2 expression was found in 58% of the cases, and it correlated with markers of poor prognosis, such as epithelioid cell type and the presence of lymphocytic infiltration and vascular closed loops. The uveal melanomas expressing COX-2 had larger nuclei, as determined by cytomorphometry.;Whereas epithelioid tumours carry a worse prognosis than spindle cell tumours, until now it has not been possible to give a strong indication of prognosis in mixed-cell tumours. This study showed that mixed-cell tumours, representing the majority of uveal melanomas, may be further subclassified according to COX-2 expression, which serves as a marker of poor prognosis. The role of COX-2 in uveal melanoma should be further elucidated, and the use of COX-2 inhibitors warrants investigation as adjuvant treatment for this life-threatening malignant disease.",

CD27- and CD28-positive T-cells had high levels of CD44 expression. T-Cell expansion resulted in significant down-regulation of CD44 expression. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and anti-CD3 antibody stimulation may be responsible for CD44 down-regulation on CD8(+) T-cells during expansion. Furthermore, CD44 down-regulation using small interfering RNA (siRNA) on TILs dramatically reduced interferon-gamma and IL-2 release upon tumor stimulation. These results suggest that the regulation of CD44 expression in TILs may play an important role in memory T-cell maintenance and antitumor immune response.",

In this paper we have outlined the suppressor system that best fits the published data. The regulatory system is composed of CD4+ T-lymphocytes which have been activated and programmed to secrete Th2 cytokines. Initially these cells do not secrete cytokines, but subsequently they enter an IL-10 secretory phase as a result of T-T cell interaction. After activation, Th1 programmed T-cells express MHC class II molecules and B7 second signals. When these Th1 T-cells express MHC II molecules containing 'self' polypeptides coupled with faulty B7-H1 second signals they are subject to inactivation by Th2 T-cells. If this system can be inactivated, immunotherapy of melanoma will be more successful. If an antigen can be discovered that stimulates sensitized Th2 T-cells without stimulating Th1 T-cells, this antigen, followed with cyclophosphamide, can be used to destroy the Th2 T-cells in the course of both active and passive immunotherapy. Solubilized MHC II molecules with appropriate 'self' polypeptides should qualify as such an antigen. We postulate such an antigen can be prepared using poliovirus 1 (Sabin) to lyse melanoma tissue cultures.",

We demonstrate that a CD4+ on-going immune response is elicited in the investigated patients.

Patients were immunized by three vaccinations, each consisting of 60 x 106 irradiated (100 Gy) melanoma cells (secreting 120 ng of IL-2/10(6) cells/24 hr) administered subcutaneously at weekly intervals for 3 consecutive weeks. Side effects of treatment consisted of swelling of locoregional lymph nodes and induration at the site of injection, i.e., a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. In three patients, vaccination induced inflammatory responses in distant metastases containing necrosis or apoptosis along with T cell infiltration. Apoptosis occurred only in Bcl-2-negative areas, not in Bcl-2-expressing parts of the metastases. Two other patients experienced complete or partial regression of subcutaneous metastases. Seven patients had protracted stabilization (4 to >46 months) of soft tissue metastases, including one patient who developed vitiligo after vaccination. Immune responses to the vaccine could be detected in 67% of the 27 patients measured. Vaccination was shown to induce a variable change in the number of anti-vaccine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in peripheral blood, which did not correlate with response to treatment. However, in two of five patients the frequency of anti-autologous tumor CTLs measured was significantly higher than before vaccination. This study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and therapeutic potential of vaccination of humans with allogeneic, gene-modified tumor cells, and that frequencies of vaccine-specific CTLs among patient lymphocytes can be determined by using a modified limited dilution analysis (LDA).",

However, little is known about the level of CTL reactivity in vivo that is required for immunological control of tumor progression. In the present report, T-cell responses were evaluated with lymphocytes obtained from tumor-involved nodes and peripheral blood of a long-term melanoma survivor. Using an ELISPOT assay, naturally occurring functional T cells, which recognize the peptide ALLAVGATK (gp100(17-25)) plus two other HLA-A3 restricted peptides, were detected in a tumor-involved lymph node. The ALLAVGATK-reactive T cells were also evaluated by MHC-tetramers staining and were found to be CD8+ CD45RO+ L-selectin(-) CD11a+, suggesting that they are antigen experienced and have a memory phenotype. Unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from the same patient demonstrated no detectable T-cell responses; however, a single stimulation with ALLAVGATK peptide in vitro resulted in a dramatic expansion of peptide-reactive CTLs. This patient, with evidence of tumor-reactive CTLs targeted to several tumor antigens in a tumor-involved lymph node and with evidence of a circulating memory T-cell response, has remained disease-free for 6 years, despite prior bulky nodal metastasis. In contrast, three HLA-A3+ patients with rapidly progressive metastatic melanoma had no detectable T-cell response in tumor-involved nodes or peripheral blood lymphocytes, even after peptide stimulation ex vivo. The presented data are consistent with a systemic polyvalent immune response against tumor in this long-term survivor. These data provide an estimate of the level of CTL response that may be associated with protection from tumor recurrence.",

In vitro studies showed a bystander effect only in C6 cells. In vivo studies showed an inhibition of tumor growth in the two melanoma models when tumor cells were coinjected with VPC-producing retroviral vectors carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, followed by GCV treatment; however, 100% of mice developed tumors in both models. Under similar experimental conditions, 70% (7 of 10) of syngeneic rats completely rejected stereotactically transferred C6 tumor cells; most of them (5 of 10) showed a prolonged survival. Treating established C6 tumors with VPC-producing retroviral vectors carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and GCV led to the cure of 33% (4 of 12) of the animals. Rats that rejected tumor growth developed an antitumor immune memory, leading to a rejection of a stereotactic contralateral challenge with parental cells.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represent the majority of mononuclear immune infiltrates in the breast tumor microenvironment and can be easily identified in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues after standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. High levels of TILs are most common in HER2+ and basal-like subtypes where they are associated with good prognosis and with response to certain therapies such as the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. International collaborative efforts are underway to standardize the assessment of TILs so as to facilitate their implementation as a breast cancer biomarker. Using immunohistochemistry to further characterize TILs, recent reports describe the presence of important lymphocyte populations including CD8+ cytotoxic, FOXP3+ regulatory, and CD4+ helper and follicular T cells which have overlapping associations with prognosis and response to therapies.

Despite strong similarities between transcriptional signatures of tumor- and virus-induced exhausted CD8 T cells, notable differences appeared. Among transcriptional regulators, Nr4a2 and Maf were highly overexpressed in tumor-exhausted T cells and significantly upregulated in CD8 T cells from human melanoma metastases. Transduction of murine tumor-specific CD8 T cells to express Maf partially reproduced the transcriptional program associated with tumor-induced exhaustion. Upon adoptive transfer, the transduced cells showed normal homeostasis but failed to accumulate in tumor-bearing hosts and developed defective anti-tumor effector responses. We further identified TGFβ and IL-6 as main inducers of Maf expression in CD8 T cells and showed that Maf-deleted tumor-specific CD8 T cells were much more potent to restrain tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, the melanoma microenvironment contributes to skewing of CD8 T cell differentiation programs, in part by TGFβ/IL-6-mediated induction of Maf. ",

In this study, the mechanism involved in, and the specificities of, cytotoxic immune response in this autologous system were examined at population and clonal levels. Resident lymph node lymphocytes were isolated from both involved and uninvolved lymph nodes from the same patient. Resident lymphocytes from both sources regulated the generation of cytotoxic immune response when both types of resident lymph node lymphocytes were further sensitized against the PJ-M cells in IVC and were expanded in interleukin 2 (IL 2). An IL 2-dependent homogeneous lymphocyte line (I-10:1) bearing the phenotype of a helper T cell (T4+) and a T4+ clone (I-10.3) of the I-10:1 line, established by limiting dilution culture, also down-regulated the generation of cytotoxic immune effector cells in the PBL in IVC against the PJ-M targets. The IL 2-dependent T4+ inducer line I-10:1 generated a functionally differentiated T8+ suppressor population(s) that, in turn, could abrogate cytotoxic response in fresh PBL in IVC against PJ-M cells. The inducer line I-10:1 and its subclone I-10.3 suppressed the generation of cytotoxic effector cells in the PBL in IVC selectively against the autologous PJ-M cells. Generation of cytotoxic allo-response in IVC was unaffected by the inducer lines. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of the regulatory network in cytotoxic immune response in an autologous human tumor system, and suggest a potential explanation for cytotoxic unresponsiveness against autologous melanoma cells.",

Ultrasonography and computed tomography disclosed an abdominal mass with multiple concentric rings, characteristic of intussusception. At surgery, a spherical tumor, 3.8 cm in diameter, with scattered pigmentation was found to lead the intussusception. Segmental intestinal resection with regional lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of malignant melanoma cells. Nodal metastasis was seen only in the mesenteric node draining from the tumor-bearing intestinal segment. Twelve months after surgery, melanoma recurred in the liver and para-aortic lymph nodes, where a malignancy of the digestive organs frequently metastasizes; however, no extraperitoneal melanoma was found after repeated examinations. Thus, this case suggests that primary malignant melanoma can originate in the small intestine and be a cause of intussusception in the adults.",

Here we present histochemical evidence that human and murine melanomas are extensively infiltrated by abundant mast cells. Because mast cells contain the natural anticoagulant heparin, the present studies were aimed at defining the role of mast cell heparin in preventing the blood from clotting within B16 melanoma grafts in C57BL/6 J mice. Mice bearing B16 melanoma grafts were treated with non-specific or specific inhibitors of mast cell heparin (protamine or heparinase, respectively). After the drug treatment there was histologic and functional evidence of selective thrombosis of the blood vessels within the protamine and heparinase treated melanoma grafts. A similar, high degree of thrombosis was also observed in B16 tumors grown in transgenic NDST-2 knockout mice bearing a targeted disruption in the gene coding for mast cell heparin synthesis. The tumors grown in the protamine-treated animals were significantly smaller than the tumors from control (untreated mice). By contrast, the tumors treated with heparinase or grown in the NDST-2 knockout mice were significantly larger than the tumors from control (untreated) mice. We conclude that the intrinsic procoagulant properties of malignant melanoma are neutralized in vivo by the anticoagulant properties of endogenous heparin produced by mast cells that naturally infiltrate the tumor. Our results also suggest that thrombosis and hemostasis within melanoma may play a complex role in modulating the growth of the tumor.",

Almost all melanocytes displaying PD-L1 expression were observed to be adjacent to TILs, irrespective of BRAF status. TIL(-) lesions were not more likely to be associated with BRAFmut, when compared with TIL(+) lesions. Baseline expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cell lines was virtually nil, regardless of BRAFmut status, and the intensity of IFN-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cell lines likewise did not correlate with BRAF mutational status.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (fraction F); subsequently the phagocytic and adherent cells were removed and the supernating cell population (fraction fff) was passaged through IgG anti-IgG columns to obtain a B cell free lymphocyte suspension (fraction fff-c). cells from the 3 lymphocyte fractions and from defibrinated whole blood were simultaneously tested for cytotoxic activity against unsensitized IGR3 target cells (SCMC assay) and IGR3 cells perviously sensitized with a rabbit anti-melanoma IgG (ADCC assay). Dose-response curves were established with all lymphocyte fractions and with whole blood. The following results were obtained. 1. With all lymphocyte fractions tested, ADCC was approximately 15 time higher than SCMC, whereas with whole blood, the difference tended to be less pronounced. 2. Elimination of phagoctic and adherent cells had no significant effect on SCMC and ADCC. 3. Passage over IgG anti-IgG columns drastically reduced cytotoxicity in both assays without, however, completely abolishing it. 4. The only difference seen between lymphocyte cytotoxicity of melanoma patients and control persons was a slight, but non-significant depression of SCMC and ADCC in melanoma patients. The results confirm and extend our previous report that SCMC against an allogeneic tumor cell-line is due to not-specific \"Null\" or \"K\" cell-activity rather than to specific T cell cytotoxicity.

We found that injecting GM-DCs into melanoma tumors in mice, or culturing GM-DCs with melanoma-secreted cytokines or melanoma-conditioned medium, rapidly suppressed DC-intrinsic expression of the gene encoding inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2), a transcriptional regulator. Melanoma-associated cytokines repressed Id2 transcription in murine DCs through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Enforced expression of ID2 in GM-DCs (ID2-GM-DCs) suppressed their production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Vaccination with ID2-GM-DCs slowed the progression of melanoma tumors and enhanced animal survival, which was associated with an increased abundance of tumor-infiltrating interferon-γ-positive CD4(+) effector and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and a decreased number of tumor-infiltrating regulatory CD4(+) T cells. The efficacy of the ID2-GM-DC vaccine was improved by combinatorial treatment with a blocking antibody to programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a current immunotherapy that overcomes suppressive immune checkpoint signaling. Collectively, our data reveal a previously unrecognized STAT3-mediated immunosuppressive mechanism in DCs and indicate that DC-intrinsic ID2 promotes tumor immunity by modulating tumor-associated CD4(+) T cell responses. Thus, inhibiting STAT3 or overexpressing ID2 selectively in DCs may improve the efficiency of DC vaccines in cancer therapy. ",

Patients with nodular melanoma and complete follow-up information were included. Lymphatic vessels were immunostained with the LYVE-1 and Podoplanin antibodies, and LVD was evaluated in both intra- and peri-tumoral (LVDpt) areas. Median LVD was 6.3 and 12.5 vessels/mm(2) in intra- and peri-tumoral areas, and coexpression of LYVE-1 and Ki-67/MIB-1 in lymphatic endothelial cells within the tumor was demonstrated, indicating active but low-grade lymphangiogenesis. Increased LVDpt was significantly associated with localization on the extremities (P = 0.005), decreased tumor thickness (P = 0.036), absence of vascular invasion (P = 0.004), brisk lymphocytic infiltration (P = 0.018), low proliferative rate by Ki-67 (P = 0.011), increased bFGF expression in tumor cells (P = 0.01) as well as in endothelial cells (P = 0.008), and decreased tumor cell expression of Ephrin-A1 (P = 0.009). Decreased LVD in intra-tumoral areas and LVDpt both predicted improved survival rates in multivariate analyses (for LVDpt, Hazard ratio: 2.1, P = 0.009). We found that decreased LVD was present in thicker and more proliferative tumors (Ki-67) and that increased LVD was significantly associated with improved patient survival in multivariate analysis.

Mutant T-cells from peripheral blood were obtained as clonal isolates or in mass cultures in the presence of 6-thioguanine (TG) selection and from tumor-bearing lymph nodes (LNs) or metastatic melanoma tissues by TG-selected mass cultures. Nonmutant (wild-type) cells were obtained from all sites by analogous means, but without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains (TCR-beta), determined directly (clonal isolates) or following insertion into plasmids (mass cultures), were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality of mature T-cell clones. Clonal amplifications, identified as repetitive TCR-beta V-region, complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and J-region gene sequences, were demonstrated at all sites studied, that is, peripheral blood, LNs, and metastatic tumors. Amplifications were significantly enriched among the mutant compared with the wild-type T-cell fractions. Importantly, T-cell trafficking was manifested by identical TCR-beta cDNA sequences, including the hypervariable CDR3 motifs, being found in both blood and tissues in individual patients.

Adoptive transfer of peritoneal B-1 CCR5(+/+) lymphocytes to CCR5(-/-) animals inhibited the establishment of lung metastasis and melanoma cell growth, in comparison to saline-treated CCR5(-/-) mice. In loco cell analysis demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of B-1 CCR5(+/+) lymphocytes to CCR5 deficient host was associated with a more intense influx of T CD8(+) to tumor site, indicating that the presence of CCR5(+/+) B-1 cells in the tumor environment induces the migration of T CD8 CCR5(-/-) cells to the implantation site. To corroborate this idea, CCR5(-/-) mice were injected with non B-1 peritoneal cells from wild type (WT) mice before B16F10 inoculation. In this regimen, CCR5(-/-) mice were not protected from tumor growth reinforcing the idea that, in host absence of CCR5, B-1 cells are essential to confer tumor resistance.

SEB activation studies were performed with pulmonary tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from 10-day established CL62 tumors. Maximal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cytotoxicity was demonstrated 24 h following SEB injection, therefore bsAb treatments were administered 24 h after SEB. When survival was examined at 60 days, there were significantly more survivors in the group receiving SEB plus bsAb (70%) compared to the group receiving SEB alone (30%), and the controls (0%) (P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). Mice cured of CL62 using SEB alone or with bsAb demonstrated equal immunity to CL62, however, mice treated with SEB plus bsAb were more often immune to the p97-parental cell line, K1735(P = 0.001).

All IFNs revealed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on melanoma cells with the highest growth inhibition caused by IFN-beta. Proliferation was also inhibited by interleukin (IL) 1-alpha and -beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. For IL-4, both growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory properties have been reported. Cellular differentiation in terms of melanin synthesis, formation of dendritelike structures, and antigenic changes was not affected by IFN-alpha or -beta. IFN-gamma, however, induced a more dedifferentiated and biologically more aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells. Histocompatibility antigen (HLA) class I molecules were found upregulated by all IFNs and by TNF-alpha, associated with a marked increase of melanoma cell lysis by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in vitro. HLA class II molecules were de novo expressed or enhanced by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The adhesion molecules ICAM-1, LFA-3, and VLA-2 were upregulated by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-beta, whereas melanoma-associated antigens were hardly affected by cytokines. It seems that both antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects may contribute to the antitumoral activity of cytokines in vivo. In vivo application of cytokines as well as combinations with cytotoxic drugs, therefore, may be promising for future treatment strategies.",

This in vitro study was undertaken to examine the initial events in the cellular immune response that may occur following the administration of the gamma IFN-transduced cell vaccine. Human melanoma tumor cell lines were transduced with a MoMLV-based retroviral vector carrying the human gamma IFN gene. The transduced cells expressed the cytokine gene, secreted biologically active gamma IFN, and exhibited enhanced expression of MHC class I and class II (HLA-DR), and ICAM-1 surface antigens. The gamma IFN-transduced and corresponding parental melanoma cells were used for the induction of short-term lymphocyte cultures. Peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymph node cells from 20 melanoma patients were stimulated for 5 to 15 days with autologous or MHC class I-matched allogeneic parental or gamma IFN-transduced melanoma cells. Seven of the 20 lymphocyte cultures showed substantial increases in lytic activity following stimulation with the transduced melanoma cells in comparison to control lymphocyte cultures stimulated with unmodified parental melanoma. The cytolytic activity stimulated with gamma IFN-modified melanomas was mediated partly by MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and partly by NK cells. Lymphocyte cultures that displayed increases in cytotoxicity after stimulation with the gamma IFN-transduced melanoma cells also exhibited enhanced expression or induction of one or more of the following lymphokines: IL-4, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, gamma IFN, and TNF-alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The effector cells should, therefore, not only exert cytotoxic activity but also home to and infiltrate the tumor site. Hence, monitoring of immune modulating therapies should not be restricted to the circulating pool of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but also include tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), as well as the correlation of these findings to the clinical course. We report here on the longitudinal immunologic workup of a melanoma patient who developed remarkably potent ex vivo detectable antimelanoma cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses after vaccinations with autologous peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Such potent CTL responses to multiple tumor antigens have, to the best of our knowledge, not been described previously in melanoma patients, neither spontaneously nor after any therapy. This patient first experienced a transient response to therapy but finally succumbed to disease progression and died. Progression was associated with the decline of the numbers of tumor-reactive T cells in circulation and at skin metastases in addition to the loss of MHC class I antigens. The immunologic analysis revealed that fully functional tumor-specific T cells were present in the peripheral blood of this patient during the phase of a relatively stable disease, and in situ tetramer staining demonstrated that these cells were also accumulated at cutaneous and visceral tumor sites. Furthermore, comparative clonotype mapping of PBMC and TIL depicted an overlapping TCR repertoire usage among these 2 compartments. Since strong CTL responses as observed in this patient are the goal of cancer vaccination but are so far only rarely observed, the thorough analysis of patients exhibiting either exceptional clinical and/or immunologic responses appears critical to understanding how vaccine therapies work and can be further improved.",

To be successful, this approach depends on the existence of a suppressed immune response against the tumor that can be released by the treatment or alternatively needs to be combined with an immune-enhancing therapy. A tumor-targeted superantigen (TTS) fusion protein utilizes the strong T-cell activating property of bacterial superantigens in concert with the tumor cell binding capacity in antitumor Fab-fragments. Our purpose was to investigate the feasibility of combining anti-CTLA-4 with TTS therapy against the poorly immunogenic B16 mouse melanoma tumor transfected with the human tumor-associated antigen EpCAM recognized by the C215 monoclonal antibody. B16-EpCAM tumors growing in the lung were completely insensitive to anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy. C215Fab-SEA treatment of the B16-EpCAM tumors induced strong infiltration and targeting of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In parallel, Foxp3(+)CTLA-4(high) regulatory T cells accumulated in the tumors. Combining activation with C215Fab-SEA and anti-CTLA-4 showed greatly enhanced antitumor effects and prolonged long-term survival. In parallel, when the expansion of regulatory T cells was inhibited, the number of specific effector T cells was enhanced and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was significantly improved. Collectively, these data emphasize the potential of combining cancer treatment using anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies with T-cell activation and directed killing by TTS therapy.",

BL6 clones expressing transfected H-2Kb class I molecules were, by contrast, highly immunogenic in immunocompetent mice. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) generated from the H-2Kb+ BL6 lesions (Thy 1.2+, CD8+, CD4-) efficiently lysed H-2Kb+ melanoma (CL8-1 and 2Kb38) and the H-2Kb+ nonrelated 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-105 sarcoma, but not the H-2Kb- parental melanoma BL6-8. This strongly suggests that CL8-1, 2Kb38, and MCA-105 express identical or cross-reactive T cell epitopes recognized by CL8-1 TILs in the context of the H-2Kb class I allele. To identify the T cell epitopes, peptides were acid-eluted from various cells, and fractionated by HPLC. Five HPLC fractions (F1mel-F5mel) of 70 tested contained peptides derived from H-2Kb+ CL8-1 melanoma (but not H-2Kb- melanomas) that were capable of conferring susceptibility to CL8-1 TIL lysis on H-2b-expressing target cells (EL4, C1R.Kb), but not on H-2d-expressing P815 target cells. CL8-1 TILs failed to recognize peptides derived from H-2Kb+ nonmelanoma targets such as EL4 or normal B6 splenocytes. Interestingly, CL8-1 TILs appeared to recognize peptide species contained in two HPLC fractions derived from the MCA-105 sarcoma (F1sar and F5sar). Conversely, TILs derived from MCA-105 lesions recognized MCA-105 and CL8-1 tumor cells, as well as F5mel and F5sar peptides presented by EL4 targets.

The melanoma cell lines studied were designated FM3, FM6, FM9, FM28, FM37, FM45, FM55p, FM55M1 and FM55M2 and were established from eight metastatic tumors as well as from one primary tumor from a total of seven different patients. On the basis of the ability of tumor cells to induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in mixed lymphocyte/tumor culture with HLA-A2+ melanoma cells, the FM3 cell line was characterized as highly immunogenic. To investigate the expression of different melanoma-associated antigens recognized by CTL on different melanoma cell lines, we selected the cell line FM3 for restimulation and further T cell cloning experiments. The lytic activity of CTL clones with good proliferative activity was examined using a panel of HLA-A2+ and HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines. None of the tested HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were susceptible to lysis by the CTL clones, whereas allogeneic HLA-A2+ melanoma cell lines were lysed only by a few CTL clones. On the basis of their reactivity with different melanoma cell lines, it was possible to divide the present CTL clones into at least four groups suggesting the recognition of at least four different antigens. Three of these target structures probably are different from already-described HLA-A2-restricted melanoma-associated antigens, because their expression in the different melanoma cell lines do not correlate with the recognition of melanoma cells by these CTL.

To study the role of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in tumor immunity and autoimmunity, we generated mice that bear a T-cell receptor transgene (TCR Tg) specific for the TRP-2(180-188) epitope. TRP-2 TCR Tg mice did not spontaneously develop depigmentation despite systemic expression of TRP-2 in the skin. Peripheral T cells from these TCR Tg mice exhibited a naive phenotype and proliferated in response to TRP-2 in vitro. In addition, transfer of in vitro-activated Tg T cells reduced B16 pulmonary tumor burden, but not subcutaneous tumors. We next sought to determine the in vivo responses of the Tg T cells to endogenous and tumor-derived TRP-2. Adoptive transfer of naive TCR Tg T cells into wild-type C57BL/6 mice, in combination with a TRP-2-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine, induced proliferation of the Tg T cells and resulted in migration of the Tg T cells into a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor. Although these tumor-infiltrating Tg T cells remained reactive against TRP-2, they did not reduce growth of the primary subcutaneous tumor; similarly, these in vivo-primed effector cells had no significant effect on the growth of pulmonary nodules. These data demonstrate that despite in vivo priming, tumor-infiltrating T cells may fail to reduce tumor burden.

Since relationships have been observed between development of autoimmunity and responsiveness of melanoma to several types of immunotherapy, we tested whether polymorphisms of IRF5 are associated with responsiveness of melanoma to adoptive therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).;140 TILs were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10954213, rs11770589, rs6953165, rs2004640) and one insertion-deletion in the IRF5 gene by sequencing. Gene-expression profile of the TILs, 112 parental melanoma metastases (MM) and 9 cell lines derived from some metastases were assessed by Affymetrix Human Gene ST 1.0 array.;Lack of A allele in rs10954213 (G > A) was associated with non-response (p < 0.005). Other polymorphisms in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs10954213 demonstrated similar trends. Genes differentially expressed in vitro between cell lines carrying or not the A allele could be applied to the transcriptional profile of 112 melanoma metastases to predict their responsiveness to therapy, suggesting that IRF5 genotype may influence immune responsiveness by affecting the intrinsic biology of melanoma.;This study is the first to analyze associations between melanoma immune responsiveness and IRF5 polymorphism. The results support a common genetic basis which may underline the development of autoimmunity and melanoma immune responsiveness.",

The main defect of blood NK cells was a decreased expression of activating NCR1/NKp46 receptor and a positive correlation of NKp46 expression with disease outcome in stage IV melanoma patients was found. In addition, in stage III melanoma patients, we identified a new subset of mature NK cells in macro-metastatic Lymph nodes (LN). In the present studies, we evaluated the numbers of NK cells infiltrating primary cutaneous melanoma and analyzed immune cell subsets in a series of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). First, we show that NKp46+ NK cells infiltrate primary cutaneous melanoma. Their numbers were related to age of patients and not to Breslow thickness. Then, a series of patients with tumor-negative or -positive sentinel lymph nodes matched for Breslow thickness of the cutaneous melanoma was constituted. We investigated the distribution of macrophages (CD68), endothelial cells, NK cells, granzyme B positive (GrzB+) cells and CD8+ T cells in the SLN. Negative SLN (SLN-) were characterized by frequent adipose involution and follicular hyperplasia compared to positive SLN (SLN+). High densities of macrophages and endothelial cells (CD34), prominent in SLN+, infiltrate SLN and may reflect a tumor favorable microenvironment. Few but similar numbers of NK and GrzB+ cells were found in SLN- and SLN+: NK cells and GrzB+ cells were not correlated. Numerous CD8+ T cells infiltrated SLN with a trend for higher numbers in SLN-. Moreover, CD8+ T cells and GrzB+ cells correlated in SLN- not in SLN+. We also observed that the numbers of CD8+ T cells negatively correlated with endothelial cells in SLN-.

Peptide A is a vaccine we have developed by screening a phage display peptide library on BAT monoclonal antibody. Anti-tumor activity was obtained in mice inoculated with B16 melanoma by either a single injection with BAT or immunization with peptide A. The aim of this study was to follow and compare histopathologically the process of prevention of melanoma metastases in lungs of treated and immunized mice. Mice were sacrificed on different days after tumor inoculation, their lungs were weighed and the number of metastases was counted. The lungs were then fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological examination of tumor inoculated mice on day 10 revealed the existence of microscopic melanoma lesions (0.01-0.012 mm) that increased gradually in number and size and on day 21, most of the metastases were large and spanned entire lobes, from the pleura to the hilum, measuring up to 3.5 mm and coexisting with scattered, small metastases showing the same morphology and pattern of lung involvement. On day 24, the lungs of untreated mice were massively infiltrated by coalescing metastases replacing up to 50% of the lung tissue and measuring up to 7.0 mm. The number of lung metastases and weight was dramatically decreased by a single injection of BAT monoclonal antibody ten days post tumor inoculation. The treated mice clearly had fewer and smaller metastases in different mice at the different days post tumor inoculation. On day 21, there were few small metastases measuring up to 1.6 mm and on day 24 no lung metastases were detected in this group that appeared with a completely normal lung structure. Immunization with peptide A started one day post tumor inoculation and was compared to immunization with control peptide N. Fourteen days post tumor inoculation, mice immunized with peptide A had only 1-2 metastases (0.012-0.076 mm) and on day 24 ranged up to 2 mm compared to control immunized mice where the tumor developed up to 5-7 mm. Foci of lung inflammation in both the untreated, treated or immunized mice were rare, small, and not preferentially associated with the lung metastases. They were composed mainly of small lymphocytes and a few macrophages.

Elegant genetic manipulation of the mouse immune system has proved this tenet. In parallel, progress in understanding human T cell mediated immunity has allowed to document the existence in cancer patients of naturally acquired T cell responses to molecularly defined tumor antigens. Various attributes of cutaneous melanoma tumors, notably their adaptability to in vitro tissue culture conditions, have contributed to convert this tumor in the prototype for studies of human antitumor immune responses. As a consequence, the first human cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL)-defined tumor antigen and numerous others have been identified using lymphocyte material from patients bearing this tumor, detailed analyses of specific T cell responses have been reported and a relatively large number of clinical trials of vaccination have been performed in the last 15 years. Thus, the \"melanoma model\" continues to provide valuable insights to guide the development of clinically effective cancer therapies based on the recruitment of the immune system.

Rational design of checkpoint combinations considers immune-mediated mechanisms of antitumor activity: immunogenic cell death, antigen release and presentation, activation of T-cell responses, lymphocytic infiltration into tumors and depletion of immunosuppression. Potential synergistic combinations include checkpoint blockade with conventional (radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies) and newer immunotherapies (cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, among others).

Efforts to define the cytoarchitecture of the angiogenic response and to ascertain molecular determinants of polarized endothelial migration have been impeded by lack of sensitive and specific immunologic markers for endothelium and vessel wall components. In this study, we utilized monoclonal antibody to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), a cell-cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, to determine extent and patterns of angiogenesis in metastatic melanomas before (N = 7) and after (N = 3) induction of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte responses provoked by administration of experimental melanoma vaccine. PECAM-1 proved to be a more reliable marker for angiogenesis than antibodies to von Willebrand Factor. Although both normal and tumor vessels exhibited prominent staining for PECAM-1, different patterns of endothelial reactivity were observed. Formation of new vessels was associated with i) PECAM-1 redistribution from a constitutive circumferential membrane pattern to a pattern restricted to cell-cell junctions; ii) formation of endothelial cords formed by cell-cell interactions; and iii) eventual development of open lumens. Vessels within inflamed (vaccine-treated) and non-inflamed melanomas did not differ with regard to patterns of PECAM-1 expression. Forming vessels of inflamed melanomas failed to express the cytokine-inducible activation marker, E-selectin. Although normal microvessels and reactive vessels of healing wounds demonstrated prominent staining for alpha 6 laminin receptor, vessels within melanomas showed apparently diminished expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This clone, which represented three of eight independently derived clones from a tumor deposit on the skin of the abdomen, also represented two of eight clones derived from a skin lesion on the shoulder. This clone could be identified by its use of a unique TCRBV2-nD1n-J1S6 sequence, and could also be detected by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) as the dominant TCRBV2-expressing clone among CD8+ TILs propagated from both shoulder and abdominal lesions. Using SSCP analysis, we also demonstrated that this clone was dominant in the fresh tumor tissue and in all TILs in which CD8+ were strongly represented, including several separate but parallel cultures. The SSCP pattern for this clone was not apparent among CD4+ TILs or CD8+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The SSCP analysis of the tumor tissue prior to in vitro culture is an indication that the selection for this anti-tumor cytotoxic T cell clone was a reflection of its in vivo accumulation. Thus, we provide evidence that melanomas are immunogenic and able to select for cytotoxic antitumor-specific TIL clones that are expanded in vivo and can circulate to accumulate in different tumor sites. However, because these clones were isolated from progressing tumor metastases, the accumulation of these specific cytotoxic T cells was not sufficient to contain tumor growth.",

Using syngeneic mouse models of breast cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer, we found that tumors grew slowly and were poorly metastatic in MerTK-/- mice. Transplantation of MerTK-/- bone marrow, but not wild-type bone marrow, into lethally irradiated MMTV-PyVmT mice (a model of metastatic breast cancer) decreased tumor growth and altered cytokine production by tumor CD11b+ cells. Although MerTK expression was not required for tumor infiltration by leukocytes, MerTK-/- leukocytes exhibited lower tumor cell-induced expression of wound healing cytokines, e.g., IL-10 and growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), and enhanced expression of acute inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-12 and IL-6. Intratumoral CD8+ T lymphocyte numbers were higher and lymphocyte proliferation was increased in tumor-bearing MerTK-/- mice compared with tumor-bearing wild-type mice. Antibody-mediated CD8+ T lymphocyte depletion restored tumor growth in MerTK-/- mice. These data demonstrate that MerTK signaling in tumor-associated CD11b+ leukocytes promotes tumor growth by dampening acute inflammatory cytokines while inducing wound healing cytokines.

To better characterize the host immune response, we have classified TIL by their immunoreactivity against lymphoid markers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and TIA-1 (a granule-associated protein of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells) were used to immunostain a series of benign nevi, nontumorigenic radial growth phase, and tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas and metastases. Among nine nevi, few LCA+ TIL were found, among which rare cells were positive for TIA-1 (mean, 2.0). Five nontumorigenic radial growth phase melanomas also had few total TIL and rare TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 3.4); the nontumorigenic radial growth phase component of seven tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas had higher numbers of TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 11). Twelve cases of tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanoma showed a variable but significantly greater number of both LCA+ TIL and TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 30.6). Nine cases of metastatic melanoma had a wide range of variation in LCA as well as in TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 46). Although the mean total number of TIA-1+ TIL increased from nontumorigenic radial growth phase to tumorigenic vertical growth phase to metastases, TIA-1+ as a percentage of TIL declined across these categories of tumor progression (42%, 31%, and 26%, respectively). Our results show that these attributes of TIA-1+ TIL, both increasing total number but decreasing percentage, appear to be a marker of tumor progression of malignant melanomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"In order to understand how tumor cells can escape immune surveillance mechanisms and thus develop antitumor therapies, it is critically important to investigate the mechanisms by which the immune system interacts with the tumor microenvironment. In our current study, wild-type mice were inoculated with melanoma cell line B16-F10 (1 × 10(6)/mouse) and treated with the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonist WKYMVm or the FPR antagonist WRW(4). Growth of melanoma cell line B16-F10 was significantly inhibited in WKYMVm-treated mice and markedly promoted in WRW(4)-treated mice compared with control. Decreased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increased NK cell infiltration in tumor tissues were detected from WKYMVm-treated mice. Next, we showed that depletion of NK cell significantly increased tumor development in B16 tumor-bearing mice compared with the control group, and the suppressed tumor-developing effect of WKYMVm in B16 melanoma was abrogated with NK cell depletion. We also found that WKYMVm stimulates chemotactic migration in NK cells via the FPR family, and this was dependent on extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation. Moreover, in our further experiment, we showed that the increased infiltration of NK cell and promoted NK cell chemotaxis in B16 melanoma induced by WKYMVm were both abolished with ERK inhibitor PD98059 administration. In conclusion, the FPR family promoted NK cell migration through ERK activation and inhibited B16 melanoma growth in a murine model. ",

However, it is not known whether tumor Ags can drive in vivo a selective accumulation/expansion of Ag-specific, tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL). Therefore, to evaluate this possibility, 39 CTL clones isolated from several independent mixed lymphocyte tumor cultures (MLTC) of TIL and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of an HLA-A2+ melanoma patient and selected for T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent, HLA-restricted tumor lysis, were used for analysis of TCR alpha and beta chain structure by the cDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with variable gene-specific primers followed by sequencing. Despite absence of oligoclonality in fresh TIL and PBL, as well as in T cells of day 28 MLTC (day of cloning), sequence analysis of TCR alpha and beta chains of TIL clones revealed a dominance of a major category of melanoma-specific, HLA-A2-restricted T cells expressing a V alpha 8.2/J alpha AP511/C alpha and V beta 2.1/D beta 1/J beta 1.1/C beta 1 TCR. The same TCR was also found in 2 out of 14 PBL clones. The other PBL clones employed a V alpha 2.1 gene segment associated with either V beta 13.2, 14, or w22. Clones A81 (V alpha 2.1/J alpha IGRJ alpha 04/C alpha and V beta 14/D beta 1/J beta 1.2/C beta 1) and A21 (V alpha 8.2/J alpha AP511/C alpha and V beta 2.1/D beta 1/J beta 1.1/C beta 1), representative of the two most frequent TCR of PBL and TIL, respectively, expressed different lytic patterns, but both were HLA-A2 restricted and lysed only HLA-A2+ melanomas and normal melanocytes, thus indicating recognition of two distinct HLA-A2-associated and tissue-related Ags. Finally, by the inverse PCR technique, the specific TCR beta chain (V beta 2.1/D beta 1/J beta 1.1/C beta 1) expressed by the dominant TIL clone was found to represent 19 and 18.4% of all V beta 2 sequences expressed in the fresh tumor sample and in the purified TIL, respectively, but < 0.19% of V beta 2+ sequences expressed in PBL.

Some of the target antigens for those T cells have been isolated using cDNA expression cloning with melanoma reactive T cells derived from lymphocytes tumor infiltrating (TIL) of patients with melanoma. These include melanocyte specific proteins, such as tyrosinase, TRP1, TRP2, gp100, and MART-1, cancer-testis antigens, and mutated peptides derived from genetic alterations in melanoma cells. Some of the melanoma reactive T cells appear to respond to cryptic or subdominant self epitopes in melanosomal proteins. Modification of those epitopes to increase their immunogenicity by replacement of amino acids at primary anchor residues for peptide/MHC binding, allowed an improvement in immunotherapy for patients with melanoma. Targets for autoreactive T cells against melanocytes in those autoimmune disorders remain to be identified. Isolation of novel target antigens is important for understanding these pathological T cell responses, as well as for developing new diagnostic and treatment methods for these diseases. A variety of techniques, including cDNA expression cloning with T cells, serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX), cDNA subtraction with representational differential analysis (RDA), and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) are now being applied to identify novel melanoma/melanocyte antigens recognized by T cells and antibodies.",

PBLs, TILs, and DLNs were cultured in RPMI 1640 + 10% human AB serum, 20% LAK cell culture supernatant, and 1,000 u/ml of recombinant interleukin-2. Half of each culture was restimulated with irradiated autologous tumor every 14 days. In all groups, tumor feeding enhanced lymphocyte proliferation, although TILs and DLNs consistently proliferated longer and more rapidly than PBLs. Eight of 10 early cultures of TILs and DLNs contained greater or equal proportions of CD8+ cells compared with CD4+ cells, but in long-term cultures an inversion of that ratio was seen (CD4+ greater than CD8+). In short-term chromium release assays, specific lysis of autologous tumor was seen in tumor-fed TILs and DLNs from one patient with melanoma, DLNs from one patient with breast cancer, and TILs from one patient with lung cancer. Other cultures had nonspecific lytic activity. Specific cytotoxicity against autologous tumor sometimes became apparent only after prolonged culture and repeated restimulation with autologous tumor.

After transduction, greater than 50% gene transfer efficiency was demonstrated in primary T-lymphocytes stimulated by an anti-CD3 antibody. The specificity and biologic activity of TCR gene-transduced T-cells was determined by cytokine production after coculture of T-cells with stimulator cells pulsed with MART-1 peptide. The production of interferon-gamma and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was comparable to highly active MART-1 specific peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in the amount of cytokine produced and transduced cells recognized peptide pulsed cells at dilutions similar to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I restricted recognition was demonstrated by mobilization of degranulation marker CD107a, by cell lysis, by cytokine production, and by proliferation in the presence of HLA-A2-positive but not HLA-A2-negative melanoma cell lines.

CTLA-4 is expressed on naïve T cells and regulatory T cells. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, shows a distinct durable clinical benefit by inhibiting the immunosuppressive function of CTLA-4. PD-1, which is expressed on activated T cells, inhibits T cell responses against tumor cells. The antibodies against PD-1, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, produce anti-tumor responses in melanoma and other cancers due to T cell reactivation. Furthermore, clinical trials of combination therapies using immune checkpoint blockades with molecularly targeted therapies and other chemotherapeutic agents are being conducted. However, immune checkpoint blockades frequently cause immune-related adverse events.

Renewed optimism for the therapeutic potential of immune therapy is currently driven by key advances in tumor immunobiology, including the potential to manipulate and disrupt immune activation checkpoints and tumor defense mechanisms; newer approaches to antigen presentation for immune activation; refinements to procedures for antigen-specific T-cell expansions in vitro and preparative regimens to support their expansion and activity in vivo; gene transfer to alter lymphocyte specificity and function; and the potential for discovery of improved predictive biomarkers to select patients for individual treatments. Proof of concept is provided by durable remissions observed in patients with advanced melanoma enrolled in clinical trials of anti-CTLA-4 and in new studies of adoptively transferred tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes combined with lymphocyte ablation conditioning regimens.

In this study, we investigated whether these processes can be promoted by s.c. administration of low-dose (0.5 microg/kg) recombinant human interleukin-12 (rHuIL-12) to metastatic melanoma patients. A striking burst of HLA-restricted CTL precursors (CTLp) directed to autologous tumor was documented in peripheral blood by a high-efficiency limiting dilution analysis technique within a few days after rHuIL-12 injection. A similar burst in peripheral CTLp frequency was observed even when looking at response to a single tumor-derived peptide, as documented by an increase in Melan-A/Mart-1(27-35)-specific CTLp in two HLA-A*0201+ patients by limiting dilution analysis and by staining peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with HLA-A*0201-melanoma antigen-A/melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Melan-A/Mart)-1 tetrameric complexes. The CTLp burst was associated, in PBLs, with enhanced expression of T-cell adhesion/homing receptors CD11a/CD18, CD49d, CD44, and with increased proportion of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)-positive T cells. This was matched by a marked increase, in serum, of soluble forms of the endothelial cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM)-1. Infiltration of neoplastic tissue by CDS+ T cells with a memory and cytolytic phenotype was found by immunohistochemistry in eight of eight posttreatment metastatic lesions but not in five of five pretreatment metastatic lesions from three patients. Increased tumor necrosis and/or fibrosis were also found in several posttherapy lesions of two of three patients in comparison with pretherapy metastases. These results provide the first evidence that rHuIL-12 can boost the frequency of circulating antitumor CTLp in tumor patients, enhances expression of ligand receptor pairs contributing to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/ICAM-1, very late antigen-4/VCAM-1, and CLA/E-selectin adhesion pathways, and promotes infiltration of neoplastic lesions by CD8+ memory T cells in a clinical setting.",

Activation of dendritic cells, another prerequisite for the effective activation of naïve tumor-specific T cells, was achieved by the addition of immunostimulatory cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) into the tumor site. Intratumoral administration of SLC-Fc or CpG-ODN revealed antitumor effects against B16F10 murine melanoma grown in the subcutaneous space. Co-treatment of SLC-Fc and CpG-ODN displayed synergistic effects in reducing the tumor size. The synergistic antitumor effect in co-treatment group was correlated with the synergistic/additive increase in the infiltration of CD4(+) T cells and CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the tumor mass compared to the single treatment groups.

However, IL-2 is not normally synthesized by solid tumor cells. This study was aimed at exploring the possible presence of T-cell mitogens of tumor origin. To this end four TIL lines derived from four melanoma patients were studied for their ability to use the environments of cultured tumor cell lines as mitogenic sources. The presence of four irradiated cultured human tumor cell lines, three of which were derived from the same melanoma patients as the TILs, were found to stimulate proliferation of human TILs in the absence of IL-2. Further investigation showed that the observed proliferative stimulation by the fourth tumor line was due to secreted factor(s) as mitogenic activity was present in the serum-free tumor cell supernatant.

We have recently shown that cytokine release by TIL is another indicator of the specific interaction with autologous tumor. To determine if recognition of shared melanoma Ag can also induce cytokine release, seven melanoma TIL, which lysed autologous tumor, were co-cultured with autologous tumor or with 7-12 HLA-matched or unmatched melanoma stimulators for 6-24 h. Supernatants were collected and assayed by ELISA for the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-6. Among five of six melanoma TIL for which autologous tumor was available, autologous melanoma cells stimulated specific release of at least one of three cytokines: GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Neither IL-4 nor IL-6 secretion by three TIL cultures tested was enhanced upon contact with tumor. For six of seven TIL cultures, HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas also stimulated significant cytokine release; HLA-A1, -A2, -A24, -B8, and -Cw7 were identified as possible restriction elements. The cytokine secretion induced by both autologous and allogeneic HLA-matched melanomas could be blocked by an anti-MHC I antibody.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes of a melanoma patient (AV) were activated in an autologous-mixed-lymphocyte tumor culture (AMLTC) and responding cells were cloned using irradiated autologous melanoma cells (AV-Mel) as antigen source, EBV-transformed B-lymphoblasts as feeder cells and recombinant Interleukin 2. T-cell clones were isolated which proliferated in response to autologous tumor cells, but not to autologous B-lymphoblasts (AV-B), and which were cytolytic for AV-Mel cells. In an attempt to identify the antigens recognized, an in vitro test system was used, in which 3H-Thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation by T lymphocytes was measured in the presence of protein from AV-Mel cells presented by irradiated autologous accessory cells. Antigen-bearing particles of AV-Mel or AV-B cells were prepared by spotting cell lysates onto nitrocellulose (NC) followed by dissolution with DMSO and precipitation with an aqueous buffer. T cells sensitized against autologous melanoma cells were specifically stimulated by NC-bound AV-Mel protein. Stimulation required the presence of AV-B accessory cells, indicating that B-lymphoblasts are able to present tumor antigens. This approach facilitates screening of polypeptide fractions of AV-Mel cells separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting for their capacity to stimulate antigen-dependent T-cells. CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific clones appear to recognize different antigens on the tumor cell: proliferation of an antigen-dependent CD8+ clone was stimulated by 240- and 24-kDa protein fractions, while proliferation of 2 antigen-dependent CD4+ clones was observed either with an 84- or with 140- and 55-kDa fractions.

Although major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted human CD4(+) T cells with specific antitumor reactivities have been described, no standard method exists for cloning the recognized tumor-associated antigen (Ag). In this study, biochemical protein purification methods were used in conjunction with novel mass spectrometry sequencing techniques and molecular cloning to isolate a unique melanoma Ag recognized by a CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) line. The HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted Ag was determined to be a mutated glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). A C to T mutation identified by cDNA sequencing caused a Thr to Ile conversion in TPI, which could be detected in a tryptic digest of tumor-derived TPI by mass spectrometry. The Thr to Ile conversion created a neoepitope whose T cell stimulatory activity was enhanced at least 5 logs compared with the wild-type peptide. Analysis of T cell recognition of serially truncated peptides suggested that the mutated amino acid residue was a T cell receptor contact.

Treatment of melanoma cells with TNFalpha and IL-1alpha in vitro enhanced the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to a lesser degree, in human melanoma cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human monocytes enhanced production of IL-8, VEGF, TNF alpha, as well as IL-1alpha, but not bFGF. Co-culture of human monocytes and human melanoma cells was also found to significantly enhance production of IL-8 and VEGF in the absence and presence of LPS, compared with either monocytes or melanoma cells alone. The production of IL-8 and VEGF from co-cultured melanoma cells and LPS-activated monocytes was blocked when anti-TNF-alpha antibody or anti-IL-1alpha antibody was co-administrated.

Age groups were defined as ≤45 (young), 46-65 (intermediate), and >65 (older). Each age group in the IMCG and TCGA cohorts was stratified by tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) measurements and tested for association with MSS. Differential expression of 594 immunoregulatory genes was assessed in a subset of primary melanomas in the IMCG and TCGA cohorts using an integrative pathway analysis.;We analyzed 304, 476 (SEER), 1241 (IMCG), and 292 (TCGA) patients. Increasing age at melanoma diagnosis in both the SEER and IMCG cohorts demonstrated a positive correlation with tumor thickness, ulceration, stage, and mortality, however age in the TCGA cohort did not correlate with mortality. Older age was associated with shorter MSS in all three cohorts. When the young age group in both the IMCG and TCGA cohorts was stratified by TIL status, there were no differences in MSS. However, older IMCG patients with brisk TILs and intermediate aged TCGA patients with high lymphocyte scores (3-6) had improved MSS. Gene expression analysis revealed top pathways (T cell trafficking, communication, and differentiation) and top upstream regulators (CD3, CD28, IFNG, and STAT3) that significantly changed with age in 84 IMCG and 43 TCGA primary melanomas.;Older age at time of melanoma diagnosis is associated with shorter MSS, however age's association with clinicopathologic features is dependent upon specific characteristics of the study population. TIL as a read-out of the host immune response may have greater prognostic impact in patients older than age 45. Recognition of age-related factors negatively impacting host immune responses may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for the elderly.",

CD8+ T cells were responsible for the activity of B16 melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The in vivo depletion of NK cells with anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), prior to B16-immunization, significantly decreased the capacity of the spleen cells (s.c.) to generate B16-specific CTL after in vitro restimulation. However, the CD8+ T cells of the s.c. from NK cell-depleted and subsequently B16-immunized mice increased their potential to become B16-specific CTL compared with those from the B16-immunized mice. The tumor-infiltrating NK cells showed a low but significant degree of CTL activity against B16. In addition, the disrupted B16 melanoma cells demonstrated less of an ability to in vivo prime the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings thus suggest the possibility that the quick disruption of tumor cells by tumor-infiltrating NK cells consequently interfered with the in vivo priming of the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, the CD4+ T cells of the s.c. from NK cell-depleted and subsequently B16-immunized mice showed less of a capacity to induce the tumor-specific CTL compared with those from B16-immunized mice. In addition, the delayed-type hypersensitivity response against B16 was significantly diminished by the in vivo depletion of NK cells prior to B16-immunization.

However, the relationship between KIT and melanoma histology remains uncharacterized, and its role in melanoma pathogenesis unknown. We evaluated 70 melanomas from 70 patients seen at a single institution from 1997 to 2008. Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Mutational analyses for KIT exons 9 and 11, and BRAF were performed on cases with 3+ labeling. Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage. There is a strong correlation to hyperpigmentation that overrides factors including sun damage, tumor location, and histologic subtype, which may be used to identify cases with KIT aberrations.",

Tumor angiogenesis depends on the release of angiogenic growth factors by tumor cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, and from the extracellular matrix following degradation by tumor proteases. Human melanoma progresses through different steps: nevocellular nevi, dysplastic nevi, in situ melanoma, radial growth phase melanoma (Breslow index < or = 0.75 mm), vertical growth phase melanoma (Breslow index > 0.75 mm), and metastatic melanoma. In agreement with progression, it acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing proportion of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall. Hence, both phenomena favour tumour cell extravasation and metastases. Melanocytic cells produce and release Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), mainly in the steps of dysplastic nevus and melanoma in vertical growth phase. Melanoma cells also secrete the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), in parallel with the switch from the radial to the vertical growth phase and the metastatic phase.

This TIL was found to recognize HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes in tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-2 (clone MR7) and NY-ESO-1 (clone M8). These epitopes were the same as the previously identified nonapeptide TRP-2: 180-188, and the overlapping NY-ESO-1 peptides, obtained by using lymphocytes from in vitro stimulation. We also cloned a previously unknown TRP-2 mRNA isoform (TRP-2-6b) that contained two novel exons alternatively spliced from the sixth intron between exons 6 and 7 of TRP-2 mRNA. The isoform encoded an HLA-A2-restricted antigenic epitope recognized by TIL clone MB4. An immunologic analysis of the patient's PBMC obtained before treatment showed the presence of high reactivity against NY-ESO-1 and both TRP-2 Ags, but not the Ags used for immunization. Because immune response against these Ags was less pronounced, it is possible that NY-ESO-1, TRP-2, and TRP-2-6b may be of importance in the generation of CTL-mediated tumor destruction and may have played a role in the dramatic tumor regression seen in this patient.",

Gangliosides were added exogenously to lymphocytes grown in the presence of IL-2. Preferential interactions of specific melanoma gangliosides on IL-2 stimulation were found. While GM2 and GD2 enhanced the lymphocyte response to IL-2, GM3 and GD3 significantly inhibited this response. GM2 and GD2 differ from GM3 and GD3 by the presence of a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine.

To elucidate the role of HLA class II expression in the immunopathogenesis of melanoma, the authors compared HLA class II+ melanoma cells to autologous B cells with respect to their ability to stimulate primary (naïve) histoincompatible lymphocytes and T-cell clones (antigen experienced). Using primary lymphocytes (peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBLs]), melanoma cells were nonstimulatory when compared to autologous B cells. To determine whether this was caused by defective antigen processing, the authors used alloreactive T-cell clones, which require alloantigen presentation by a histocompatible stimulator cell but not costimulation. Melanoma cells stimulated the alloreactive T-cell clones in two of three clones tested, indicating that they processed and presented alloantigen. To determine whether the failure of melanoma cells to stimulate primary lymphocytes was caused by their inability to costimulate the T cells, the authors transduced the melanoma cells with B7.1 and achieved stable expression in more than 95% of the cells. The transduced cells were highly stimulatory, eliciting a 17- to 25-fold increase in proliferation by the peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with controls. Indeed, B7-expressing melanoma cells were more stimulatory than autologous B cells, which elicited an 11- to 15-fold increase compared with controls. These data indicate that melanoma cells fail to stimulate primary lymphocytes because they do not deliver costimulatory signals.

Here, we used the ret transgenic spontaneous murine melanoma model that mimics human melanoma. Skin tumors and metastatic lymph nodes showed increased levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ, which correlated with tumor progression. Moreover, Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), known to inhibit tumor reactive T cells, were enriched in melanoma lesions and lymphatic organs during tumor progression. MDSC infiltration was associated with a strong TCR ζ-chain down-regulation in all T cells. Coculturing normal splenocytes with tumor-derived MDSC induced a decreased T-cell proliferation and ζ-chain expression, verifying the MDSC immunosuppressive function and suggesting that the tumor inflammatory microenvironment supports MDSC recruitment and immunosuppressive activity. Indeed, upon manipulation of the melanoma microenvironment with the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil, we observed reduced levels of numerous inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, VEGF, S100A9) in association with decreased MDSC amounts and immunosuppressive function, indicating an antiinflammatory effect of sildenafil. This led to a partial restoration of ζ-chain expression in T cells and to a significantly increased survival of tumor-bearing mice. CD8 T-cell depletion resulted in an abrogation of sildenafil beneficial outcome, suggesting the involvement of MDSC and CD8 T cells in the observed therapeutic effects.

In the presence of TIL, concomitant regression was associated with significantly worse survival (p ≤ 0.0001). In the absence of TIL, there was no effect of regression on survival (p = 0.324).;Primary TIL and regression status and RND status are independently associated with melanoma-specific survival in patients with T4 melanomas; presence of TIL in the primary melanoma with concomitant radial growth phase regression is associated with a poor prognosis and may reflect an ineffective local regional immune response.",

Although cDNAs encoding the previously identified melanoma Ags, tyrosinase and gp100, were isolated, these TIL were found to recognize previously unidentified peptides. An HLA-A1-restricted CTL, TIL1388, was found to recognize a tyrosinase peptide (SSDYVIPIGTY), and an HLA-A3-restricted CTL, TIL1351, recognized a gp100 peptide (LIYRRRLMK). CTL clones isolated from the HLA-A2-restricted TIL1383 recognized a gp100 peptide (RLMKQDFSV). HLA-A2-restricted CTL, TIL1200, recognized a gp100 peptide (RLPRIFCSC). Replacement of either cysteine residue with alpha-amino butyric acid in the gp100 peptide, RLPRIFCSC, enhanced CTL recognition, suggesting that the peptide epitope naturally presented on the tumor cell surface may contain reduced cysteine residues. Oxidation of these cysteines might have occurred during the course of the synthesis or pulsing of the peptide in culture. These modifications may have important implications for the development of efficient peptide-based vaccines.

Its microscopic picture is characterized by atypical \"neuroma-like\" patterns of Schwann cells and spindle cells, by poorly defined margins, and by neurotropism. Lentigo malignant melanoma (LMM) is a precursory lesion. The neurotropic melanoma is of particular interest to the head and neck surgeon because in the less than 50 reported cases of this rare tumor the preponderant sites were head, neck, and lip.

Significant DNA uptake but low gene expression were found in the M-3 melanoma while no DNA uptake and no gene expression were found in KB, 518A2, A549, and SW480 xenograft tumor models. To elucidate the reasons for these differences, the tumors were analyzed for vascularization and infiltration of macrophages. Neuro2a, Huh-7, and HepG2 tumors are well vascularized, with a high density of partially immature blood vessels and low numbers of infiltrating macrophages. The M-3 melanoma is well vascularized correlating with significant DNA uptake, however, necrosis and intensive infiltration by macrophages lead to rapid degradation of DNA. In contrast, the KB, 518A2, A549, and SW480 tumors are poorly vascularized, correlating with undetectable DNA uptake and gene expression.

The T cell responses to the vaccines show correlation with the tumor regressions. The local immunosuppression may be the cause of the lack of vaccination effectiveness that is observed in most patients.

Malignant transformation proceeds in a stepwise manner from multiple melanocytic nevi to single nodular melanomas and disseminated metastases in most mice. Migrating melanoma cells invade the draining lymph nodes without activating the immune system. Autochthonous primary tumors are destroyed following experimental introduction of immune surveillance using an adoptive lymphocyte transfer approach. However, some tumor cells are able to survive, evade immune cell control, and recur both locally and systemically.

We investigated the safety and ability to bestow gene expression via intratumoral transfer of escalating amounts of lipid-formulated plasmid DNA encoding for the MHC HLA-B7 gene product Allovectin-7 into metastatic renal cancer lesions. Fifteen patients with histologically confirmed, HLA-B7-negative metastatic renal cancer received intratumoral injection of Allovectin-7 on an escalating dose schedule. Tumors were evaluated serially by computed tomography scan, ultrasound, and physical examination. Presence of the HLA-B7 gene and protein was determined via PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical staining in serial biopsy specimens.

Three patients had tumor biopsy to assess the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and all three had higher posttreatment levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. There were no significant clinical responses or toxicity at the site of injection or at other, noninjected tumor sites. This study demonstrated that intratumoral injection of Allovectin-7 is safe, feasible, and associated with minimal toxicity. This approach was capable of bestowing gene expression, possible resulting in antitumor CTL response.

In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of transducing human tumor cells with genes coding for gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) or alpha-interferon (IFN alpha), which are two other cytokines that can enhance host antitumor immune responses. Tumor cells from 12 melanoma and 2 renal cell carcinoma patients were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the gene for IFN gamma. Northern blot analysis showed IFN gamma transcripts only in the IFN gamma gene-transduced cells. In both IFN gamma-secreting and non-secreting tumor lines, the cell surface expression of HLA class I and class II molecules increased following transduction. However, the magnitude of the increase in HLA expression appeared to be greater in tumor lines secreting IFN gamma. Two melanoma cell lines were successfully transduced with an IFN alpha retroviral vector. Melanoma cells transduced with the IFN alpha gene contained IFN alpha RNA transcripts and secreted large amounts of IFN alpha. In contrast to cells transduced with the IFN gamma gene, the expression of HLA class II molecules was not increased in the IFN alpha gene-transduced cells. Finally, we tested the ability of HLA.DR+ melanoma cells, which had been transduced with the IFN gamma gene, to stimulate specific cytokine release by autologous CD4+ TIL. Specific secretion of cytokine by TIL occurred when the TIL and IFN gamma gene-transduced tumor cells were cultured together but not when TIL were cultured alone or with control nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that molecules newly expressed on the transduced cells promoted antigen presentation and T-cell responses against the transduced tumor cells. The insertion of the IFN gamma gene into melanoma cells may be useful either for active immunization against melanoma or for the generation of TIL to be used in adoptive immunotherapy.",

To understand the molecular basis of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity, several groups started to search for such tumor antigens in melanoma as well as in other types of cancers. This led to the subject I will review in this article. A number of tumor antigens were isolated by the use of cDNA expression systems and biochemical approaches. These tumor antigens could be classified into several categories: tissue-specific differentiation antigens, tumor-specific shared antigens, and tumor-specific unique antigens. However, the majority of tumor antigens identified to date are nonmutated, self proteins. This raises important questions regarding the mechanism of antitumor activity and autoimmune disease. The identification of human tumor rejection antigens provides new opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies against cancer. This review will summarize the current status and progress toward identifying human tumor antigens and their potential applications to cancer treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Several antigens, including the products encoded by the genes MAGE-1 and MAGE-3, are recognized on human melanoma cells by HLA-A1, HLA-A2, or HLA-Cw*1601*-restricted T cells on autologous or HLA-matched melanoma cell lines. T-cell recognition of naturally processed MHC class I-presented peptides, or alternatively synthetic peptides derived from MAGE-1 or MAGE-3, leads to cytokine release as well as to a cytotoxic T-cell response in these antimelanoma-directed polyclonal or clonal effector T-cell populations. Recent reports suggest that the activity of T lymphocytes infiltrating melanoma in vivo appears to be impaired. We report here the characterization of the in vitro (in the presence of 6000 IU interleukin 2) expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) T-cell line PM2-B2 derived from a patient with rapidly progressing and therapy-resistant head and neck melanoma. The TIL cell line PM2-B2 did not lyse, but instead released granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to the autologous tumor or HLA-A1-matched allogeneic tumor cell lines. The TIL line PM2-B2 did not kill the MHC class I natural killer/lymphokine-activated killer target cell lines Daudi or K562. The fine specificity of the TIL line PM2-B2 restricted by HLA-A1 was further characterized by evaluating specific granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor release in response to MHC class I-eluted peptides derived from HLA-A1(+) melanoma cell lines. TIL PM2-B2 failed to recognize the recently described HLA-A1-presented peptides derived from the gene products encoded by MAGE-1 or MAGE-3. PCR-based analysis of the freshly harvested tumor from patient PM2-B2 revealed the presence of message for the melanoma-associated gene products MAGE-1 and MAGE-3, but not for tyrosinase or MART-1/MELAN-A. Acid elution and high performance liquid chromatography fractionation of MHC class I-presented peptides from HLA-A1-matched melanoma cell lines 397 or 888 revealed that TIL PM2-B2 recognized at least three distinct peptide epitopes eluting in high performance liquid chromatographic bioactive fractions 5/6, 36, and 51/52. These bioactive peaks appeared to be shared among HLA-A1(+) melanoma cell lines. We suggest, based on this report, that HLA-A1-presented melanoma-derived peptides (other than those previously reported peptides derived from MAGE-1 or MAGE-3) may represent targets for TIL recognition as defined by cytokine release, but not cytotoxicity. Such an immune response differentially defined by cytokine release, but absent cytotoxic functions, may either reflect the impaired cytolytic function of the TIL population or reflect the inherent nature of HLA-A1-presented melanoma T-cell epitopes leading to cytokine release, but not to a cytotoxic T-cell response. Additionally, this report suggests that the individual T-cell immune response to melanoma may be rather complex, involving diverse T-cell effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity or cytokine release), each of which should be evaluated in studies of antitumor-specific T-cell reactivity.",

Nonetheless, methods currently used for ex vivo TIL expansion have not been evaluated for their efficacy to expand TAA-specific T cells. We have addressed this question here, using a culture method in which high TIL growth was induced by a polyclonal T cell stimulus. Intracellular cytokine assays were performed to measure the proportion of T cells responding to autologous tumor cells among the lymphocytes from lymph node biopsies (TIL) of 26 patients with stage III melanoma. The data show that TIL from 18 of these patients contained detectable amounts of tumor-specific T cells before expansion. Although they decreased somewhat in percent abundance during expansion, they were still present afterwards, ranging from 0.3 to 13.8%. Since a median number of 1.7 x 10(10) TIL was obtained from these patients (starting from 3.6 x 10(6) TIL), a total amount of tumor-reactive cytokine-secreting TIL of between 2.8 x 10(6) and 1.12 x 10(9) was obtained in each case from 18 patients. The TIL populations from 8 patients did not contain tumor-reactive T cells: neither before expansion, nor after expansion. Lack of tumor-reactive TIL only occurs for patients bearing several tumor-invaded lymph nodes (40%), but not for those having a single invaded lymph node. Therefore, high numbers of tumor-reactive T cells can be produced, through a polyclonal TIL stimulation, from most early stage III melanoma patients but from only about half of the patients with a more disseminated disease. For this last group, the possibility of getting tumor-reactive TIL can be predicted by checking the presence of these cells before expansion.",

Moreover, CD8⁺ TILs from patients exhibited downregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD226, which competes with TIGIT for the same ligand, supporting a TIGIT/CD226 imbalance in metastatic melanoma. TIGIT marked early T cell activation and was further upregulated by T cells upon PD-1 blockade and in dysfunctional PD-1⁺TIM-3⁺ TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells.

In addition, immunization of mice with K1735-ICAM-1 transfectants induced protective immunity against the parental ICAM-1-negative tumor.

As the CD70-CD27 costimulatory axis plays an important role in the activation, survival, and differentiation of lymphocytes, we have examined the efficacy of agonistic anti-CD27 antibodies as monotherapies for established melanoma in a murine model. We show that this approach leads to a substantial reduction in the outgrowth of both experimental lung metastases and subcutaneous tumors. Anti-CD27 treatment supports the maintenance of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells within the tumor, reduces the frequency of FoxP3-expressing CD4(+) T cells within tumors, and potentiates the ability of NK1.1(+) and CD8(+) tumor infiltrating cells to secrete IFNγ upon coculture with tumor cells. The enhanced effector function correlated with lower levels of PD-1 expression on CD8(+) T cells from anti-CD27-treated mice. Despite the modulating effect of anti-CD27 on multiple cell types, only CD8(+) T cells were absolutely required for tumor control. The CD4(+) T cells were dispensable, whereas NK1.1(+) cells were needed during early stages of tumor growth but not for the effectiveness of anti-CD27. Thus, CD27-mediated costimulation provides a potent boost to multiple aspects of the endogenous responses to tumor, and may be exploited to enhance tumor immunity.",

In recent clinical trials, however, immune responses against melanoma antigens have been elicited without consistent clinical responses, suggesting the need for approaches that potentiate the specific cellular immune response. Since B lymphocytes have been reported to exert a negative effect on the cellular arm of the immune response in certain model systems, the authors compared the protective immunity elicited by melanoma antigens in B cell-deficient microMT mice to that obtained in fully immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Immunization with melanoma-associated antigens was accomplished using recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vectors encoding human gp100 (Ad2/gp100) or murine TRP-2 (Ad2/mTRP-2). A single dose of Ad2/gp100 or Ad2/mTRP-2 inhibited the growth of established subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumors in B cell-deficient but not wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced tumor protection observed in B cell-deficient mice appeared to be associated with potentiation of the magnitude and longevity of the specific cellular immune response. Natural killer (NK) cells were also found to be essential to the protective immune response in microMT mice because NK cell depletion with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody resulted in both the loss of tumor growth suppression and attenuation of the specific cellular immune response. The authors conclude that the protective cell-mediated immunity provoked by Ad-based cancer vaccines is enhanced in the absence of B cells, suggesting that a therapeutic regimen that includes depletion of B lymphocytes may be beneficial to cancer vaccine therapy.",

Splenocyte cytotoxicity assays against B16 melanoma cells [as cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity] and P815 cells [as natural killer (NK) activity] were performed. IL-10 and interferon-γ concentrations were measured. An in vivo subcutaneous B16 melanoma growth model was performed in B6 mice and treated with iPSC-conditioned medium. The lymphocyte subpopulation depletion test was performed to determine effectors against B16 melanoma cells. We found that unstimulated splenocytes had little cytotoxic activity. Without tumor cells, mIL-2 could augment iPSC-conditioned medium-treated CTL and NK activities (P<0.01). With irradiated tumor cells, mIL-2 treatment of splenocytes could not enhance CTL or NK activity, but iPSC-conditioned medium could enhance CTL and NK activity (P<0.001). Irradiated tumor cells induced mice splenocytes to secrete more IL-10, similar to mIL-2 treatment, but not iPSC-conditioned medium treatment. mIL-2 had better efficacy than conditioned medium in inducing splenocyte interferon-γ production. The CTL and NK cell depletion test showed that the immunostimulating effect of iPSC-conditioned medium on splenocytes was through the enhancement of NK cellular activity (P<0.05). The subcutaneous melanoma growth model showed that B16-bearing mice treated with an iPSC-conditioned medium intraperitoneal injection had a decreased tumor growth rate (P<0.01).

Logistic regression and classification tree analyses were used to investigate the association between SLN positivity and Breslow thickness, Clark level, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), ulceration, mitotic rate (MR), lesion site, gender, and age. RESULTS.: In all, 88 of the 682 patients had > or =1 positive SLN (12.9%). In the multivariate analysis, MR, TIL, and thickness were found to be independent prognostic factors for SLN positivity. In the classification tree, four different risk groups were defined, ranging from minimal risk (2.1%) to high risk (40.4%). In lesions < r =2.0 mm, MR was important in risk-stratifying patients, and in lesions >2.0 mm TIL was important.;By incorporating biologically based variables such as VGP, TIL, and MR along with thickness into a prognostic model, both patients at high risk and minimal risk for SLN positivity can be identified.

Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient. By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system, we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer, which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells.",

Strong adhesion receptor expression was noted on vessels within adjacent tissue. Tumor-associated T lymphocytes accumulate preferentially in these adjacent areas and are not enriched for skin- or lymph node-homing receptor phenotype.;Expression of leukocyte homing receptors is dysregulated on the vasculature of metastatic melanoma. This results in a block to recruitment of activated tumor-specific CTL to melanoma metastases and is a likely factor limiting the effectiveness of current immunotherapy protocols.",

Significant lysis of the tumor cells was observed with a fraction of these microcultures, whereas no lysis was observed with control microcultures seeded without stimulator melanoma cells. Because our aim was to measure the precursor frequency of CTL showing specificity for the tumor, and not that of NK-like effectors that were also capable of lysing the melanoma cells, we used cold-target inhibition with an excess of NK target K562 to inhibit the NK-like activity. Microcultures whose lysis on the tumor cells was not abolished by K562 competition were observed. The specificity of these CTL clones was confirmed by the absence of lytic activity on autologous T-cell blasts. The numbers of microcultures with anti-tumor CTL activity fitted the zero-order of the Poisson distribution equation, indicating that they resulted from the activity of single T-cell clones. The frequency of anti-tumor CTL precursor cells (CTL-P) of 7 melanoma patients ranged from 1/900 to 1/33,000.

Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. A primary cutaneous lesion was investigated. T cell repertoire analysis showed the in situ amplification of at least two tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) expressing the V beta 13 and V beta 16 variable TCR gene segments respectively. The two clones were precisely characterized by sequence of the TCR beta chain junctional region. Further functional study demonstrated that both lymphocytes displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. The V beta 16+ cells, predominant in vivo, were shown to be closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrated the existence of a local adaptative immune response associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept. A gastric metastasis which occurred three years after the primary lesion has been studied here. Overexpression of the V beta 13 and V beta 16 TCR segments was no longer detected by direct PCR analysis in situ. Sequencing transcripts from V beta 13+ and V beta 16+ TILs confirmed that the two CTLs, identified in the primary lesions, were not represented with high frequency. The V beta 13+ cell was however shown to be present while the V beta 16+ CTL was not detected. Yet, characterization of a tumor cell line derived from the gastric site indicated that the peptidic antigen(s) which induced the initially successfully immune response was still expressed. The present data illustrate that it has become possible to perform very precise analysis of local immune responses during cancer development. Such an improvement together with the recently initiated molecular characterization of tumor associated peptidic antigens, should provide the basis for improved strategies of cancer immunotherapy.",

In the present study we investigated whether CTL epitopes are present in anti-id mAb MF-11-30 and activate T cells to recognize HMW-MAA on melanoma cells. One candidate epitope in the mAb MF11-30 VH chain, VH (3-11), was selected based on the presence of HLA-A2 anchor residues and partial homology with the HMW-MAA epitope, HMW-MAA (76-84). Lymphocytes from HLA-A2(+)-immunized patients proliferated to VH (3-11) peptide and to a variant HMW-MAA peptide to a significantly greater extent than autologous lymphocytes stimulated with an irrelevant peptide and lymphocytes from nonimmunized patients.

T lymphocytes play a major role both in tumor immunity and autoimmunity. CD28, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and inducible costimulator (ICOS) molecules are important secondary signal molecules in the T lymphocyte activation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD28/CTLA4/ICOS gene region were reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases including, type-1 diabetes, SLE, autoimmune thyroid diseases and celiac disease. In this study, we investigated the association of SNPs in the CD28, CTLA4 and ICOS genes with the risk of melanoma. We also assessed the prognostic effect of the different polymorphisms in melanoma patients. Twenty-four tagging SNPs across the three genes and four additional SNPs were genotyped in a cohort of 763 German melanoma patients and 734 healthy German controls. Influence on prognosis was determined in 587 melanoma cases belonging to stage I or II of the disease. In general, no differences in genotype or allele frequencies were detected between melanoma patients and controls. However, the variant alleles for two polymorphisms in the CD28 gene were differentially distributed in cases and controls. Similarly no association of any polymorphism with prognosis, except for the rs3181098 polymorphism in the CD28 gene, was observed. In addition, individuals with AA genotype for rs11571323 polymorphism in the ICOS gene showed reduced overall survival. However, keeping in view the correction for multiple hypothesis testing our results suggest that the polymorphisms in the CD28, CTLA4 and ICOS genes at least do not modulate risk of melanoma and nor do those influence the disease prognosis in the investigated population.",

After fourteen and fifteen selections in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice sublines B16-B14b and B16-B15b, respectively, were established in culture. These were then assayed in vivo by injection of single tumor cell suspensions into the tail vein (i.v.), left ventricle of the heart (i.c.) or left common carotid artery (i.a.), and the resulting tumors were examined histologically. Injection of subline B16-B14b or B16-B15b resulted in brain meningeal tumor formation in the dura mater and leptomeninges with invasion into underlying brain parenchyma and also some brain ventricular tumors at the sites of i.a. injection. Lung colonization ability remained in the brain-selected sublines, although it was remarkably reduced in i.a. tumor cell-injected animals. The brain meningeal tumors that formed were of three types: intravascular, nodular or infiltrative. Injection of tumor cells i.v. resulted mainly in the establishment of the intravascular type of brain meningeal tumors with eventual perivascular invasion, while injection i.a. or i.c. resulted mostly in nodular or infiltrative type brain meningeal tumors. The B16-B14b brain meningeal tumors formed were small (less than 1 mm in diameter) and usually nonpigmented, while B16-B15b tumors were generally large (up to 7 mm in diameter) and pigmented.

We find that Fcγ receptors are required for efficacy, showing that antitumor activity of combination therapy is immune mediated. Rag1(-/-) mice deficient in adaptive immunity are able to clear tumors, and thus innate immunity is sufficient for efficacy. Furthermore, previously treated wild-type mice are not significantly protected against tumor reinduction, as compared with mice inoculated with irradiated B16 alone, consistent with a primarily innate immune mechanism of action of chemo-immunotherapy. In contrast, mice deficient in both classical natural killer (NK) lymphocytes and nonclassical innate lymphocytes (ILC) due to deletion of the IL2 receptor common gamma chain IL2γc(-/-)) are refractory to chemo-immunotherapy. Classical NK lymphocytes are not critical for treatment, as depletion of NK1.1⁺ cells does not impair antitumor effect. Depletion of CD90⁺NK1.1⁻ lymphocytes, however, both diminishes therapeutic benefit and decreases accumulation of macrophages within the tumor. Tumor clearance during combination chemo-immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against native antigen is mediated by the innate immune system.

We previously suggested that the immunogenicity of autologus tumor vaccines in humans may be augmented by engineering vaccinating tumor cell membranes to express alpha-galactosyl (alpha-gal) epitopes (i.e., Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc-R). Subsequent in situ binding of natural anti-Gal IgG molecules to these epitopes would result in the formation of immune complexes that target tumor vaccines for uptake by APCs, via the interaction of the Fc portion of anti-Gal with Fcgamma receptors on APCs. This hypothesis was tested in a unique experimental animal model of knockout mice for alpha1,3galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT) and the mouse melanoma B16-BL6 (referred to here as BL6). Like humans, these mice lack alpha-gal epitopes and produce anti-GaL BL6 melanoma cels are highly tumorigenic, and like human tumor cells, they lack alpha-gal epitopes. Expression of alpha-gal epitopes on these melanoma cells was achieved by stable transfection with alpha,3GT cDNA. The transfected melanoma cells (termed BL6alphaGT) express approximately 2 x 10(6) alpha-gal epitopes per cell and readily form immune complexes with anti-Gal. Vaccination of the mice with 2 x 10(6) irradiated melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes, followed by challenge with 0.5 x 10(6) live parental melanoma cells, resulted in protection for at least 2 months (i.e, no tumor growth) in one-third of the mice, whereas all mice immunized with irradiated parental melanoma cells developed tumors 21-26 days post-challenge. The proportion of protected mice doubled when the mice were immunized twice with irradiated melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes and challenged with 0.2 x 10(6) live BL6 cells. Histological studies on the developing tumors in challenged mice that were immunized with melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes demonstrated extensive infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages, whereas no mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in tumors of mice immunized with parental tumor cells. Overall, these studies imply that immunization of alpha1,3GT knockout mice with BL6 melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes elicits, in a proportion of the population, protective immune response against the same tumor lacking such epitopes. These studies further suggest that similar immunization of cancer patients with autologous tumor vaccines that are engineered to express alpha-gal epitopes may increase the immune response to autologous tumor-associated antigens and, thus, may elicit immune-mediated destruction of metastatic cells expressing these antigens.",

In vivo persistence and telomere length of the transferred cells correlate with antitumor response. In an attempt to prolong the in vivo survival of the transferred cells, TILs were genetically engineered to produce interleukin (IL)-2. In vitro, these transduced TILs secreted IL-2 while retaining tumor specificity and exhibited prolonged survival after IL-2 withdrawal. In a phase I/II clinical trial, seven evaluable patients received transduced TILs and one patient experienced a partial response associated with in vivo persistence of IL-2-transduced TILs in circulating lymphocytes. An additional five patients received transduced TILs in conjunction with IL-2 administration. Persistence of IL-2-transduced TILs was observed in three patients, including one partial responder. The transgene DNA as well as vector-derived IL2 mRNA could be detected for 4 months in responding patients. The low response rate in this trial was possibly due to a reduction in telomere length in cells as a result of prolonged in vitro culture. In this study, insertion of the IL-2 gene into antitumor TILs increased their ability to survive after IL-2 withdrawal in vitro but did not increase their in vivo persistence or clinical effectiveness.",

Hierarchical clustering analysis supported that melanoma metastases have a phylogenetically determined, rather than a stochastic, pattern of antigen expression that varies by anatomic site. Furthermore, tyrosinase expression was more frequently lost in metastatic sites outside of the brain and was uniquely correlated with both endogenous CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell infiltrates.;Site-specific antigen heterogeneity represents a novel attribute for human melanoma metastases that should be considered in future therapy development and when assessing the responsiveness to antigen-specific immunotherapies.",

Because autologous tumors are generally unavailable, an allogeneic choroidal melanoma cell line, OCM-1, was used as the specific stimulus. Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. To analyze this reactivity, sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to both ocular and cutaneous melanoma cells, and presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy.",

The aim of this paper is to update clinical results of 7 years of follow-up after the last treated patient. In the trial conducted between December 1993 and January 1999, patients without any detectable metastases after lymph node excision were randomly assigned to receive either TIL plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 months, or IL-2 only. The duration of the relapse-free interval was the primary objective. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Currently, the last analysis performed in June 2006, after a median follow-up of 114.8 months, did not show change of non-significant extension of the relapse-free interval or overall survival. However, this second analysis strengthens our first hypothesis about the relationship between number of invaded lymph nodes and TIL treatment effectiveness. In the group with only one invaded lymph node, the estimated relapse rate was significantly lower (P (adjusted) = 0.0219) and the overall survival was increased (P (adjusted) = 0.0125) in the TIL+IL-2 arm compared with the IL-2 only arm. No differences between the two arms, either with regard to the duration of disease-free survival (P (adjusted) = 0.38) or overall survival (P (adjusted) = 0.43), were noted in the group with more than one invaded lymph node, whatever the number of invaded lymph nodes. Treatment was compatible with normal daily activity. This study, with a very long follow up (median of almost 10 years), postulates for the first time relationship between TIL efficiency in stage III melanoma (AJCC) and number of invaded lymph nodes, indicating that tumor burden might be a crucial factor in the production of an effective in vitro expansion of T cells specific for autologous tumor antigen, a finding which could be of value in future vaccine development for the treatment of melanoma.",

In such a setting where numerous parameters appear to influence survival, a multifactorial analysis using Cox's regression model is a valuable statistical model. Using a computerized data base of 394 clinical stage I melanoma patients treated at this institution during the past 20 years, a multifactorial analysis was used to compare the relative prognostic strength of 11 parameters. Two pathological factors (tumor thickness and ulceration) and two clinial factors (initial surgical treatment and anatomic location) were identified as the dominant prognostic variables. Other factors examined simultaneously that did not provide additional predictive influence on survival included the level of invasion, pigmentation, growth pattern, lymphocyte infiltration, pathological state, sex, and age. Melanoma thickness was the most important factor for predicting survival in patients with stage I melanoma (P less than 10(-8). This parameter is easy to measure and provides a quantitative estimate of clinically occult regional and distant metastases. Contrary to other reports using single factor analysis, the type of initial surgical treatment, in fact, did influence survival after other variables were taken into consideration. Thus the multifactorial analysis supports the observation that patients with intermediate thickness melanoma thickness of 1.5 to 3.99 mm had a 78% 8-year survival rate with wide excision of the melanoma and elective node dissection, while none survived more than 8 years if a melanoma of the same thickness was only widely excised.

Some of the highest clinical response rates for metastatic melanoma have been reported in trials using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These protocols still have room for improvement and furthermore are currently only performed at a limited number of institutions. The goal of this work was to develop TILs as a therapeutic product at our institution.;TILs from 40 melanoma tissue specimens were expanded and characterized. Under optimized culture conditions, 72% of specimens yielded rapidly proliferating TILs as defined as at least one culture reaching ≥3×10(7) TILs within 4 weeks. Flow cytometric analyses showed that cultures were predominantly CD3+ T cells, with highly variable CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios. In total, 148 independent bulk TIL cultures were assayed for tumor reactivity. Thirty-four percent (50/148) exhibited tumor reactivity based on IFN-γ production and/or cytotoxic activity. Thirteen percent (19/148) showed specific cytotoxic activity but not IFN-γ production and only 1% (2/148) showed specific IFN-γ production but not cytotoxic activity. Further expansion of TILs using a 14-day \"rapid expansion protocol\" (REP) is required to induce a 500- to 2000-fold expansion of TILs in order to generate sufficient numbers of cells for current ACT protocols. Thirty-eight consecutive test REPs were performed with an average 1865-fold expansion (+/- 1034-fold) after 14 days.;TILs generally expanded efficiently and tumor reactivity could be detected in vitro.

In this study, we have analyzed the CD8+ T cell response of an ocular melanoma patient to a vaccine composed of four different tumor antigen-derived peptides administered simultaneously in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). Peptide NY-ESO-1(157-165) was remarkably immunogenic and induced a CD8+ T cell response detectable ex vivo at an early time point of the vaccination protocol. A CD8+ T cell response to the peptide analog Melan-A(26-35 A27L) was also detectable ex vivo at a later time point, whereas CD8+ T cells specific for peptide tyrosinase(368-376) were detected only after in vitro peptide stimulation. No detectable CD8+ T cell response to peptide gp100(457-466) was observed. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses declined rapidly after the initial response but increased again after further peptide injections. In addition, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated from a vaccine injection site biopsy sample. Importantly, vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells specifically lysed tumor cells expressing the corresponding antigen.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has emerged as a useful diagnostic tool to categorize these lesions, by identifying known chromosomal aberrations in malignant melanoma or the lack thereof in melanocytic nevi. However, determining a lesion's biological behavior primarily on CGH is limited by a relatively small series of corroborative cases without long term follow up. We present a case of a pigmented lesion on the right cheek of a 4 year old boy. The lesion had features of a deep penetrating nevus, but the presence of frequent mitoses, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and microscopic foci of tumor necrosis were concerning for an unusual melanoma. We termed this lesion a melanocytic tumor of uncertain potential (MELTUMP) for these reasons. High-resolution array-CGH performed elsewhere on the lesion demonstrated no melanoma-associated genomic abnormalities. A sentinel lymph node biopsy of this patient later revealed multiple small tumor deposits. Although the presence of nodal involvement in similar lesions often do not lead to progressive and fatal disease, this case illustrates that atypical melanocytic lesions with nodal involvement may not demonstrate genomic abnormalities by CGH, and that histopathologic assessment remains paramount in defining these difficult melanocytic lesions. Further comprehensive study of these lesions is needed.",

A major limitation of ACT is the inability to generate or expand autologous tumor-reactive TIL in 25-45 % of patients tested. Methods that successfully identify tumors that are not suitable for TIL generation by standard methods would eliminate the costs of fruitless expansion and enable these patients to receive alternate therapy immediately.;Multispectral fluorescent immunohistochemistry with a panel including CD3, CD8, FoxP3, CD163, PD-L1 was used to analyze the tumor microenvironment in 17 patients with melanoma among our 36-patient cohort to predict successful TIL generation. Additionally, we compared tumor fragments and enzymatic digestion of tumor samples for efficiency in generating tumor-reactive TIL.;Tumor-reactive TIL were generated from 21/36 (58 %) of melanomas and for 12/13 (92 %) tumors where both enzymatic and fragment methods were compared. TIL generation was successful in 10/13 enzymatic preparations and in 10/13 fragment cultures; combination of both methods resulted in successful generation of autologous tumor-reactive TIL in 12/13 patients. In 17 patients for whom tissue blocks were available, IHC analysis identified that while the presence of CD8(+) T cells alone was insufficient to predict successful TIL generation, the CD8(+) to FoxP3(+) ratio was predictive with a positive-predictive value (PPV) of 91 % and negative-predictive value (NPV) of 86 %. Incorporation of CD163+ macrophage numbers and CD8:PD-L1 ratio did not improve the PPV. However, the NPV could be improved to 100 % by including the ratio of CD8(+):PD-L1(+) expressing cells.;This is the first study to apply 7-color multispectral immunohistochemistry to analyze the immune environment of tumors from patients with melanoma. Assessment of the data using unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified tumors from which we were unable to generate TIL. If substantiated, this immune profile could be applied to select patients for TIL generation. Additionally, this biomarker profile may also indicate a pre-existing immune response, and serve as a predictive biomarker of patients who will respond to checkpoint blockade. We postulate that expanding the spectrum of inhibitory cells and molecules assessed using this technique could guide combination immunotherapy treatments and improve response rates.",

Despite the remarkable clinical efficacy and established involvement of effector CD8 T cells, the knowledge of the exact peptide-MHC complexes recognized by T cells on the tumor cell surface is limited. Many melanoma-associated T-cell epitopes have been described, but this knowledge remains largely restricted to HLA-A2, and we lack understanding of the T-cell recognition in the context of other HLA molecules. We selected six melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, gp100, Mart1, tyrosinase and TRP-2) that are frequently recognized in patients with the aim of identifying novel T-cell epitopes restricted to HLA-A1, -A3, -A11 and -B7. Using in silico prediction and in vitro confirmation, we identified 127 MHC ligands and analyzed the T-cell responses against these ligands via the MHC multimer-based enrichment of peripheral blood from 39 melanoma patients and 10 healthy donors. To dissect the T-cell reactivity against this large peptide library, we used combinatorial-encoded MHC multimers and observed the T-cell responses against 17 different peptide-MHC complexes in the patient group and four in the healthy donor group. We confirmed the processing and presentation of HLA-A3-restricted T-cell epitopes from tyrosinase (TQYESGSMDK) and gp100 (LIYRRRLMK) and an HLA-A11-restricted T-cell epitope from gp100 (AVGATKVPR) via the cytolytic T-cell recognition of melanoma cell lines and/or K562 cells expressing the appropriate antigen and HLA molecule.

Uveal melanoma cells expressed Fas but were insensitive to Fas triggering induced by bystander cytotoxic T lymphocytes or a Fas-specific agonistic antibody; this could not be ascribed to tumor counterattack against T cells or general resistance of the tumors to apoptosis. Treatment with inhibitors of metalloproteases rendered uveal melanomas sensitive to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. Metalloprotease inhibitors did not affect the expression of Fas but increased the surface expression of Fas ligand (FasL), which correlated with the disappearance of soluble FasL from culture supernatants of tumor cells. FasL eluted from the surface of uveal melanomas specifically inhibited cytotoxic T lymphocyte lysis of tumor cells pretreated with an inhibitor of metalloproteases. In addition to uveal melanomas, a number of other tumor cell lines of various cellular origins were sensitized to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity by metalloprotease inhibitors. Our results show that autocrine secretion of FasL shields tumor cells from Fas-mediated killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes. This defines a novel mechanism of tumor escape from immune surveillance.",

IL-4 production was not observed in culture either with medium alone or with IL-2 in any of the cells described above. Anti-CD3 mAb was required for IL-4 production in 3 of 12 IL-2-activated TIL, 2 of 6 CTL clones, and none of 5 noncytotoxic TIL clones. In summary, IFN gamma production was characteristic of melanoma TIL. Some autologous tumor-specific CTL in TIL are suggested to be productive of IL-2 and IFN gamma under unstimulated conditions, both being required for self-activation in an autocrine loop.",

Histopathological evaluation revealed a multinodular to packeted, poorly demarcated, unencapsulated, infiltrative exophytic melanocytic neoplasm composed of bundles and nests of plump spindloid to polygonal heavily pigmented epithelioid neoplastic cells interspersed with pigment-laden macrophages within a fine fibrovascular stroma. Upon examination after enucleation, neoplastic cells were found to infiltrate into the lateral cornea, sclera and the choroid. This is a unique case of an epibulbar melanoma with choroidal invasion in a foal. Based on the sudden onset and rapid growth as well as the histological evidence of invasion, well-differentiated features, heavy pigmentation, and no apparent mitoses, this neoplasm was considered to be a low-grade malignant melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Spontaneous regression of melanoma lesions is thought to be the result of an efficient immune response against melanoma cells in vivo. The outcome of immune responses is critically influenced by a complex network of interacting cytokines present in the local microenvironment. Analysis of cytokine gene transcription in melanoma lesions exhibiting or lacking a sufficient anti-tumor immune response thus may help to define cytokines or cytokine combinations critical to the development of this immune response. In the present study, we have investigated an extended panel of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes by reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in regressive and progressive primary human cutaneous melanoma samples. Whereas the presence of a lymphocyte infiltrate in tissue samples was associated with a TH1 cytokine mRNA profile (TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL12p35, IL12p40, IL2Rbeta, and IL2Rgamma), clinically and histologically regressive samples exhibited additionally increased transcript levels for GM-CSF, IL2, and IL15. mRNAs of TH2 cytokines IL4 and IL5 were detected only in a minor portion of progressive melanoma samples and regressive melanoma lesions. These results were further supported by comparison of progressive with regressive regions in three melanoma samples. Again, regressive regions contained higher transcript levels for GM-CSF, IL2, and IL15. In comparison to cutaneous metastatic melanoma lesions, regressive melanomas also overexpressed the same cytokine mRNA profile. These results provide evidence for an association of spontaneous regression with increased transcript levels for the cytokine combination GM-CSF, IL2, and IL15 in malignant melanoma. This cytokine combination could be relevant for experimental anti-tumor immune response studies and for immunotherapeutic and gene transfer studies in the treatment of melanoma patients.",

The blocking of CTLA-4 using human monoclonal antibodies, such as Ipilimumab, is currently used to relieve CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of anti-tumor immune response in metastatic melanoma. Herein, we have analyzed CTLA-4 expression and Ipilimumab reactivity on melanoma cell lines and tumor tissues from cutaneous melanoma patients. Then, we investigated whether Ipilimumab can trigger innate immunity in terms of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α release. Finally, a xenograft murine model was set up to determine in vivo the effects of Ipilimumab and NK cells on melanoma.;CTLA-4 expression and Ipilimumab reactivity were analyzed on 17 melanoma cell lines (14 primary and 3 long-term cell lines) by cytofluorimetry and on 33 melanoma tissues by immunohistochemistry. CTLA-4 transcripts were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Soluble CTLA-4 and TNF-α were tested by ELISA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), NK and γδT cells were tested in ADCC assay with Ipilimumab and melanoma cell lines. TNF-α release was analyzed in NK-melanoma cell co-cultures in the presence of ipilimumab. In vivo experiments of xenotransplantation were carried out in NOD/SCID mice. Results were analyzed using unpaired Student's t-test.;All melanoma cell lines expressed mRNA and cytoplasmic CTLA-4 but surface reactivity with Ipilimumab was quite heterogeneous. Accordingly, about 2/3 of melanoma specimens expressed CTLA-4 at different level of intensity.Ipilimumab triggered, via FcγReceptorIIIA (CD16), ex vivo NK cells as well as PBMC, IL-2 activated NK and γδT cells to ADCC of CTLA-4+ melanoma cells. No ADCC was detected upon interaction with CTLA-4- FO-1 melanoma cell line. TNF-α was released upon interaction of NK cells with CTLA-4+ melanoma cell lines. Remarkably, Ipilimumab neither affected proliferation and viability nor triggered ADCC of CTLA-4+ T lymphocytes. In a chimeric murine xenograft model, the co-engraftment of Ipilimumab-treated melanoma cells with human allogeneic NK cells delayed and significantly reduced tumor growth, as compared to mice receiving control xenografts.;Our studies demonstrate that Ipilimumab triggers effector lymphocytes to cytotoxicity and TNF-α release. These findings suggest that Ipilimumab, besides blocking CTLA-4, can directly activate the elimination of CTLA-4+ melanomas.",

The more melanoma-specific melanoma markers, MelanA/MART-1, HMB45, and tyrosinase, used in addition to S100 protein, all have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we evaluated 2 new melanoma markers, monoclonal antibodies KBA62 and PNL2 to yet unidentified antigens, using a large panel of metastatic melanomas (n=214), desmoplastic melanomas (n=34), gastrointestinal mucosal melanomas (n=54), benign nevi (n=27), clear cell sarcomas (n=16), and nonmelanocytic tumors (n=1218). Immunoreactivity for KBA62 and PNL2 was found in all pigmented nevi and in 86% and 90% of metastatic melanomas, respectively. Mucosal melanomas showed a similar rate of PNL2 immunoreactivity but somewhat less frequent KBA62 positivity (72%). In addition, KBA62 was found to be a sensitive diagnostic marker for desmoplastic melanoma (28 of 34; 82%), whereas PNL2 was only rarely positive (2 of 34; 6%). KBA62-positive normal tissues included pericytes, vascular and parenchymal smooth muscles, and basal cells of complex epithelia, including myoepithelia, whereas PNL2 labeled only melanocytes and neutrophils. Among nonmelanocytic tumors, those that were KBA62 positive were nodular fasciitis, leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, benign and malignant nerve sheath tumors, synovial sarcoma, and subsets of various carcinomas, especially those with squamous cell/stratified epithelial differentiation. PNL2 positivity in nonmelanocytic tumors was more restricted but occurred consistently in angiomyolipoma and other perivascular epitheloid cell tumor and in chronic myeloid leukemia tissue infiltrates. KBA62 may assist in the identification of desmoplastic melanomas, but its widespread occurrence in nonmelanomas limits utility. PNL2 is highly specific for melanomas but lacks reactivity with desmoplastic melanomas. It is also an excellent supplementary marker for perivascular epitheloid cell tumor at various sites.",

The pathway and prognosis of strong pigmentation of melanoma metastases in the SN is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pigmentation and growth pattern of metastases in the SN with respect to survival. A total of 389 patients underwent an SN procedure (1997-2011). Ninety-five patients had a positive SN and material from 75 patients was available for review. The median follow-up time was 75 months (range 6-164). Pigmentation was scored from 0 to 2 using the following scale: 0=absent, 1=slight, and 2=strong. Growth pattern was scored as either eccentric (1) or infiltrative (2). SN tumor burden was measured according to the Rotterdam criteria. The primary melanoma had a median Breslow thickness of 2.90 mm (0.8-12.00 mm). Ulceration was present in 34 patients (45.3%). There was a median SN tumor burden of 0.5 mm (0.05-7.00 mm). In a total of 75 patients, 59 patients (79%) had no pigmentation, 13 patients (17%) had slight pigmentation, and three patients (4%) had strong pigmentation in the SN. Because of the small numbers, the classification was modified to either absent 59 (79%) or present 16 (21%) pigmentation, respectively. The SN tumor burden was significantly higher (P=0.031) for patients with pigmentation. Patients with pigmentation had a 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) of 47% and a 10-year MSS of 33%. Patients without pigmentation had a 5-year MSS of 70% and a 10-year MSS of 59% (P=0.06). There was no difference in MSS for patients with an eccentric or an infiltrative growth pattern, nor did it correlate with other prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis for MSS showed five significant factors associated with worse prognosis: male sex (P=0.036), nodular melanoma (P=0.001), truncal site (P=0.0001), SN tumor burden more than 1.0 mm (P=0.022), and positive completion lymph node dissection (P=0.004). The 5-year MSS for SN tumor burden is 94% for 0.1 mm or less, 66% for 0.1-1.0 mm, and 41% for more than >1.0 mm (P<0.001). The 10-year MSS for SN tumor burden is, respectively, 94, 51, and 35% (P<0.001). This preliminary exploratory retrospective study showed that pigmentation within the SN seems to correlate with increased SN tumor burden. ",

In nonspecific immunotherapy, an unrelated antigen (eg, BCG or smallpox vaccine) is used to provoke an immunologic response that results in tumor destruction.

Using simplified versions of previously published grading systems, the agreement between TMA and whole slide sections ranged between 83 and 96%, and between 81 and 97% for inflammation and tumor cell markers, respectively.

To work under such conditions, a poorly tumorigenic human melanoma cell line was transfected with an expression vector encoding MCP-1. We found that M2 macrophages are associated to MCP-1+ tumors, triggering a profuse vascular network. To target the protumoral macrophages recruitment and reverting tumor growth promotion, clodronate-laden liposomes (Clod-Lip) or bindarit were administered to melanoma-bearing mice. Macrophage depletion after Clod-Lip treatment induced development of smaller tumors than in untreated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-CD31 antibody revealed scarce vascular structures mainly characterized by narrow vascular lights. Pharmacological inhibition of MCP-1 with bindarit also reduced tumor growth and macrophage recruitment, rendering necrotic tumor masses. We suggest that bindarit or Clod-Lip abrogates protumoral-associated macrophages in human melanoma xenografts and could be considered as complementary approaches to antiangiogenic therapy.",

The adhesive function of VAP-1 can be blocked by anti-VAP-1 Abs and small-molecule inhibitors. However, the effects of VAP-1 blockade on antitumor immunity and tumor progression are unknown. In this paper, we used anti-VAP-1 mAbs and small-molecule inhibitors of VAP-1 in B16 melanoma and EL-4 lymphoma tumor models in C57BL/6 mice. Leukocyte accumulation into tumors and neoangiogenesis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and intravital videomicroscopy. We found that both anti-VAP-1 Abs and VAP-1 inhibitors reduced the number of leukocytes in the tumors, but they targeted partially different leukocyte subpopulations. Anti-VAP-1 Abs selectively inhibited infiltration of CD8-positive lymphocytes into tumors and had no effect on accumulation of myeloid cells into tumors. In contrast, the VAP-1 inhibitors significantly reduced only the number of proangiogenic Gr-1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid cells in melanomas and lymphomas. Blocking of VAP-1 by either means left tumor homing of regulatory T cells and type 2 immune-suppressing monocytes/macrophages intact. Notably, VAP-1 inhibitors, but not anti-VAP-1 Abs, retarded the growth of melanomas and lymphomas and reduced tumor neoangiogenesis. The VAP-1 inhibitors also reduced the binding of Gr-1(+) myeloid cells to the tumor vasculature. We conclude that tumors use the catalytic activity of VAP-1 to recruit myeloid cells into tumors and to support tumor progression. Small-molecule VAP-1 inhibitors therefore might be a potential new tool for immunotherapy of tumors.",

Infiltration of T lymphocyte subsets and antigen presenting dendritic cells, crucial in mounting an efficient antitumor immune response, is generally associated with favorable prognosis. On the contrary, accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages, mast cells and neutrophils, playing important roles in chronic inflammatory processes promoting tumor progression, predicts unfavorable disease outcome in most cases. In melanoma, studies on the prognostic impact of the lymphoid infiltrate in general, and that of T cells, yielded controversial results. In our studies, density of activated T lymphocytes correlated with patients' survival, and we obtained similar results in the case of B cells and mature dendritic cells. The amount of both B cells and dendritic cells showed correlation with that of activated T lymphocytes, and their combined analysis identified patient subgroups with different prognosis. According to data from the literature, intense infiltration by neutrophil granulocytes could be associated with shorter survival, while no unambiguous conclusions can be drawn from studies on the prognostic value of tumor-associated macrophages and other immune cell types. Our results indicate that a prominent infiltration of dendritic cells, B cells and activated T lymphocytes can be considered as a favorable prognostic factor in malignant melanoma. ;A szolid daganatok szerves részét képezõ gazdaszervezeti sejtek, ezen belül a veleszületett és adaptív immunválasz létrehozásában közremûködõ sejtek pozitív és negatív hatást is gyakorolhatnak a betegség kimenetelére.

In this model, CTL migrated toward tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis. CTL migration was mediated by the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 expressed by the CTL and the CC chemokine ligand (CCL)2 secreted by the tumor cells, as evidenced by blockage of CTL migration by CCL2 or antibodies to CCL2 or CCR4. These results were confirmed in a Transwell migration assay in which the CTL actively migrated toward isolated CCL2 and migration was inhibited by anti-CCR4 antibody.

MLTC and TCRBV-selected lines recognized allogeneic melanomas sharing HLA-A and -B alleles with the autologous tumor, but only two of the HLA-A2-restricted lines were directed to a known peptide from melanoma-associated Ags. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis indicated a polyclonal composition of both MLTC and TCRBV-selected lines, but expansion of clonotypes with identical CDR3 length was observed only in the MLTC lines.

This effect was also seen when allogeneic CD8+ and CD4+ subpopulations were used as effectors. In these studies, activation of lymphocytes was B7-1-dependent and HLA classes I and II mediated. The higher proliferation correlated with an increased lytic activity by PBL stimulated with B7-1+ tumor cells against the untransfected Me1B6. Furthermore, PBL from a metastatic melanoma patient stimulated by Me1B6/B7 developed an higher lytic activity not only against Me1B6 but also against their autologous, B7-1- tumor. Finally, after Me1B6/B7 stimulation, PBL released interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-gamma, but not IL-4, suggesting a Th1-mediated response. These data support the use of B7-1 transfected melanoma cells in the therapeutic vaccination of melanoma patients.",

DMM has clinical as well as histological features that may be subtle and overlooked, or misdiagnosed as other benign or malignant lesions that would require less aggressive therapy for cure. We have reviewed the preliminary clinical diagnoses and histological features of 18 cases of desmoplastic malignant melanoma, defined as either an inapparent lesion clinically, or a papule or small nodule less than 0.7 cm, which proved histologically to be DMM. Nine of 18 cases (50%) were clinically pigmented. Histologically, early lesions were characterized by superficial tumor fascicles, and random diffuse hypercellularity in the upper dermis identified as elongated hyperchromatic pleomorphic spindle cells with stromal myxoid change. Neuroidal melanocytic structures, invasion of adventitial dermis, islands of inflammation, and epidermal lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia were often present. The most reliable and characteristic features of an early lesion of DMM are aggregates of lymphocytes, tumor cell cytological atypia, stromal myxoid change, and poor circumscription of the dermal infiltrate. DMM is a disease best treated by complete excision at the time of initial surgery, but is also a lesion easily missed or misdiagnosed in the early stages. Features of early DMM are identified and illustrated to enable early diagnosis and cure of these lesions.",

At B-scan and standardized A-scan echography, the mass was shown to be localized to the ciliary body, with characteristics of a malignant melanoma.

Therefore, enucleation was performed and light microscopy revealed a pigmented malignant melanoma of the ciliary body with extrascleral growth and infiltration of the anterior third of the corneal stroma. No alteration of Bowman's membrane was present. The corneal infiltration, limited to the anterior third of the stroma, could be due to the fact that at this level the collagen fibers are disposed less regularly than those of the posterior two-thirds, with this different disposition responsible for the weak resistance opposed to the tumoral invasion.",

In this regard, immunotherapies involving adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor-specific T-cells constitute a promising approach to treat melanoma. However, these cells do not always preexist in the patient or are difficult to isolate and/or expand. Thus, as the specificity of T-lymphocytes is determined by their T-cell receptor (TCR), it is possible to convert peripheral T-cells into cancer specific lymphocytes by transducing them to express a receptor that recognizes a defined tumor epitope. To this end, retroviral vectors can be used to efficiently transduce actively dividing cells such as proliferating T cells, while being relatively safe to the user. As we show herein, this approach is powerful and can be easily implemented, paving the way to the development of advanced research tools and potent clinical immunotherapeutic strategies.",

In this experimental model of pulmonary metastasis, the highly metastatic B16-F10.9 melanoma tumor cells (2 x 10(5)) were inoculated into the footpad of mice to form a primary tumor. The tumor-bearing leg was surgically removed on reaching the size of 5.5 mm, which resulted in the appearance of metastases in the lungs of the animals. After tumor excision, mice were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of BCNU (20 or 35 mg/kg) followed by a series of intraperitoneal THF-gamma 2 injections (1 microgram/0.5 ml/injection). Relative to untreated mice and those receiving chemotherapy alone, the antitumor action of the combined THF-gamma 2 chemoimmunotherapy protocol was significantly augmented according to the following in vivo parameters: (a) decreased postsurgical spontaneous metastatic burden; (b) prolonged survival time; (c) increased resistance to tumor cell challenge; and (d) massive infiltration of lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages in the lung tissue. The THF-gamma 2 immunotherapy also prevented a decrease in lymphocyte reactivity, otherwise induced by the tumor/BCNU chemotherapy. THF-gamma 2 immunotherapy resulted in restoration of the response to Lipopolysaccharide mitogenic stimulation and the allogeneic response.

Possible explanations could be that as MART-1 and gp100 are melanocyte differentiation Ag, clonogenic Ag-non-expressing cells would be spared by immune effectors, or that clonogenic cells would be intrinsically resistant to cytotoxic lymphocytes. We therefore analyzed the proliferative status of MART-1/gp100-expressing and -non-expressing cells in biopsies, and the clonogenicity and sensitiveness to cytotoxic lymphocytes of the human cutaneous melanoma cell lines MEL-XY1 and MEL-XY3. Analysis of MART-1/gp100 and Ki-67 expression in 22 melanoma tumors revealed that MART-1/gp100-expressing and -non-expressing cells proliferated competitively. MART-1, gp100, tyrosinase, and CD271 expression were studied in MEL-XY1 and MEL-XY3 colonies. At 7 days, colonies displayed positive, negative, and mixed expression patterns. By 14 days, colonies of different sizes developed, showing cells with different clonogenic potential, and Ag were downregulated, suggesting Ag plasticity. Subcloning of MEL-XY1 colonies showed that Ag expression varied with time without interfering with clonogenicity. Finally, clonogenic, MART-1/gp100-expressing cells were lysed by specific CD8 lymphocytes. Thus, MART-1 and gp100 expression and plasticity would not interfere with proliferation or clonogenicity, and clonogenic cells may be lysed by cytotoxic lymphocytes.",

Importantly, the PD-1 gene-edited TIL product showed improved in vitro effector function and a significantly increased polyfunctional cytokine profile (TNFα, GM-CSF, and IFNγ) compared to unmodified TIL in two of the three donors tested. In addition, all donor cells displayed an effector memory phenotype and expanded approximately 500-2,000-fold in vitro.

Autologous melanoma clones were found that were resistant to some or all of these CTL clones. The autologous CTL clones recognized at least two different antigens (A, B) on the melanoma cells and three types of melanoma clones could be distinguished (A+B+, A+B-, A-B-). This antigenic heterogeneity of melanoma clones was confirmed by testing the CTL clones in cold target competition and also in antigen-dependent CTL proliferation assays performed with very small numbers of stimulator cells. The data further indicated an instability of the expression of a melanoma-associated antigen in the course of a long culture period. Among the melanoma clones that expressed antigen A, one was found to stimulate the proliferation of anti-A CTL clones much more effectively than the others.

Here, we show in 9 out of 12 analyzed patients the expansion of cytolytic CD8+ T cell precursors specific for melanoma differentiation antigens. These precursors yield, upon single restimulation with melanoma peptide-pulsed DCs, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) able to kill melanoma cells. Melanoma-specific CTLs can be grown in vitro and can be detected in three assays: (a) melanoma tetramer binding, (b) killing of melanoma peptide-pulsed T2 cells, and (c) killing of HLA-A*0201 melanoma cells. The cytolytic activity of expanded CTLs correlates with the frequency of melanoma tetramer binding CD8+ T cells. Thus, CD34-DC vaccines can expand melanoma-specific CTL precursors that can kill melanoma antigen-expressing targets.

Expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) retained in vivo and in vitro functionality, suggesting that melanoma growth did not induce T-cell anergy. The magnitude of suppressed proliferative expansion was proportional to the extent of tumor burden. Melanoma-induced suppression of CTL expansion was correlated with upregulated apoptotic activity and hampered the induction of memory precursor effector cells. Adoptive transfer of resting LCMV antigen-specific T-cells before or after tumor establishment demonstrated that a critical period of in vivo exposure of resting T-cells to growing melanoma was responsible for the induction of suppressed expansion. This suppression was durable; surgical resection of melanoma after in vivo exposure to resting T-cells but before antigenic stimulation did not restore full expansion.;These data suggest that growing melanoma tumors exert a global, antigen-independent influence on resting T-cells that fundamentally reprograms their ability to undergo proliferative expansion in response to subsequent antigenic stimulation.

As we previously reported, most of the melanoma vaccines failed to show any major impact on the disease, except for the autologous whole cell vaccine. This can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of cutaneous melanoma that expresses various levels of melanoma antigens, peptides and has various genetic profiles among different patients. From an immunological point of view, it is illogic to eliminate the tumor and its specific antigens then apply allogenic type of therapy and expect a tumor response. Therefore, it is more logical is to utilize the tumor site as a source for the tumor-specific antigens. In the meantime, patients with in-transit metastases can give us an excellent opportunity to evaluate the local and systemic effects of intralesional (intratumoral) therapy, and various agents have been utilized with equivocal results. On the other hand, intralesional administration of 2 cytokines seemed to process the tumor antigens and activates thymic-derived lymphocytes (T cells). This can induce an antitumor immune response in vivo, i.e., autoimmunization (auto-vaccination), specific to each patient, and overcome tumor heterogeneity regardless to its antigenic or genetic profiles.

The ultrastructural features of seven cases were evaluated.;A comparison of this study's findings with that of other published cases revealed many similarities regarding clinical and pathologic findings and outcome. The patients were white (15 men:13 women; mean and median age, 59 years; range, 22-83 years). Most tumors were located on the head and neck (75%) and were nonpigmented (57%). An associated intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation was identified in 85% of the patients (lentigo maligna in 56%). Histologically, the dermal tumors were composed of tapered, nonpigmented spindle cells in peripheral nerve sheath patterns resembling neuromas, schwannomas, neurofibromas, and perineurial proliferations accompanied by variable neurotropism and desmoplasia; desmoplasia was the most notable feature in most tumors. The mean depth of tumor invasion was 4.1 mm (range, 0.32-9.0 mm). Tumors with continuity between the epidermal and dermal components had a significantly thinner depth of invasion and a more extensive intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation than those tumors with a grenz zone between the two components (2.3 mm vs. 4.6 mm, P = 0.015).

An ulcer was present in 5/27 tumors, regression in 4/27, a microsatellite in 1, and brisk and had nonbrisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytic responses in 2 and 14, respectively. Vimentin was uniformly positive and keratins AE1.3 and Cam 5.2 and Leu-7 were uniformly negative. S100 protein, also uniformly positive, had patchy reactivity in most tumors that expressed EMA (43%). Smooth muscle actin (52%), neuron-specific enolase (42%), and FXIIIa (30%) had patchy positivity. HMB-45 was reactive only in the epidermal and superficial papillary dermal component in 21% of cases. Ultrastructurally, the common features were long, often intertwining cellular processes, intercellular junctions, and discontinuous basal lamina. Melanosomes were not identified. Follow-up data available on 26/28 patients (mean, 36 months; median, 24 months; range, 5-132 months) showed 20 (70%) alive without disease, 2 alive with disease and 3 dead from disease. Seven patients had recurrent local tumor (multiple in four); four had lymph node metastases, and three had visceral metastases. Patients with recurrent disease of any type had significantly thicker tumors (5.4 mm vs. 3.4 mm, P = 0.046) and were more likely to have an ulcerated tumor (P = 0.03). Actuarial 5-year survival for tumors with greater than a 4-mm thickness was 72%, which was greater than that for other types of melanoma with greater than a 4-mm thickness.;Desmoplastic neurotropic melanomas are neuroectodermal tumors that usually arise from an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation but rarely develop de novo in the dermis. Schwannian and perineurial differentiation may account for the desmoplasia and neurotropism encountered in these neoplasms. Desmoplastic neurotropic melanomas present at a more advanced stage locally and may be associated with a better survival than associated with conventional melanomas of similar depth of invasion.",

In particular, recent studies point toward a disease-progressing role of proangiogenic M2 macrophages in melanomas with monosomy 3. Although most studies implicate a protective effect of PPAR-gamma activation in tumors, PPAR-gamma has also been shown to promote the polarization of M1 macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. The purpose of this investigation was first, to characterize the phenotype of tumor infiltrating macrophages and second, to study PPAR-gamma expression in uveal melanomas with molecular gene expression profile as prognostic predictors for patients' outcome. Twenty specimens from patients with uveal melanoma were analyzed for clinical and histologic tumor characteristics. The molecular RNA profile (class 1 or class 2) was commercially determined. Using immunohistochemical techniques, the specimens were dual labeled for CD68 and CD163. CD68 + CD163- M1 macrophages and CD68 + CD163+ M2 macrophages were analyzed in ten high power fields sparing macrophage-poor areas and a mean value was calculated for each tumor. The tumors were immunostained for von Willebrand factor and the micro vascular density (MVD) was analyzed according to Foss. To assess the proliferative rate of each tumor, Ki67 expression was evaluated in ten high power fields followed by calculation of a mean value. Expression of PPAR-gamma was evaluated using a score from 0 (no staining) to 3 (tumor entirely stained). Statistical analysis and a respective correlation were made between histologic characteristics, molecular profile, type of tumor infiltrating macrophages (M1 vs. M2), MVD, proliferative rate, and PPAR-gamma expression. Our results showed a correlation between the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages and the molecular profile with a ratio of approximately 1 corresponding to molecular class 1 and a ratio of approximately 2 corresponding to molecular class 2 (p = 0.01). The ratio of M2/M1 macrophages was higher in tumors with extraocular extension (p = 0.01). PPAR-gamma was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Its expression showed no association with the molecular RNA profile (p = 0.83). This study confirmed that the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages is another prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. Thus, polarization of macrophages plays an important role for patients' outcome. PPAR-gamma is expressed in uveal melanoma tumor cells and further studies are warranted to determine its role in tumor biology.",

During tumor progression, MDSCs accumulate in several organs, including the tumor tissue. So far, tumor-infiltrating MDSC subpopulations remain poorly explored. In this study, we performed global gene expression profiling of mouse tumor-infiltrating granulocytic and monocytic (MO-MDSC) subsets compared with MDSCs from peripheral blood. RMA-S lymphoma-infiltrating MO-MDSCs not only produced high levels of NO and arginase-1, but also greatly increased levels of chemokines comprising the CCR5 ligands CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. MO-MDSCs isolated from B16 melanoma and from skin tumor-bearing ret transgenic mice also expressed high levels of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Expression of CCR5 was preferentially detected on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Accordingly, tumor-infiltrating MO-MDSCs directly attracted high numbers of Tregs via CCR5 in vitro. Intratumoral injection of CCL4 or CCL5 increased tumor-infiltrating Tregs, and deficiency of CCR5 led to their profound decrease. Moreover, in CCR5-deficient mice, RMA-S and B16 tumor growth was delayed emphasizing the importance of CCR5 in the control of antitumor immune responses. Overall, our data demonstrate that chemokines secreted by tumor-infiltrating MO-MDSCs recruit high numbers of Tregs revealing a novel suppressive role of MDSCs with potential clinical implications for the development of cancer immunotherapies.",

As results, the tumor growth was more strongly inhibited by intratumor co-transfection with Mitf-siRNA and IL-12-encoding plasmid DNA than by transfection with either of the molecules alone. The co-transfection induced intratumor infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and hampered neoangiogenesis in the tumor.

Therefore, the precise analysis of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is becoming an important additional pathological biomarker. Analysis of TILs is usually performed semiquantitatively by pathologists on haematoxylin and eosin-stained or immunostained tissue sections. However, automated quantification outperforms semiquantitative approaches, and is becoming the standard. Owing to the presence of melanin pigment, this approach is seriously hampered in melanoma, because the spectrum of melanin lies close to that of commonly used immunohistochemical stains. Aim of this study is to overcome the technical issues due to the presence of melanin for an automated and accurate quantification of TILs in melanoma.;Here, we successfully applied a novel multispectral imaging (MSI) technique to enumerate T cells in human primary melanomas. This microscopy technique combines imaging with spectroscopy to obtain both quantitative expression data and the tissue distributions of different cellular markers. We demonstrate that MSI allows complete and accurate analysis of TILs, successfully avoiding the blurring of images by melanin pigments, in whole tissue slide primary melanoma lesions, which could otherwise not be accurately detected by conventional digital image methodologies.;Our study highlights the potential of MSI for accurate assessment of immune cell infiltrates, including those in notoriously difficult tissues, such as pigmented melanomas.

Since MTB forms a strong complex with melanin, it is an effective carrier for a number of radioisotopes to be addressed to the tumor deposits of any size including individually dispersed melanoma cells. Thus, appropriately radiolabeled MTB can be used for either diagnosis or therapy of the neoplasm. As predicted and found in animal experiments, 211At-MTB is most effective therapeutically. Histopathological investigations showed that the highly pigmented 211At-MTB-treated tumors were characterized initially by perivascular oedema and hydropic degeneration of tumor cells followed by gradual development of extensive areas of coagulative necrosis. The necrotic tumor areas contained microvessels occluded by thrombi and tended to undergo microfocal calcification. Although melanoma-bearing animals successfully treated with 211At-MTB did not reveal any adverse effects of the therapy, detailed toxicological studies were undertaken. No serious macro- or microscopic lesions were observed in normal organs of 211At-MTB treated mice.

The tumors contained plump, strap-like polyhedral cells, with minimal nuclear anaplasia and no mitotic figures. The retina overlying the tumor mass was detached, and the retinal pigment epithelium in this area was swollen and contained intracytoplasmic autofluorescent lipopigment. In two cases, the basement membrane of the retinal epithelium was disrupted by the tumor and pigmented cells infiltrated into the retina, the subretinal space, and the posterior chamber. In one case, retinal detachment was complete and accompanied by intraocular hemorrhage. Melanocytic tumors of the canine choroid have features in common with choroidal nevus and melanocytoma in human eyes.",

We have recently demonstrated high percentages of Th17 cells in TILs from ovarian cancer patients, but the mechanisms of accumulation of these Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment are still unclear. In this study, we further showed elevated Th17 cell populations in the TILs obtained from melanoma and breast and colon cancers, suggesting that development of tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) Th17 cells may be a general feature in cancer patients. We then demonstrated that tumor microenvironmental RANTES and MCP-1 secreted by tumor cells and tumor-derived fibroblasts mediate the recruitment of Th17 cells. In addition to their recruitment, we found that tumor cells and tumor-derived fibroblasts produce a proinflammatory cytokine milieu as well as provide cell-cell contact engagement that facilitates the generation and expansion of Th17 cells. We also showed that inflammatory TLR and nucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2 signaling promote the attraction and generation of Th17 cells induced by tumor cells and tumor-derived fibroblasts. These results identify Th17 cells as an important component of human TILs, demonstrate mechanisms involved in the recruitment and regulation of Th17 cells in tumor microenvironments, and provide new insights relevant for the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.",

MT were obtained by 6-thioguanine (TG) selection of lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tumor tissues, and wild-type T cells (WT) were obtained analogously without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T cell receptor beta chains (TRB) were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality and as indicators of T cell specificity. Public TRB were identified in MT from the blood and tumor of different melanoma patients. Such public TRB were not found in normal control MT or WT. As an indicator of T cell specificity for melanoma, the >2600 MT and WT TRB, including the public TRB from melanoma patients, were compared to a literature-derived empirical database of >1270 TRB from melanoma-reactive T cells. Various degrees of similarity, ranging from 100% conservation to 3-amino acid motifs (3-mer), were found between both melanoma patient MT and WT TRBs and the empirical database. The frequency of 3-mer and 4-mer TRB matching to the empirical database was significantly higher in MT compared with WT in the tumor (p=0.0285 and p=0.006, respectively). In summary, in vivo MT from melanoma patients contain public TRB as well as T cells with specificity for characterized melanoma antigens.

The authors previously demonstrated the existence of T-cell clones in this patient's peripheral blood and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) reactive against multiple antigens, including gp100, the tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-2, a novel TRP-2 isoform-TRP-2-6b, SOX10, and the melanoma antigen NY-ESO-1. In addition to the multiple HLA-A2 restricted T-cell clones, the authors have now identified additional HLA-B/C-restricted as well as class II (HLA-DP)-restricted anti-melanoma antigen T-cell clones from this patient's TIL. One recurrent tumor showed loss of expression of multiple tumor antigens but retention of HLA class I expression. The other recurrent lesion showed total loss of HLA class I expression even though the tumor cells still expressed many melanoma antigens.

We compared the outcomes of stage 1A NSCLC with and without tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to evaluate the effects of TILs on recurrence and survival patterns.;From 2000 to 2009, 273 anatomic segmentectomies and lobectomies were performed on stage 1A NSCLC. Patients were stratified into TIL- and TIL+ cohorts based on pathologic evaluation. Further investigation was conducted on the effects of TILs in patients with and without angiolymphatic invasion. Variables analyzed include overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and type of recurrence.;Overall 5-y survival was not affected by TIL status (65% versus 60%, P = 0.469). Five-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly increased in the TIL+ group versus the TIL- group (87% versus 73%, P = 0.011), most significantly in women (P = 0.016). The presence of angiolymphatic invasion (ALI) was associated with decreased 5-y RFS versus patients without ALI (61% versus 85%, P < 0.001). Interestingly, in the ALI negative group, TIL+ patients experienced a significantly increased 5-y recurrence-free survival versus TIL- patients (93% versus 80%, P = 0.036).;High levels of intratumoral TILs are associated with improved recurrence-free survival in stage 1A NSCLC patients as well as a reduced likelihood of systemic recurrence.

In addition, a number of negative factors in the tumor microenvironment dampen antitumor immune responses, including cytokines (like transforming growth factor-β or interleukin-10), suppressive cells (regulatory T cells and myelosuppressive dendritic cells), defective antigen presentation by tumor cells (human leukocyte antigen or T antigen expression loss, antigen processing machinery defects), amino acid catabolizing enzymes (indoleamine-2-3 dioxygenase, arginase), and immune inhibitory pathways (like cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4/cluster of differentiation 28, programmed death 1/programmed death 1 ligand 1).

Both in VGP and in nodal metastases, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may be present with different patterns. In the evaluation of the primary tumor, these patterns have been defined as brisk, non-brisk, and absent. The histologic slides of regional lymph node metastases, the site of first recurrence in 99 consecutive melanoma patients, were reviewed. Disease-free survival of these cases and whether or not they were treated with rIFN alpha-2A was recorded to identify any relationship among different patterns of TILs, therapy, and prognosis. Of 99 cases, 16 were classified as brisk, 37 as non-brisk, and 46 as absent. At 30 months of follow-up the disease-free survival was 81.3% for brisk cases, 46.8% for non-brisk cases, and 29.3% for absent groups (p = .007). Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of TILs in predicting disease-free survival in patients with regional node metastases. The difference according to the presence or absence of relapse is particularly evident when comparison is made between treated and untreated patients. In conclusion the evaluation of first-recurrence regional node melanoma metastases for TILs, using the same histopathologic criteria as in VGP of primary melanoma, subdivides the cases in brisk, non-brisk, and absent groups. Also, the presence of these patterns in metastatic node melanoma deposits is correlatable to disease-free survival. Our results further stress the difference of prognosis patients treated with rIFN alpha-2A compared to the untreated group. The TILs evaluation may prove useful in selecting those melanoma stage II patients who will best respond to therapy with biologic response modifiers, because the TILs may be the local immune effector cell targets of rIFN alpha-2A or of other biologic agents.",

The blockade of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) by use of the monoclonal antibody, ipilimumab (Yervoy™, Bristol-Myers Squibb), produces favorable antitumor immune system responses and was recently approved by the US FDA for use in patients with advanced melanoma. In addition, targeting components of the MAPK pathway have also demonstrated survival advantage in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and vemurafenib (Zelboraf™, Plexxikon/Roche) was approved by the FDA in August 2011 for the first-line treatment of both metastatic and unresectable melanomas for patients whose tumors have V600E mutations in the BRAF gene.",

Tumor cell vaccine preparation succeeded for 56 patients (88%), but because of progressive disease, the well-tolerated vaccination was completed in only 28 patients. We analyzed the priming of T cells against melanoma antigens, MART-1, tyrosinase, gp100, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3 using human leukocyte antigen/peptide tetramers and functional assays.;The high-dose vaccination induced the infiltration of T cells into the tumor tissue. Three of 14 patients receiving the high-dose vaccine showed an increase in MART-1- or gp100-specific T cells in the peripheral blood during vaccination. Six patients experienced disease-free survival for more than 5 years, and two of these patients developed vitiligo at multiple sites after vaccination. MART-1- and gp100-specific T cells were found infiltrating in vitiligo skin. Upon vaccination, the T cells acquired an effector phenotype and produced interferon-gamma on specific antigenic stimulation.;We conclude that vaccination with GM-CSF-transduced autologous tumor cells has limited toxicity and can enhance T-cell activation against melanocyte differentiation antigens, which can lead to vitiligo. Whether the induction of autoimmune vitiligo may prolong disease-free survival of metastatic melanoma patients who are surgically rendered as having no evidence of disease before vaccination is worthy of further investigation.",

Eleven tumors (23%) exhibited definite regression in the form of one or more segmental areas (defects) where the invasive component was replaced by mononuclear cell infiltrate and fibrosis. Thirteen other tumors (27%) had diffuse, nonsegmental changes classified as probable regression. Nineteen lesions (40%) lacked regression, although 14 of these contained focal evidence of host response. Five melanomas (17% of lesions less than 0.75 mm thick) were equivocal for regression. There were no recurrences or metastases. The histologic diagnosis of regression in thin melanomas requires subjective judgments, but segmental defects represent a potentially reproducible criterion. Their width can be measured, and the proportion of the melanoma that has undergone regression can be estimated. The preponderance of data from the literature, supported by this study, indicates that regression has no prognostic importance in the vast majority of thin melanomas. There are observations, however, to suggest that in rare cases, regression may negate the prognostic value of microstaging of a thin melanoma.

While melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, the ability to prime immunity with vaccines has not generally translated into objective disease regression.

Metastatic melanomas are resistant to almost all existing adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, so detection of metastases remains a challenge, and no biomarkers are currently available to detect primary tumors with the highest risk of metastasis. Results presented in this paper show that Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging of histological sections followed by supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) can accurately (>90%) identify the main cell types commonly found in melanoma tumors. Here we define six cell types: melanoma cells, erythrocytes, connective tissue (includes blood vessel walls, dermis and collagen regions), keratinocytes, lymphocytes and necrotic cells. Interestingly, more than 98% of the melanoma cells are correctly identified. The spectra of the cells identified as melanomas were then further analyzed. First, we compared melanoma cells in primary tumors (from 26 patients) with melanoma cells from metastases (from 25 patients). Neither supervised nor unsupervised analyses revealed any significant difference. Similarly, we found no significant correlation between the infrared spectra of melanoma cells and the number of proliferative cells assessed by Ki67 immunostaining. Finally, we compared the infrared spectra of primary tumors from patients diagnosed at different stages of the disease. Infrared spectroscopy was capable of pointing out differences between primary tumors of patients at stage I or II and patients at stage III or IV, even by unsupervised analysis. We then developed a supervised PLS-DA model capable of predicting whether tumor cells belonged to one of the two aggregated disease stage groups. The model predicted a high rate of true positives (sensitivity of 88.9%) and a good rate of true negatives (specificity of 70.6%) in external validation. These results demonstrate that infrared spectroscopy can be used to help identify melanoma characteristics related to the cells' invasive capability. ",

Gene expression analysis revealed the induction of interferon- and cell death-related genes that were associated with responsiveness of melanoma cell lines to BI-69A11. Strikingly, the administration of BI-69A11 inhibited melanoma development in genetically modified mice bearing an inducible form of activated Nras and a deletion of the Ink4a gene (Nras((Q61K)) ::Ink4a(-/-) ). Biweekly administration of BI-69A11 starting at 10 weeks or as late as 24 weeks after the induction of mutant Nras expression inhibited melanoma development (100 and 36%, respectively).

These findings, which suggested that the proliferative potential of transferred T cells may play a role in clinical responses, led to the current studies in which telomere length as well as phenotypic markers expressed on the administered TILs were examined. TILs that were associated with objective clinical responses following adoptive transfer possessed a mean telomere length of 6.3 kb, whereas TILs that were not associated with significant clinical responses were significantly shorter, averaging 4.9 kb (p < 0.01). Furthermore, individual TIL-derived T cell clonotypes that persisted in vivo following adoptive cell transfer possessed telomeres that were longer than telomeres of T cell clonotypes that failed to persist (6.2 vs 4.5 kb, respectively; p < 0.001). Expression of the costimulatory molecule CD28 also appeared to be associated with long telomeres and T cell persistence. These results, indicating that the telomere length of transferred lymphocytes correlated with in vivo T cell persistence following adoptive transfer, and coupled with the previous observation that T cell persistence was associated with clinical responses in this adoptive immunotherapy trial, suggest that telomere length and the proliferative potential of the transferred T cells may play a significant role in mediating response to adoptive immunotherapy.",

To test the relevance of this hypothesis, we have taken advantage of the fact that spontaneous regression of human primary melanoma is thought to be the result of a successful peptide-specific cellular immune response in vivo.

In the present study, we report an MHC class I-restricted CD4+ T cell isolated from the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of a patient with metastatic melanoma. TIL 1383 I recognized HLA-A2+ melanoma cell lines but not autologous transformed B cells or fibroblasts. The antigen recognized by TIL 1383 I was tyrosinase, and the epitope was the 368-376 peptide. Antibody blocking assays confirmed that TIL 1383 I was MHC class I restricted, and the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors did not contribute significantly to antigen recognition. TIL 1383 I was weakly cytolytic and secreted cytokines in a pattern consistent with it being a Th1 cell. The avidity of TIL 1383 I for peptide pulsed targets is 10-100-fold lower than most melanoma-reactive CD8+ T cell clones. These CD4+ T cells may represent a relatively rare population of T cells that express a T-cell receptor capable of cross-reacting with an MHC class I/peptide complex with sufficient affinity to allow triggering in the absence of the CD4 coreceptor.",

The efficacy of this approach may be improved by providing adjuvant signals and an inflammatory environment for immune cell activation. We evaluated antitumor immune responses in mice after treatment of OVA-expressing B16-F0 tumors with single (15 Gy) or fractionated (5 x 3 Gy) doses of localized ionizing radiation. Irradiated mice had cells with greater capability to present tumor Ags and specific T cells that secreted IFN-gamma upon peptide stimulation within tumor-draining lymph nodes than nonirradiated mice. Immune activation in tumor-draining lymph nodes correlated with an increase in the number of CD45(+) cells infiltrating single dose irradiated tumors compared with nonirradiated mice. Similarly, irradiated mice had increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that secreted IFN-gamma and lysed tumor cell targets. Peptide-specific IFN-gamma responses were directed against both the class I and class II MHC-restricted OVA peptides OVA(257-264) and OVA(323-339), respectively, as well as the endogenous class I MHC-restricted B16 tumor peptide tyrosinase-related protein 2(180-188). Adoptive transfer studies indicated that the increased numbers of tumor Ag-specific immune cells within irradiated tumors were most likely due to enhanced trafficking of these cells to the tumor site. Together these results suggest that localized radiation can increase both the generation of antitumor immune effector cells and their trafficking to the tumor site.",

Fibroblasts (Fbs) within the tumor stroma are critically involved in promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis through secretion of soluble factors, synthesis of extracellular matrix and direct cell-cell interaction. In this work, we aim to alter the biological activity of stromal Fbs by modulating the Notch1 signaling pathway. We show that Fbs engineered to constitutively activate the Notch1 pathway significantly inhibit melanoma growth and tumor angiogenesis. We determine that the inhibitory effect of 'Notch-engineered' Fbs is mediated by increased secretion of Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1) as the effects of Notch1 activation in Fbs are reversed by shRNA-mediated blockade of WISP-1. When 'Notch-engineered' Fbs are co-grafted with melanoma cells in SCID mice, shRNA-mediated blockade of WISP-1 reverses the tumor-suppressive phenotype of the 'Notch-engineered' Fbs, significantly increases melanoma growth and tumor angiogenesis. Consistent with these findings, supplement of recombinant WISP-1 protein inhibits melanoma cell growth in vitro. In addition, WISP-1 is modestly expressed in melanoma-activated Fbs but highly expressed in inactivated Fbs. Evaluation of human melanoma skin biopsies indicates that expression of WISP-1 is significantly lower in melanoma nests and surrounding areas filled with infiltrated immune cells than in the adjacent dermis unaffected by the melanoma. Overall, our study shows that constitutive activation of the Notch1 pathway confers Fbs with a suppressive phenotype to melanoma growth, partially through WISP-1. Thus, targeting tumor stromal Fbs by activating Notch signaling and/or increasing WISP-1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to combat melanoma.",

Most vaccines are ineffective because they generate low numbers of CTLs and because numerous immunosuppressive factors abound in tumor-bearing hosts. We designed a peptide vaccine that produces large numbers of tumor-reactive CTLs in a mouse model of melanoma. Surprisingly, CTL tumor recognition and antitumor effects decreased in the presence of interferon γ (IFNγ), a cytokine that can provide therapeutic benefit. Tumors exposed to IFNγ evade CTLs by inducing large amounts of noncognate major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, which limit T-cell activation and effector function.

We developed a highly sensitive method for detecting intracellular HMGB1 in tumor cells, allowing analysis of the type of cell death and in particular, necrosis. We induced melanoma cell death with cytolytic lymphokine-activated killing (LAK) cells, tumor-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes, TRAIL, or granzyme B delivery and assessed intracellular HMGB1 retention or release to investigate the mechanism of HMGB1 release by cytolytic cells. HMGB1 release from melanoma cells (451Lu, WM9) was detected within 4 h and 24 h following incubation with IL-2-activated PBMC (LAK activity). HLA-A2 and MART1 or gp100-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes induced HMGB1 release from HLA-A2-positive and MART1-positive melanoma cells (FEM X) or T2 cell-loaded, gp100-specific peptides. TRAIL treatment, however, induced HMGB1 release, and it is interesting that this extrinsic pathway-mediated cell death was blocked with the pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. Conversely, granzyme B delivery did not induce HMGB1 release. HMGB1, along with other intracellular factors released from tumor cells induced by cytolysis, may be important components of the disordered tumor microenvironment. This has important implications for the immunotherapy of patients with cancer. Specifically, HMGB1 may promote healing or immune reactivity, depending on the nature of the local inflammatory response and the presence (or absence) of immune effectors.",

When tetramers were used to monitor the in vitro expansion of TAA-specific CTL precursors upon antigen-specific stimulation, a diverse expansion potential was evidenced in CTL from the different donors and, more strikingly, in CTL specific for the different TAA. Melan-A/MART1-specific CTL clones derived from two patients exhibited a broad range of avidity. Only the highest avidity clones, representing about 50 % of the cases analyzed, were tumor specific.

        "Doc_abstract":"The coexistence of tumor progression with a tumor-specific immune response constitutes a major paradox of tumor immunity. During the last decade, the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognising melanoma-associated antigens has been unequivocally demonstrated in numerous different in vivo and in vitro models. However, most often these melanoma-specific T lymphocytes do not control tumor growth. Several mechanisms that involve changes in melanoma phenotype and/or in T-cell differentiation and function could explain the inability of the immune response to control melanoma. In the last few years it has been demonstrated that cellular cytotoxicity is the result of a balance between activating signals triggered by the TCR and costimulatory molecules and inhibitory signals triggered by inhibitory receptors expressed by the CTL. Because the final outcome of the immune response against melanoma depends on the balance between activating and inhibitory signals, the expression de novo on melanoma cells of ligands for inhibitory NKRs and the down-regulation of costimulatory molecules may favor the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance. In this paper we review how altered expression of molecules required for T-cell costimulation could result in impaired lysis of melanoma. The modulation of antimelanoma T-cell responses by a group of receptors originally described on NK cells (NK-associated receptors) but which are now known also to be expressed on a subset of cytolytic effector cells is reviewed. We hypothesize that the expression of ligands for NKRs on melanoma cells may contribute to T-cell-mediated immune responses against melanoma either enhancing or inhibiting activation and differentiation to effector cells. Blocking inhibitory receptors or increasing activating receptors could result in new strategies to improve T-cell-mediated rejection of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A multifactorial analysis was used to identify the dominant prognostic variables affecting survival from a computerized data base of 339 melanoma patients treated at this institution during the past 17 years. Five of the 13 parameters examined simultaneously were found to independently influence five year survival rates: 1) pathological stage (I vs II, p = 0.0014), 2) lesion ulceration (present vs absent, p = 0.006), 3) surgical treatment (wide excision vs wide excision plus lymphadenectomy, p = 0.024), 4) melanoma thickness (p = 0.032), and 5) location (upper extremity vs lower extremity vs trunk vs head and neck, p = 0.038). Additional factors considered that had either indirect or no influence on survival rates were clinical stage of disease, age, sex, level of invasion, pigmentation, lymphocyte infiltration, growth pattern, and regression. Most of these latter variables derived their prognostic value from correlation with melanoma thickness, except sex which correlated with location (extremity lesions were more frequent on females, trunk lesions on males). This statistical analysis enabled us to derive a mathematical equation for predicting an individual patient's probability of five year survival. Three categories of risk were delineated by measuring tumor thickness (Breslow microstaging) in Stage I patients: 1) thin melanomas (<0.76 mm) were associated with localized disease and a 100% cure rate: 2) intermediate thickness melanomas (0.76-4.00 mm) had an increasing risk (up to 80%) of harboring regional and/or distant metastases and 3) thick melanomas (>/=4.00 mm) had a 80% risk of occult distant metastases at the time of initial presentation. The level of invasion (Clark's microstaging) correlated with survival, but was less predictive than measuring tumor thickness. Within each of Clark's Level II, III and IV groups, there were gradations of thickness with statistically different survival rates. Both microstaging methods (Breslow and Clark) were less predictive factors in patients with lymph node or distant metastases. Clinical trials evaluating alternative surgical treatments or adjunctive therapy modalities for melanoma patients should incorporate these parameters into their assessment, especially in Stage I (localized) disease where tumor thickness and the anatomical site of the primary melanoma are dominant prognostic factors.",

However, it remains unclear why only some tumors are infiltrated with T cells. This study was designed to investigate possible correlations between intratumoral T-cell infiltrates and the expression of cancer-associated antigens and MHC class I and II molecules in patients with melanoma. Fresh frozen samples from 124 stage IV melanoma patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of Melan-A/MART-1, tyrosinase, gp100, NY-ESO-1, and MHC class I and II. Intratumoral T-cell and B-cell infiltrates were detected by staining with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD3, and L26 antibodies. The NY-ESO-1 serum antibody status was assessed by Western blot analysis. Intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected in 63.9% and 71.3% of patients, respectively. We observed a significant heterogeneity of the expression of the melanocyte differentiation antigens, NY-ESO-1, and MHC class I and II molecules. The only significant correlation was found between the expression of MHC class I and the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.0001). There was a strong association between these two variables with respect to the density and distribution of infiltrating T cells and the pattern of MHC class I expression (focal versus homogenous). Intratumoral T-cell infiltration is closely correlated with the MHC class I expression but not with the expression of differentiation antigens, cancer-associated antigens, or MHC class II molecules. These results may have implications for the definition of prognostic variables and for the identification of patients who may benefit from antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy.",

The establishment and expansion in vitro of CTL of a specific phenotype to tumor cells strongly depends on the method of activation and sensitization with tumor cells. We generated CD3+ CTL lines to melanoma by co-culturing peripheral blood lymphocytes with autologous irradiated melanoma cells and repetitive stimulation with high-dose interleukin-4 in a \"cocktail\" culture medium. CTL lines were investigated for their specificity to kill autologous and allogeneic melanoma. Histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) class I (A, B) molecules are important restrictive recognition antigens for CTL. Although these antigens are highly polymorphic, they can share a similar immunogenic molecular epitope(s) and can be immunologically cross-reactive. The CTL lines generated were found to kill not only autologous melanoma, but also allogeneic melanomas having class I HLA-A antigens shared or \"cross-reactive\" with autologous HLA-A. These CTL lines were poor killers of melanomas bearing non-shared or non-cross-reactive HLA-A. Cold-target inhibition assays demonstrated this CTL cross-reactivity to allogeneic melanoma specificity. Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed autologous and allogeneic B lymphoblastoid cell lines failed to block autologous melanoma killing, indicating that CTL were not recognizing major histocompatibility complex antigens, serum proteins or culture medium products as the primary target antigen. HLA-A2 was the major shared HLA-A antigen recognized by CTL lines on the melanoma lines studied. CTL lines also recognized shared HLA-A11 and A24 on allogeneic melanoma. There were no CTL lines showing restriction to HLA-B. These results suggest that common tumor-associated antigens are present on melanomas and are recognized in association with distinct HLA-A epitopes by CTL.",

Standard chemoimmunotherapy consisting of dacarbazine (DTIC) given with IFN-alpha has had disappointing results.

Subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumors in C57BL/6 mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of DTIC followed by the topical application of CpG-ODN over the tumors. This therapeutic approach abrogated the growth of established tumors and significantly enhanced survival. Topical CpG application was more effective than intratumoral CpG. Cell depletion studies indicated that the antitumor effect was dependent on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells but not on natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was generated in treated animals and was highest in topically treated animals. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that DTIC, but not CpG, enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. Further, topical CpG induced an expansion of a B220(+)CD8(+) subset of dendritic cells and a subset of NK1.1(+) CD11c(+) cells within the tumors. By enhancing both tumor cell death and local immune activation, DTIC/topical CpG chemoimmunotherapy induced an effective T-cell-dependent host-immune response against melanoma.",

Cancer remains a huge burden on the health and social welfare sectors worldwide and its prevention and cure remain two golden goals that science strives to achieve. Among the treatment options for cancer that have emerged in the past 100 years, cancer vaccine immunotherapy seems to present a promising and relatively safer approach as compared to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The identification of different tumour antigens in the last fifteen years using a variety of techniques, together with the molecular cloning of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)- and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)-defined tumour antigens allowed more refining of the cancer vaccines that are currently used in different clinical trials. In a proportion of treated patients, some of these vaccines have resulted in partial or complete tumour regression, while they have increased the disease-free survival rate in others. These outcomes are more evident now in patients suffering from melanoma. This review provides an update on melanoma vaccine immunotherapy. Different cancer antigens are reviewed with a detailed description of the melanoma antigens discovered so far. The review also summarises clinical trials and individual clinical cases in which some of the old and current methods to vaccinate against or treat melanoma were used.

Gene expression results were validated using a whole genome array in two independent sample sets. Ulceration of primary melanomas was associated with more proliferative tumors, tumor vessel invasion, and increased microvessel density. Infiltration of tumors with greater number of macrophages and gene expression pathways associated with wound healing and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests that ulceration is associated with tumor-related inflammation.

To assess the potential role of SOX2 expression in melanoma invasion, we examined patient melanomas and humanized melanoma xenografts, and noted preferential SOX2 expression in cells that interfaced and infiltrated dermal stroma. Experimental knockdown (KD) of SOX2 mRNA and protein in A2058 melanoma cells with high constitutive SOX2 expression resulted in 4.5-fold decreased invasiveness in vitro compared with controls (P<0.0001). Conversely, when G361 cells that normally express low SOX2 were transduced to overexpress SOX2 mRNA and protein, a 3.8-fold increase in invasiveness was observed (P=0.0004). Among 84 invasion-related genes, RT-PCR screening revealed that SOX2 KD resulted in striking decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), an endopeptidase associated with cleavage of the extracellular matrix. Quantitatively, SOX2 KD diminished MMP-3 mRNA by 87.8%. MMP-3 KD in SOX2-expressing A2058 cells served to inhibit invasion, although to a lesser degree than SOX2 KD. Finally, immunostaining of patient and xenograft melanomas revealed coordinate SOX2 and MMP-3 expression in regions of stromal infiltration.

Long-term follow-up of patients receiving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for metastatic melanoma reveals a substantial subset that experienced complete, lasting tumor regression - and may be cured. Increasing evidence points to mutated gene products as the primary immunological targets of TILs from melanomas. Recent technological advances permit rapid identification of the neoepitopes resulting from these somatic gene mutations and of T cells with reactivity against these targets. Isolation and adoptive transfer of these T cells may improve TIL therapy for melanoma and permit its broader application to non-melanoma tumors. Extension of ACT to other malignancies may also be possible through antigen receptor gene engineering. Tumor regression has been observed following transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors against CD19 in B-cell malignancies or a T-cell receptor against NY-ESO-1 in synovial cell sarcoma and melanoma. Herein, we review recent clinical trials of TILs and antigen receptor gene therapy for advanced cancers. We discuss lessons from this experience and consider how they might be applied to realize the full curative potential of ACT. ",

Similar efforts for nonmelanoma tumors have had limited success with few antigens identified. To identify potentially relevant tumor-associated antigens expressed in renal cell carcinoma cell lines, a tumor-specific CTL clone was established from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from a regressing pulmonary lesion. This CTL recognized nonmutated fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF-5). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR revealed that FGF-5 was overexpressed in the majority of renal cell carcinomas, as well as in some prostate carcinoma and breast carcinoma lines. FGF-5 expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR in normal tissues was below the recognition threshold for this CTL. As a normal protein with significant overexpression by multiple adenocarcinomas and little normal tissue expression, FGF-5 represents an immunotherapy target with potential utility against a broad array of nonmelanoma cancers.",

This therapeutic effect is accompanied in approximately 20% of the animals by induction of a population of lymphocytes that migrates to and substantially disrupts the cytoarchitecture of the skin, which results in progressive alopecia. The histologic changes associated with the hair loss, i.e., peri-, and intrafollicular inflammatory infiltrates consisting of both activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens on subinfundibular follicle epithelium, are similar to those observed in human alopecia areata. Furthermore, the alopecic phenotype can be transmitted horizontally by passive transfer of lymphocytes from treated animals to naïve mice. Since lymphocytes from treated animals either lacking or displaying signs of alopecia are able to transmit these phenotypic changes to a similar percentage of naïve animals, the initiation of alopecia seems to be dependent on the coincidence of at least two different events: the presence of specific lymphocyte populations as well as specific features of the skin disclosing a target for these cells.",

Although the data support the thesis that uveal melanomas are typically slow-growing tumors that show local infiltrative properties but little tendency to produce metastatic disease unless treated by enucleation of the eye, it is possible that the available information is possibly biased by our methods of acquisition of data. Much pertinent information is lost because the cases usually do not come to the attention of ophthalmologists or ophthalmic pathologist.

A panel of 57 different variable-region primers specific for the TCR V alpha I-29 and V beta I-28 was designed, and a semi-quantitative PCR method applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was developed. This semi-quantitative method was demonstrated to be reproducible and to be useful for the assessment of V alpha- and V beta-gene-family usage in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. A total of 9 different histopathologically characterized primary tumors were analyzed in this study. The TILs in these tumors were found to preferentially express certain TCR V alpha and V beta regions. The differential usage of certain V alpha regions was very pronounced as illustrated by V alpha 4, which was highly expressed in 3/8 tumors, and V alpha 22, which was highly expressed in 4/8 tumors. For comparison, specific highly expressed V alpha regions in control samples of peripheral-blood lymphocytes rarely exceeded 10%. The most highly expressed V beta region was V beta 8, which was highly expressed in 2/8 tumors. For the highly expressed V alpha 4 and V alpha 22 and V beta 8 regions, the high levels may be explained by the in situ clonal or oligoclonal expansion of TIL. In one specific case, the high expression of V beta 8 was due to expansion of a single clone of TILs, as evidenced by a fully readable sequence of the CDR3 (V-D-J) region, determined by direct sequencing of the PCR product corresponding to V beta 8. In contrast, sequence analysis of V alpha 22, which was expressed in the same tumor sample at similar levels, demonstrated the simultaneous presence of 3 different CDR3 (V-J) sequences derived from V alpha 22 transcripts of exactly the same length. The observed preferential use of TCR V alpha and V beta regions suggests the in situ clonal expansion of specific populations of T-cells, possibly reactive with melanoma-associated peptides presented by HLA molecules. The preferential use of TCR V alpha and V beta regions may imply the involvement of a limited number of shared melanoma-associated peptides.",

Here, we describe a bioassay that may link early T-cell-mediated immune responses to later clinical benefits. This bioassay rests upon the tenet of immunotherapy that tumor-specific effector T cells capable of invading peripheral tissue can recognize tumor antigens and exert cytotoxic functions there. To show its utility, we conducted a retrospective study of a large cohort of metastatic melanoma patients (n = 91) enrolled in dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination protocols to examine a hypothesized correlation of posttreatment skin-infiltrating lymphocytes (SKIL) with overall survival (OS). Stringent immunologic criteria were defined to identify long-term survivors. The presence of tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific CD8(+) T cell populations within SKILs (criterion I) was highly predictive for long-term survival. Further restriction by selecting for the presence of TAA-specific CD8(+) T cells specifically recognizing tumor peptide (criterion II) was also associated with improved OS. Recognition of naturally processed antigen (criterion III) maximized the accuracy of the test, with a median OS of 24.1 versus 9.9 months (P = 0.001).

In several human cancers, higher numbers of CD20(+) TAB are associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas in human primary melanomas, this association is contentious. In this study, we determined the association of TAB numbers in cutaneous primary melanoma tissue samples and patients' overall survival. The CD20 immunohistochemistry on archival nonmetastasized and metastasized cutaneous primary melanoma tissues from 2 independent patient cohorts was performed. One cohort was used in class comparison for metastasis, the most important prognostic factor for overall survival, and the other cohort for a subsequent survival analysis. Survival association was further validated with RNA data from a third independent cohort. Whole tissue sections were read automatically via quantitative digital imaging and analysis. Survival data were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard modeling. We discovered that cutaneous primary melanomas without metastasis contain significantly more TAB than primary melanomas that had metastasized. At time of first diagnosis, a higher number of TAB is associated with a significantly better overall survival in patients with cutaneous primary melanomas of >1 mm Breslow depth. Also, higher CD20/CD19 tumor mRNA levels are correlated with a significantly better overall survival. Thus, our data support TAB numbers as a prognostic biomarker in cutaneous primary melanoma patients with a tumor of >1 mm Breslow depth. For a survey in larger studies, whole tissue section analysis seems to be key to accurate assessment of TAB numbers. ",

The significance of CD44 modifications is still controversial. Only a small number of these different proteins has a prognostic value independent of tumor thickness.

Systemic activation, measured as the ability of splenocytes to lyse tumor cells in vitro in the presence of BFA, was enhanced by the in vivo administration of SEB but not by beta-glucan or F(ab')2 BFA. Despite lacking a systemic effect, F(ab')2 BFA increased both direct and BFA-mediated cytotoxicity in fresh tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. beta-Glucan did not increase systemic or intratumor T cell activation. However, it significantly enhanced the ability of splenocytes to lyse NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. When tested in a pulmonary metastases model, all three forms of immune modulation combined with F(ab')2 BFA significantly reduced the number of metastases. BFA were more effective at tumor neutralization when combined with SEB compared with adoptively transferred, in vitro-activated splenocytes.

Physical examination showed a well-demarcated dark-brown macule 10 mm in diameter. Dermoscopy demonstrated a central dark area with a blue-grey structureless area, a milky-red area with irregular blue-grey dots or globules suggestive of regression structures, and multifocal black pigmentation with whitish scaly areas. An abrupt intralesional change in color from a central dark area to a peripheral light-brown area was also seen. The peripheral area showed an atypical pigment network with an obscure mesh and holes. Histopathologic examination of the lesion showed acanthosis with melanocytic proliferation and nuclear atypia, a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, melanophages and a few nests of melanocytes just beneath the epidermis. The epidermal melanocytes were positive for S-100, Melan-A and HMB-45, but the dermal nests of melanocytes were negative for HMB-45 and positive for S-100 and Melan-A.

In this study, we investigated the role of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in initiating nitric oxide (NO) production by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The in vivo depletion of NK cells prior to the i.p. inoculation of melanoma cells resulted in a significant decrease in the NO production of the TAM prepared from the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC). Such prior NK cell depletion also decreased the ability of TAM to show any antitumor activity in vitro. The addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (Me-L-Arg) to the culture partially inhibited the ability of TAM to suppress the proliferation of melanoma cells and also decreased their cytolytic activity against melanoma cells. These results suggest that the TAM exhibited both cytostatic and cytolytic activities through their NO production. In an in vivo assay, the administration of Me-L-Arg permitted the more rapid growth of i.p. inoculated melanoma cells compared with the control. On the other hand, the decreased NO production of TAM, resulting from the prior NK cell depletion, was restored by the i.p. administration of interferon gamma (IFN gamma). In addition, the in vivo administration of anti-IFN gamma mAb into mice inoculated i.p. with melanoma cells also significantly decreased the NO production of TAM in peritoneal exudate cells. Furthermore, the tumor-infiltrating NK cells produced a considerable level of IFN gamma. Overall, these results indicate that early-appearing tumor-infiltrating NK cells play an important role in the NO production of TAM through their IFN gamma production.",

Besides promising approaches based on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells have gained more and more attention as anti-melanoma effector cells. NK cell activation is inhibited by HLA class I molecules expressed by target cells, so they preferentially attack tumor cells that express low levels of HLA class I. Partial or complete loss of HLA class I expression is a frequent event during the development of melanoma. In parallel, ligands for activating NK cell receptors become induced upon malignant transformation. Thus, melanoma cells are often efficiently recognized and lysed by NK cells at least in vitro. In vivo, however, melanomas have developed multiple sophisticated strategies to escape from NK cell mediated attack. Several novel approaches aim at harnessing NK cells to treat melanoma patients and to counteract existing tumor escape mechanisms. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the field. ",

Its potential role as an antitumor agent has been suggested by its demonstrated activity in a variety of tumor models. The mechanism of antitumor activity has been proposed to be its enhancement of cytotoxic T-cell function. In the current work we demonstrate clear antitumor activity for this cytokine in a nonimmunogenic tumor system. B16 melanoma cells transfected with the human IL-6 complementary DNA demonstrated slower tumor growth in vivo. Tumors that developed from these cells had a prominent stromal matrix, an easily recognized infiltration of inflammatory cells, fewer mitotic figures, and fewer blood vessels. These in vivo findings corresponded with a greater adhesion of the IL-6-transfected B16 cells to stromal matrix proteins (laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin) and a less prominent vascular response in an intradermal angiogenesis assay. Therefore, we propose that with weakly antigenic tumors, such as B16 melanoma, IL-6 may mediate important antitumor responses by nonspecific proinflammatory mechanisms.",

Durable complete response rates of 20% to 25% are achieved in patients with metastatic melanoma following adoptive cell transfer of T cells derived from metastatic lesions, responses that appear in some patients to be mediated by T cells that predominantly recognize mutated antigens. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the reactivity of T cells administered to a patient with metastatic melanoma who exhibited a complete response for over 3 years after treatment. Over 4,000 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were identified by whole-exome sequence analysis of the patient's autologous normal and tumor cell DNA. Autologous B cells transfected with 720 mutated minigenes corresponding to the most highly expressed tumor cell transcripts were then analyzed for their ability to stimulate the administered T cells. Autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes recognized 10 distinct mutated gene products, but not the corresponding wild-type products, each of which was recognized in the context of one of three different MHC class I restriction elements expressed by the patient. Detailed clonal analysis revealed that 9 of the top 20 most prevalent clones present in the infused T cells, comprising approximately 24% of the total cells, recognized mutated antigens. Thus, we have identified and enriched mutation-reactive T cells and suggest that such analyses may lead to the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer.

Here it is shown that human SDF-1beta (hSDF-1beta) alone secreted by hSDF-1beta-transduced tumor cells promotes efficacious antitumor responses. The murine C1498 leukemia and B16F1 melanoma models have been studied. For expression of hSDF-1beta by tumor cells (SDF-tumor cells), packaging cell lines secreting retroviruses encoding hSDF-1beta have been used. The results demonstrate that 50% (B16F1) and 90% (C1498) of naive mice injected with SDF-tumor cells reject their tumors. Prophylactic vaccination of naive mice with irradiated SDF-tumor cells leads to systemic immunity, and therapeutic vaccination leads to cure of established tumors. Mice that previously rejected live SDF-tumor cells are immune to the rejected tumor but susceptible to another tumor and have in vitro tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. SDF-tumor cells are not rejected by immunodeficient scid mice. Immunohistochemistry shows significant infiltration of SDF-1 tumors by T cells, and in vivo T-cell depletion studies indicate that CD4(+) T cells are required for SDF-mediated tumor rejection.

This leads to increased oncogenic properties such as tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and resistance to apoptosis. Blockade of the MAPK pathway with highly specific kinase inhibitors induces unprecedented tumor response rates in patients with advanced BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma. Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programed death-1/PD-L1 has also demonstrated striking anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. Tumor responses are likely limited by multiple additional layers of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. There is emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that MAPK inhibition has a beneficial effect on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a strong rationale for combined immunotherapy and MAPK pathway inhibition in melanoma. The T cell response has been the main focus in the studies reported to date. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are important in the induction of tumor-specific T cell responses, the impact of MAPK pathway activation in melanoma on DC function is critical for the melanoma directed immune response. BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells modulate DCs through the MAPK pathway because its blockade in melanoma cells can reverse suppression of DC function. As both MEK/BRAF inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade have recently taken center stage in the treatment of melanoma, a deeper understanding of how MAPK pathway inhibition affects the tumor immune response is needed.

The antigens identified in mouse model systems appear, with one exception, to represent the products of mutated genes. In contrast, most of the antigens recognized by human tumor-reactive T cells reported to date appear to represent the products of non-mutated genes. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding beta-catenin, which was shown to be recognized by the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 1290, a HLA-A24 restricted melanoma-specific CTL line from patient 888. The cDNA clone, which was isolated from the autologous melanoma cDNA library, differed by a single base pair from the published beta-catenin sequence, resulting in a change from a serine to a phenylalanine residue at position 37. Normal tissues from this patient did not express the altered sequence, nor did 12 allogeneic melanomas, indicating that this represented a unique mutation in this patient's melanoma. A peptide corresponding to the sequence between amino acids 29 and 37 of the mutant gene product was identified as the T cell epitope recognized by TIL 1290. The observation that HLA-A24 binding peptides contain an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at position 9 suggested that the change at position 37 may have generated a peptide (SYLDSGIHF) which was capable of binding to HLA-A24, and a competitive binding assay confirmed this hypothesis. The beta-catenin protein has been shown previously to be involved in cell adhesion mediated through the cadherin family of cell surface adhesion molecules. The high frequency of mutations found in members of cellular adhesion complexes in a variety of cancers suggests that these molecules may play a role in development of the malignant phenotype.",

We recently reported that the induction of profound unresponsiveness in a T cell clone by melanoma cells expressing MHC class II antigens may provide a mechanism for these tumor cells to escape immunosurveillance. Here we demonstrate that two T cell clones (sTC3 and sTS5) produced high amounts of IL-10 after being rendered anergic by autologous melanoma cells. Co-culture of these T cell clones with melanoma cell transfectants expressing B7, which failed to induce anergy, resulted in a significantly lower production of IL-10. IL-10 production by the anergic T cell clones correlated with an impaired ability to produce IL-2 in response to TCR mediated activation. Neutralization of IL-10 reduced the duration of T cell unresponsiveness from 14 to only 4 days, but inhibition of IL-10 production during initiation of anergy showed no effect on it. Induction of the unresponsive state, as well as the subsequent IL-10 production in sTC3 cells, could be prevented by the addition of cyclosporin A to the primary co-culture of sTC3 and the autologous melanoma. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 is important for maintenance of T cell anergy induced by contact with nonprofessional antigen presenting cells such as MHC class II+ melanoma cells.

In this study, we administered these three melanoma-associated antigens via lentiviral vectors (termed LV-3Ag) and found that this multi-antigen vaccine strategy markedly increased functional T-cell infiltration into tumors and generated protective and therapeutic antitumor immunity. We also engineered a novel immunotoxin, αFAP-PE38, capable of targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-expressing fibroblasts within the tumor stroma. When combined with αFAP-PE38, LV-3Ag exhibited greatly enhanced antitumor effects on tumor growth in an established B16 melanoma model. The mechanism of action underlying this combination treatment likely modulates the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and, consequently, activates cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells capable of specifically recognizing and destroying tumor cells.

Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated with antibodies blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or PD-1/PD-L1. Treatment with ipilimumab, a fully human CTLA-4-specific mAb, showed durable clinical efficacy in metastatic melanoma; its mechanism of action is, however, only partially understood. This is a study of 29 patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma treated with ipilimumab. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and matched melanoma metastases from 15 patients responding and 14 not responding to ipilimumab by multicolor flow cytometry, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay, and immunohistochemistry. PBMCs and matched tumor biopsies were collected 24 h before (i.e., baseline) and up to 4 wk after ipilimumab. Our findings show, to our knowledge for the first time, that ipilimumab can engage ex vivo FcγRIIIA (CD16)-expressing, nonclassical monocytes resulting in ADCC-mediated lysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In contrast, classical CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes are unable to do so. Moreover, we show that patients responding to ipilimumab display significantly higher baseline peripheral frequencies of nonclassical monocytes compared with nonresponder patients. In the tumor microenvironment, responders have higher CD68(+)/CD163(+) macrophage ratios at baseline and show decreased Treg infiltration after treatment. Together, our results suggest that anti-CTLA-4 therapy may target Tregs in vivo. Larger translational studies are, however, warranted to substantiate this mechanism of action of ipilimumab in patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The clinical and pathological characteristics of cutaneous melanomas occurring in Camargue-type gray-skinned horses are reported. Examination of 83 tumor-bearing horses revealed that the tumors occurred most frequently underneath the tail (93.9%) and at high rates in the peri-anal region (43.0%), the lips (33.0%), and the eyelids (24.0%), but rarely in the vulva (3.8%). Tumorous lesions were characterized by the presence of either hemispheric nodules or large infiltrated plaques, or their combinations. Microscopic examination indicated that tumorous lesions were composed mostly of melanocytes and numerous melanophages and that component cells manifested a remarkable cellular atypia with anisocytosis and anisokarinosis. Pathological examination of lesions corresponding to earlier stages of the tumors disclosed that tumor formation and its related melanogenesis occurred in close topographical association with apocrine sweat glands, but not at the dermal-epidermal junction. Larger nodules of the tumors were often composed of a concentric deposition of cell layers, each being separated by dermal components from the epidermis. Because of the absence of their tropism toward the epidermis and their multiloculation, horse melanomas are considered to be different in their pathological characteristics from human melanomas.",

In these cases, determination of tumour thickness by ultrasound yields higher values for thickness than do histological examinations. In addition, tumour cell aggregates that are smaller than the lower limit of scanner resolution, are very close to the main tumour mass, or have infiltrated the deeper dermis cannot be measured accurately.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adoptive infusion of natural killer (NK) cells is being increasingly explored as a therapy in patients with cancer, although clinical responses are thus far limited to patients with hematological malignancies. Inadequate homing of infused NK cells to the tumor site represents a key factor that may explain the poor anti-tumor effect of NK cell therapy against solid tumors. One of the major players in the regulation of lymphocyte chemotaxis is the chemokine receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) which is expressed on activated NK cells and induces NK cell migration toward gradients of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL9, 10 and 11). Here, we show that ex vivo expansion of human NK cells results in a tenfold increased expression of the CXCR3 receptor compared with resting NK cells (p = 0.04). Consequently, these NK cells displayed an improved migratory capacity toward solid tumors, which was dependent on tumor-derived CXCL10. In xenograft models, adoptively transferred NK cells showed increased migration toward CXCL10-transfected melanoma tumors compared with CXCL10-negative wild-type tumors, resulting in significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival (median survival 41 vs. 32 days, p = 0.03). Furthermore, administration of interferon-gamma locally in the tumor stimulated the production of CXCL10 in subcutaneous melanoma tumors resulting in increased infiltration of adoptively transferred CXCR3-positive expanded NK cells. Our findings demonstrate the importance of CXCL10-induced chemoattraction in the anti-tumor response of adoptively transferred expanded NK cells against solid melanoma tumors.",

The purpose of the present study was to examine the systemic and intra-tumor effects of in vivo T-cell activation with BsAb, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), and beta-glucan in combination with BsAb as a retargeting agent. CL-62 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into C3H/ HeN mice. Mice were subsequently treated with BsAb alone or with SEB or beta-glucan plus BsAb. Fresh splenocytes, lymph-node cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were tested for their proliferative response using incorporation of 3H-thymidine, and for their ability to lyse CL-62 cells in the presence or absence of BsAb in 4-hr 51Chromium release assays. Toxicity of treatments was assessed in a D-galactosamine model. BsAb, alone or combined with beta-glucan, had essentially no effect on systemic T-cell cytotoxicity, and essentially no effect on systemic proliferation, unless exogenous IL-2 was provided. At the tumor site, BsAb alone, BsAb plus beta-glucan, and SEB plus BsAb all significantly increased BsAb-mediated TIL cytotoxicity. In contrast to the TIL-limited effects of BsAb and of BsAb plus beta-glucan, SEB plus BsAb markedly increased both systemic and intra-tumor T-lymphocyte activation. Toxicity correlated with measures of systemic activation, with limited effects from BsAb alone and from beta-glucan plus BsAb, and with marked lethality from SEB plus BsAb. Overall, these results suggest moderate intra-tumor activation of TIL, but no measurable systemic activation after in vivo treatment with BsAb or beta-glucan plus BsAb. SEB plus BsAb results in complete T-cell activation in both systemic and intra-tumor compartments, but at the expense of increased systemic toxicity. In conclusion, TIL can be activated in situ with different combinations of in vivo activants. In vivo-activated TIL can be retargeted with bispecific antibodies to lyse tumor cells, and may be an alternative to ex vivo T-cell activation and adoptive transfer therapy.",

Many therapies for metastatic melanoma are limited by low response rates, severe toxicities, and/or relatively short response duration. Cancer immunotherapies that act as immune-checkpoint inhibitors to block the localized immune suppression mechanisms utilized by tumors are undergoing development and clinical trials. A clinically relevant immune escape mechanism in melanoma is the activation of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor on infiltrating T cells. Activating PD-1 triggers an immune checkpoint resulting in inhibition of T cells directed against melanoma antigens and prevents the immune system from combating the melanoma. In Phase I clinical trials, two anti-PD1 therapies, Nivolumab and MK-3475, that block the PD-1 receptor to enable T cell killing have demonstrated objective tumor responses in patients with advanced melanoma. The purpose of this review is to present the available clinical evidence on anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. We also discuss limitations associated with anti-PD-1 therapy. The blockade of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway has shown promising results in clinical trials and has revolutionized melanoma immunotherapy. ",

Hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter region of a major alternative transcript of this gene, RASSF1A, has been suggested to play a key role in pathogenesis of various carcinomas. There is limited analysis of inactivation of RASSF1A in tumors other than carcinomas. Hypermethylation of two regions of the RASSF1A CpG island was investigated in metastatic cutaneous melanomas using methylation-specific PCR; region 1 is located upstream, and region 2 is located within the first exon (1alpha) of the open reading frame of the RASSF1A transcript. Eleven melanoma cell lines and 44 melanoma tumors were examined. Methylation of RASSF1A CpG island promoter region 1 was detected in 7 (64%) cell lines and 18 (41%) tumors, and methylation of region 2 was detected in 9 (82%) cell lines and 22 (50%) tumors. Overall, RASSF1A gene hypermethylation was detected in 55% of the melanoma tumors. No methylation was detected in normal skin tissues or healthy donor lymphocytes. All cell lines that showed methylation at promoter region 1 were also methylated at promoter region 2. Hypermethylation of both CpG island regions correlated with no expression of the RASSF1A gene. RASSF1A transcripts could be reexpressed in cell lines after treatment with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

In this study, we investigated the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3 (Foxp3) in melanoma-invaded LNs and determined proportion and functionality of Treg cells among TIL extracted from these 10 metastatic melanoma LNs at different steps of their in vitro expansion. We found that metastatic melanoma LNs expressed very heterogeneous levels of Foxp3 and that CD4+CD25(high) Treg cells extracted from these LNs were detectable at each step of the in vitro culture of TIL but decreasing during the culture. In addition, functional assays demonstrated that these CD4+CD25(high) T cells were capable of suppressing autologous CD8+ and CD4+CD25- T cell proliferation.

It is well known that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are actively recruited during tumor angiogenesis. Using this feature, we attempted to establish a novel therapeutic modality that targets tumor vessels of multiple metastases using embryonic endothelial progenitor cells (eEPCs) transduced with an immune-activating gene. The eEPCs were retrovirally transduced with the mouse CC chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) gene, a lymphocyte-migrating chemokine. The mouse ovarian cancer cell line OV2944-HM-1 (HM-1) was inoculated subcutaneously into B6C3F1 mice, along with CCL19-tranduced eEPCs (eEPC-CCL19), resulting in immunologic activity and tumor-inhibitory effects. In this model, eEPC-CCL19 showed tumor repression accompanied by increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes compared with the control group. In contrast, no tumor repression was observed when the same experiment was done in immunodeficient (SCID) mice, suggesting a crucial role of T-cell function in this system. Next, we established a lung metastasis model by injecting HM-1 cells or B16 melanoma cells via the tail vein. Subsequent intravenous injection of eEPC-CCL19 leads to a decrease in the number of lung metastasis and prolonged survival. Antitumor effects were also observed in a peritoneal dissemination model using HM-1. These results suggest that systemic delivery of an immune-activating signal using EPCs can alter the tumor immune microenvironment and lead to a therapeutic effect, which may provide a novel strategy for targeting multiple metastases of various malignancies.",

Such TILs show in vitro cross-reactivity for allogeneic tumors but have not been evaluated for in vivo activity.;An F1 hybrid mouse (C57BL/6 X DBA-2[B6D2 F1]) was used to generate TILs (F1 TILs) expressing both H-2b and H-2d class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants, which were used to treat established autologous lung metastases in C57BL/6 (B6) parental strain mice.;H-2b mice bearing the fully syngeneic MC-38 tumor were treated with F1 TILS, and a 98-100% reduction in 4-day-old established lung metastasis was achieved. However, B6 mice bearing MC-38 tumors after preimmunization with H-2d splenocytes did not show a response to F1 TILs. Preimmunization of B6 mice by intravenous injection of H-2d splenocytes at varying times before F1 TIL administration showed a dramatic reduction in F1 TIL efficacy when alloimmunization occurred as early as 2 days before therapy. Immunization against an unrelated haplotype (H-2s) sharing no MHC genes with the F1 TILs resulted in a smaller reduction of F1 TIL efficacy, possibly due to shared minor determinants.;Allogeneic TILs sharing an MHC restriction element for a common tumor antigen can be used to successfully treat established metastases in the nonallosensitized host.",

The rationale comes from the knowledge that many patients with melanoma have endogenous immune responses against their tumor cells and clinically meaningful tumor regression can be achieved in a minority of patients using cytokines such as interleukin-2 and adoptive cellular therapy. In the last 5 years there has been a revolution in the clinical management of melanoma in large measure based on the development of antibodies that influence T cell regulatory pathways by overcoming checkpoint inhibition and providing co-stimulation, either of which results in significantly more effective immune-mediated tumor destruction. This review will describe the pre-clinical and clinical application of antagonistic antibodies targeting the T-cell checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), and agonistic antibodies targeting the costimulatory pathways OX40 and 4-1BB.

Gene expression analysis divided the UM panel into three classes. Class I presented tumors with a good prognosis and a distinct genomic make up that is characterized by 6p gain. The UM with a bad prognosis were subdivided into class IIa and class IIb. These classes presented similar survival risks but could be distinguished by tumor heterogeneity. Class IIa presented homogeneous tumors while class IIb tumors, on average, contained 30% of non-mutant cells. Tumor heterogeneity coincided with expression of a set of immune genes revealing an extensive immune infiltrate in class IIb tumors. Molecularly, class IIa and IIb presented the same genomic configuration and could only be distinguished by 8q copy number. Moreover, UM establish in the void of the immune privileged eye indicating that in IIb tumors the infiltrate is attracted by the UM.

The linear-quadratic (LQ) and modified linear quadratic (MLQ) models were used separately to evaluate the therapeutic outcome of a series of single fraction regimens that employed grid therapy to treat both acute and late responding melanomas of varying sizes. The dose prescription point was at the center of the tumor volume. Dose sizes ranging from 1 to 30 Gy at 100% dose line were modeled. Tumors were either touching the skin surface or having their centers at a depth of 3 cm. The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) to the melanoma cells and the therapeutic ratio (TR) were defined by comparing grid therapy with the traditional open debulking field. The clinical outcomes from recent reports were used to verify the authors' model.;Dose profiles at different depths and 3D dose distributions in a series of 3D melanomas treated with grid therapy were obtained. The EUDs and TRs for all sizes of 3D tumors involved at different doses were derived through the LQ and MLQ models, and a practical equation was derived. The EUD was only one fifth of the prescribed dose. The TR was dependent on the prescribed dose and on the LQ parameters of both the interspersed cancer and normal tissue cells. The results from the LQ model were consistent with those of the MLQ model. At 20 Gy, the EUD and TR by the LQ model were 2.8% higher and 1% lower than by the MLQ, while at 10 Gy, the EUD and TR as defined by the LQ model were only 1.4% higher and 0.8% lower, respectively. The dose volume histograms of grid therapy for a 10 cm tumor showed different dosimetric characteristics from those of conventional radiotherapy. A significant portion of the tumor volume received a very large dose in grid therapy, which ensures significant tumor cell killing in these regions. Conversely, some areas received a relatively small dose, thereby sparing interspersed normal cells and increasing radiation tolerance. The radiobiology modeling results indicated that grid therapy could be useful for treating acutely responding melanomas infiltrating radiosensitive normal tissues. The theoretical model predictions were supported by the clinical outcomes.;Grid therapy functions by selectively killing infiltrating tumor cells and concomitantly sparing interspersed normal cells. The TR depends on the radiosensitivity of the cell population, dose, tumor size, and location. Because the volumes of very high dose regions are small, the LQ model can be used safely to predict the clinical outcomes of grid therapy. When treating melanomas with a dose of 15 Gy or higher, single fraction grid therapy is clearly advantageous for sparing interspersed normal cells. The existence of a threshold fraction dose, which was found in the authors' theoretical simulations, was confirmed by clinical observations.",

B7 molecules were expressed on CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells, which also expressed CD124 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, thus verifying their relation to MDSCs. In developing melanomas, CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells express only low levels of B7-H1. In contrast, B7-H1 is upregulated in large tumors, and functional analysis demonstrates that CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells suppress the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells through B7-H1. Depletion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) significantly downregulated the expression of B7-H1, B7-H3, and B7-H4 on MDSCs and reduced tumor growth, indicating a concerted immunosuppressive activity of Tregs and MDSCs. No differences in the suppressive function of MDSCs between CD25-depleted and non-depleted mice were recorded. Instead, tumor-derived MDSCs from Treg-depleted hosts produced less IL-10 and more IFN-γ as compared with Treg-harboring mice.

The large increases in diagnosis of melanoma without commensurate increases in advanced tumors and mortality are not compatible with presumed malignant behavior of thin melanomas. Increased intensity of melanoma surveillance may artificially increase the incidence of melanoma by harvesting histologically \"malignant\" but biologically benign tumors. Little available evidence suggests the presence of an actual increase in the frequency of biologically malignant tumors.

When B16F10 cells transfected with miR-134 were co-cultured with normal splenic lymphocytes, the secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α from lymphocytes was reduced and B16F10 cell survival was increased. HIFU exposure efficiently decreased miR-134 while increased CD86 expression in B16F10 cells in vitro. CD86 knockdown with siRNA markedly rescued the viability of HIFU-treated B16F10 cells that co-cultured with lymphocytes. Altogether, our results suggest that HIFU down-regulates miR-134 to release the inhibition of miR-134 on CD86 in melanoma cells, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immune response. ",

However, strong T-cell response does not always coincide with tumor rejection, for which upregulated expression of immunoinhibitory molecules may be responsible. In this study, the treatment with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) vaccine induced an infiltration of T cells into the tumor site as well as the expression of IFN-gamma and IL-2, and delayed lung metastases of tumor, but the tumor progression nonetheless occur finally. We demonstrated that B7-H1 expressed by residual tumor cells was responsible for the resistance of tumor to the therapy with HSP70 vaccine. Blockade of B7-H1 by i.v. injection pPD-1A, a plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of PD-1 (sPD-1), could reverse this resistance and enhance the therapeutic efficacy. To complement these findings, we investigated the gene expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by Real-time PCR analysis, which revealed that the expression of TH1 cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2 by TIL in the mice treated with HSP70 vaccine in combination with sPD-1 was increased and the expression of negative regulatory molecules IL-10, TGF-beta and foxp3 was decreased, demonstrating that multifunctional properties afforded by the combination therapy can effectively overcome tumor resistance and promote effective antitumor immunity. The in vivo transfection with pPD-1A could be performed as infrequently as once a week and still produce a significant antitumor effect. These findings suggest that the treatment with HSP70 vaccine followed by blockade of tumor-B7-H1 with sPD-1 may provide a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy.",

In this sense, their most prominent role is the presentation of tumor-derived antigens to naïve T cells and generation of cell-mediated adaptive immune response. Since tumor micro-environment affects immune cell function in this study we have evaluated the ability of T cells and NK cells in metastatic (involved) and non-metastatic regional LNs to produce interferon γ (IFNγ), a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates adaptive antitumor immune response. Our results show reduced IFNγ production in both T and NK lymphocyte subsets and decreased prevalence of T cells in metastatic regional LNs of melanoma patients. The decrease of IFNγ production in T cells was more pronounced with increased number of involved regional LNs indicating tumor-induced functional impairment of both T and NK cell lymphocyte subsets in involved regional LNs. Therefore, shown low IFNγ production in metastatic LNs may represent an obstacle in adaptive cell-mediated antitumor immune response and hence may enable tumor progression. ",

Fusion hybrids were generated in vitro between weakly metastatic Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma cells and normal mouse or human macrophages. Hybrids were implanted s.c. in the tail and mice were monitored for metastases. Controls included parental S91 cells, autologous S91 x S91 hybrids, and B16F10 melanoma cells. Of 35 hybrids tested, most were more aggressive than the parental melanoma cells, producing metastases sooner and in more mice. A striking characteristic was heterogeneity amongst hybrids, with some lines producing no metastases and others producing metastases in up to 80% of mice. With few exceptions, hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also had the highest basal melanin content whereas those with the lowest metastatic potential were basally amelanotic, as were the parental melanoma cells. A spontaneous in vivo supermelanotic hybrid between an S91 tumor cell and DBA/2J host cell was one of the most metastatic lines. Hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also exhibited markedly higher chemotaxis to fibroblast-conditioned media. Histologically, the metastatic hybrids demonstrated vascular invasion and spread to distant organs similar to that of metastatic melanomas in mice and humans. Thus previous findings of enhanced metastasis in leukocyte x lymphoma hybrids can now be extended to include leukocyte x melanoma hybrids. Whether such hybridization is a natural cause of metastasis in vivo remains to be determined; however the fusion hybrids with genetically-matched parents described herein so closely resembled naturally-occurring metastatic melanoma cells that they could serve as useful new models for studies of this complex and deadly phenomenon.",

In a strictly autologous system, we fused dendritic cells with melanoma cells, both of which were derived from patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Hybridomas were positive for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD40, CD54, CD83, CD86, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12. Autologous T lymphocytes were co-incubated with hybridomas. After 6 days, in-vitro-primed T lymphocytes revealed a strong proliferation activity and released Th-1-associated, but not Th-2-associated, cytokines. Furthermore they showed effective anti-melanoma activity, resulting in death of 70 +/- 9% of autologous melanoma cells. After depletion of CD4+ cells from the mixed population of primed T lymphocytes, the remaining CD8+ cells were able to kill 63+/-8% of autologous melanoma cells. Following depletion of CD8+ cells, however, the cytotoxic capacity of the remaining T lymphocytes caused death in only 32+/-6% of autologous melanoma cells. Blocking of MHC class I, but not class II, molecules on hybridomas impaired T cell proliferation, secretion of Th-1-associated cytokines, as well as the cytotoxic activity of primed T cells. These findings strongly suggest that hybridomas deliver melanoma-associated antigens via MHC class I molecules to T lymphocytes, resulting in the generation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with effective anti-melanoma activity in vitro.

Expression of CD7 decreases in M-CSF-differentiated macrophages and in melanoma-conditioned medium-induced macrophages (MCMI/Mφ) in comparison to monocytes. A ligand for CD7, SECTM1 (secreted and transmembrane protein 1), is highly expressed in many tumors, including melanoma cells. We show that SECTM1 binds to CD7 and significantly increases monocyte migration by activation of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase) pathway. In human melanoma tissues, tumor-infiltrating macrophages expressing CD7 are present. These melanomas, with CD7-positive inflammatory cell infiltrations, frequently highly express SECTM1, including an N-terminal, soluble form, which can be detected in the sera of metastatic melanoma patients but not in normal sera.

Length pattern analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) indicated that the repertoire of T cells expressing some of these BVs was heterogeneous. At difference, CDR3, beta-chain joining region usage, and sequence analysis enabled us to demonstrate, within a T-cell subpopulation commonly expanded at DTH sites and at the postvaccine lesion of patient 1, that both DTH sites contained identical dominant T-cell clonotypes.

It is based on the ex vivo expansion and activation of tumor-specific T lymphocytes extracted from the tumor and their administration back to the patient. Various TIL-ACT trials, which differ in their TIL generation procedures and patient preconditioning, have been reported. In the latest clinical studies, genetically engineered peripheral T cells were utilized instead of TIL. Further improvement of adoptive T cell transfer depends on new investigations which seek higher TIL quality, increased durable response rates, and aim to treat more patients. Simplifying this therapy may encourage cancer centers worldwide to adopt this promising technology. This paper focuses on the latest progress regarding adoptive T cell transfer, comparing the currently available protocols and discussing their advantages, disadvantages, and implication in the future.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The growth and spread of cancer depends as much on the host response to tumor as on the biological characteristics of the tumor itself. This interaction is at its most intimate and dynamic within the tumor microenvironment. It is here that the battle is fought that leads to mutual evolution of tumor and host cell phenotypes. Contributing to this evolutionary process are physiological changes distinctive for the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, low nutrient levels, low extracellular pH, and high interstitial fluid pressure. These largely result from the chaotic intratumoral vasculature but are impacted by the nature of the tumor and the inflammatory and wound healing responses that are generated. Numerous infiltrating immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells infiltrate the tumor, contributing to high levels of growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. We suggest that the integrated interplay between host and tumor factors results in distinct phenotypes that determine the response to therapy as well as tumor behavior. Targeting the tumor microenvironment to awaken or reawaken immune cells, or to redirect it from a pro-tumor to an anti-tumor state, will require understanding of this phenotype. Current conventional therapies target tumors not tumor cells and clearly affect the host infiltrate and the physiological characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. This may an advantage that has yet to be effectively exploited due to lack of knowledge of existing phenotypes resulting from the tumor-host interactions. The same lack of knowledge impacts outcomes of clinical immunotherapy (IT) trials that have so far not broken through the ceiling of 10% success rate that seems to exist even in melanoma. It seems obvious that more could be achieved by combining therapies that tackle malignancies from multiple angles, with the tumor microenvironment conditioned to support a powerful effector arm generated by IT. The challenge is how to design combination therapies that modify the tumor microenvironment so as to promote immunity and better combat both local and systemic disease.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Modern immunotherapy of human cancer has evolved as a rapidly expanding field of clinical and experimental research. Employing the systemic application of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) in humans, Rosenberg and colleagues from the National Cancer Institute reported the regression of advanced metastatic tumors in approximately 10%-30% of patients treated. The additional adoptive transfer of autologous patient-derived activated lymphocytes was performed to enhance therapeutic efficacy. While the exact mechanisms of IL-2 based immunotherapy in cancer remain unclear, it has been hypothesized that both the IL-2 activated lymphocyte and its secretory products such as interferon-gamma or tumor-necrosis factor beta may contribute to the lysis of tumor cells in vivo. Accordingly, research has been directed toward enhancing both the activation state and the specificity of IL-2 induced killer cells in humans. Based on in vitro and animal data, the retransfusion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been shown to mediate the regression of metastatic neoplasms in up to 50% of patients receiving systemic IL-2. Considerable toxicity from the use of high-dose IL-2 has prompted attempts to develop low-dose regimens which allow for the outpatient treatment of patients presenting poor prognosis. While in most clinical trials involving IL-2, patient follow-up has been short, and no or only limited data have become available from controlled prospective and randomized clinical studies, IL-2 has shown some promise in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or malignant melanoma. Novel approaches toward the improvement of clinical efficacy of IL-2 include local (e.g., intracavitary) application or combinations with other cytokines such as interferon-alpha or cytostatic drugs.",

Secondary objectives included validation of the gene delivery technology (particle-mediated gene transfer), determining the host immune response to the tumor after vaccination, and monitoring patients for evidence of antitumor response. Sixteen patients were treated with either of two different doses of GM-CSF-treated tumor cells. One patient received treatment with both doses of tumor cells. No treatment-related local or systemic toxicity was noted in any patient. Patients administered 100% treated cells (i.e., with a preparation of tumor cells that had all been exposed to GM-CSF DNA transfection) had a more extensive lymphocytic infiltrate at the vaccine site than did patients given 10% treated cells (a preparation of tumor cells in which 10% had been exposed to GM-CSF transfection) or nontreated tumor. The generation of a systemic immune response to autologous tumor by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the intradermal placement of nontransfected tumor cells was noted in one patient. One patient had a transient partial response of metastatic tumor sites. The entire procedure, from tumor removal to vaccine placement, was accomplished in less than 6 hr in all patients.

However, only DCs pulsed with apoptotic cells were able to induce proliferation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and stimulate antigen-specific T cells. This study demonstrates for the first time that DCs derived from melanoma patients process and present antigens derived from both HLA-matched or HLA-mismatched human apoptotic tumor cells stimulating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

It was hypothesized that continuous expression of IL-15 within a tumor would recruit cytotoxic effector cells to induce an antitumor immune response and improve treatment efficacy. Weekly intratumoral injections were given to evaluate the effect of treatment on the median survival time of C57BL/6 mice bearing established B16F10 melanomas. Mice that received MYXV-Tred or MYXV-IL15 lived significantly longer than mice given treatment controls. Unexpectedly, the median survival time of MYXV-IL15-treated mice was similar to that of MYXV-treated mice. At 1, 2, and 4 days postinoculation, viral plaque assays detected replicating MYXV-Tred and MYXV-IL15 within treated tumors. At these time points in MYXV-IL15-treated tumors, IL-15 concentration, lymphocyte grades, and cluster of differentiation-3+ cell counts were significantly increased when compared to other treatment groups. However, viral titers, recombinant protein expression, and lymphocyte numbers within the tumors diminished rapidly at 7 days postinoculation. These data indicate that treatment with recombinant MYXV should be repeated at least every 4 days to maintain recombinant protein expression within a murine tumor. Additionally, neutrophilic inflammation was significantly increased in MYXV-Tred- and MYXV-IL15-treated tumors at early time points.

We are reporting here three cases of high grade tumors that were studied by a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel including cytokeratins, S100, HMB-45, Melan A, Tyrosinase, and MITF.

Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases.

Although RA failed to exhibit direct toxicity on this variant at the concentration used, the immunologic aberrations induced by the tumors were diminished by i.p.

The presence of these tumor cells decreased the absolute number of CD4- and CD8-positive splenic lymphocytes. Following RA treatment, the CD8-positive population was increased in tumor-bearing mice, while the CD4+ population was not significantly altered. Since previous studies indicated that plasma membrane fragments (or vesicles) could alter lymphocyte distributions and proliferative capacities, the in vitro shedding of membrane fragments from B16-F10 tumor cells was assayed and observed to be decreased after continuous treatment of cultures with 10(-6) M RA for 21 days.

In this study, we validated Foxp3 expression in both tumor-infiltrating Tregs and melanoma cells by performing immunohistochemical analysis of human melanoma tissue sections. Further, we assessed Foxp3 expression in melanoma cell lines by performing flow cytometry, confocal microscopic analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blotting. Inhibition of Foxp3 expression in melanoma cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in downregulation of B7-H1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β expression; in contrast, Foxp3 overexpression resulted in the upregulation of the expression of these proteins. Coculture of Foxp3-expressing melanoma cells with naive CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells resulted in strong inhibition of T-cell proliferation. This antiproliferative effect was partially abrogated by specific inhibition of Foxp3 expression and was effectively enhanced by overexpression of Foxp3. We observed an attenuated antiproliferative effect even when melanoma cells and T cells in the coculture were separated using Transwell inserts. These findings indicated that melanoma cells could have Foxp3-dependent Treg-like suppressive effects on T cells and suggested that the mimicking of Treg function by melanoma cells may represent a possible mechanism of tumor resistance to immune destruction in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.",

In this study, we sought to study whether 4-1BBL, expressed in normal tissue cells, inhibits the growth and metastasis of tumor. The expressing plasmid, p4-1BBL, was constructed and was used to treat established melanoma in situ model and metastasis tumor model mice, respectively, with injecting directly into the skeletal muscle of the inoculation site and systemically administering plasmid with the hydrodynamics-based gene-delivery approach. Administration of p4-1BBL resulted in high-level expression in the muscle and liver. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with 4-1BBL plasmid DNA significantly suppressed the growth and metastasis of melanoma without significant toxicity, compared with mice treated with control-plasmid DNA. This treatment with plasmid p4-1BBL in vivo induced an infiltration of CD8(+) T-cells into the tumor milieu and an increase of levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. Our study suggests that 4-1BBL expressed in normal tissue cells has significant antitumor activity and may have therapeutic potential as an antitumor agent in the clinic. Directly intramuscular injection peritumor and hydrodynamic intravenous injection may provide promising immune gene-therapy approaches for different tumor clinical stages.",

The results were related to simultaneously performed microcytotoxicity (MC) tests, HL-A typing, plasma membrane fluorescence and B:T cell ratios in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, lymphocytes from six melanoma patients were tested in CMC and ADCC assays against autologous tumour cells. The following results were obtained. (1) A large number of healthy controls possessed lymphocytes which readily lysed M1 target cells in CMC and MC assays. (2) CMC activity of lymphocytes from melanoma patients was generally lower than that of control lymphocytes and decreased further with progression of the disease. (3) CLL lymphocytes were virtually non-toxic for M1 cells, even at high aggressor:target cell ratios. (4) ADCC assays with a heterologous rabbit-anti-M1 serum showed generally higher isotope release than CMC assays; this was particularly pronounced in the melanoma group and in the group of patients with other tumours. (5) No tumour-specific blocking factor could be detected in melanoma sera, as judged by the capacity of the sera to block CMC activity. (6) No obvious correlation was found between the results obtained in short-term CMC and long-term MC assays. (7) T lymphocytes, as determined by E-rosette formation, were significantly diminished in melanoma patients. (8) The HL-A type of lymphocytes from normal donors and melanoma patients did not appear to be related to high or low activity in CMC and MC assays.

Animals were treated with daily injections of cyclosporine, and tumor growth was followed by serial fundus examinations and ultrasonography. When a tumor exceeded 3 mm in thickness (tumor height ranged from 3.1-4.6 mm), the authors administered benzoporphyrin derivative intravenously (1 mg/kg) and irradiated the tumor at 692-nm through an argon-pumped dye laser at different total light doses ranging from 60 to 120 J/cm2. Control animals were treated with light or benzoporphyrin derivative only. Each animal then was followed-up for 4 to 6 weeks by fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and ultrasonography.;All animals treated with benzoporphyrin derivative and light at fluences of > or = 80 J/cm2 showed complete tumor arrest. In contrast, both control groups showed continuous tumor growth in all animals with tumors filling most of the vitreous cavity by 3 weeks. Histologic examination results of tumors treated with dye plus light immediately after treatment showed prominent vascular closure. No vascular changes were noted in the control eye treated with light or dye alone.

Histology was available in 22 cases. Tumour tissue was evaluated for cell type, vascularization, necrosis, pigmentation, and lymphocytic infiltration, and immunohistochemistry was performed with 225.28S and antibodies against HMB-45, S-100 and vimentin. One hundred and two patients with metastasizing cutaneous melanoma served as controls.

In five patients who turned out not to have melanoma, two false-positive results were obtained (one subretinal hemorrhage and one Wegener's granulomatosis). No correlation was found between any of the histological features or the immunoreactivity pattern and the immunoscintigraphic outcome. However, antigenic differences between ocular and cutaneous melanoma were evident.;We conclude that IS, using the antibody applied in this study, is of only limited value in patients with ocular melanoma.

The primary tissue and nodes were examined using immunohistochemical techniques for the presence of HLA-DR antigen and HSP-70 protein and the expression of the c-myc oncogene.;Of 40 patients, there were 23 with lesions 1 to 2.9 mm thick and 17 with lesions 3 to 4 mm thick. Nodal metastases were present in 25 of the 40 patients who had elective node dissection. HLA-DR antibody stained the primary tumor in 10 patients (25%), but there was no correlation with survival in this group. HLA-DR antibody stained the stroma and cellular infiltrates surrounding the primary tumor in 28 of 40 patients; in this group there was a correlation of HLA-DR staining of the peritumoral stroma with improved survival overall. HLA-DR staining of the peritumoral stroma also influenced survival when patients were stratified by tumor thickness groups 1 to 2.9 mm and 3 to 4 mm and presence of nodal metastases. HSP-70 was demonstrated in the primary tumor in 25% of patients, who were also shown to have significantly improved survival when compared with those whose primary tumor did not stain with HSP-70. C-myc was expressed in the primary tumor in 25%, but showed no correlation with survival. None of these proteins correlated with or predicted the presence of nodal metastases.;We conclude that the use of specific molecular-oncogene markers in intermediate-thickness primary melanoma may identify patients at high risk for conventional treatment failure and reduced survival who may profit from more aggressive surgery, adjuvant therapy, or both.",

Most tumors appear as echopoor areas in high-frequency sonography. Until today, a differentiation between skin tumors by means of high-frequency ultrasound is not possible. This is also true concerning the differentiation between the tumor tissue itself and its subtumoral inflammatory infiltration. Therefore, this lack of differentiation leads to the fact that sonometric thicknesses of tumors often exceed the originally measured tumor thickness in histology. By means of three-dimensional reconstruction of serial b-scan images, it is possible to determine each tumor's volume and surface as well as the topographical arrangement of echopoor areas and sonographical structures. Besides high-frequency ultrasound, additional non-invasive techniques like MRI, ultrasound- or laser-doppler, computer-aided image analysis and epiluminescence microscopy are also available for diagnosing malignant melanoma. Epiluminescence microscopy is used today as a standard technique in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma due to the possibility of differential diagnosis.

We find that Notch3 is specifically upregulated in melanoma-endothelial cell cocultures and is functionally associated with increased Notch signaling in melanoma cells. Furthermore, induced Notch3 signaling in melanoma cell lines leads to enhanced tumor cell migration without associated increases in tumor cell growth.

The antitumor effects of locally produced IL-12 were examined in 2 tumor model systems. IL-12 expressing EMT6 mammary sarcomas (EMT6/IL-12) grew temporarily and then regressed resulting in mice that were immune to a further challenge of EMT6 cells. Interestingly, the IL-12 expressing K1735 melanomas (K1735/IL-12) maintained a lag phase of nonmeasurable growth for several weeks, followed by tumor outgrowth that was associated with a loss of IL-12 production. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from EMT6/IL-12 tumors effectively lysed EMT6 target cells, whereas K1735/IL-12 TILs lacked lytic activity. Both IL-12 expressing tumors, however, grew progressively in nude mice indicating an important role for T cells in each case. Recombinant murine interferon gamma (rmIFN-gamma) inhibited the growth of EMT6 cells, but not K1735 cells in vitro, and strongly induced the expression of the antiangiogenic chemokine interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) by both cell lines. Of interest, only the EMT6 cell line was able to secrete the proangiogenic molecule, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in response to low oxygen conditions. Fluorescent staining of the vascular endothelium at the tumor injection site provided images depicting early stages of angiogenesis prior to K1735/IL-12 tumor outgrowth. These results indicate that locally produced IL-12 likely mediates the rejection of EMT6 tumors through tumor cell lysis by host immune cells, whereas its antiangiogenic potential may be counterbalanced by the strong induction of VEGF by hypoxic tumor cells. In contrast, IL-12 does not induce protective immunity to K1735 tumors. However, an antiangiogenic mechanism may be responsible for controlling tumor growth.",

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression determined factors associated with a low risk of SLN positivity. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to stratify groups based on risk of positivity.;Of the 952 study patients, 157 (16.5 %) had a positive SLN. In the multivariate analysis, thickness <1.5 mm (odds ratio [OR] 0.29), age ≥60 (OR 0.69), present tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (OR 0.60), absent lymphovascular invasion (OR 0.46), and absent satellitosis (OR 0.44) were significantly associated with a low risk of SLN positivity. CART analysis identified thickness of 1.5 mm as the primary cut point for risk of SLN metastasis.

In many cancers, hyaluronan synthesis is altered, which implicates disease progression and metastatic potential. We have previously shown that synthesis of hyaluronan and expression of its synthases 1-2 (HAS1-2) decrease in cutaneous melanoma, compared to benign melanocytic lesions.;In the present study, we compared immunohistological staining results of HAS1 and HAS2 with clinical and histopathological parameters to investigate whether HAS1 or HAS2 has prognostic value in cutaneous melanoma. The specimens consisted of 129 tissue samples including superficial (Breslow ≤ 1 mm) and deep (Breslow > 4 mm) melanomas and lymph node metastases. The differences in immunostainings were analysed with non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Associations between immunohistological staining results and clinical parameters were determined with the χ(2) test. Survival between patient groups was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method using log rank test and Cox's regression model was used for multivariate analyses.;The expression of HAS1 and HAS2 was decreased in deep melanomas and metastases compared to superficial melanomas. Decreased immunostaining of HAS2 in melanoma cells was significantly associated with several known unfavourable histopathologic prognostic markers like increased mitotic count, absence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the nodular subtype. Furthermore, reduced HAS1 and HAS2 immunostaining in the melanoma cells was associated with increased recurrence of melanoma (p = 0.041 and p = 0.006, respectively) and shortened disease- specific survival (p = 0.013 and p = 0.001, respectively).;This study indicates that reduced expression of HAS1 and HAS2 is associated with melanoma progression and suggests that HAS1 and HAS2 have a prognostic significance in cutaneous melanoma.",

In the present study, we investigated the occurrence, the in vivo relevance, and the underlying mechanisms of cannibalism in human melanoma. As first evidence, we observed that tumor cannibalism was clearly detectable in vivo in metastatic lesions of melanoma and often involved T cells, which could be found in a degraded state within tumor cells. Then, in vitro experiments confirmed that cannibalism of T cells was a property of metastatic melanoma cells but not of primary melanoma cells. In particular, morphologic analyses, including time-lapse cinematography and electron microscopy, revealed a sequence of events, in which metastatic melanoma cells were able to engulf and digest live autologous melanoma-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, this cannibalistic activity significantly increased metastatic melanoma cell survival, particularly under starvation condition, supporting the evidence that tumor cells may use the eating of live lymphocytes as a way to \"feed\" in condition of low nutrient supply. The mechanism underlying cannibalism involved a complex framework, including lysosomal protease cathepsin B activity, caveolae formation, and ezrin cytoskeleton integrity and function. In conclusion, our study shows that human metastatic melanoma cells may eat live T cells, which are instead programmed to kill them, suggesting a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape. Moreover, our data suggest that cannibalism may represent a sort of \"feeding\" activity aimed at sustaining survival and progression of malignant tumor cells in an unfavorable microenvironment.",

We exploited the selection power of phage display that allows for the testing of tens of billions of individual clones with a high-throughput selection of Fabs with peptide/MHC complex binding capacity. Following in vitro selection, human \"TCR-like\" Fab fragments have been functionally expressed on human T-lymphocytes, resulting in MHC-restricted, tumor-specific lysis and cytokine production.

This semiquantitative RT-PCR method could be adapted to analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histopathological samples of primary tumor material and demonstrated to be reproducible and to be useful for the assessment of V alpha- and V beta-gene family usage in tumor samples. The TIL in primary tumors were observed to preferentially express certain TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene families: V alpha 4, and V beta 8 were highly expressed in several of the primary tumors analyzed using this method. With respect to V alpha 22 and V beta 8, the preferential expression of these V-gene families was demonstrated to be due in situ clonal expansion of T cells by means of cloning and sequencing of the CDR3 regions (V-J or V-D-J, respectively) corresponding to the RT-PCR products from one of the primary tumors. The observed preferential usage of certain TCR V alpha and V beta-genes strongly suggest the in situ clonal expansion of specific populations of T cells in accordance with recent results from others. These clonal T cell populations probably react with certain melanoma-associated peptides presented by specific HLA molecules. The preferential usage of certain V alpha- and V beta-gene families observed in several tumors further supports the involvement of a limited number of shared melanocyte or melanoma-associated peptides. Since the HLA status of the patients is obviously important to interpret these results, some of the patients were typed for HLA-A1 and -A2, the two most well-characterized restriction elements for melanoma-associated antigens, either serologically or by a newly developed RT-PCR method which similarly could by applied directly to the tumor material. In TIL in primary melanomas, a possible correlation was suggested between HLA-A2 and the preferential usage of the TCR V-gene families V alpha 4, V alpha 5, V alpha 22 and V beta 8, whereas the V beta 3-gene family appeared to be expressed together with HLA-A1. The V-gene families which were highly expressed in the primary tumors were generally not, or only very weakly, expressed in the corresponding metastases and vice versa, possibly reflecting a substantial change in the phenotype of the metastatic melanoma target cells. Continued studies of larger patient materials will be necessary to extend and validate these conclusions and of obvious interest for the further analysis of the T cell response in melanoma.",

In coculture experiments, astrocytes, but not fibroblasts, reduced apoptosis in human melanoma cells treated with various chemotherapeutic drugs. This chemoprotective effect was dependent on physical contact and gap junctional communication between astrocytes and tumor cells. Moreover, the protective effect of astrocytes resulted from their sequestering calcium from the cytoplasm of tumor cells.

In this work, the cytotoxicity of MB was measured by MTT method in erythroleukemic and melanoma lineages, comparing it with that of normal cells:lymphocytes and melanocytes. MB was more cytotoxic for tumoral cells; however, there was no difference between erytroleukemic cells with or without MDR phenotype.

We tried to analyze whether the cells were dying, via apoptosis or necrosis, using Anexin-V and propidium iodide.

The studies have involved rIL-2 or polyethylene-glycol conjugated rIL-2 (PEG-IL-2) as single agents, combinations of rIL-2 with recombinant interferon alpha, IL-4, or doxorubicin, and trials of rIL-2 with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These studies are summarized and involve Phase I or Phase II investigations in patients with renal cell carcinoma (191 patients), malignant melanoma (49 patients) or miscellaneous solid tumors (97 patients). Response rates in each category, respectively, were 12%, 20% and 2%. Toxicity varied depending on the regimen and generally reflected the dose and schedule of rIL-2 being employed. This series of clinical studies demonstrates the role of rIL-2 in various malignancies and documents the activity in patients with malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adoptive cell transfer (ACT), either using rapidly expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or T-cell receptor transduced peripheral blood lymphocytes, can be considered one of the most promising approaches in cancer immunotherapy. ACT results in the repopulation of the host with high frequencies of tumor-specific T cells; however, optimal function of these cells within the tumor micro-environment is required to reach long-term tumor clearance. We and others have shown that ongoing anti-tumor immune responses can be impaired by the expression of ligands, such as PD-L1 (B7-H1) on tumor cells. Such inhibitory molecules can affect T cells at the effector phase via their receptor PD-1. PD-L1/PD-1 interaction has indeed been shown crucial in inducing T-cell anergy and maintaining peripheral tolerance. In order to maximize anti-tumor responses, antibodies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are currently in phase I/II trials. Alternatively, a more refined approach could be the selective targeting of PD-1 in tumor-specific T cells to obtain long-term resistance against PD-1-mediated inhibition. We addressed whether this goal could be achieved by means of retroviral siRNA delivery. Effective siRNA sequences resulting in the reduction of surface PD-1 expression led to improved murine as well as human T-cell immune functions in response to PD-L1 expressing melanoma cells. These data suggest that blockade of PD-1-mediated T-cell inhibition through siRNA forms a promising approach to achieve long-lasting enhancement of tumor-specific T-cell function in adoptive T-cell therapy protocols.",

More recently with the remarkable mushroom of immunology, newer tools became available, resulting in the novel possibility to attack cancer with the specificity of the immune system. Herein we will review some of the recent achievement of immunotherapy in such aggressive cancers as melanoma, prostatic cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies. Immunotherapy of tumors has developed several techniques: immune cell transfer, vaccines, immunobiological molecules such as monoclonal antibodies that improve the immune responses to tumors. This can be achieved by blocking pathways limiting the immune response, such as CTLA-4 or Tregs. Immunotherapy may also use cytokines especially proinflammatory cytokines to enhance the activity of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) derived from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The role of newly discovered cytokines remains to be investigated. Alternatively, an other mechanism consists in enhancing the expression of TAAs on tumor cells.

The success of TIL therapy has led to novel strategies for redirecting normal T cells to recognize tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by genetically engineering tumor antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genes. In this manner, large numbers of antigen-specific T cells can be rapidly generated compared with the longer term expansion of TILs. Great efforts have been made to improve these approaches. Initial clinical studies have demonstrated that genetically engineered T cells can mediate tumor regression in vivo. In this review, we discuss the development of TCR and CAR gene-engineered T cells and the safety concerns surrounding the use of these T cells in patients.

No association was found between p53 expression and Breslow thickness or presence of nodal and skin metastases. Overexpression of p53 was associated with ulceration, mitotic figures and lymphocytic infiltration, and there was a striking increase of p53 expression with age. Expression of p53 was inversely correlated with disease-free interval.;Although overexpression of p53 is common in melanoma, there was no association with major clinical parameters such as Breslow thickness and overall survival.

We hypothesized that a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor could sensitize tumor cells to immunotherapy because this class of agents has been reported to increase tumor antigen expression and shift gene expression to a proapoptotic milieu in cancer cells. To test this question, we treated B16 murine melanoma with the combination of the HDAC inhibitor LAQ824 and the adoptive transfer of gp100 melanoma antigen-specific pmel-1 T cells. The combined therapy significantly improved antitumor activity through several mechanisms: (a) increase in MHC and tumor-associated antigen expression by tumor cells; (b) decrease in competing endogenous lymphocytes in recipient mice, resulting in a proliferative advantage for the adoptively transferred cells; and (c) improvement in the functional activity of the adoptively transferred lymphocytes. We confirmed the beneficial effects of this HDAC inhibitor as a sensitizer to immunotherapy in a different model of prophylactic prime-boost vaccination with the melanoma antigen tyrosinase-related protein 2, which also showed a significant improvement in antitumor activity against B16 melanoma. In conclusion, the HDAC inhibitor LAQ824 significantly enhances tumor immunotherapy through effects on target tumor cells as well as improving the antitumor activity of tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes.",

The addition of PM into the TIL cytotoxicity assay produced a concentration-dependent suppression of TIL cytotoxicity with up to 71% inhibition of autologous tumor killing at the 1:1 PM:TIL ratio. Inhibition was not target-specific, as killing of NK-sensitive (K562), NK-resistant (M14), and autologous tumor targets were equally suppressed. Nor was inhibition specific for lung TIL, as similar inhibition was observed with melanoma and renal TIL. Using a model system, we demonstrated that both CD3+ antigen-specific and CD56+ nonspecific lymphocytes are susceptible to the suppressive effects of the PM. Direct co-incubation of PM and TIL for 4 to 44 h resulted in progressive suppression of TIL proliferation and cytotoxicity. TIL cytotoxicity remained suppressed even if PM were removed from the co-culture after 24 h, but was restored if the separated TIL were re-incubated in interleukin-2.

Sixty percent of all lymphocytes were recovered in this monocyte-depleted lymphocyte fraction (LF). In contrast, with the corresponding unfractionated lymphocytes (UL) the LF cells were not spontaneously cytotoxic on T24 bladder carcinoma, NKI-1, NKI-7, NKI-8, NKI-10 melanoma, and MC-1 mammary carcinoma cell line cells and target cells derived from two short-term melanona cultures (Me 215 and Me 223). SC of the LF could be restored by reconstitution with autologous monocytes, which were obtained > 80% pure in the same velocity sedimentation procedure. Addition of 4-8% monocytes was sufficient to restore the SC of the LF to the level achieved with the corresponding UL, whereas maximal induction of SC was observed after addition of 8-16% monocytes. Higher numbers of monocytes had suboptimal effects. SC of the LF could also be restored by monocyte culture supernatants. The spontaneous cytotoxic effector cells were characterized as non-E rosette-forming, membrane sIg-negative Fc-receptor-bearing lymphocytes, a proportion of which probably also bear C3-receptors. Since the LF was not spontaneously cytotoxic, in spite of the presence of Fc-receptor bearing lymphocytes, it is concluded that monocyte help, mediated via soluble factors, is required. Evidence is presented that the lack of SC by the LF might be attributable to the failure of these cells to make appropriate contact with the target cells. LF/target cell contact followed by target cell kill occurred after addition of monocytes. Effector/target cell contacts, artificially established by agglutinins, did not result in target cell kill. Thus the effector/target cell contacts observed in the presence of monocytes suggest recognition of particular membraner determinants involved in SC. An identical requirement for monocytes was observed with LF cells from 5 stage 1 and 5 stage 11 melanoma patients tested for SC against both melanoma and non-melanoma target cells. This indicates that either the cytotoxicity against melanoma cells with lymphocytes from melanoma patients is of the same nature as the SC of lymphocytes from healthy donors, or that specific melanoma-associated cellular cytotoxicioty also requires monocyte help.",

Surface marker analysis revealed that TILs and PBLs mainly consisted of CD3+ T cells and that TILs generally displayed a lower CD4/CD8 ratio. Differences were found in the expression of CD25 (IL-2 receptor) and DR (MHC class II) antigens, which were increased in TILs, and in the percentage of CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells, which was reduced in TILs as compared to PBLs. Accordingly, the NK activity of TILs was lower than that of PBLs, whereas neither TILs nor PBLs expressed spontaneous cytolytic activity against fresh autologous tumor cells, melanoma cells and the \"NK-resistant\" A549 lung carcinoma cell line. After 4 days of culture in medium with recombinant-interleukin-2 (rIL-2), TILs and PBLs acquired cytolytic activity against all cell targets, but TILs expressed higher levels of cytotoxicity than autologous PBLs only in 3 patients out of 16 tested. More importantly, both TILs and PBLs displayed similar levels of cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. TILs and PBLs from 8 patients were also analyzed by a limiting dilution microculture system. Cloning efficiency was remarkably lower in TILs, and surface marker analysis of T cell clones confirmed that an accumulation of CD8+ lymphocytes, which displayed cytolytic activity in a lectin-dependent assay, occurred at the tumor site. The non-MHC-restricted cytolytic activity of TIL- and PBL-derived T cell clones against K562, A549, and allogeneic melanoma cells and the cytolytic activity against autologous tumor cells showed no significant differences. Only 53% of TIL clones released IL-2 in response to PHA + TPA stimulation, whereas 68% of PBL-derived clones were IL-2 producers. Moreover, most PBL- and TIL-derived clones released tumor necrosis factor alpha in response to mitogen stimulation.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate expression and targeting of gangliosides on canine melanoma. Using immunohistochemical methods, we analyzed the expression of disialogangliosides GD2 and GD3 on canine oral malignant melanomas with murine Mabs 14.G2a and R24 that recognize GD2 and GD3 disialogangliosides, respectively, on human tumors. We also assessed the ability of Mab 14.G2a (and its mouse-human chimera, ch 14.18) to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro against a canine malignant melanoma cell line with human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated canine peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), or canine neutrophil effector cells. Our data show that Mabs 14.G2a and R24 recognized fresh frozen canine oral melanoma. Mabs 14.G2a or ch 14.18, or IL-2, potentiated lysis of the canine malignant melanoma cell line by canine PBL. The killing effect observed using the combination of either Mab with IL-2 was additive. Mab 14.G2a mediated potent ADCC of canine melanoma by canine neutrophils. These studies indicate that disialogangliosides are expressed on fresh canine melanoma cells. Mabs reactive with these antigens can target and trigger tumor killing by multiple canine effector populations and IL-2 can potentiate these effects by canine lymphocytes. Thus, canine oral malignant melanoma, a spontaneously occurring, metastatic cancer in the dog, may be a relevant animal model to investigate combination immunotherapy using antitumor Mab and IL-2.",

It has been demonstrated that ncRNAs play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. However, little is known about ncRNAs in lymphocytes. In this study, we investigated the presence of ncRNAs in lymphocytes of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16 melanoma by using the differential display reverse transcription-PCR (DD-RT-PCR). PKR is a serine/threonine kinase containing two RNA-binding domains within the N-terminal region. We took advantage of the ability of RNAs to bind PKR in order to identify ncRNAs of lymphocytes activated during tumor development. Thus, RNAs that co-immunoprecipitated with PKR were reversed transcribed, re-amplified, cloned, sequenced and the secondary structure was determined. The ability of transcripts obtained by in vitro transcription to activate PKR was also examined. We detected a highly structured transcript of 220 nt with no open reading frame (ORF) which is able to activate PKR, and it is only expressed in lymphocytes of C57BL/6 mice bearing B16 melanoma. Therefore, the 220 nt transcript may be included in the class of ncRNAs that act by modifying protein activity and our data suggest that regulation of gene expression in activated lymphocytes by this ncRNA could be mediated by PKR through the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.",

Herein, we investigated whether lovastatin treatment affects the function of human cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Upon T-cell receptor stimulation, lovastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from healthy donors whereas their intracellular cytokine production including interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α remained the same with a slight decrease of interleukin-2. Moreover, the specific lysis of target cells by CTL lines derived from patients and normal donors specific for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded antigen latent membrane protein-2 or cytomegalovirus-encoded antigen pp65 was uncompromised in the presence of lovastatin. In addition, we evaluated the effect of lovastatin on the proliferation and effector function of the CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) derived from melanoma patients specific for MART-1 antigen. Lovastatin significantly reduced the expansion of antigen-specific TILs upon MART-1 stimulation. However, the effector function of TILs, including the specific lysis of target cells and secretion of cytokine interferon-γ, remained intact with lovastatin treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrated that lovastatin inhibits the proliferation of Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and MART-1-specific CTLs without affecting cytolytic capacity. The differential effect of lovastatin on the proliferation versus cytotoxicity of CTLs might shed some light on elucidating the possible mechanisms of graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-tumor effect elicited by alloimmune responses.",

The most important predictor in the CART analysis was Breslow thickness. Absence of an inflammatory infiltrate, patient age, and tumor location were predictive of SN metastasis in patients with tumors thicker than 2mm. In the case of thinner melanomas, the predictors were mitotic rate (>6 mitoses/mm(2)), presence of ulceration, and tumor thickness. Patient age, mitotic rate, and tumor thickness and location were predictive of survival.;A high mitotic rate predicts a higher risk of SN involvement and worse survival.

Although ACT utilizing ex vivo expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or engineered CAR/TCR T cells have undergone clinical trials for other solid cancers, their efficacy to date has been limited. This may be due, in part, to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment.

A crucial step in this research effort has been the derivation of an allogeneic cell line (FO1-12) that expresses both a dominant selectable marker (neomycin resistance) and a recessive selectable marker (sensitivity to hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine), which allows easy selection of semiallogeneic cell hybrids derived from the fusion of FO1-12 cells with patient-derived tumor cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from select patients with melanoma and exposed to semiallogeneic cell hybrids from the same patient were better able to specifically lyse autologous tumor cells. Furthermore, FO1-12 cells express carcinoembryonic antigen, which is ubiquitous in adenocarcinomas, and fusion of FO1-12 cells with various patient-derived adenocarcinoma cells showed that the hybrid cells also express carcinoembryonic antigen. Because of the results of these preclinical studies, the authors were given permission to use semiallogeneic cell hybrids for immunotherapy of patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic adenocarcinoma who had not responded to standard treatment regimens.

The present study aimed to examine the relationship between the presence of ulceration and the mitotic rate and clinicopathological characteristics and melanoma patient survival, and to discuss the results in the context of AJCC melanoma staging recommendations. Tissue samples were obtained from 104 patients treated for CMM. In classical H&E staining, the mitotic rate and the presence of ulceration were evaluated. Non-mitogenic tumors were defined as having 0 mitoses/mm2, low mitogenic potential, 1-2 mitoses/mm2 and highly mitogenic tumors, ≥3 mitoses/mm2. In the entire group of 104 patients, a high mitotic rate (hMR) and ulceration were highly negative prognostic factors, and indicated considerably shorter overall survival, cancer-specific overall survival and disease-free survival. Notably, hMR appeared to have a statistically significant negative impact on survival in early melanomas in both the pT1 (P=0.001) and pT2 subgroups (P=0.006). Kaplan‑Meier analysis of the remaining subsets (pT3 and pT4) did not reveal any important differences in the 5-year survival with regard to MR values. The presence of ulceration also had a prognostic significance for early melanomas, but only for pT1 tumors (P=0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that hMR was strongly associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Ulceration had no prognostic significance in the Cox proportional hazards model. Considering the biology of melanoma, hMR seems to be a more reliable parameter than the presence of ulceration. The value of MR categorizes melanomas into tumors with low or high proliferative potential, thus giving direct information concerning their capacity to infiltrate deeper layers of the dermis and, potentially, to generate regional lymph node and distant metastases.",

In addition, we administered HuIFN-beta into cutaneous metastatic lesions of melanoma and evaluated clinical and histopathological effects. Although the size of the metastatic cutaneous lesion did not change by the intralesional injection of HuIFN-beta, histopathological examination revealed apoptotic changes of melanoma cells along with dense lymphohistiocytic infiltration.

Using lymphocytes from regional lymph nodes, peripheral blood and tumor infiltrates, 158 fusions were performed with SKO-007 (human myeloma line), LICR-LON-HMy2 (LICR-2), GM 4672 (human lymphoblastoid lines), or NS-1 (mouse myeloma line). Fusion of lymph node lymphocytes with NS-1 resulted in a 3-4 times higher frequency of clones than fusion with LICR-2, and a 10 times higher frequency than fusion with SKO-007 or GM 4672. In the case of peripheral blood lymphocytes, fusion with NS-1 gave greater than 25 times higher frequency of clones than fusion with LICR-2 or SKO-007. Production of human mu, gamma, or alpha heavy chains was detected in 50-80% of wells containing growing clones, and the levels of immunoglobulin ranged from 0.3 micrograms to 40 micrograms/ml. NS-1-derived clones could be easily subcultured, while LICR-2 and SKO-007 clones grew more slowly on subculturing. In this study, Ig secretion appeared to be a more stable property of LICR-2-derived clones than NS-1-derived clones. A panel of 20 human cancer cell lines was used to screen 771 Ig-secreting cultures for antibody to cell surface or intracellular antigens. Reactivity with cell surface antigens was found infrequently (6 cultures), whereas reactivity with intracellular antigens was more common (27 cultures). A new cell surface antigen with properties of a glycolipid was defined with an IgM monoclonal antibody secreted by a tetraploid cell derived from a fusion of LICR-2 with lymphocytes from the axillary lymph node of a patient with melanoma. The hybrid cell line has been subcloned four times and secretes 5 micrograms IgM/ml. The antigen detected by this IgM antibody was found on 5 of 23 melanoma cell lines and 12 of 30 epithelial cancer cell lines. No reactions were found with 11 cultures derived from normal cells. Stable cell lines secreting human antibody that detected nuclei, nucleoli, cytoskeletal elements, Golgi complex, or other cytoplasmic components were also isolated in this study. One of these antibodies detected an intracellular antigen that is restricted to cells of neuroectodermal derivation, and a second antibody reacted primarily with cells of epithelial origin. Using these methods to isolate and analyze human monoclonal antibody, it should now be possible to define the repertoire of the humoral immune response to melanoma.",

In this study, we profiled immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a B-RafV600E/Pten-driven murine model of melanoma after administration of the B-Raf(V600E) small molecule inhibitor PLX4720. In this model, we found that as tumors developed, they gradually acquired immunosuppressive features, including accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells and loss of Th1 effector functions on CD4(+) TILs, such as CD40L and IFNγ expression. PLX4720 administration promoted development of a more immune stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in CD40L and IFNγ expression on intratumoral CD4(+) TILs and a reduced accumulation of Tregs and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells. Strikingly, CD40L or IFNγ blockade compromised the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit melanoma growth. Supporting this result, agonistic CD40 antibody was sufficient to evoke antitumor immunity and suppress tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice.

        "Doc_abstract":"Targeted therapy against the BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of melanoma. Treatment with selective BRAF inhibitors results in a high initial response rate but limited duration of response. To counter this, investigators propose combining this therapy with other targeted agents, addressing the issue of redundancy and signaling through different oncogenic pathways. An alternative approach is combining BRAF/MAPK-targeted agents with immunotherapy. Preliminary evidence suggests that oncogenic BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) contributes to immune escape and that blocking its activity via MAPK pathway inhibition leads to increased expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDA). Recognition of MDAs is a critical component of the immunologic response to melanoma, and several forms of immunotherapy capitalize on this recognition. Among the various approaches to inhibiting BRAF/MAPK, broad MAPK pathway inhibition may have deleterious effects on T lymphocyte function. Here, we corroborate the role of oncogenic BRAF in immune evasion by melanoma cells through suppression of MDAs. We show that inhibition of the MAPK pathway with MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors or a specific inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) in melanoma cell lines and tumor digests results in increased levels of MDAs, which is associated with improved recognition by antigen-specific T lymphocytes. However, treatment with MEK inhibitors impairs T lymphocyte function, whereas T-cell function is preserved after treatment with a specific inhibitor of BRAF(V600E). These findings suggest that immune evasion of melanomas mediated by oncogenic BRAF may be reversed by targeted BRAF inhibition without compromising T-cell function. These findings have important implications for combined kinase-targeted therapy plus immunotherapy for melanoma.",

TA99 is shown to increase induction of anti-Tyrp1 CD8+T-cell responses to DNA vaccination against Tyrp1 as assessed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that TA99 localizes rapidly and specifically to B16 lung nodules. Augmentation of T-cell responses is dependent on the presence of tumor as well as on activating Fc receptors. Furthermore, TA99 enhances DNA vaccination against a distinct melanoma antigen, gp100(pmel17/silver locus), improving antitumor efficacy, augmenting systemic CD8+ T-cell responses to gp100, and increasing CD8+ T-cell infiltration at the tumor site. Epitope spreading was observed, with CD8+ T-cell responses generated to Tyrp1 peptide in mice receiving gp100 DNA vaccination in the presence of TA99. Finally, we show that TA99 improves therapeutic efficacy of DNA vaccination combined with adoptive T-cell transfer in treatment of established subcutaneous B16 melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"The analysis of gene expression patterns in cancers has improved the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the process of metastatic progression. However, the acquisition of invasive behavior in melanoma is poorly understood. In melanoma, components of the immune system can contribute to tumor progression, and inflammatory cells can influence almost all aspects of cancer progression, including metastasis. Recent studies have attributed an important role to B-1 cells, a subset of B lymphocytes, in melanoma progression. In vitro interactions between B16 melanoma cells and B-1 lymphocytes lead to increased B16 cell metastatic potential, but the molecular changes induced by B-1 lymphocytes on B16 cells have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used a microarray approach to assess the gene expression profile of B16 melanoma cells following contact with B-1 lymphocytes (B16B1). The microarray analysis identified upregulation in genes involved with metastatic progression, such as ctss, ccl5, cxcl2 and stat3. RT-qPCR confirmed this increase in mRNA expression in B16B1 samples. As previous studies have indicated that the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade is activated in melanoma cells following contact with B-1 lymphocytes, RT-qPCR was performed with RNA from melanoma cells before and after contacting B-1 cells and untreated or treated with ERK phosphorylation inhibitors. The results showed that the expression of stat3, ctss and cxcl2 increased in B16B1 but decreased following ERK1/2 MAPK inhibition. Ccl5 gene expression increased after contacting B-1 cells and was maintained at the same level following inhibitor treatment. Stat3 was verified and validated at the protein level by Western blot analysis. STAT3 expression was also significantly increased in B16B1, suggesting that this pathway can also contribute to the increased metastatic phenotype observed in our model. These results indicated that B-1 cells induce important global gene expression changes in B16 melanoma cells. We also evaluated the relationship of some of the genes identified as differentially expressed and the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade. This work may have important implications for understanding the role of B-1 lymphocytes and the ERK/MAPK cascade in the metastatic process. ",

Candidate mutated epitopes were identified using a peptide-MHC-binding algorithm, and these epitopes were synthesized and used to generate panels of MHC tetramers that were evaluated for binding to tumor digests and cultured TILs used for the treatment of patients. This strategy resulted in the identification of 9 mutated epitopes from 5 of the 8 patients tested. Cells reactive with 8 of the 9 epitopes could be isolated from autologous peripheral blood, where they were detected at frequencies that were estimated to range between 0.4% and 0.002%.

We have previously shown that in vitro incubation of human PBMC with LMB-2, a CD25-directed immunotoxin, significantly reduced CD25+ FOXP3+ CD4+ Treg cells without impairing the function of the remaining lymphocytes. In the current study, eight patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with LMB-2 followed by MART-1 and gp100-specific peptide vaccination. LMB-2 administration resulted in a preferential, transient reduction in mean circulating CD25+ CD4+ T cell number, from 83 +/- 16 cells/microl to a nadir of 17 +/- 5 cells/microl, a 79.1% reduction. FOXP3 analysis revealed a less robust depletion with mean FOXP3+ CD4+ Treg cell number decreasing from 74 +/- 15 cells/microl to 36 +/- 8 cells/microl, a 51.4% reduction. FOXP3+ CD4+ Treg cells that survived LMB-2-mediated cytotoxicity expressed little or no CD25. Similar to the peripheral blood, immunohistochemical analysis showed a 68.9% mean reduction in FOXP3+ CD4+ Treg cell frequency in evaluable lesions. Despite inducing a reduction in Treg cell numbers in vivo, LMB-2 therapy did not augment the immune response to cancer vaccination and no patient experienced an objective response or autoimmunity. These data demonstrate the capacity of a CD25-directed immunotoxin to selectively mediate a transient partial reduction in circulating and tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in vivo, and suggest that more comprehensive Treg cell elimination may be required to bolster antitumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer immunotherapy based on vaccination with defined tumor antigens has not yet shown strong clinical efficacy, despite promising results in preclinical models. This discrepancy might result from the fact that available preclinical models rely on transplantable tumors, which do not recapitulate the long-term host-tumor interplay that occurs in patients during progressive tumor development and results in tumor tolerance. To create a faithful preclinical model for cancer immunotherapy, we generated a transgenic mouse strain developing autologous melanomas expressing a defined tumor antigen recognized by T cells. We chose the antigen encoded by P1A, a well-characterized murine cancer germ line gene. To transform melanocytes, we aimed at simultaneously activating the Ras pathway and inactivating tumor suppressor Ink4a/Arf, thereby reproducing two genetic events frequently observed in human melanoma. The melanomas are induced by s.c. injection of 4-OH-tamoxifen (OHT). By activating a CreER recombinase expressed from a melanocyte-specific promoter, this treatment induces the loss of the conditional Ink4a/Arf gene in melanocytes. Because the CreER gene itself is also flanked by loxP sites, the activation of CreER also induces the deletion of its own coding sequence and thereby allows melanocyte-specific expression of genes H-ras and P1A, which are located downstream on the same transgene. All melanomas induced in those mice with OHT show activation of the Ras pathway and deletion of gene Ink4a/Arf. In addition, these melanomas express P1A and are recognized by P1A-specific T lymphocytes. This model will allow to characterize the interactions between the immune system and naturally occurring tumors and thereby to optimize immunotherapy approaches targeting a defined tumor antigen.",

Once diagnosed, patients were managed with control of their hypertension with multiple agents and supportive red blood cell transfusions. TMA typically stabilized or improved and no patient progressed to dialysis.

Rarely, patients with melanoma have an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, and melanoma metastases might develop as collision tumours in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The aim of this study was to measure the incidence and examine the effect of collision tumours on the accuracy of SLND and on the validity of staging in this setting. Between 1998 and 2012, 750 consecutive SLNDs were performed in melanoma patients using the triple technique (lymphoscintigraphy, gamma probe and blue dye). The validity of SLND in collision tumours was analysed. False negativity was reflected by the disease-free survival. The literature was reviewed on collision tumours in melanoma. Collision tumours of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were found in two SLN and in one RLND (0.4%). Subsequent RLNDs of SLND-positive cases were negative for melanoma. The patient with negative SLND developed relapse after 28 months with an inguinal lymph node metastasis of melanoma; RLND showed collision tumours. The literature review identified 12 cases of collision tumours. CLL was associated with increased melanoma incidence and reduced overall survival. This is, to our knowledge, the first assessment of the clinical value of SLND when collision tumours of melanoma and CLL are found. In this small series of three patients with both malignancies present in the same lymph node basin, lymphocytic infiltration of the CLL did not alter radioisotope uptake into the SLN. No false-negative result was observed. Our data suggest the validity of SLND in collision tumours, but given the rarity of the problem, further studies are necessary to confirm this reliability. ",

T-cell clones were then obtained by limiting dilution and by micromanipulation. Eleven clones, selected for autologous tumor (Auto-Tu) cytotoxicity, were tested for specificity on a panel of 17 cell cultures of normal and neoplastic origin, revealing a complex spectrum of lytic activities. Three groups of clones could be identified depending on the patterns of cytotoxicity. One clone (B11.12) lysed Me28 and expressed a borderline reactivity against one allogeneic Me. A second group of clones (A4, A4.18, H10, E12, C9) lysed the Auto-Tu and allogeneic Me. The last group of clones (A4.2, A4.3, A4.4, A7, B7) expressed a broader pattern of reactivity with significant cytotoxicity against targets of different histologic origin. Furthermore, the second and third groups of clones lysed K562 while B11.12 did not. The Auto-Tu-restricted reactivity of clone B11.12, confirmed by a further test on 13 allogeneic Me and on autologous IL-2 cultured lymphocytes, suggests the recognition of antigenic structures preferentially expressed on Me28. Blocking studies, performed with monoclonal antibodies (MAb), revealed that an anti-HLA class I MAb (w6/32), but not two anti-DR MAbs (L243, DI.12), could inhibit the cytotoxic activity of clones B11.12 on Me28.

Comparison of the lymphocyte subsets of peripheral blood and metastatic lesions revealed equal relative amounts of CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells in both tissues, but 10- to 20-fold fewer CD56+ (natural killer, NK) cells, and a total absence of CD20+ (B) cells in the metastatic lesions. The prognosis of patients was viewed at different stages of the disease. The median survival from the primary diagnosis of patients with a tumor CD4+/CD8+ ratio above the median was 4.4 years compared with 2.4 years for those with a ratio below the median (Logrank, p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant prognostic factors were the CD4+/CD8+ ratio of the tumor (p = 0.010) and of the peripheral blood (p = 0.020). Monitoring of CD4+ and CD8+ cells may thus provide valuable information about the state of host defense, with a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio indicating more favorable prognosis.",

Meanwhile, the expression of β-catenin in HVJ-E treated murine melanoma cells was detected. In addition, HVJ-E was intratumorally injected into the melanoma on C57BL/6 mice, and the immune cells, CTL response and tumor volume were analyzed.;HVJ-E injected into B16F10 melanoma obviously inhibited the growth of the tumor and prolonged the survival time of the tumor-bearing mice. Profiles of cytokines secreted by dendritic cells (DCs) after HVJ-E stimulation showed that the number of cytokines released was significantly higher than that elicited by PBS (1P<0.05). The co-stimulation-related molecules on DCs were comparable to those stimulated by LPS. Immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated the repression of β-catenin in B16F10 melanoma cells after HVJ-E treatment. Meanwhile, real-time reverse transcription PCR revealed that HVJ-E induced a remarkable infiltration of CD11c positive cells, chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) molecules, interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecule, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells into HVJ-E injected tumors. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of β-catenin in the HVJ-E injected tumors was also down-regulated. In addition, B16F10-specific CTLs were induced significantly after HVJ-E was injected into the tumor-bearing mice.;This is the first report to show the effective inhibition of melanoma tumors by HVJ-E alone and the mechanism through which it induces antitumor immune responses and regulates important signal pathways for melanoma invasion. Therefore, HVJ-E shows its prospect as a novel therapeutic for melanoma therapy.",

Avidity of induced CTLs was evaluated by measuring their lysis and cytokine secretion to peptide-pulsed transporter-associated protein-deficient cells and to melanoma cells. In side-by-side experiments, we show that melanoma cells, either allogeneic or autologous, induced the growth of high avidity Melan-A-reactive CTLs from all donors, whereas essentially low avidity T cells were induced by peptide-pulsed PBLs. We also show that at least two cytokines, interleukin-6 and interleukin-2, were required to promote the growth of high avidity CTLs. Once sorted by tetramer labeling or cloning, the specificity and reactivity to tumor cells of peptide-specific T cells induced by allogeneic melanoma cells were confirmed. We then describe a relatively simple and efficient procedure that allowed us to obtain systematically high amounts (in the range of billion) of high avidity Melan-A/ MART-1-specific T cells from the PBLs of HLA-A2 melanoma patients and healthy donors in 3 months. Because this antigen is expressed by most melanoma tumors, this procedure should be useful for checking the efficiency of adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma tumors and using functionally well-defined Melan-A/MART-1-specific CTLs in a large group of patients.",

MITF-M regulates the expression of melanocyte differentiation genes such as MLANA, tyrosinase and gp100, which encode antigens recognized on melanoma cells by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes. Accordingly, treating some melanoma cells with IL-1beta reduced by 40-100% their ability to activate such antimelanoma cytolytic T lymphocytes. Finally, we observed large amounts of biologically active IL-1alpha or IL-1beta secreted by two melanoma cell lines that did not express MITF-M, suggesting an autocrine MITF-M downregulation. We estimate that approximately 13% of melanoma cell lines are MITF-M-negative and secrete IL-1 cytokines.

A gene encoding a tumor antigen recognized by TIL586 was recently isolated and shown to encode gp75. Here we report that an antigenic peptide, MSLQRQFLR, recognized by TIL586 was not derived from the normal gp75 protein. Instead, this nonamer peptide resulted from translation of an alternative open reading frame of the same gene. Thus, the gp75 gene encodes two completely different polypeptides, gp75 as an antigen recognized by immunoglobulin G antibodies in sera from a patient with cancer, and a 24-amino acid product as a tumor rejection antigen recognized by T cells. This represents the first demonstration that a human tumor rejection antigen can be generated from a normal cellular gene using an open reading frame other than that used to encode the normal protein.

We found that TILs isolated after the rapid expansion protocol (REP) phase, used to generate the final patient TIL infusion product, were hyporesponsive to restimulation with MART-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, with many CD8(+) T cells undergoing apoptosis. Telomere length was shorter post-REP, but of sufficient length to support further cell division. Phenotypic analysis revealed that cell-surface CD28 expression was significantly reduced in post-REP TILs, whereas CD27 levels remained unchanged. Tracking post-REP TIL proliferation by CFSE dilution, as well as sorting for CD8(+)CD28(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-) post-REP subsets, revealed that the few CD28(+) TILs remaining post-REP had superior survival capacity and proliferated after restimulation with MART-1 peptide. An analysis of different supportive cytokine mixtures during the REP found that a combination of IL-15 and IL-21 facilitated comparable expansion of CD8(+) TILs as IL-2, but prevented the loss of CD28 expression with improved responsiveness to antigenic restimulation post-REP. These results suggest that current expansion protocols using IL-2 for melanoma adoptive T cell therapy yields largely CD8(+) T cells unable to persist and divide in vivo following Ag contact. The few CD8(+)CD28(+) T cells that remain may be the only CD8(+) TILs that ultimately survive to repopulate the host and mediate long-term tumor control.

Here, we examined whether the same \"intracerebral immunotherapy\" strategy could be applied to the treatment of metastatic brain tumors.;Mice with both i.c. and s.c. melanomas were injected intratumorally with CNT-CpG into either location. Antitumor responses were assessed by flow cytometry, bioluminescent imaging, and animal survival.;When given s.c., CNT-CpG response was mostly local, and it only modestly inhibited the growth of i.c. melanomas. However, i.c. CNT-CpG abrogated the growth of not only brain but also s.c. tumors. Furthermore, compared with s.c. injections, i.c. CNT-CpG elicited a stronger inflammatory response that resulted in more potent antitumor cytotoxicity and improved in vivo trafficking of effector cells into both i.c. and s.c. tumors. To investigate factors that accounted for these observations, CNT-CpG biodistribution and cellular inflammatory responses were examined in both tumor locations. Intracranial melanomas retained the CNT-CpG particles longer and were infiltrated by Toll-like receptor (TLR-9)-positive microglia. In contrast, myeloid-derived suppressive cells were more abundant in s.c. tumors. Although depletion of these cells before s.c. CNT-CpG therapy enhanced its cytotoxic responses, antitumor responses to brain melanomas were unchanged.;These findings suggest that intracerebral CNT-CpG immunotherapy is more effective than systemic therapy in generating antitumor responses that target both brain and systemic melanomas.",

Because TGFβ1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in cancer development, we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells, the effect of TGFβ1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression, two known factors responsible for melanoma progression. TGFβ1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells, an effect mediated by the cross-talk between Smad, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT, and BRAF-MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) signaling pathways. Supernatants from TGFβ1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1-dependent migration of monocytes, which, in turn, expressed high levels of TGF,β1, bFGF, and VEGF mRNA. Moreover, these supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10-dependent mechanisms. When using in vitro, the TGFβ1-blocking peptide P144, TGFβ1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation, and expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited. In vivo, treatment of A375 tumor-bearing athymic mice with P144 significantly reduced tumor growth, associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels, as well as angiogenesis. Finally, in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors, when administered with immunotherapy, P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels, linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells, as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses. These results show new effects of TGFβ1 on melanoma cells, which promote tumor progression and immunosuppression, strongly reinforcing the relevance of this cytokine as a molecular target in melanoma.",

Two T cell lines were derived from a patient with Wilms tumor. One of them expressed a non-disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR using the 60-kDa gamma chain, whereas, the other expressed a disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR. A T cell line was derived from a patient with sarcoma and expressed a disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR, whereas, a T cell line derived from a patient with melanoma expressed a non-disulfide-linked gamma chain of 62 kDa. Several T cell clones were developed from patients with metastatic melanoma or Wilms tumor and expressed either disulfide- or non-disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR. Northern analysis of RNA from certain of these clones revealed a full-length gamma chain transcript, whereas, the alpha or beta chain transcripts were either absent or truncated. These T cell clones exhibited nonspecific cytotoxicity. Both disulfide- and non-disulfide-linked TIL T cell lines and clones expressed the delta TCS1 determinant. gamma/delta TcR+ cells in freshly prepared TIL from these patients were present in low proportions (less than 5%) and their delta TCS1/delta 1 ratios were within the range observed in the peripheral blood of normal donors. These results demonstrate that both disulfide- and non-disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR are expressed on T cell lines and clones derived from TIL from solid tumors. Non-disulfide-linked gamma/delta TcR using the 56-66-kDa gamma chain are frequently found on TIL-derived T cell lines and clones. These 56-66-kDa gamma chains are rarely expressed on T cell lines or clones derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal donors.",

Five patients died in the first two months of treatment. Of the remaining 25 patients, two (8%) showed complete regression, and one (4%) partial regression. Seven patients (28%) had stabilization of the disease for a six-month period, and 15 (60%) had progression of the disease. Complete and partial regressions were seen only in patients with extravisceral (subcutaneous) metastases, and were associated with a longer survival time. Regression of the subcutaneous metastatic nodules was always accompanied by the following local phenomena: increased temperature; local inflammation; softening, pain and pruritus at the nodule site; and a gradual decrease in size. At the site of the tumor mass, a hypochromic halo appeared. This halo remained permanently and was pathognomonic of the metastatic nodule rejection. When the halo was fully established, the inflammatory infiltrate was minimal and the malignant cells disappeared. If the area contained hairs, they underwent complete albinization. Serial biopsies of the nodules undergoing inflammatory changes and decreased consistency exhibited an intense cellular infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells around the malignant cells. This sometimes simulated lymphoid follicle formation involving the melanoma cells associated with necrosis in a centripetal way. Some patients with visceral metastases (particularly pulmonary) had an unexpectedly long survival, apparently associated with interruption of the growth rate of the masses. Eleven out of 20 deaths were due to cerebral metastases. When cerebral disease was diagnosed, BCG was discontinued and the administration of corticoids was usually associated with a disappearance of the inflammatory signs at the nodule sites, but with progression of the disease.

Syngeneic B16F10 melanoma cells transplanted intracamerally into C57BL/6 mice produced progressively growing intraocular tumors, yet formed only occasional pulmonary metastases. Neither enucleation nor mechanical manipulation of the melanoma-containing eye promoted a significant increase in the incidence of metastases. Likewise, immunologic impairment in the form of natural killer cell deficiency, T-lymphocyte deficiency, or gamma-irradiation-induced lymphopenia failed to produce spontaneous metastases in intraocular melanoma-bearing mice. However, enucleation in consort with immune impairment (T-cell deficiency) produced a sharp increase in the incidence and number of pulmonary metastases in intraocular melanoma-bearing mice. Further studies showed that external pressure to the tumor-containing globe (without enucleation) produced extensive metastases in athymic, nude mice. By contrast, atraumatic enucleation of rapidly frozen eyes prevented metastasis of intraocular melanomas in similar hosts. Collectively, the results indicate that induction of distant metastases in hosts harboring intraocular melanomas requires two simultaneous processes: (1) mechanical manipulation of the melanoma-containing eye, and (2) concomitant impairment of T-cell-dependent immune processes. The data strongly suggest that mechanical manipulation of melanoma-containing eyes produces intravascular showers of melanoma cells that are rejected by T-cell-dependent immune processes in the immunocompetent host. In the absence of these normal T-cell-dependent immune mechanisms, enucleation-induced showers of blood-borne melanoma cells gain a foothold in the lung and form progressive metastases.",

In 9/14 experiments the BL effects of 2 melanoma patients were compared to BL effects of 2 colorectal carcinoma patients. In two experiments, BL from 1 melanoma patient and 1 colorectal carcinoma patient were compared for cytotoxic effect with each other and with BL from 2 normal healthy donors, and in the remaining 3 experiments BL from 2 melanoma patients were compared with BL from 1 healthy donor and one patient bearing a tumor which was neither a melanoma nor a colorectal carcinoma. Eleven out of 14 experiments were performed in a criss-cross manner. Target cells in the first three tests of this series consisted of tumor cells and fibroblasts explanted from a single melanoma patient. In all of the remaining experiments, each BL population was tested for cytotoxicity against both a tumor-fibroblast target cell pair explanted from one of two melanoma patients and a tumor-fibroblast target cell pair explanted from a rectal adenocarcinoma patient. Out of 35 tumor patients, 27 (77%) demonstrated a selective cytotoxic effect on the tumor target cells compared to the corresponding fibroblasts, while 4 patients (11%) showed a selective effect on the fibroblasts, and 6/29 patients showed a selective effect on the other type of tumor cells compared to matching fibroblasts. In 8/11 experiments (including two repeat tests) tumor-specific BL effects were demonstrated in a criss-cross manner.

Dermoscopically, the central region consists of intricate areas colored in red, violet, blue-white and black. On the periphery stand two rings, centrally white and peripherally pigmented, with an abundance of polymorphic capillaries. To clarify the diagnosis, the lesion was widely excised and histopathological examination was performed, which revealed immunophenotypical tumor cells negative for HMB-45 and S100, and numerous CD68 macrophages between tumor cells. This aneurysmal fibrous histiocytoma shows both clinical and dermoscopically discrete differential criteria, which are not specific and that make it difficult to distinguish from malignant melanoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, and required performing histopathology and immunohistochemistry.

TIL therapy itself has little side effects, but conditioning chemo- or radiotherapy and postinfusion interleukin 2 (IL-2) injections are associated with severe adverse advents. We reasoned that combining TIL infusion with dendritic cell (DC) vaccination could circumvent the need for conditioning and IL-2 support and thus represent a milder treatment approach. Eight patients with stage IV melanoma were enrolled in the MAT01 study, consisting of vaccination with autologous tumor-lysate-loaded DC, followed by TIL infusion. Six of eight patients were treated according to protocol, while one patient received only TIL and one only DC. Treatments were well tolerated with a single grade 3 adverse event. The small study size precludes analysis of clinical responses, though interestingly one patient showed a complete remission and two had stable disease. Analysis of the infusion products revealed that mature DC were generated in all cases. TIL after expansion were CD3+ T cells, dominated by effector memory CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire revealed presence of highly dominant clones in most infusion products, and many of these could be detected in the circulation for weeks after T cell transfer. Here, we report the first combination of DC vaccination and TIL infusion in malignant melanoma. This combined treatment was safe and feasible, though after evaluating both clinical and immunological parameters, we expect that administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and IL-2 will likely increase treatment efficacy.",

Few studies have addressed the latter phenomenon because no animal models have been described in which melanomas clearly develop in a de novo manner. In this study, we have address this need in defining RFP-RET-transgenic mice (RET mice) as a mouse model for multi-step melanomagenesis that proceeds via tumor-free, benign, premalignant, and malignant stages. Melanomas from RET mice exhibited decreased expression levels of endothelin receptor B (Ednrb) compared with benign tumors. In RET mice that were heterozygous for Ednrb (Ednrb+/-;RET mice), >80% of the arising primary tumors were malignant. Life span after tumor development in the mice was significantly shorter than in RET mice. Lung metastasis after tumor development was significantly higher than in RET mice. The observed process of melanomagenesis in Ednrb+/-;RET mice, which proceeded without a pre-existing benign lesion, along with the emergent characteristics in the model after tumor development corresponded well with the formation of de novo melanoma in humans. Our findings define a novel transgenic mouse model for de novo melanoma and suggest that reduced expression of Ednrb might facilitate the development of de novo melanoma in humans.",

To investigate on a possible role of CXCR4 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) subsets, 195 patients with melanoma were evaluated for correlations between PBL subsets CXCR4 expressing and clinicopathological and prognostic features. One hundred ninety-five patients with stages I-III melanoma were enrolled in this study. Lymphocytes subsets were assayed by the direct fluorescence method for whole blood and staining with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Correlations between PBL subsets, baseline patient, and tumor features were studied by contingency tables and the chi(2) test. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was applied to plot disease-free- and overall-survival curves. Univariate analysis was performed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to analyze the effect of multiple risk factors on disease-free survival (DFS). Melanoma patients characterized by CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CXCR4(+) higher than 25% of PBL showed a longer DFS. Conversely, CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CXCR4(+) <25% increased the risk of relapse. The 5-year DFS rate was 76% for patients with CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CXCR4(+) lymphocytes <25% of PBL, and 94% for patients with CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CXCR4(+) >25% (p = 0.030 at log-rank test). Univariate and multivariate analysis for DFS confirmed the prognostic value of the CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CXCR4(+) lymphocytes.

Loss of α6 expression in α6fl/fl‑Tie2Cre(+) mice reduced tumor growth in a murine B16F10 melanoma model. Immunohistological analysis of the tumors showed that Tie2-dependent α6 gene deletion was associated with reduced tumor vascularization and with reduced infiltration of proangiogenic Tie2-expressing macrophages.

Overall killing activity was very similar in CTL induced by tumor lysate or RNA. CTL induced by both methods preferentially killed an HLA class I-matched M14 melanoma cell line rather than HLA class I-unmatched M3 cells. Cytotoxicity could be partially blocked by anti-HLA class I antibodies. There were no significant differences in cytotoxicity and in other clonal characteristics in CTL lines induced by a lysate of apoptotic bodies as compared to lines induced by lysate of viable cells. However, CTL induced by DMRIE-C-bound total RNA demonstrated superior cytotoxicity when compared with CTL induced by unconjugated total RNA. Polyclonal CTL induced by tumor lysate contained a substantial percentage of tyrosinase(368-376 370N) tetramer-positive cells and demonstrated specific killing activity against tyrosinase(368-376 370N) peptide-labeled T2 cells, comparable to cytotoxicity of the CTL developed against this peptide alone. In contrast, there were no detectable tyrosinase(368-376 370N)-tetramer positive cells and no specific anti-tyrosinase peptide(368-376 370N) response in polyclonal CTL induced by immunization with tumor RNA. These data demonstrate that both total tumor RNA and tumor lysate are effective for inducing of cytotoxic anti-melanoma CTL, but tyrosinase(368-376 370N) specific cells were detected only in lysate-induced CTL cultures.

Since no significant infiltration of host cells was observed in the lung in response to metastatic foci, the rise in DNA polymerase activity should be due to tumor cells and not to infiltrating host cells.

TIL were shown to be particularly effective against melanoma and it was in these trials that we learned the importance of immunologic specificity for tumor. With the identification and characterization of tumor antigens recognized by TIL, we now see the use of these antigens in various forms constituting vaccines. Investigators are using tumor antigens alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs), the body's most efficient and powerful antigen-presenting cell. Therapies are being delivered to many patients with different types of cancer in order to combat bulky disease, eliminate micro-metastatic disease, and provide a memory mechanism to fight tumor recurrence. This review will detail the past 18 years and present the developments that have been made in this therapy. Many believe that with continued development, immunotherapy will provide a fourth modality of cancer therapy.",

This cytotoxicity was observed under endotoxin-free conditions. NK-depleted lymphocytes did not lyse the melanoma targets. Culture supernatants of monocytes incubated with the melanoma tumor cells did not exhibit cytotoxic activity against these targets. Purified monocytes lacked NK activity against the K562 targets in a 4-hr 51Cr release assay. Treatment of the monocytes with anti-Leu 1 1b and anti-Leu7 monoclonal antibodies plus complement did not reduce monocyte-mediated lysis of the melanoma targets, demonstrating that contaminating NK cells, if any, were not responsible for the lysis of noncultured melanoma targets by monocytes. In contrast, Leu 1 1b+ NK cells were responsible for the lysis of the melanoma targets by NK-enriched lymphocytes. The addition of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma), but not lipopolysaccharide, into the 51Cr release assay or pretreatment of monocytes with rIFN-gamma significantly increased their cytotoxicity against noncultured solid tumor cells. Monocytes cultured for 3 days with medium alone lost their cytotoxic activity.

DCs from melanoma-bearing mice secreted significantly more interleukin 10 and less interleukin 12p70, and showed a decreased capacity to activate T cells compared with DCs from tumor-free animals. Observed DC dysfunction was linked to considerable activation of p38 MAPK. Inhibition of its activity in spleen DCs from tumor-bearing mice led to normalization of their cytokine secretion pattern and T-cell stimulation capacity.;Our data show a critical role of constitutively activated p38 MAPK in the acquirement of tolerogenic pattern by DCs during melanoma progression that contributes to the suppression of antitumor T-cell immune responses.

Most human melanomas have substantial surface GD3; in addition, a significant proportion of T lymphocytes display surface GD3. In a phase I study, we have investigated the toxicity and effect on selected immunological parameters of three dose levels of R24 given intravenously daily for five days (10 mg/m2/d, 30 mg/m2/d and 50 mg/m2/d) to patients with advanced melanoma. R24 administration neither consistently diminished nor augmented expression of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions to anergy panel antigens or to a contact allergen dinitrofluorobenzene. R24 was infrequently found on tumor cells, or on lymphocytes from DTH biopsies, despite measurable serum levels of R24. The 30 mg/m2/d dose of R24 produced a statistically significant drop in peripheral blood lymphocytes on treatment Day 5. Likewise, on Day 5 there was a modest but statistically significant decrement in the proportion of circulating cells which were R24+. While there was one mixed response, there were no complete or partial tumor regressions in the R24 treated patients; there was no evident clinical benefit from the R24 therapy. The toxicity of the R24 at the higher dose levels can be very substantial. One patient, on the highest dose level, died on the 4th day of R24 treatment; in the absence of a plausible alternative explanation, a relationship of the death to the administered R24 must be considered.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms which regulate MHCI expression on tumor cells are not clear. We previously showed that immune innate cells from the spleen can regulate MHCI expression on MHCI(low) tumor cells. Here, using the murine model of B16 melanoma, we demonstrate that the MHCI status of tumor cells in vivo is regulated by the microenvironment. In subcutaneous grafts, induction of MHCI molecules on tumor cells is concomitant to the recruitment of lymphocytes and relies on an IFNgamma-mediated mechanism. gammadelta T and NK cells are essential to this regulation. A small proportion of tumor-infiltrating NK cells and gammadelta T cells were found to produce IFNgamma, suggesting a possible direct participation to the MHCI increase on the tumor cells upon tumor cell recognition. Depletion of gammadelta T cells increases the tumor growth rate, confirming their anti-tumoral role in our model. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in vivo, NK and gammadelta T cells play a dual role during the early growth of MHCI(low) tumor cells. In addition to controlling the growth of tumor cells, they contribute to modifying the immunogenic profile of residual tumor cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hemocyanins, the huge oxygen-transporting glycoproteins of some mollusks, are used as immunomodulatory proteins with proven anti-cancer properties. The biodiversity of hemocyanins has promoted interest in identifying new anti-cancer candidates with improved immunological properties. Hemocyanins promote Th1 responses without known side effects, which make them ideal for long-term sustained treatment of cancer. In this study, we evaluated a novel hemocyanin from the limpet/gastropod Fissurella latimarginata (FLH). This protein has the typical hollow, cylindrical structure of other known hemocyanins, such as the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and the Concholepas hemocyanin (CCH). FLH, like the KLH isoforms, is composed of a single type of polypeptide with exposed N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. However, its immunogenicity was significantly greater than that of KLH and CCH, as FLH induced a stronger humoral immune response and had more potent anti-tumor activity, delaying tumor growth and increasing the survival of mice challenged with B16F10 melanoma cells, in prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Additionally, FLH-treated mice demonstrated increased IFN-γ production and higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) lymphocytes. Furthermore, in vitro assays demonstrated that FLH, but not CCH or KLH, stimulated the rapid production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-α) by dendritic cells, triggering a pro-inflammatory milieu that may explain its enhanced immunological activity. Moreover, this effect was abolished when deglycosylated FLH was used, suggesting that carbohydrates play a crucial role in the innate immune recognition of this protein. Altogether, our data demonstrate that FLH possesses increased anti-tumor activity in part because it activates a more potent innate immune response in comparison to other known hemocyanins. In conclusion, FLH is a potential new marine adjuvant for immunization and possible cancer immunotherapy. ",

Electron microscopic examination of the spindle cells showed prominence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, which was dilated and filled with flocculent material and occasional collagen fibrils. The same cells contained aggregates of non-membrane-bound melanin granules and pre-melanosomes. Some cells also showed features of myofibroblasts. Immunoperoxidase staining with anti-S100 protein antibody demonstrated positivity of the spindle cells as well as of melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis.

However, upregulated RANK expression was not found in stage IV melanoma patients with bone metastases compared with stage IV melanoma patients without bone metastases, providing a possible explanation for the clinical observation that melanoma cells do not preferentially metastasize to bone tissue. Strikingly, RANK-expressing melanoma cells from peripheral blood, primary tumors, or metastases of stage IV patients coexpressed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) B5 and CD133, both markers characteristic of melanoma-initiating cells, suggesting a tumor stem cell-like phenotype. In support of this hypothesis, RANK-expressing melanoma cells showed a reduced Ki67 proliferation index compared with RANK(-) melanoma cells from the same patient and are able to induce tumor growth in immunodeficient mice.

TIL from five of seven cases proliferated well in culture with AIM-V serum-free medium and 1000 U/ml rIL-2 in 3-L gas permeable bags, whereas TIL from two RCCs exhibited delayed proliferation. Proliferation of CD3-CD56+ NK cells with major histocompatibility complex-nonrestricted cytotoxicity in RCC-TIL (n = 6, mean = 651-fold, ranging from 39- to 3450-fold) for the first 2-4 weeks was 63 times higher than that of noncytotoxic CD3+ T cells (n = 6, 10.3-fold ranging from 0.8 to 35-fold). Thereafter, CD3+ T cells predominantly proliferated, and proliferation of CD3+ T cells (n = 5, 743-fold) for 5-6 weeks were 24 times higher than that of CD3-CD56+ NK cells (n = 5, 31-fold).

These adherent TIL consisted of more CD3-CD56+ NK cells and exhibited higher cytotoxicity than did nonadherent TIL. Adherent RCC-TIL produced interferon (IFN)-gamma, while nonadherent TIL did not. These results suggest that initially cytotoxic CD3-CD56+ NK cells and, later, noncytotoxic CD3+ T cells proliferated in culture of RCC-TIL for adoptive therapy. These noncytotoxic TIL were primarily transferred to RCC patients, who also received cyclophosphamide, IL-2, and IFN-alpha. In contrast to RCC-TIL, IL-2-activated melanoma TIL consisting of all CD3+ T cells displayed modest levels of cytotoxicity, primarily restricted to autologous melanoma cells in all cases tested.

Melanoma has been recognized as one of the most immunogenic malignancies; therefore, understanding the mechanisms of tumor-immune interaction is key for developing more efficient treatments. As the tumor microenvironment shows an immunosuppressive action, immunotherapeutic agents promoting endogenous immune response to cancer have been tested (interleukin-2, anticytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, and antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibodies) as well as combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and inhibitors of angiogenesis (taxol/carboplatin/avastin). However, clinical outcomes are variable, with only a minority of patients achieving durable complete responses. The variability of immune homeostasis, which may be more active or more tolerant at any given time, in cancer patients and the interaction of the immune system with the tumor could explain the inconsistency in clinical outcomes among these patients. Recently, the role of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte-ratio (LMR) in the peripheral blood has been investigated and has been proven to be an independent predictor of survival in different hematological malignancies and in solid tumors. In melanoma, our group has validated the significance of LMR as a predictor of relapse after resection of advanced melanoma. In this study, we examined the dynamics in the immune system of patients with advanced melanoma by performing serial multiday concentration measurements of cytokines and immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood. The analysis of outcomes of chemotherapy administration as related to LMR on the day of treatment initiation showed that progression-free survival was improved in the patients who received chemotherapy on the day when LMR was elevated.",

A 54-year-old man presented with a black tumor measuring 3×4 cm on the right forearm. Histologic sections showed a tumor mass with rhabdoid features composed entirely of polygonal neoplastic cells with eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and large hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions. The tumor cells were immunoreactive with HMB-45, S100, Fontana-Masson silver and vimentin, and negative for smooth muscle actin, CD68, CD34, CD99, synaptophysin, desmin, and PAS. The differential diagnosis for this tumor included malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient was treated with a wide excision and a local skin graft. The excised tumor was entirely composed of rhabdoid tumor cells. No recurrence or metastasis was evident 4 months after removal.

The approach has demonstrated remarkable clinical responses in several studies since. Reinfusion of TIL-derived T cells represents a highly personalized form of immunotherapy, taking into account the enormous interindividual tumor heterogeneity. However, despite its successes, TIL therapy does not lead to objective clinical responses in all cases. It is thus crucial to find out which tumor antigens are particularly valuable targets and to develop strategies to enhance the reactivity of T-cell products toward them. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Kelderman et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2016. 46: 1351-1360] present a platform for the generation of antigen-specific TIL therapy. Combining recently developed technologies for clinical identification and enrichment of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, such as MHC Streptamers and UV-mediated peptide exchange, the authors could enrich T-cell populations with defined antigen specificities from melanoma-derived TILs. This T-cell product showed higher reactivity against autologous tumor cell lines than bulk TIL-derived T cells. The novel platform might enable the generation of more effective and predictable TIL-derived T-cell products for future clinical applications. ",

To apply this premise to human tumors, the effects of UC729-6 (lymphoblastoid B-cell) and M21-HPB (malignant melanoma) conditioned media (CM) on normal lymphocyte proliferation, as well as on tumor cell growth in autologous CM was studied. The CM was collected at 2-5 day intervals from cultures of UC729-6 and M21-HPB cells in serum-free media. Phytohemagglutinin- and concanavalin A-stimulated mononuclear peripheral blood cells from healthy human donors showed decreased [3H]thymidine ([3H]Tdr) uptake in the presence of each CM when compared with controls. In assays using 100% CM, mitogen stimulation was 68-85% less than that of controls and 40-50% less using 50% CM. The suppression was more pronounced with UC729-6 CM than with M21-HPB CM. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), addition of 50% CM from either tumor cell line resulted in 40-50% reduction in [3H]Tdr uptake by lymphocytes. Incubation of UC729-6 cells in 5% to 100% of UC729-6 fCM (filter-concentrated) produced a decrease in [3H]Tdr uptake which was directly proportional to the amount of fCM present. In contrast, M21-HPB cell growth in autologous fCM was dependent on cell number, as well as on the amount of fCM used. Treatment of the UC729-6 fCM using acid (pH 4.5), trypsin (100 micrograms/ml), and heat (56 degrees C) did not restore mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation. However, the inhibition observed with UC729-6 fCM was partially reversed after dialysis with membranes having M(r) limits of 2.5 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(4), or 1 x 10(4).",

Data from refractory cancer patients in a Phase I clinical trial with CM101 indicated a similar mechanism of tumor-targeted inflammation. To further our understanding of the mechanism of action of CM101 as an antitumor agent, we examined the role of the inflammatory response in inducing tumor apoptosis in a normal mouse and tumor-bearing mouse model. The i.v. infusion of CM101 into B16BL-6 melanoma tumor-bearing mice elevated p53 mRNA in circulating leukocytes as measured by reverse transcription-PCR, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated infiltration and sequestration of leukocytes. Whole tumor lysates from excised tumors exhibited an increase in binding to the murine p21(Waf1/Cip1) derived p53 DNA binding sequence compared with control whole tumor lysates, in which minimal or no DNA binding was observed. CM101 infusion led to elevated levels of Fas protein within the tumors as well as a decrease in the expression of fas ligand (fasL). Furthermore, tumors were apoptotic as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and DNA fragmentation assays. Collectively, these data suggest that CM101 up-regulates p53 in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, initiating a loss of tumor immunoprivilege and consequently rendering the tumor sensitive to Fas/fasL-mediated apoptosis. CM101 induced loss of tumor immunoprivilege through changes in the expression of leukocyte p53, tumor Fas and fasL coupled with neovascularitis and leukocyte infiltration, constitutes a plausible molecular pathway for tumor reduction observed in cancer patients.",

However, a blastocyst cloned from a RAS-inducible melanoma nucleus gave rise to ES cells with the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types in vivo including melanocytes, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. Chimeras produced from these ES cells developed cancer with higher penetrance, shorter latency, and an expanded tumor spectrum when compared with the donor mouse model. These results demonstrate that the secondary changes of a melanoma nucleus are compatible with a broad developmental potential but predispose mice to melanomas and other malignant tumors on reactivation of RAS.

The TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes from a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, which recognized the tyrosinase 368-376 peptide in the context of HLA-A2, were cloned into a gamma-retroviral vector. Following transduction of PBL, specific reactivity was confirmed by cytokine production following coculture with tumor targets. Experiments using Ab blockade and CD4/CD8 sorting of the transduced PBLs demonstrated that this antityrosinase TCR was CD4/CD8 independent. The introduction of a second disulfide bond between the TCR constant regions and/or creation of a chimeric protein in which the human constant regions were replaced by murine homologs resulted in enhanced TCR expression as demonstrated by tetramer staining and improved tumor reactivity that was comparable to PBL transduced with either anti-melanoma Ag recognized by T cells-1 or anti-gp100 TCR vectors currently used in clinical trials. The chimeric TCR also allowed us to test antitumor function of in HLA-A2/K(b)-transgenic mice. Transfer of the antityrosinase TCR into mouse splenocytes conferred CD4/CD8-independent, HLA-A2-restricted Ag reactivity against B16/A2K(b) murine melanoma in vitro. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of transduced splenocytes mediated B16/A2K(b) melanoma tumor regression in lymphodepleted mice, and, surprisingly, both CD8 and CD4 T cells were equally effective in mediating tumor regression.

Consequently, experiments were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of Th2-mediated destruction of B16-F1 melanoma cells by examining the in vitro antitumor activity of leukocytes within a type-2 inflammatory infiltrate. The experimental data show that activation of alternatively activated macrophages (aaMacs) within type-2 infiltrates by IL-4 or IL-13 can inhibit B16-F1 melanoma cell proliferation through a mechanism that is dependent on arginase-1 depletion of L-arginine within the tumor cell microenvironment. Interestingly, whilst at higher E:T ratios aaMac exhibited antitumor activity, at lower E:T ratios aaMacs were observed to enhance rather than inhibit B16-F1 melanoma cell growth.

A 7-day course of subcutaneous IFN-gamma alone was administered to cohorts of two or three patients each at doses of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg/m2. Thirteen patients received escalating doses of IFN-gamma between 0.2 and 0.5 mg/m2 followed by the intravenous (i.v.) administration of IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg) given three times a day. A treatment course consisted of two cycles (maximum of 15 doses of IL-2 per cycle) separated by a 10-day interval. Five additional patients were treated with five courses of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). All patients treated had the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. The maximal tolerated dose of subcutaneous IFN-gamma was established at 0.3 mg/m2 with dose-limiting hepatotoxicity. Immunohistochemistry analyses showed detectable upregulation of MHC class I alleles in one (8%) of 12 patients. Two of 20 patients who received the combination of IFN-gamma and IL-2 had responses, one partial and one complete response. The duration of response was 7 months for the partial response and 12 months for the complete response. IFN-gamma was tolerated with minimal side effects of nausea, vomiting, malaise, and decreased hematopoiesis. No increased toxicities were found with the combination treatment, as compared with IL-2 alone. One death occurred on the third day of treatment with IFN-gamma alone from hemorrhage into brain metastases.

We have investigated the expression of murine lymphocyte activation antigen (MALA-2), the murine equivalent of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), in blood vessels of normal murine tissues and in melanoma tumors and evaluated the relationship between MALA-2 expression and lymphocyte trafficking in vivo. C3H/HeN mice were injected both i.p. and s.c. with a clone of K-1735 syngeneic melanoma cells. Day 11 tumor-bearing mice were killed and vascular expression of MALA-2 was quantified using immunohistochemistry. MALA-2 expression was high in lung, liver and spleen and low in lymph node, small bowel, muscle and tumor. Systemic administration of either recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF alpha) or recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha) over 2 days prior to organ harvest resulted in an increase in the number of tumor vessels expressing MALA-2, with no change in MALA-2 expression in other tissues. In vivo lymphocyte trafficking was evaluated using cultured, activated splenocytes radiolabeled with 111In. 111In-labeled splenocyte distribution correlated closely with MALA-2 expression, with high localization to spleen, liver and lung and poor localization to lymph node, small bowel, muscle and tumor. Systemic administration of rTNF alpha, but not rIL-1 alpha, resulted in a significant increase in 111In-labeled splenocyte distribution to tumor, but neither rTNF alpha nor IL-1 alpha altered 111In-labeled splenocyte distribution to normal organs. Our data demonstrate the in vivo pattern of vascular MALA-2 expression in normal murine tissues and tumors and suggest that the expression of MALA-2 can be preferentially enhanced in tumors by systemic administration of cytokines. Lymphocyte distribution in vivo correlates closely with the pattern of MALA-2 expression, and these data support the conclusion that MALA-2 plays an important role in the regulation of lymphocyte trafficking.",

The role of T lymphocytes in tumor immunity has been extensively studied in melanoma, whereas less is known about the importance of B lymphocytes. The effects of plasma cells (PCs), in particular, are still obscure. The aim of this study was to characterize pathological features and clinical outcome of primary cutaneous melanomas associated with PCs. Moreover, we investigated the origins of the melanoma-associated PCs. Finally, we studied the outcome of patients with primary melanomas with PCs. We reviewed 710 melanomas to correlate the presence of PCs with histological prognostic markers. Immunohistochemistry for CD138 and heavy and light chains was performed in primary melanomas (PM) and in loco-regional lymph nodes (LN), both metastatic and not metastatic. In three PM and nine LN with frozen material, VDJ-rearrangement was analyzed by Gene Scan Analysis. Survival analysis was performed on a group of 85 primary melanomas >2 mm in thickness. Forty-one cases (3.7%) showed clusters/sheets of PCs. PC-rich melanomas occurred at an older age and were thicker, more often ulcerated and more mitotically active (P<0.05). PCs were polyclonal and often expressed IgA in addition to IgG. In LN, clusters/sheets of IgA+ PCs were found both in the sinuses and subcapsular areas. Analysis of VDJ-rearrangements showed the IgA to be oligoclonal. Melanomas with clusters/sheets of PCs had a significantly worse survival compared with melanomas without PCs while, interestingly, melanomas with sparse PCs were associated with a better clinical outcome (P=0.002). In conclusion, melanomas with sheets/clusters of PCs are associated with worse prognosis. IgG and IgA are the isotypes predominantly produced by these PCs. IgA oligoclonality suggests an antigen-driven response that facilitates melanoma progression by a hitherto unknown mechanism. ",

A comparison of tumor cells with differing metastatic ability also showed a minor 180 kd component in poorly metastatic cells which appeared decreased and partly degraded in its more invasive counterpart. The differential recognition of a 97 kd species in resting and proliferating lymphocytes, as well as the different cleavage of a 180 kd species in tumor cells of differing metastatic ability, implies a role for these molecules in cell proliferation.

Combined transfer of IL-2 gene and IL-6 gene was found to elicit inhibitory effects on the growth of B16F10 tumor more significantly and prolonged the survival period of tumor-bearing mice more obviously. We investigated the local immunity in tumor microenvironment and found that IL-2 and IL-6 gene transfer could significantly increase the expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and MHC-I molecule on tumor cells freshly isolated from the tumor mass. The NK and CTL activity of TIL increased markedly after the combined transfer of these two cytokine genes. We also observed the systemic antitumor immune response in the tumor-bearing mice and demonstrated that NK and CTL activity of splenocytes and the production of IL-2, tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma from splenocytes increased obviously in mice after the combined transfer of IL-2 and IL-6 gene.

Although T cells express inhibitory adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) that suppress their activation and inhibit immune killing of tumors, a role for myeloid cell A2ARs in suppressing the immune response to tumors has yet to be investigated. In this study, we show that the growth of transplanted syngeneic B16F10 melanoma or Lewis lung carcinoma cells is slowed in Adora2a(f/f)-LysMCre(+/-) mice, which selectively lack myeloid A2ARs. Reduced melanoma growth is associated with significant increases in MHCII and IL12 expression in tumor-associated macrophages and with >90% reductions in IL10 expression in tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and Ly6C(+) or Ly6G(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Myeloid deletion of A2ARs significantly increases CD44 expression on tumor-associated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells or NK cells in tumor-bearing mice indicates that both cell types initially contribute to slowing melanoma growth in mice lacking myeloid A2A receptors, but tumor suppression mediated by CD8(+) T cells is more persistent. Myeloid-selective A2AR deletion significantly reduces lung metastasis of melanomas that express luciferase (for in vivo tracking) and ovalbumin (as a model antigen). Reduced metastasis is associated with increased numbers and activation of NK cells and antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in lung infiltrates. Overall, the findings indicate that myeloid cell A2ARs have direct myelosuppressive effects that indirectly contribute to the suppression of T cells and NK cells in primary and metastatic tumor microenvironments. The results indicate that tumor-associated myeloid cells, including macrophages, DCs, and MDSCs all express immunosuppressive A2ARs that are potential targets of adenosine receptor blockers to enhance immune killing of tumors.",

We identify unanticipated roles of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) in favoring the recruitment of pro-tumor γδ T cells within the primary tumor. γδ T cells isolated from Ret mice deficient for NOS2 produced more IFNγ and less IL-17 than their counterparts from Ret mice. By supporting IL-17 production by γδ T cells, NOS2 leads to the recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) and metastasis formation. NOS2 also reduces the cytotoxicity of γδ T cells toward melanoma cells. Finally, we detected NOS2 expressing γδ T cells in the primary tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes in Ret mice, but also in human melanoma. Overall our results support that this NOS2 autocrine expression is responsible for the polarization of γδ T cells toward a pro-tumor profile. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"It has been shown that after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), donor T cells can induce potent graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects in hematologic malignancies and possibly solid tumors such as renal cell carcinoma. Two patients (27 and 30 years old) with metastatic melanoma received allogeneic PBSCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor after reduced conditioning with fludarabine, carmustine and melphalan. One patient showed a delayed mixed response with complete regression of lymph node metastases but persistent liver metastasis at day +60 and +120, consistent with a GVT response. In order to generate donor-derived tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with donor dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with host tumor lysate. Using these culture conditions, a marked increase in CD8(+) CTLs was observed in both donors exhibiting a strong MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic activity against the host tumor without cross-reactivity against nonmalignant host cells. CDR3 spectratyping was used to analyze the complexity of T-cell subpopulations in both CTL lines. Results demonstrate that oligoclonal T cells are expanded in vitro, exhibiting a marked overexpression of TCRVbeta3 (donor 1) and TCRVbeta4/Vbeta11 (donor 2) subfamilies. Functional (ELISPOT assay) and phenotypic (CDR3 spectratyping, sequencing Vbeta transcripts) analysis of patients' T cells at different time points after transplantation demonstrated an expansion of alloreactive T cells with a limited TCR Vbeta pattern. The Vbeta3 cDNA clone, being predominant in the CTL line from donor 1, could not be identified in patient 1 peripheral blood lymphocytes after transplant. Altogether, our results provide the first evidence that GVT effects against melanoma can induce tumor regression and that oligoclonal donor-derived CTLs specific against host tumor cells can be generated in vitro that may be used for adoptive T-cell transfer after allogeneic transplantation.",

This peptide (AAGIGILTV) corresponds to residues 27-35 from the nonmutated melanoma-associated antigen MART-1/Melan A and is recognized by most melanoma-specific, HLA-A*0201-restricted, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. To test the in vivo induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) sensitization, we compared CTL reactivity in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) pools obtained before and after vaccination.;MART-1(27-35) was administered to HLA-A*0201 melanoma patients subcutaneously in an emulsification with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. A vaccination course included four inoculations of peptide at 3-week intervals. PBMC collected by leukapheresis and separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient before and after vaccination were analyzed in 18 patients by in vitro sensitization with MART-1(27-35). To induce MART-1(27-35)-specific CTL, PBMC were incubated with 1 microM peptide (on day 0) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (300 IU/mL, on days 1 and 4 after each stimulation). At weekly intervals, cells were harvested and an aliquot was cryopreserved for later analysis. The remaining cells were replated and restimulated using irradiated autologous PBMC pulsed with 1 microM of relevant peptide. After three restimulations, all samples from one patient were tested simultaneously for HLA-A*0201-restricted anti-MART-1(27-35) reactivity by microcytotoxicity and cytokine (IFN-gamma) release assays.;Toxicities were minimal and consisted of local irritation at the site of vaccine administration. None of the patients sustained a clinical response. The first eight patients were monitored by inducing CTL reactivity from PBMC obtained preimmunization and after two and four vaccinations. Only two prevaccination cultures were reactive to MART-1, compared with five and seven cultures from PBMC obtained after two and four vaccinations, respectively. Thus, an enhancement in cytotoxic activity could be detected in postvaccination CTL cultures, and serial vaccine administrations appeared to boost the detectability of cytotoxicity in vitro. For completeness, the analysis compared prevaccination with postvaccination PBMC cultures. Specific anti-MART-1(27-35) cytotoxicity (> or = 10 lytic units) could be detected in two prevaccination and 12 postvaccination cultures after two in vitro stimulations. In 15 postvaccination CTL cultures, a more than threefold increase in specific release of IFN-gamma was noted, compared with prevaccination.;In vivo administration of a melanoma-associated antigen peptide, emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, could safely augment CTL reactivity against epitopes commonly expressed by melanoma cells. Although the enhancement of CTL reactivity did not achieve tumor regression, it is possible that the use of recombinant immunogens with increased immunomodulatory capabilities in future clinical trials could reach the threshold of CTL activation necessary for tumor regression.",

Histological and clinical data for these tumours were assessed.;ICAM-1 was expressed in 34 of 35 tumours; in 20 cases, more than 50% of the cells stained ICAM-1 positive.

NCAM was expressed in 14 of 34 tumours; in 11 cases, only a small proportion (1-25%) stained NCAM positive. CD3-positive leucocytes were found in 26 of 32 tumours, whereas CD68-positive leucocytes were present in 33 of 34 tumours. Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with NCAM-positive tumours had a 6.4-fold higher risk of dying from conjunctival melanoma (P = 0.02).

Ephrin-A1 was present in occasional early lesions and in advanced primary melanomas (43%) and metastatic melanomas (67%). Expression of ephrin-A1 was induced in melanoma cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our findings are consistent with 2 possible roles for ephrin-A1 in melanoma development: it may promote melanocytic cell growth or survival and induce vascularization in advanced melanomas.

TILs were literally defined as \"tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes\", which a posteriori locate within the tumor tissues. Although such cells can be found, they fail to control the growth of tumor. Many have proposed diverse mechanisms for dysfunction of TILs with regard to the roles of immunosurveillance against cancer. However, only a few cancer types, e.g. melanoma, have seen the benefits brought by activating these cells for immunotherapy. Functional defects of TILs have been linked to abnormalities of signaling molecules; however, there is conflicting data. The death of TILs was attributed to expression of cancer-derived FasL, PD-1 and RCAS1, and cancer-induced activation-induced cell death (AICD). Confirmed by studies using TILs and animal models, the compromise of tumor-specific immune responses was thought to result from not only mechanisms of clonal anergy but also exhaustion and/or deletion. Furthermore, functional cytotoxic CD8(+) TILs might be rendered incompetent by cancer-induced up-regulation of inhibitory NK receptors or proximal signaling abnormalities. Additionally, immune privilege was partly attributed to recruitment of regulatory T cells to the tumor sites. The failure of IL-2 signaling, which stands at the center of T cell functionalities, had been linked to the enzymatic activity of cancer-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Finally, the exploitation of IDO expression, an important enzyme in pregnancy-related immunosuppression, by cancer cells might play a role in tumor immunity. The disparity of cancer types, origin, developmental stages and individual genetic backgrounds likely account for differences, or even contradictions, which might be the reason why immunotherapy works only on a few cancer types. Delineating the mechanisms behind functional defects of TILs can help not only boost chances of the development of a successful cure but understand the not fully identified roles played by immune system in the face of malignancies.",

Spontaneous tumors rarely demonstrate significant immunogenicity in classical transplantation rejection tests. This study demonstrates a novel approach to the question of tumor immunogenicity using viable tumor cells in diffusion chambers. Classical transplantation rejection was induced to the poorly immunogenic, spontaneous B16 murine melanoma by implantation of diffusion chambers containing viable B16 melanoma tumor cells. Implantation of B16 chambers i.p. for at least 4 weeks induced specific, long-term resistance to subsequent live B16 tumor cell challenge. In contrast, immunization with irradiated tumor cells for the same time interval resulted in a delay of tumor growth but had no effect on survival. These studies demonstrate the possibility that a significant anti-tumor immune response against the B16 melanoma may be induced without the presence and negative regulatory influences of a progressively growing B16 tumor. In addition, the diffusion chamber sensitization technique may detect the antigenicity of some tumors which are not detectable by classical transplantation rejection tests. Thus, the diffusion chamber technique provides another avenue for testing the immunogenicity of tumors, especially those of spontaneous origin.",

Furthermore, it has been shown that it has significant anti-tumor effects, which are mediated by T cells and natural killer cells, in a manner similar to interleukin-12. Here, we report the evaluation of the effects of the systemic administration of interleukin-18 in combination with B7-1 (CD80) expressed on tumor cells [interleukin-18 + B7-1] on the growth of murine B16 melanoma in vivo. After the subcutaneous inoculation of B16 melanoma, B16 tumors grew progressively in immunocompetent syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Mice treated with either interleukin-18 or immunized with B7-1-transduced B16 did not demonstrate significant anti-tumor effect. The combination of the two treatments, however, resulted in dramatic suppression of melanoma formation, tumor growth, and a significant improvement in survival. Inhibitory effects of [interleukin-18 + B7-1] on lung metastasis in mice were also detected. Additionally, mice treated with [interleukin-18 + B7-1] showed an increase of natural killer cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma production in vivo. Unlike [interleukin-18 + B7-1], [interleukin-12 + B7-1] did not have a strong anti-tumor effect against B16 melanoma. Histologic characterization after the [interleukin-18 + B7-1] treatment confirmed the infiltration of natural killer cells into the tumor, suggesting that natural killer cells may be involved in the [interleukin-18 + B7-1]-induced anti-tumor effect. This finding was confirmed by showing that depletion of NK1.1+ cells before immunization inhibits the [interleukin-18 + B7-1]-induced anti-tumor effect.

Although pDCs initiate innate and adaptive immunity upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering by pathogens, TLR-independent signals may be responsible for pDC activation and immune suppression in the tumor inflammatory environment. To identify molecules that are potentially involved in alternative pDC activation, we explored the expression and function of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) in human pDCs. In this report, we showed the expression of LAG-3 on the cell surface of a subset of circulating human pDCs. LAG-3+ pDCs exhibited a partially mature phenotype and were enriched at tumor sites in samples from melanoma patients. We found that LAG-3 interacted with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) to induce TLR-independent activation of pDCs with limited IFNα and enhanced IL-6 production. This in vitro cytokine profile of LAG-3-activated pDCs paralleled that of tumor-associated pDCs analyzed ex vivo. By confocal microscopy, LAG-3+ pDCs detected in melanoma-invaded lymph nodes (LNs) stained positive for IL-6 and preferentially localized near melanoma cells. These results suggest that LAG-3-mediated activation of pDCs takes place in vivo at tumor sites, and it is in part responsible for directing an immune-suppressive environment. ",

A single intravenous administration of BAT to mice that had been inoculated with various murine tumors (e.g., B16 melanoma, 3LL carcinoma, and methylcholanthrene fibrosarcoma) resulted in striking antitumor effects as manifested by complete tumor regression and prolonged survival of the treated mice. BAT exhibited a diminished but significant antitumor effect in athymic nude mice, which are deficient in T lymphocytes, and in beige mice, which are deficient in NK cells. Furthermore, selective depletion of T or NK cells in mice reduced the response to the antitumor effect of BAT. These data indicate a dual role for T and NK cells in mediating the antitumor activity of BAT. We report here on the antitumor activity of BAT mAb on human tumor xenografts in mice. BAT demonstrated an antitumor effect in nude mice bearing human colon carcinoma (HT29) xenografts.

In tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from a melanoma patient we found a high frequency of tyrosinase(368-376) peptide-specific cells as detected by IFN-gamma ELISPOT, without detectable staining with the corresponding A2/peptide multimers. Surprisingly, these T cells were able to lyse tyrosinase(368-376) peptide-pulsed target cells as efficiently as other specific T cells that were stained by multimers. Analysis of the staining patterns under different conditions of incubation time and temperature revealed that these results were explained by major differences in TCR-multimeric ligand interaction kinetics among the clones. Whereas no direct quantitative correlation between antigenic peptide concentration required for CTL effector functions and equilibrium multimer binding was observed interclonally, the latter was profoundly affected by the kinetics of TCR-ligand interaction.

These antigens belong to three main groups: tumor-associated testis-specific antigens (e.g. , MAGE, BAGE, and GAGE); melanocyte differentiation antigens (e.g., tyrosinase, Melan-A/MART-1); and mutated or aberrantly expressed molecules (e.g, CDK4, MUM-1, beta-catenin). Although strong CTL activity may be induced ex vivo against most of these antigens, often in the presence of excess cytokines and antigen, a clear understanding of the functional status of CTL in vivo and their impact on tumor growth, is still lacking. Several mechanisms are described that potentially contribute to tumor cell evasion of the immune response, suggesting that any antitumor efficacy achieved by immune effectors may be offset by factors that result ultimately in tumor progression. Nevertheless, most of these MAA are currently being investigated as immunizing agents in clinical studies, the conflicting results of which are reviewed. Indeed, the therapeutic potential of MAA has still to be fully exploited and new strategies have to be found in order to achieve an effective and long-lasting in vivo immune control of melanoma growth and progression.",

MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 gene expression has been identified in a number of human malignancies, and MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 antigenic peptides are potential targets for tumor-specific immunotherapy. The only normal tissues known to express these genes are testicular germ cells and placental tissue. The objective of this study was to examine MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 antigens immunohistochemically in testicular germ cell tumors, including seminoma, a germ cell tumor frequently associated with a lymphoid infiltrate. Forty-three germ cell tumors (24 seminomas, six embryonal carcinomas and 13 mixed germ cell tumors), and 10 Leydig cell tumors were selected for study, and standard immunohistochemical techniques were used on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using mouse monoclonal antibodies to MAGE-1 (clone M454) and MAGE-3 (clone 57B) antigens. MAGE-1 antigen was identified in 16.6% of seminomas. No embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, or teratomas contained MAGE-1 protein. MAGE-3 antigen was identified in 41.8% of seminomas, and this protein was not identified in embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumors, or teratoma. Spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes contained MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 antigen, and more mature forms, including spermatids, were weakly positive to negative. Leydig cell tumors were negative for MAGE-1 and MAGE-3. In seminoma, the presence of MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 antigens did not correlate with tumor size, tumor stage, the presence of a lymphoid infiltrate, or patient outcome. The low frequency of MAGE-specific HLA alleles in the population, the loss of the HLA class I antigens in neoplastic germ cells, and the finding that the majority of seminomas and all non-seminomatous germ cell tumors lacked MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 antigenic peptides indicate that immunotherapy directed towards MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 antigen is not a likely treatment option for seminoma and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors.

So they have been established previously (with an efficacy of 47%) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium enriched with fetal calf serum (FCS). In order to improve the probability of establishing melanoma cell lines, we compared two FCS-free media with the original FCS medium. Ten melanoma-invaded lymph nodes were tested for their ability to grow in three different culture media: RPMI with FCS; RPMI with human serum (HS); serum-free X-vivo 15 (X15). For each medium, we compared the following criteria: percentage of lines obtained; period of establishment; cell morphology; expression of melanoma-associated antigens and surface molecules. More cell lines were obtained with HS and X15 media compared to FCS medium (7/10, 5/10 and 4/10, respectively). The time period to establish a stable line was similar for the three media. No morphological differences were observed in cells derived from the same tumor sample in the different media. With the X15 medium, cells generally expressed lower levels of melanocytic differentiation antigens and surface molecules. The growth of melanoma cell lines in FCS-free culture media appears possible and advantageous, with an increased probability of obtaining autologous tumor cell lines.

This has been suggested by reports of spontaneous responses of metastatic disease with strong immune infiltrates, and supported by recent data correlating clinical response after IFNalpha treatment with development of generalized autoimmunity. Since the identification of melanoma-associated tumor antigens, many groups have performed clinical trials to take advantage of this discovery with melanoma-specific cancer vaccines. These trials, in which multiple antigen delivery strategies have been tested in hundreds of patients, have demonstrated that these vaccines are safe, immunogenic, and yield a low frequency of objective clinical responses. The ability to perform careful immunological monitoring has allowed important insights into the nature of the anti-tumor immunity generated by these vaccinations. While many trials have found that the absolute frequency of T cells specific for a vaccine-encoded antigen are a marker of immunization, it does not correlate with objective clinical response. Induction of broad immunity to multiple tumor antigens, taking advantage of cross-reactive T cells and activation of persistent T cells may be more important. Harnessing additional modes of amplifying immune responses (lymphodepletion, cytokine support, inhibition of negative immune self-regulation) are now being tested and should improve clinical responses from 5% to 10% complete response seen currently.",

The present study investigated whether interleukin (IL)-18, which can enhance Fas ligand expression, is produced by B16F10 melanoma cells and is involved in immune escape of tumor cells. Immunohistology, reverse transcription-PCR, intracellular fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, and immunoblotting demonstrated that melanoma cells express IL-18. C57BL/6 splenocytes cultured with culture supernatants of B16F10 melanoma cells enhanced IFN-gamma production, which was blocked by anti-IL-18 antibody, indicating that IL-18 in the culture supernatants is functional. In addition to IL-18, the IL-18 receptor was also detected in B16F10 melanoma cells, suggesting a role of this cytokine in regulating the functions of B16F10 melanoma cells. The functional effect of IL-18 on B16F10 melanoma cells was shown by reduction of Fas ligand expression in cells treated with anti-IL-18 antibody or transfected with IL-18 antisense cDNA. In addition, the same treatments decreased intracellular reactive oxygen intermediate levels in B16F10 melanoma cells, indicating that IL-18 regulates reactive oxygen intermediate production, which is involved in Fas ligand expression. Furthermore, transfection of IL-18 antisense cDNA into melanoma cells increased the susceptibility of tumor cells to natural killer cells in vitro. When IL-18 antisense transfectants were implanted into syngeneic mice, severe reduction of tumor cell growth was observed with concomitant infiltrated natural killer cells in the tumor area. Taken together, these results demonstrate that IL-18 has a critical role as a survival factor for B16F10 melanoma cells.",

The antigens were detected employing an indirect, biotin-streptavidin conjugated alkaline phosphatase (AP) immunocytochemical technique. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I restricted, tumor-associated antigen (TAA) specific, CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were identified in 58/76 (76.32%) brain tumors, and usually represented 1-10% of all cells, but in some cases 30-44% of the cells were CD8(+). CD4(+), MHC class II restricted helper lymphocytes were present in 65/76 (85.53%) brain tumors, and accounted for 1-10% of the observed cells. Macrophages were present in 74/76 (97.37%) brain tumors, and their number also represented 1-10% of all observed cells in the brain tumor frozen sections. Leukocyte common antigen (LCA) expression was detected in all 76 (100%) brain tumors studied. MoAB UJ 308 detected the presence of premyelocytes and mature granulocytes in 60/76 (78.95%) brain tumors. Natural killer (NK) cells were not defined in the observed brain tumors. The great majority of childhood glial tumors, particularly ASTRs express Fas (APO-1/CD95) receptor whereas normal cells in the central nervous system (CNS) do not. FasR is a transmembrane glycoprotein which belongs to the nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor (NGF/TNF) receptor superfamily. As part of our screening, the 42 childhood ASTRs were also investigated for expression of CD95. We detected strong expression (strong intensity of staining, number of stained cells 50-100%) of FasR, employing formalin fixed, paraffin-wax embedded tissue slides. Brain tumors and melanomas have been shown to produce their autocrine FasL, and are even capable of switching CD95-related signal transduction from the PCD pathway to a proliferative pathway. In view of our results, we conclude that: (1) the tumor infiltrating leukocytes in MEDs/PNETs and ASTRs represent a very diverse population and are present in a great majority of the cases studied; (2) the strong expression of FasR in ASTRs provides a manner in which T lymphocytes may exert their anti-tumor effects, but may also represent yet another way that tumors may evade the immune response; and (3) further observations of the expression of various antigens involved in juxtacrine, in situ growth control are necessary for the refinement of cellular immunotherapeutical approaches in the treatment of human malignancies.",

Better knowledge of signaling pathways has enabled the development of new cancer immunotherapy. The discovery of negative feedback mechanisms following the lymphocyte activation has promoted the development of new antibodies targeting molecule inhibitors such as PD1, PDL1 or CTLA-4. Dramatic results were obtained with melanoma. Checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab and ipilimumab) have many advantages in terms of rate of objective response and overall survival. Recent studies in translational research aimed to understand and analyze mechanisms of action of anti-PD1/anti-PDL1. Expression of PDL1 in the tumor is associated with a significantly greater objective response rate (immunohistochemistry). Nevertheless, limits with tumor immunohistochemical analysis encourage new biomarkers research. Other immunotherapy approaches, such as cell and gene therapies using engineered T cells call for further advancements to broaden their applicability. However, these therapies are very expensive and their manufacturing process very restrictive, which could lately limit their use in case of inefficiency of checkpoint inhibitors or when lymphocytic infiltration in tumor is absent. In this case, the objective would be to engineer ex vivo the patient's immune system by restoring the ability of T cells to identify and suppress tumor cells.

After adjustment by Cox regression for tumor size, cell type, microvascular loops and networks, and microvascular density, a clinically meaningful 0.15 difference in 10-year melanoma-specific survival persisted.;The presence of ezrin immunoreactivity in uveal malignant melanoma is associated with higher mortality and with two independent high-risk characteristics: microvascular density and number of infiltrating macrophages.

In these cases, atypical cells were difficult if not impossible to identify in routinely processed sections, either because the invasive cell was a spindle cell variant and indistinguishable from a fibrohistiocytic cell, because the invasive cells were occasionally solitary or in small groups, or because there was an inflammatory infiltrate that obscured the tumor cells. Recent studies of lentigo maligna melanoma have revealed no better prognosis when compared to that of other forms of malignant melanoma after normalization for depth and body location.

The effect of histone modifications and their catalysing enzymes over euchromatic promoter DNA methylation in melanoma remains unclear. This study investigated the potential association of p16(INK) (4A) promoter methylation with histone methyltransferase SETDB1 expression in Greek patients with sporadic melanoma and their correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. Promoter methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR in 100 peripheral blood samples and 58 melanoma tissues from the same patients. Cell proliferation (Ki-67 index), p16(INK) (4A) and SETDB1 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. High-frequency promoter methylation (25.86%) was observed in tissue samples and correlated with increased cell proliferation (P = 0.0514). p16(INK) (4A) promoter methylation was higher in vertical growth-phase (60%) melanomas than in radial (40%, P = 0.063) and those displaying epidermal involvement (P = 0.046). Importantly, p16(INK) (4A) methylation correlated with increased melanoma thickness according to Breslow index (P = 0.0495) and marginally with increased Clark level (I/II vs III/IV/V, P = 0.070). Low (1-30%) p16(INK) (4A) expression was detected at the majority (19 of 54) of melanoma cases (35.19%), being marginally correlated with tumor lymphocytic infiltration (P = 0.078).

In the present study, we report that a significant fraction of adoptively transferred A-LAK cells, labeled with fluorochromes for identification, accumulates in lung and liver metastases of the B16 melanoma, the MCA 102 sarcoma and the Lewis lung carcinoma lines. Thus, 5- to 10-fold higher numbers of A-LAK cells were found in the malignant lesions compared to the surrounding normal tissue. The infiltration seemed very heterogeneous after intravenous injection of moderate numbers of A-LAK cells (15 x 10(6)). However, after adoptive transfer of 45 million A-LAK cells, an A-LAK cell/tumor cell ratio higher than 1:1 in most metastases was observed. Surprisingly, approximately 5% of the lung metastases seemed totally resistant to infiltration even though neighboring metastases were highly infiltrated.

When analyzing T-cell recognition of shared melanoma antigens before and after adoptive cell therapy in melanoma patients, we observe a greater number of melanoma-specific T-cell populations compared with cytometry-based approaches. Furthermore, we detect neoepitope-specific T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood from patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

To date, the true source of tumor-related DNA in serum remains unknown. We hypothesized that CTC is a possible origin of serum tumor-related methylated DNA and their combination can predict disease outcome. To test this hypothesis, we obtained matched pairs of peripheral blood lymphocytes and serum specimens simultaneously from 50 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV melanoma patients before administration of biochemotherapy. Peripheral blood leukocytes were analyzed for three mRNA markers of CTC: MART-1, GalNAc-T, and MAGE-A3. Sera were analyzed for two methylated DNA markers: RASSF1A and RAR-beta2. CTC were detected in 13 of 15 (86%) patients with serum tumor-related methylated DNA and only in 13 of 35 (37%) patients without methylated DNA (P = 0.001). The number of CTC markers detected significantly correlated with methylated DNA (P = 0.008). CTC and methylated DNA were significantly correlated with biochemotherapy-treated patients' outcome. Patients with both CTC and methylated DNA showed significantly poorer response to biochemotherapy (P = 0.02) and worse time to progression and overall survival (P = 0.009 and 0.02, respectively). The correlation between CTC and serum tumor-related methylated DNA and the significant effect of this correlation on disease outcome indicate that a composite molecular assessment in blood may be a useful determinant of disease status and efficacy of systemic therapy for melanoma.",

We conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of the T-cell TIL subpopulations in frozen tissue sections taken from 82 consecutive B-cell diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) patients. Initially, we analyzed the relationship in these patients between relapse-free survival (RFS) and their T-cell TIL characteristics. Nineteen patients had a low percentage (less than 6% of Leu-2+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T-cell TILs, and 63 patients had a high percentage (greater than 6%) of Leu-2+ TILs. We found that a low percentage of Leu-2+ TILs correlated with a reduction in RFS: at 20 mo follow-up, all 19 low Leu-2+ patients had relapsed, whereas 70% of the 63 high Leu-2+ patients remained relapse-free (P = 0.008). No significant correlations appeared between patients' T-cell TIL subsets and overall survival. The percentage of newly diagnosed tumors with low counts of Leu-4+ (pan-T) TILs was marginally greater among interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-positive tumors than among IL-2 receptor-negative tumors (50 versus 28%, P = 0.098), which suggests that specific phenotypic characteristics of B-cell DLCL may modulate the host T-cell TIL response. Our results indicate that the host's T-cell TIL response in B-cell DLCL can be quantitated from frozen tissue sections and that this response may be related to disease course. Further related TIL studies may lead to new immunorestorative therapeutic approaches for patients with deficient or aberrant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte host responses.",

OVCAR-3 tumors were treated i.t. with monocytes alone, IFN-α2a and IFN-γ alone or combination of all three on day 0, 15 or 30 post-tumor implantation. Mice receiving combination therapy beginning day 15 showed significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival including complete regression in 40% mice. Tumor volumes measured on day 80 in mice receiving combination therapy (206 mm(3)) were significantly smaller than those of mice receiving the IFNs alone (1,041 mm(3)), monocytes alone (1,111 mm(3)) or untreated controls (1,728 mm(3)). Similarly, combination therapy with monocytes and IFNs of much larger tumor also inhibited OVCAR-3 tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry studies showed a large number of activated macrophages (CD31(+)/CD68(+)) infiltrating into OVCAR-3 tumors and higher densities of IL-12, IP10 and NOS2, markers of M1 (classical) macrophages in tumors treated with combination therapy compared to the controls. Interestingly, IFNs-activated macrophages induced apoptosis of OVCAR-3 tumor cells as monocytes alone or IFNs alone did not mediate significant apoptosis. Similar antitumor activity was observed in the LOX melanoma mouse model, but not as profound as seen with the OVCAR-3 tumors. Administration of either mixture of monocytes and IFN-α2a or monocytes and IFN-γ did not inhibit Lox melanoma growth; however, a significant inhibition was observed when tumors were treated with a mixture of monocytes, IFN-α2a and IFN-γ.

Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased. These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.

A clinical pilot study in patients with disseminated melanoma refractory to standard therapy was initiated using a different approach. The authors generated autologous monocyte-derived DC and fused these DC with gamma-irradiated primary autologous tumor cells by incubation in polyethylene glycol. In previous experiments, the authors had shown that these fused cell products are potent inducers of a T-cell response in a mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture. Seventeen patients were immunized with the cell product by s.c. injection in monthly intervals without any serious side effects. Of these patients, one had a partial response with decrease in size of all evaluable tumor manifestations. In one patient, some of the metastases were regressing despite an overall progressive disease, and one patient achieved disease stabilization for six months. In the responding patient, in parallel to tumor regression, circumscript hair depigmentation occurred.

The dominant clone expressed a high-avidity TCR to cognate tumor Ag, efficiently killed tumor cells, and prevailed in the differentiated effector-memory T lymphocyte compartment. TCR sequencing also revealed that this particular clone arose at least 1 year before vaccination, displayed long-term persistence, and efficient homing to metastases. Remarkably, during concomitant vaccination over 3.5 years, the frequency of the pre-existing clone progressively increased, reaching up to 2.5% of the circulating CD8 pool while its effector functions were enhanced. In parallel, the disease stabilized, but subsequently progressed with loss of Melan-A expression by melanoma cells. Collectively, combined ex vivo analysis of T cell differentiation and clonality revealed for the first time a strong expansion of a tumor Ag-specific human T cell clone, comparable to protective virus-specific T cells.

The reason for these opposite effects is not yet known. Levan (polyfructose), an immunomodulatory polysaccharide, has been found to exert opposite effects on the growth of the F10 variant of B16 melanoma. Low doses inhibit and high doses enhance the growth of this tumor. Cyclophosphamide (CY) augments the inhibitory effect of the polysaccharide. In order to elucidate the mechanism of these opposite effects, we tried to determine the changes induced by levan at inhibitory and stimulatory doses, alone or in conjunction with CY, on the lymphatic and hematopoietic systems of B16-F10 melanoma-bearing mice. In a previous study we reported the effect of these treatments on the morphology of spleen and lymph nodes (Leibovici, Kopel, Siegal & Gal-Mor (1986). Int. J. Immunopharmac., 8, 391). In the present study, we examined the effect of the treatments on bone marrow and peripheral blood composition. The growth of the tumor itself, as well as the various treatments, induced very marked changes in both bone marrow and blood. Tumor inoculation produced a sharp leukopenia and anemia followed by a restoration of both white and red blood cells. In the bone marrow, the tumor caused a gradual decrease in lymphocyte number. CY accentuated the severe leukopenia caused by the tumor. Lymphocyte depletion was prolonged, while restoration of granulocytes was achieved by day 7. A similar pattern of changes was observed in the bone marrow. With levan, opposite effects were observed in blood and bone marrow with the two doses in relation to the number of the cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lines: while 0.1 mg (tumor inhibitory) doses caused a more active restoration of lymphocytes as compared to 10 mg (tumor stimulatory) doses, an opposite effect was seen on the myeloid series--the high dose induced a more pronounced granulocytosis than the low dose. In the combined treatment, the low levan dose accelerated lymphocyte restoration in bone marrow compared to CY, while the high dose delayed the recovery of these cells. The results of the present study in conjunction with our previous study may explain the basis of the intriguing tumor inhibitory-stimulatory effects of some immunomodulators. Moderate increases in myeloid cell series appear to favor tumor inhibition and high increases favor tumor stimulation. In addition, the results of this study suggest that a regulatory relation might exist between the proliferation of the lymphoid and myeloid cell series.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There is a worldwide increase in the incidence of melanoma. Without treatment, melanomas can progress to metastatic disease and result in death. It is now accepted that for a tumor to grow, non-tumorous host tissue must form blood vessels in and around the tumor. Tumor cells and blood vessels must form a highly regulated system whereby endothelial cells can be switched from a resting state to one of rapid growth. Tumor cells have been shown to produce diffusible angiogenic regulatory molecules. Nitric oxide [NO] and polyamines [PA] have been implicated in the angiogenic process. This paper hypothesizes that NO and PA regulate melanoma angiogenesis differently. During early stages of malignant melanoma an increase in PA synthesis is expected to promote endothelial cell proliferation and therefore angiogenesis. NO is expected to be maintained at low levels. During the vascular stage of malignant melanoma, NO synthesis is hypothesized to be elevated which will decrease endothelial cell proliferation and maintain a vasodilator tone in and around the tumor. PA concentrations are expected to be lower. A regulatory link between NO and PA may be involved in the maintenance of tumor homeostasis. The regulation of L-arginine metabolism in tumor angiogenesis requires investigation as it may lead to novel selective therapeutic interventions in cancer therapy.",

Fifty percent of the patients with stage II melanoma treated by operation and adjuvant immunotherapy had recurrent or metastatis disease within two years. No adverse effects were noted in patients with early disease who received adjuvant therapy. Two patients who had a full course of systemic BCG therapy developed severe reactions after intralesional injection of the vaccine. Further experience with various immunotherapeutic regimens and longer follow-up are necessary to evaluate its value in the early stages of melanoma.",

Patients with stable or responding disease were maintained on treatment until tumor resolution or progression. Systemic toxicity was infrequent, dose-related, and limited to mild flu-like symptoms that resolved within 24 hours. Local inflammation, at times with pustule formation, was consistently seen with doses of > or =10(7) PFU/lesion. Chronically treated lesions showed a dense infiltration, with CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. All seven patients developed an antivaccinia humoral immune response 14-21 days following revaccination. Despite the presence of these antivaccinia antibodies, the reporter gene was expressed, as judged by the development of anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies in all patients. Passenger cytokine gene function was evidenced by the presence of virally encoded GM-CSF mRNA at injection sites both early (weeks 1 and 5) and late (week 31) in the course of treatment. Eosinophilia at treatment sites indicated that physiologically significant levels of functional cytokine were generated. However, there were no changes in the total number of peripheral white blood cells or in the numbers or percentages of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, or eosinophils. GM-CSF was not detected in the sera. The two patients with the largest tumor burdens failed to respond even at treatment sites. Three patients had mixed responses, with regression of treated and untreated dermal metastases and progression of disease elsewhere. One patient had a partial response, with regression of injected and uninjected regional dermal metastases. Residual melanoma was excised, rendering the patient disease free. One patient with only dermal metastases confined to the scalp achieved a complete remission. Sequential administration of escalating doses of a GM-CSF recombinant vaccinia virus is safe, effective at maintaining passenger gene function, and can induce tumor regression.",

Autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were sensitized in in vitro co-culture (IVC) against radiated PJ-M cells in the presence or absence of PJ-M-sensitized LNL and enriched suppressor (OKT8+) or inducer (OKT4+) LNL populations, and were assayed for cytotoxicity in a 4-hr 51Cr-release microcytotoxicity assay. Significant cytotoxic response against PJ-M could be generated in the PBL, but not in the LNL. The addition of sensitized, unfractionated LNL, OKT8+, or OKT4+ LNL populations abrogated cytotoxic response in the PBL against PJ-M. The suppression of cytotoxic response was induced selectively against the PJ-M targets, because IVC of PBL in the presence of the sensitized LNL did not affect the generation of polyclonal cytotoxic alloreactivities, nor did they abrogate the generation of cytotoxic response against allogeneic targets in IVC against the corresponding allogeneic targets. These results suggest the possibility that cytotoxic immune response against the autologous melanoma cells might have been suppressed by the individual's own immunoregulatory circuit.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is the most deadly type of skin cancer, constituting annually ∼ 75% of all cutaneous cancer-related deaths due to metastatic spread. Currently, because of metastatic spread, there are no effective treatment options for late-stage metastatic melanoma patients. Studies over the past two decades have provided insight into several complex molecular mechanisms as to how these malignancies evade immunological control, indicating the importance of immune escape or suppression for tumor survival. Thus, it is essential to develop innovative cancer strategies and address immune obstacles with the goal of generating more effective immunotherapies. One important area of study is to further elucidate the role and significance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. These cells possess a remarkable ability to suppress immune responses and, as such, facilitate tumor growth. Thus, MDSCs represent an important new target for preventing tumor progression and escape from immune control. In this study, we investigated the role of MDSCs in immune suppression of T cells in an antigen-specific B16 melanoma murine system utilizing a novel synthetic tyrosinase (Tyr) DNA vaccine therapy in both prophylactic and therapeutic models. This Tyr vaccine induced a robust and broad immune response, including directing CD8 T-cell infiltration into tumor sites. The vaccine also reduced the number of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment through the downregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin-10, CXCL5 and arginase II, factors important for MDSC expansion. This novel synthetic DNA vaccine significantly reduced the melanoma tumor burden and increased survival in vivo, due likely, in part, to the facilitation of a change in the tumor microenvironment through MDSC suppression.",

We retrospectively studied the expression of immune (escape) markers in metastatic melanoma tissues of 27 patients before autologous tumor cell vaccination, and 16 patients who were intended to treat but were not vaccinated because of rapid disease progression. Immunohistochemical data of infiltrating (suppressive) cells, such as T cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and mast cells, or the expression of T-cell inhibitory factors (PD-1/PD-L1, IDO, and galectins), cytotoxic molecules (granzyme-B), melanocyte differentiation antigens, HLA class-I and tolerogenic cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-β] were correlated statistically to clinical outcome and overall survival (OS). Significantly more tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (both P < 0.05) were found in nonprogressors to vaccination (n = 9; median OS, 56 months), compared with progressors (n = 18; median OS, 9.5 months). Moreover, granzyme-B expression was elevated in the tumors of nonprogressors, suggesting activated cytotoxic T cells or natural killer cells. T-cell infiltration and granzyme-B expression significantly correlated with overall OS. T-cell inhibitory factors and suppressive cells did not correlate with OS, suggesting minor influence of these immune-escape markers on clinical outcome. The data of progressors were comparable with those from patients with rapid progression (not vaccinated; n = 16; median OS, 3 months). Our study shows that high numbers of intratumoral activated CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells, before autologous tumor cell vaccination, are associated with favorable clinical outcome. Analyses of these markers in the patients' tumor tissues before immunotherapy may therefore be a valuable tool to select patients for whom the treatment may result in potential clinical benefit.",

In the present report, the interactions between LR and human cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are described. Two cultured T-cell populations are specifically cytotoxic for autologous human melanoma and fail to lyse allogeneic melanoma, K562, or autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in 4 h chromium release assays. Pretreating allogeneic melanoma or K562 with LR resulted in 19-67% lysis at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 5:1, while no more than 10% lysis was observed without LR. Autologous PBLs were also subject to lysis when pretreated with LR (50% at an E:T of 40:1 with LR, and 2% without LR). The observed effect was dose-related and was most effectively inhibited by autologous cold targets, but persisted in the presence of antibody to human lymphocyte antigen class I antigens (w6/32). Lysis of autologous melanoma was not increased by pretreatment with LR. LR appears to mediate lysis of melanoma, NK targets, and normal PBLs by tumor specific CTLs. The effect is dose-related and non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted. The data do not support a significant role for LR in the normal physiology of human CTLs, but the striking effects in vitro may prove to be experimentally or therapeutically useful.",

To examine this issue, highly specific oligoclonal MHC class I-restricted cytolytic TIL grown in bulk culture from patient 397 were used to immunoselect a TIL-resistant variant tumor from the autologous cultured melanoma line 397-mel. Four cycles of immunoselection produced tumor 397-R4, a variant completely resistant to 397 TIL but not to allogeneic LAK cell lysis in 4-h 51Cr release assays. By flow microfluorometry analysis, this tumor variant had not lost MHC molecules, adhesion molecules, or a variety of tumor-associated Ag expressed by the parent tumor but showed decreased expression of many Ag examined. Failure of 397-R4 to cold target inhibit TIL lysis of 397-mel suggested that cell-surface modification was at least one mechanism causing TIL resistance. The inherent lysability of 397-R4 was equal to 397-mel, as confirmed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, lysis by non-MHC restricted allogeneic TIL, and lysis by a second line of 397 TIL grown independently from tumor 397. Treatment of 397-R4 with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, +/- TNF-alpha for 72 h before cytolytic assays enhanced TIL lysis of this target slightly, and enhanced surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. The resistant phenotype of 397-R4 was evident in all clones of 397-R4 examined and has been maintained in serial culture for over 13 mo and through passage in nude mice, suggesting that such stable tumor variants may provide an in vivo escape mechanism from specific immune reagents such as TIL. Evolving patterns of TIL culture clonality over time, as well as the spontaneous emergence of different clones in two long term TIL cultures grown under identical conditions from the same source of cryopreserved tumor, were documented by analyzing TCR gene rearrangements and suggest that TIL from different culture passages or lines may be used to overcome resistant tumor subpopulations.",

Patients treated with one course of the anti-OX40 mAb showed an acceptable toxicity profile and regression of at least one metastatic lesion in 12 of 30 patients. Mechanistically, this treatment increased T and B cell responses to reporter antigen immunizations, led to preferential upregulation of OX40 on CD4(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and increased the antitumor reactivity of T and B cells in patients with melanoma.

Tumors of nonlymph-node metastases from two responders yielded neither TILs nor tumor cells, whereas those from all four nonresponders had both TILs [(1.1-13.8) x 10(6) cells/g tumor] and tumor cells [(2.8-30.8) x 10(6) cells/g tumor). Tumors of lymph node metastases from nine patients yielded substantial numbers both of TILs and tumor cells, regardless of different clinical responses, except with one complete responder, whose tumor did not contain tumor cells. The mean increase of TILs from these tumors (n = 14) 3-4 weeks after incubation with 200 U/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) was 2.5-fold, whereas there was a 56-fold increase in TILs from untreated tumors (n = 3). CD3+ T cells predominated in TILs before and after expansion with IL-2. IL-2-activated TILs from five of six tumors tested displayed higher cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells than against cells from any of three allogeneic tumors. Mean tumor cell numbers (10(6) cells/trial) obtained by serial needle biopsies for the same tumor in five patients decreased from 1.2 before therapy to 0.25 at day 4 of therapy (interferon alpha alone), and to 0.02 at day 8 (interferon alpha and IL-2). This decrease did not correlate with clinical responses. Yields (x 10(6) cells/g tumor) of TILs and tumor cells in subcutaneous melanomas obtained by excisional biopsies in one nonresponder under IL-2 therapy were respectively 0.2 and 1.1 before therapy (day 0), 0.1 and less than 0.01 during (day 7), 0.2 and less than 0.01 at the end of therapy (day 21), and 0.5 and 0.5 at the time of tumor progression (day 66). Yields of TILs and tumor cells in the other nonresponder were respectively 3 and 26 before (day 0), 16 and 3 during (day 7), and 0.4 and less than 0.01 at the end of IL-2 therapy (day 17), and 2.5 and 6 at the time of progression (day 62). TILs in these two patients before therapy proliferated well in culture with IL-2 (570- and 720-fold, respectively), and showed higher cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells, whereas none of those from the five tumors biopsied during or at the end of IL-2 therapy proliferated. TILs at the time of progression showed modest proliferation (54- and 76-fold, respectively) and showed major-histocompatibility-complex-nonrestricted cytotoxicity. In summary, a decrease in the number of live tumor cells did not always correlate with clinical response in either therapy. CVD chemotherapy may simply impair IL-2-induced proliferation of TILs. IL-2 therapy may induce transient unresponsiveness of TILs to IL-2.",
