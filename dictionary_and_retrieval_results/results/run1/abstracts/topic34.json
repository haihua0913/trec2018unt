In RIS, TP53 mutations are frequent, but little is known about Mdm2-p53 interaction, which is a recent therapeutic target of sarcomas.;We studied the immunohistochemical expression of Mdm2 and p53 of 8 RISs. The intervals between radiation therapy and diagnosis of secondary sarcomas ranged from 3 to 17 years.;Mdm2 expression was more common in de novo sarcomas than RISs (75% vs 37.5%), and p53 expression was more common in RISs than in de novo cases (75% vs 37.5%). While half of the RISs were Mdm2(-)/p53(+), none of de novo cases showed such combination; while half of de novo sarcomas were Mdm2(+)/p53(-), which are a candidate group of Mdm2 inhibitors, only 1 RIS showed such a combination. Variable immunoprofiles observed in both groups did not correlate with tumor types, except that all of 2 myxofibrosarcomas were Mdm2(+)/p53(+).;In conclusion, we speculated that both radiation-induced and de novo sarcomagenesis are not due to a unique genetic mechanism. Mdm2-expression without p53 overexpression in 1 case of RIS decreases the future possibility of applying Mdm2 inhibitors on a subset of these difficult tumors.",

We have investigated if Nutlin-3a could be employed to augment the response to traditional therapy and/or reduce the genotoxic burden of chemotherapy.;A panel of sarcoma cell lines with different TP53 and MDM2 status were treated with Nutlin-3a combined with Doxorubicin, Methotrexate or Cisplatin, and their combination index determined.;Clear synergism was observed when Doxorubicin and Nutlin-3a were combined in cell lines with wild-type TP53 and amplified MDM2, or with Methotrexate in both MDM2 normal and amplified sarcoma cell lines, allowing for up to tenfold reduction of cytotoxic drug dose. Interestingly, Nutlin-3a seemed to potentiate the effect of classical drugs as Doxorubicin and Cisplatin in cell lines with mutated TP53, but inhibited the effect of Methotrexate.;The use of Nutlin in combination with classical sarcoma chemotherapy shows promising preclinical potential, but since clear biomarkers are still lacking, clinical trials should be followed up with detailed tumour profiling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Purpose. MDM2 is an oncogene whose protein product may promote tumorigenesis by blocking wild-type p53 tumor suppressor mediated G (0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting repair of damaged DNA prior to cell division. While MDM2 DNA amplification is frequently observed in human sarcoma, the mechanisms linking this amplification to MDM2 oncoprotein over-production as well as its functional significance have not been well characterized in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.Methods. A tissue bank of resected soft tissue sarcomas and autologous normal tissues was assembled; all specimens were snap frozen within 15 min of resection. DNA and RNA were extracted from tissues using isoamyl alcohol and phenol chloroform extraction methods, respectively; cell lysates were prepared using PBSTDS lysis buffer. DNA and mRNA were confirmed as being non-degraded and were then examined for MDM2 DNA amplification (Southern blots) and mRNA over-expression (Northern blots) using actin (DNA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mRNA) as loading controls. The MDM2 protein was examined on Western blots using the MDM2-specific monoclonal antibody IF2 (Oncogene Science, Inc). The presence of p53 DNA and expression of p53 mRNA was examined by rehybridizing the Southern and Northern filters using a p53-specific cDNA probe.Results. Soft tissue sarcomas and autologous normal tissues were screened for MDM2 DNA amplification, which was detected in 10 of 30 tumors screened. After screening, there was sufficient biomaterials from six specimens for subsequent Northern and Western analysis to see whether MDM2 gene amplification correlated with over-expression of MDM2 mRNA and MDM2 protein. In addition, we examined whether other mechanisms may lead to over-expression of the MDM2 oncoprotein. Several possible mechanisms of MDM2 oncoprotein over-expression were identified. These most commonly included MDM2 DNA amplification, MDM2 mRNA over-expression and MDM2 oncoprotein over-expression. However, some soft tissue sarcoma patient specimens had no evidence of MDM2 mRNA over-expression yet had MDM2 oncoprotein over-production in the tumor relative to autologous normal tissue, implying possible post-transcriptional regulation. Of functional relevance, MDM2 oncoprotein over-production by tumors was associated with large decreases in the percentage of cells in the (0)/G(1) cell cycle interface compared with autologous normal tissue cells.Discussion. It is likely that there are multiple mechanisms underlying human soft tissue sarcoma MDM2 oncoprotein over-production. Consequently, strategies that decrease MDM2 over-production, such as transcriptional repression to inhibit MDM2 promoter activity or RNA antisense approaches, may ultimately offer the best therapeutic efficacy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 is observed frequently in human sarcomas. Although overexpression of these protooncogenes might inhibit growth regulation through the TP53- and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB)-mediated pathways, neither gene was included consistently in all of the amplicons observed in our sarcoma panel. It was unclear whether both of these genes were selected for during amplification. Furthermore, in some samples without amplification of MDM2 or CDK4, comparative genomic hybridization showed amplification in the 12q13-15 region, suggesting that another selection mechanism might also be involved. To investigate the possibility that another target gene, which may be located between CDK4 and MDM2, could be the driving force, we characterized the involvement of 17 loci from this region in 12q13-15 amplicons that were detected previously in 21 sarcoma samples. The results showed discrete amplicons around MDM2 and CDK4 with reduced amplification of the intervening sequences. This suggests that there is separate selection for amplification of the two genes, and it makes the possibility of a common selective gene unlikely. Furthermore, D12S8, localized distal to MDM2, was amplified almost as frequently as MDM2 and was also amplified in one of the samples without MDM2 or CDK4 amplification. The data suggest that amplification of at least three different regions within the 12q13-15 segment may be selected for in tumor cells involving MDM2, CDK4, or a more distally located gene, possibly near D12S8.",

The expression and amplification of MDM2 could be demonstrated by means of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Furthermore, staging examinations did not reveal indications of any other primary tumors. These preliminary findings were suggestive of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma; however, in the further diagnostic work-up the tumor showed strong expression of CD21 and CD23 and was ultimately diagnosed as a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS). The case emphasizes that MDM2 expression represents a possible pitfall in the diagnosis of spindle cell tumors.

A cohort of 211 soft tissue sarcomas from adults that were both clinically and pathologically well characterized was analyzed. Monoclonal antibodies directed against mdm2 and p53 proteins were used to measure overexpression of these proteins in the nuclei of cells from sections of these tumors. Seventy-six of 207 tumors had abnormally high levels of mdm2 proteins and 56 of 211 tumors overexpressed p53 protein. Twenty-two cases had abnormally high levels of both mdm2 and p53 proteins based upon immunoreactivity with these antibodies. There was a striking statistically significant correlation between the overexpression of p53 and mdm2 proteins in the same tumor and poor survival (P < 0.05) of the patients. A group of 73 soft tissue sarcomas was chosen for analysis using Southern blots, single strand conformation polymorphisms, and direct DNA sequencing to confirm mdm2 gene amplifications and p53 mutations and correlate these with the results of the immunoreactivities.

MDM2 amplification, a genetic abnormality of well-differentiated liposarcoma, is known to be present not only in DDLPS, but also in some other sarcomas. To differentiate DDLPS, we investigated MDM2 amplification and expression in high-grade spindle sarcomas. Eighty-five cases of nonlipogenic high-grade sarcomas, diagnosed between 2008 and 2011, were investigated. Tissue microarray, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for MDM2 were performed. Forty-one of 85 cases (48.2%) showed MDM2 amplification and expression. Cases of MDM2 amplification were reclassified based on histology, immunophenotype, and clinical data. Thirty-nine of 41 cases, including those originally diagnosed as DDLPS (n=30), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n=7), myxofibrosarcoma (n=1), and pleomorphic liposarcoma (n=1) could be reclassified as DDLPS. In addition, MDM2 immunohistochemistry and MDM2 fluorescence in situ hybridization showed an excellent correlation (P<0.001, sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 100%). MDM2 amplification and expression are potentially very useful in distinguishing between DDLPS and other undifferentiated high-grade spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas, even though a few other sarcomas also showed MDM2 amplification and expression.",

Positivity for P53 and MDM2 was found in 9.7% and 28.1% tumours, respectively. The fraction of P53 and MDM2 positive tumours was the highest in leiomyosarcomas (16.7% and 17.2%, respectively) and the lowest in dermatofibrosarcomas (0% and 4.3%, respectively). Overall, P53(-)/MDM2(+) phenotype predominated (20.2%), while 7.9% of tumours were both P53 and MDM2 positive, and 1.8% of tumours were only P53 positive. P53 accumulation was associated with a high histological malignancy grade and a higher proliferative rate. MDM2 immunoreactivity was revealed in tumours of all malignancy grades and there was no association between MDM2 positivity and tumours proliferative activity. These results suggest that P53 overexpression underlays rather late events in the oncogenesis of STSs, which might be a determinant of their proliferative rate.

        "Doc_abstract":"Few studies have investigated the loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability in soft tissue sarcomas. Therefore, we analyzed samples of human soft tissue sarcomas to determine the status of the chromosomal region 12q14-15, which contains the MDM2 gene encoding the well-known counterpart of the tumor suppressor p53. In addition, we determined whether an amplified MDM2 gene was present in the samples. Of the 88 soft tissue sarcoma samples, 24 (27%) showed evidence of loss of heterozygosity of markers representing 12q14-15, and 12 (14%) showed evidence of microsatellite instability. Of the 72 samples analyzed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction, 15 (21%) possessed an amplified MDM2 gene. Loss of heterozygosity (P =.008) and microsatellite instability (P =.035) were significantly more common in Stage I tumors than in higher stage tumors. This result indicated that these alterations occur early in soft tissue sarcoma progression and possibly define a subgroup of soft tissue sarcoma. Surprisingly, MDM2 amplification in soft tissue sarcoma patients was associated with a prognosis better than that of patients without the amplification; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P =.6). Furthermore, of the tumors with an MDM2 amplification, 40% (6/15) also experienced loss of heterozygosity at 12q14-15; in contrast, only 16% of tumors without an MDM2 amplification (9/57) underwent a loss of heterozygosity. A concomitant occurrence of deletions and amplifications resulting from deficiencies in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway could in part explain this finding.",

The goal of this study was to examine the clinical value of immunohistochemical (IHC) RB detection and its relationship to mdm2 overexpression in a cohort of 198 adult primary soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). RB overexpression reveals, multivariately, a correlation with survival (RR=1.59, P=0.037) as well as mdm2 positivity (RR=2.32, P=0.0035). Stratification of RB results to mdm2 staining shows a prognostic graduation in four levels. Patients with positivity for both antibodies have the highest risk (RR=3.30, P=0.002) and the poorest prognosis (projected 5-year survival rate, 18.6%); those with negativity for both antibodies show the most favourable prognosis (projected 5-year survival rate, 63.4%). Intermediately, an isolated RB overexpression (projected 5-year survival rate, 46.1%) is more favourable than an isolated mdm2 positivity (projected 5-year survival rate, 33.5%).

An osteosarcoma cell line, OsACL, manifested a 25-fold increased copy number of CDK4, amplified concordantly with both GLI and MDM2, whereas a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, SJRH30, was found to have an amplicon that included CDK4 and GLI but not MDM2.

Cytogenetics in these tumors has identified ring and giant chromosomes composed of 12q13-15 amplicons including the MDM2 gene. Identifying MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization may prove an adjunctive tool in the diagnosis of lipomatous neoplasms. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization employing a laboratory-developed BAC label probe cocktail specific for MDM2 (12q15) and a probe for the centromeric region of chromosome 12 (Abbott Molecular, DesPlaines, IL) was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue including whole sections from atypical lipomatous tumors (n=13), dedifferentiated liposarcomas (n=14), benign lipomatous tumors (n=30), and pleomorphic sarcoma, not otherwise specified (n=10), and a tissue microarray containing a variety of high-grade sarcomas (n=63). An MDM2/chromosome 12 ratio >or=2.0 was considered amplified, <2.0 nonamplified, and cases displaying >2 signals of both probes and an MDM2 ratio <2.0 polysomic for chromosome 12. Of the well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 100% showed amplification of MDM2. Chromosome 12 polysomy was noted in 89% of spindle cell/pleomorphic lipomas, while all angiolipomas and lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic. MDM2 amplification was observed in 40% of pleomorphic sarcomas and a small subset of high-grade sarcomas (3/63). MDM2/chromosome 12 fluorescence in situ hybridization is a sensitive and specific tool (both 100%) in evaluating low-grade lipomatous neoplasms. The specificity decreases in high-grade sarcomas, as MDM2 amplification was observed in a small portion of pleomorphic sarcomas and high-grade sarcomas other than dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Importantly, none of the benign lipomatous lesions were MDM2 amplified and even cells in areas of well-differentiated liposarcomas with minimal cytologic atypia were amplified, making the probe a valuable tool in the diagnosis of even limited biopsy samples of well-differentiated lipomatous neoplasms.",

Since amplification seems to be a primary aberration in these tumors, whereas amplification in osteosarcoma generally is a progression marker, the underlying biological mechanisms may be different. We have therefore investigated the molecular response to Nutlin treatment in several liposarcoma cell lines with such markers, as well as a panel of other sarcoma cell lines. We report that Nutlin efficiently stabilized p53 and induced downstream p53 dependent transcription and apoptosis in liposarcoma cells with amplified MDM2 in vitro. Some effect of Nutlin was also observed on cell lines without amplified MDM2 but with wt TP53, but no apoptosis was induced. The MDM4 protein, reported to interfere with the reactivation of p53, was undetectable in cells with amplified MDM2.

Mdm2 functions as an oncoprotein, in part, by acting as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Multiple spliced forms of Mdm2 transcripts have been observed in human tumors; however, the contribution of these variant transcripts to tumorigenesis is unknown. In this report, we isolate alternative splice forms of Mdm2 transcripts from sarcomas that spontaneously arise in Mdm2-overexpressing mice, including Mdm2-b, the splice form most commonly observed in human cancers. Transduction of Mdm2-b into a variety of cell types reveals that Mdm2-b promotes p53-independent cell growth, inhibits apoptosis, and up-regulates the RelA subunit of NFkappaB. Furthermore, expression of Mdm2-b induces tumor formation in transgenic mice. These results identify a p53-independent role for Mdm2 and determine that an alternate spliced form of Mdm2 can contribute to formation of cancer via a p53-independent mechanism.

Genetic amplification and inheritance of MDM2 promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the two best-studied mechanisms for up-regulating MDM2 activity. This article provides an overview of these events in human cancer, highlighting the frequent occurrence of MDM2 amplification in sarcoma and the role of SNP309 and SNP285 in regulating MDM2 expression and cancer risk.

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite extensive data linking mutations in the p53 gene to human tumorigenesis, little is known about the cellular regulators and mediators of p53 function. MDM2 is a strong candidate for one such cellular protein; the MDM2 gene was originally identified by virtue of its amplification in a spontaneously transformed derivative of mouse BALB/c cells and the MDM2 protein subsequently shown to bind to p53 in rat cells transfected with p53 genes. To determine whether MDM2 plays a role in human cancer, we have cloned the human MDM2 gene. Here we show that recombinant-derived human MDM2 protein binds human p53 in vitro, and we use MDM2 clones to localize the human MDM2 gene to chromosome 12q13-14. Because this chromosomal position appears to be altered in many sarcomas, we looked for changes in human MDM2 in such cancers. The gene was amplified in over a third of 47 sarcomas, including common bone and soft tissue forms. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MDM2 binds to p53, and that amplification of MDM2 in sarcomas leads to escape from p53-regulated growth control. This mechanism of tumorigenesis parallels that for virally-induced tumours, in which viral oncogene products bind to and functionally inactivate p53.",

Four resected lungs, one endarterectomy specimen and three biopsies from eight patients (four males and four females; median age 41 years) suffering from intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery using conventional stains, immunohistochemistry, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) were analyzed. The predominant clinical presentation was dyspnea (all eight patients) and febrile pulmonary disease (six of eight). Signs of embolic lung disease were present in all patients. One patient died postoperatively, six patients died of disease 8-35 months after presentation, and one patient was alive 6 months after surgery. Histopathological examination of the submitted material showed spindle cell, partially myxoid and pleomorphic sarcomas. Metastases were histologically confirmed in three patients (lung, pleura, and skull). Immunohistochemically, vimentin was strongly expressed in all tumors. Focal positivity was observed for alpha smooth muscle actin, CD117, CD68, p53, and bcl2. No reaction could be obtained for endothelial markers. The proliferation index Ki-67 was between 5% and 80%. Six examined tumors were positive for mdm2. In the CGH analysis, gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region were found in six of eight tumors (75%). Other, less consistent alterations, were losses on 3p, 3q, 4q, 9p, 11q, 13q, Xp, and Xq, gains on 7p, 17p, and 17q, and amplifications on 4q, 5p, 6p, and 11q. Intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery are tumors with an unfavorable prognosis and poorly differentiated morphology. A majority of tumors show a consistent genetic alteration (gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region) and overexpression of mdm2, implicating the mdm2/p53 pathway as a possible mechanism in the tumor pathogenesis.",

A tumorigenic connection between the oncogene product Mdm2 and tumor suppressor p53 is generally accepted, but their possible clinical relevance has not yet been investigated sufficiently in soft tissue sarcoma. In 86 primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (RO-resected, T1/2 N0 M0), Mdm2 and p53 overexpression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results were adjusted to clinico-pathological characteristics and evaluated for their prognostic relevance by multivariate analysis. In Cox's multivariate analysis with stratification of Mdm2 to p53 results, we determined four groups which had different prognostic values for relapse-free and overall survival (Mdm2-/p53- < Mdm2-/p53+ < Mdm2+/p53- < Mdm2+/p53+). The most striking finding was a relative risk (rr) for overall survival of 18.77 (P=0.006) for patients with Mdm2/p53 co-overexpression (n=40). It is noticeably higher than the additive risk from both factors.

        "Doc_abstract":"The MDM2 oncogene plays an important role in tumorigenesis and especially in soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Overexpression of the MDM2 protein is associated with a poorer prognosis for STS patients. An MDM2 antisense approach to reduce MDM2 protein levels has been successfully applied on several carcinomas in vitro and used on a few in vivo cases. However, antisense treatment not only resulted in an MDM2 protein reduction but also in a wild-type P53 gene (wt-P53) mediated tumor growth suppression due to its genetic wt-P53 status. In this study, we used a clinically relevant xenotransplanted STS model with a mutated P53 gene (mt-P53) in order to exclude the influence of wt-P53. The human STSs were surgically implanted and one week later osmotic pumps were implanted intraperitoneally into nude rats releasing MDM2-antisense ODNs (AS ODNs) continuously for one week. As controls MDM2-sense ODN (SE ODN) or a 0.9% NaCl solution (saline solution) were administered. After one week animals treated with MDM2-AS ODN (100 or 200 microg) showed a reduction in tumor mass in comparison to animals treated with MDM2-SE ODN. The reduction in tumor mass was significant in animals treated with MDM2-AS ODNs in comparison to the saline solution treated ones (p=0.018 or p=0.007). Furthermore, a significant reduction in macroscopically visible tumor number with MDM2-AS ODN treatments (100 or 200 microg) in comparison to MDM2-SE ODN or saline solution treatment (both p=0.009) was observed for the first time. As expected a reduction in MDM2 protein expression in the MDM2-AS ODN treated tumors when compared to the MDM2-SE ODN or saline solution treated tumors was detected in Western blot analyses and immunohistochemically. In addition, an unexpected reduction in mt-P53 protein expression after AS ODN therapy was also observed. In short, we have demonstrated in vivo for the first time that MDM2-AS ODN treatment of xenotransplanted STS (mt-P53) reduces tumor mass, tumor number, MDM2 protein and mt-P53 protein expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that MDM2-AS ODN treatment may exert a tumor inhibiting effect on all MDM2 expressing tumors regardless of the P53-status, this in turn may be of general importance in gene therapy of cancer.",

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of sarcomas to Nutlin-3a. In an ex vivo tissue explant system, we found that TP53 pathway alterations (TP53 status, MDM2/MDM4 genomic amplification/mRNA overexpression, MDM2 SNP309, and TP53 SNP72) did not confer apoptotic or cytostatic responses in sarcoma tissue biopsies (n = 24). Unexpectedly, MDM2 status did not predict Nutlin-3a sensitivity. RNA sequencing revealed that the global transcriptomic profiles of these sarcomas provided a more robust prediction of apoptotic responses to Nutlin-3a. Expression profiling revealed a subset of TP53 target genes that were transactivated specifically in sarcomas that were highly sensitive to Nutlin-3a. Of these target genes, the GADD45A promoter region was shown to be hypermethylated in 82% of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not respond to Nutlin-3a, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the innate ability of sarcomas to resist apoptotic death following Nutlin-3a treatment. Collectively, our findings argue that the existing benchmark biomarker for MDM2 antagonist efficacy (MDM2 amplification) should not be used to predict outcome but rather global gene expression profiles and epigenetic status of sarcomas dictate their sensitivity to p53/MDM2 antagonists.",

In this study, we investigated whether the detection of amplified or overexpressed murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) can be a useful diagnostic ancillary aid. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect MDM2 amplification and protein overexpression, respectively, in 49 WDLSs, 5 DDLSs, 23 myxoid liposarcomas, 25 benign lipomatous tumors, and 75 spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas. MDM2 amplification was detected in 48 of 49 WDLSs, 5 of 5 DDLSs, 2 of 9 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and 2 of 10 myxofibrosarcomas. We did not detect MDM2 amplification in any of the benign lipomatous tumors. FISH-mediated detection of MDM2 amplification was the most valuable diagnostic aid for ALT/WDLS, as determined by using the Fisher exact test to compare two different diagnoses of 19 biopsies. On the contrary, unequivocal nuclear overexpression of MDM2 was found in only 10 of 50 ALT/WDLSs. The sensitivity and specificity of MDM2 amplification in distinguishing a DDLS from spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas were 100% and 95%, respectively, while those of MDM2 overexpression were 100% and 87%, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that FISH-mediated detection of MDM2 amplification is the most useful adjunct in the diagnosis of both ALT/WDLS and DDLS.

The p53-MDM2 interaction pathway has been suggested as a novel target for cancer therapy. To that end, several strategies have been explored, including the use of small polypeptides targeted to the MDM2-p53 binding domain, anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides, and natural agents. Different generations of anti-human-MDM2 oligonucleotides have been tested in in vitro and in vivo human cancer models, revealing specific inhibition of MDM2 expression and significant antitumor activity. Use of antisense oligos potentiated the effects of growth inhibition, p53 activation and p21 induction by several chemotherapeutic agents. Increased therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs in human cancer cell lines carrying p53 mutations or deletions have shown the ability of MDM2 inhibitors to act as chemosensitizers in various types of tumors through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Inhibiting MDM2 appears to also have a role in radiation therapy for human cancer, regardless of p53 status, providing a rationale for the development of a new class of radiosensitizers. Moreover, MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides potentiate the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors by affecting in vitro and in vivo proliferation, apoptosis and protein expression in hormone-refractory and hormone-dependent human prostate cancer cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Purpose. Amplification of genetic sequences on chromosome 12q13 is frequently found in soft tissue tumours. However, for the MDM2 gene, over-expression of the MDM2 protein has not always been shown to accompany gene amplification, raising the possibility that amplification of genetic sequences targets alternative genes on chromosome 12q13 for over-expression. To investigate this discrepancy, we have examined 129 soft tissue tumours for amplification of the MDM2 gene using Southern analysis, and 39 of these tumours were also examined by immunohistochemical staining for MDM2 over-expression.Results. Gene amplification was identified in 14/114 (12.3%) of the malignant tumours, but was not identified in any of the benign tumours; 21/39 (54%) of the malignant tumours also demonstrated MDM2 over-expression. Within this group the MDM2 gene was over-expressed in every tumour in which the gene amplification was found, and over-expression in the absence of gene amplification was also found in an additional 10 tumours.Discussion. These data demonstrate a clear correlation between the presence of MDM2 amplification and MDM2 over-expression, and provide persuasive evidence therefore that the amplification of genetic sequences on chromosome 12q13 in soft tissue sarcomas targets the MDM2 gene for over-expression. These data also indicate that alternative mechanisms may contribute to MDM2 over-expression within some tumours.",

Both p53 and retinoblastoma genes are frequently mutated in human cancers, and the simultaneous inactivation of RB and p53 is frequently observed in a variety of naturally occurring human tumours. Furthermore, three distinct DNA tumour virus groups--papovaviruses, adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses--transform cells by targeting and inactivating certain functions of both the p53 and retinoblastoma proteins. The cellular oncoprotein, Mdm2, binds to and downmodulates p53 function; its human homologue, MDM2, is amplified in certain human tumours, including sarcomas and gliomas. Overproduction of Mdm2 is both tumorigenic and capable of immortalizing primary rat embryo fibroblasts. Here we show that MDM2 interacts physically and functionally with pRB and, as with p53, inhibits pRB growth regulatory function. Therefore, both pRB and p53 can be subjected to negative regulation by the product of a single cellular protooncogene.",

There is growing evidence that amplification and overexpression of the MDM2 gene are alternative mechanisms that also lead to functional inactivation of p53. While p53 mutations and MDM2 amplification have been reported to occur in rhabdomyosarcoma and osteogenic sarcoma, the incidence of MDM2 in other pediatric solid tumors is not known. We therefore tested a series of other pediatric solid tumors for MDM2 gene amplification. MDM2 amplification could not be detected in specimens from 40 Wilms' tumors, 15 neuroblastomas, 12 sarcomas, or 4 hepatoblastomas tested. To determine whether MDM2 amplification was an alternative mechanism of p53 inactivation in adult carcinomas that frequently possess p53 mutations, 68 samples of squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract, 24% of which were previously shown to contain p53 mutations, were also tested for MDM2 amplification. MDM2 amplification did not occur in any of the tumor specimens tested. These findings suggest that MDM2 amplification may only occur in a limited subset of human tumors. Loss of function of p53 may be an essential event in human tumorigenesis. If so, then other mechanisms of p53 inactivation must occur in those tumors that exhibit neither p53 mutation nor MDM2 amplification.",

In this study, we used a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technique, combined with conventional CGH, to identify gene amplifications in 43 tumors including eight pulmonary artery intimal sarcomas and 35 adrenocortical tumors. Conventional CGH revealed gains or amplifications of 12q13-q15 in six sarcomas and in two adrenocortical carcinomas. Using microarrays, we demonstrated that, among genes located on 12q13-q15, SAS/CDK4 were amplified in six sarcomas, and MDM2 and GLI in five and four sarcomas, respectively. The two adrenocortical tumors showed coamplifications of SAS/CDK4 and MDM2. Furthermore, PDGFRA (located on 4q12) amplification was identified in five sarcomas. Our data demonstrate: (1) amplifications of SAS/CDK4, MDM2, GLI, and PDGFRA are strongly associated with the tumorigenesis of pulmonary artery intimal sarcomas, whereas SAS/CDK4 and MDM2 coamplification may contribute to the progression of adrenocortical tumors; (2) microarray-based CGH is a useful tool for simultaneous detection of multiple gene amplifications, with a high sensitivity and resolution compared to that of conventional CGH.",

Some of the tumor subtypes are characterized by the presence of distinct chromosomal translocations and fusion genes. When no signs of differentiation are seen, the diagnosis by exclusion becomes undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma. Cytogenetic, RNA sequencing and RT-PCR analyses were performed on a case of spindle cell sarcoma. The karyotype of the primary tumor was 46,X,del(X)(p?11p?22), der(12)(12pter→12q?22::12q?15→q?22::16p11→16pter),-16,+r(12). MDM2 was found amplified in both the primary tumor and a meta-stasis.

In material from the metastasis, RT-PCR detected the PTGES3-PTPRB, HMGA2-DYRK2 and TMBIM4-MSRB3 whereas no USP15-CNTN1 fusion transcript was found. Because MDM2 amplification and the fusion transcripts PTGES3-PTPRB, HMGA2-DYRK2 and TMBIM4-MSRB3 were found both in the primary tumor and in the metastasis, they are components of the same clone and may be involved both in initiation and progression of the tumor.

In some tumors, such as soft tissue sarcomas, overexpression of MDM2 inactivates an otherwise intact p53, disabling the genome integrity checkpoint and allowing cell cycle progression of defective cells. Disruption of the MDM2/p53 interaction leads to increased p53 levels and restored p53 transcriptional activity, indicating restoration of the genome integrity check and therapeutic potential for MDM2/p53 binding antagonists. Here, we show by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy that chalcones (1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ones) are MDM2 inhibitors that bind to a subsite of the p53 binding cleft of human MDM2. Biochemical experiments showed that these compounds can disrupt the MDM2/p53 protein complex, releasing p53 from both the p53/MDM2 and DNA-bound p53/MDM2 complexes.

A chromosome 12-specific probe (CHR12) was generated from a pα12H8 plasmid. The in situ hybridization assay was developed by using a dinitrophenyl-labeled MDM2 probe and a digoxigenin-labeled CHR12 probe on the Ventana Medical Systems' automated slide-staining platforms. The specificity of the MDM2 and CHR12 probes was shown on metaphase spreads and further validated against controls, including normal human tonsil and known MDM2-amplified samples. The assay performance was evaluated on a cohort of 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens by using a conventional bright field microscope.;Simultaneous hybridization and signal detection for MDM2 and CHR12 showed that both DNA targets were present in the same cells. One hundred soft tissue specimens were stained for MDM2 and CHR12. Although 26 of 29 lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic, MDM2 amplification was noted in 78% of atypical lipomatous tumors or well-differentiated liposarcomas. Five of 6 dedifferentiated liposarcoma cases were amplified for MDM2. MDM2 amplification was observed in 1 of 8 osteosarcomas; 3 showed CHR12 aneusomy.

This study is an immunohistochemical evaluation of MDM2 and CDK4 expression in canine liposarcoma designed to assess the correlation of these proteins with histologic type, grade, mitotic index and Ki67 labeling index and evaluate their utility in improving tumor classification. Fifty-three liposarcomas were retrospectively collected: 24 were well differentiated liposarcomas (WDL), 16 of which expressed MDM2 and 21 CDK4; 7 were myxoid liposarcomas (ML), 1 of which expressed MDM2 and 5 expressed CDK4; 18 were pleomorphic liposarcomas (PL), all were MDM2 negative and 12 expressed CDK4. Four tumors were morphologically consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) a subtype described only in humans: 3 expressed MDM2 and 4 expressed CDK4. MDM2 expression correlated with histotype (highly expressed in WDL and DDL) and grade (highly expressed in grade 1 tumors). Histotype correlated with the Ki67 labeling index (lowest in WDL and highest in DDL). A revised classification, considering MDM2 expression, allowed 8 WDL to be reclassified as PL and correlated significantly with mitotic and Ki67 labeling index (both significantly lower in WDL and progressively higher in ML and DDL). These results partially parallel data reported for human liposarcomas, suggesting that WDL and DDL are distinct neoplastic entities characterized by MDM2 expression, which may represent a useful diagnostic and potentially prognostic marker for canine liposarcoma.

The immunohistochemical findings were correlated with P53 mutation analysis using PCR-SSCP, PCR-HDF and direct sequencing, and MDM2 amplification studies by differential PCR. P53 immunopositivity was found in 25 out of 94 (26.6%) cases. Alterations of the P53 gene were detected in 12 (12.8%) tumors; eight of these tumors revealed P53 immunoreactivity. A high number of P53 positive and P53 mutated tumors were histologically defined as poorly differentiated G3 (64.0% and 75.0%, respectively). MDM2 immunopositivity was revealed in 36 out of 94 (38.3%) cases. MDM2 amplification occurred in 17 tumors (18.1%); only nine of these tumors exhibited MDM2 immunoreactivity. Overall, MDM2 positivity was not associated with MDM2 amplification in 27 out of 94 tumors (28.7%). There was no significant correlation between MDM2 overexpression and histological grade. However, when the samples were stratified by immunophenotype, the majority of tumors (52.5%) with isolated MDM2 overexpression (dissociated from P53 positivity) were defined histologically as low grade (G1 + G2). These results support the notion that besides P53 alterations, MDM2 gene deregulation seems to be an important event in sarcomas evolution. Additionally, the mechanism of MDM2-mediated degradation of P53 protein, without involving stabilization and inactivation of P53 gene, should be considered for better understanding of all features of tumor progression processes.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Under conditions of genomic stress, the Mdm locus in human and in mouse is prone to instability manifested as amplification and oncogenesis. The Mdm2 gene is a known oncogene that is amplified in approximately one-third of sarcomas and whose protein product interacts with the tumor suppressor p53. Concimitant with such gene amplification events is the activation and mobilization of endogenous retroelements, typically through the relaxation of epigenetic controlling mechanisms. Processed pseudogenes, which can be formed through endogenous LINE retroelement activity, may indicate increased genomic instability. We have isolated processed pseudogenes for Mdm2 in Mus caroli DNA, likely formed from independent events in different individuals. This is the first identification and characterization of an Mdm2 pseudogene in any organism. Multiple retrotransposition events are suggested by the variable sequence and genomic structure of the identified pseudogenes across all exons and the 3'UTR. The high degree of similarity between the gene and each pseudogene, as well as the lack of evidence for an Mdm2 pseudogene in several other species of Mus, indicate evolutionarily recent retrotransposition events leading to the formation of the Mdm2 pseudogenes in M. caroli. Previous studies on the Mdm2 locus in Mus caroli showed amplification and overexpression of this gene on double minute chromosomes in a Mus musculus x Mus caroli interspecific hybrid. The identification of an Mdm2 retropseudogene within this species further highlights the predisposition to instability for this region of the genome.",

Evidence is accumulating that these alterations frequently do not result in a complete loss of the sequence-specific transcriptional regulatory function of p53. Here, we describe the transcriptional activity of the p53 mutant C277Y isolated from a Ewing's sarcoma with high constitutive pig3 expression. Transient transfection of this mutant into a p53 null cell line resulted in activation not only of the pig3 but also of the MDM2 gene compatible with the presence of constitutively expressed MDM2 transcripts initiated from the P2 promoter in the p53-C277Y hemizygous Ewing's sarcoma cell line. Expression of endogenous pig3 and MDM2 genes was further enhanced on irradiation of this cell line. Here, suppression of p53-C277Y by RNAi reduced pig3 promoter activity, RNA, and protein expression. Reporter gene assays revealed that the potential of p53-C277Y to up-regulate MDM2 expression was similar to wild-type p53, whereas activation of the pig3 promoter was at least 5-fold increased over wild-type p53. The pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence present in exon 1 of the pig3 gene was found to be responsible for p53-C277Y-mediated activation. In concordance with a role of PIG3 protein for cell death, we showed residual apoptotic activity of p53-C277Y to which the described Ewing's sarcoma cell line was found to be resistant. p53-C277Y has previously been reported to bind to DNA with altered sequence specificity and to be unable to activate generic p53 target genes in yeast-based functional assays. Our results, therefore, show that a p53 mutant may behave differently when tested in its authentic cellular context.",

In this report, we describe the dissection of the MDM2-binding domain on p53 as well as the p53-binding domain on MDM2. We also demonstrate that the oncoprotein simian virus 40 T antigen binds to the product of cellular oncogene mdm2. We have constructed several N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of p53 and MDM2, expressed them in vitro, and assayed their in vitro association capability. The N-terminal boundary of the p53-binding domain on MDM2 is between amino acids 1 and 58, while the C-terminal boundary is between amino acids 221 and 155. T antigen binds to an overlapping domain on the MDM2 protein. On the other hand, the MDM2-binding domain of p53 is defined by amino acids 1 and 159 at the N terminus. At the C terminus, binding is progressively reduced as amino acids 327 to 145 are deleted. We determined the effect of human MDM2 on the transactivation ability of wild-type human p53 in the Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell line, which does not have any endogenous p53. Human MDM2 inhibited the ability of human p53 to transactivate the promoter with p53-binding sites. Thus, human MDM2 protein, like the murine protein, can inactivate the transactivation ability of human p53. Interestingly, both the transactivation domain and the MDM2-binding domain of p53 are situated near the N terminus. We further show that deletion of the N-terminal 58 amino acids of MDM2, which eliminates p53 binding, also abolishes the capability of inactivating p53-mediated transactivation. This finding suggests a correlation of in vitro p53-MDM2 binding with MDM2's ability in vivo to interfere with p53-mediated transactivation.",

Both p53 and mdm2 expression correlated with tumor grade. Abnormalities involving the Rb-cyclin D pathway were identified in all of the tumors by the altered expression of either pRb (72%) or p16 (94%). Fourteen (21%) and 64 (96%) cases demonstrated cyclin D1 or cdk4 expression, respectively. Overexpression of cyclin D1 showed an association with pRb and p53. There was no correlation between pRb, p16, cyclin D1, or cdk4 and tumor grade or relapse.;Disturbance in the cell-cycle regulatory system involving the p53 pathway and the Rb-cyclin D pathway is relatively frequent in soft tissue sarcomas and may be a contributing factor in the tumorigenesis of these tumors. The alterations in the Rb-cyclin D pathway probably constitute an early event, whereas the abnormalities in the p53 pathway seem to be involved in tumor progression.

Quantitative genomic PCR analysis showed that 2 of 35 tumors have extremely low levels of the p53 gene, indicating a homozygous deletion of the gene. Mutational analysis of exons 4 to 9 of p53 by PCR-SSCP revealed that 3 of 35 tumors carry sequence alterations in exons 5 or 8, and DNA sequencing analysis identified missense point mutations at codon 132 (AAG-->ATG, lysine-->methionine) and codon 135 (TGC-->TCC, cystein-->serine) in exon 5, and codon 287 (GAG-->GTG, glutamic acid-->valine) in exon 8 from these tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are the most common genetic alteration found in human cancers. Most of them are accompanied by stabilization of the protein, which renders it detectable through immunohistochemical techniques. Although p53 expression is a very common finding in Hodgkin's disease (HD), the status of the p53 gene is scarcely known, due to the difficulty in sequencing this gene in a lesion in which tumour cells are thought to constitute a very minor subpopulation, diluted in a background of supposedly benign cells. The pattern of expression of two downstream p53 proteins (MDM2 and p21 WAF1/CIP1, was studied as an indirect way of assessing p53 gene status. MDM2 is a wild-p53 inducible protein which may form a complex with p53, abrogating its function, as has been found in human sarcomas and other malignancies. p21WAF1/CIP1 is another protein inducible by wild-type p53, involved in inhibiting cell-cycle progression, through binding to cyclin/cyclin-dependent-kinase complexes. MDM2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 immunostaining was detected in all the cases analysed, independently of histological type, and were mainly present in Sternberg-Reed and Hodgkin (H & SR) cells. These immunohistochemical results were confirmed by Western blotting. To study the cause of MDM2 protein accumulation, MDM2 mRNA expression was also investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results show the presence of MDM2 transcripts in all cases of HD, albeit at lower levels than those found in reactive lymphoid tissue. These results seem to support the hypothesis that p53 is transcriptionally active in at least some of the H & SR cells in HD, and is able to induce MDM2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression.",

In the absence of a lipogenic component histologically, the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal DDL includes other sarcomas and, if the tumor has visceral involvement, sarcomatoid carcinoma. DDL demonstrates amplification of chromosome subregion 12q13-q15. Detection of the amplification itself, or the resulting overexpression of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes by genetic and immunohistochemical methods, is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of DDL. More recently, immunohistochemistry for p16, the product of the CDKN2A gene, was shown to be a useful adjunct in differentiating well-differentiated liposarcoma from benign adipocytic tumors. In the present study, we examined the utility of p16 immunohistochemistry to distinguish DDL (n=44) from other high-grade and low-grade retroperitoneal mimics (n=73). p16 positivity was observed in 43/44 (98%) DDLs, with the majority of these showing strong, diffuse, staining. The rate of p16 positivity in other retroperitoneal tumors was lower (37/73, 51%) and staining was not as consistently diffuse or intense. Furthermore, p16 positivity varied between the control sarcomas based on tumor type as follows: 11/11 leiomyosarcomas, 8/11 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas, 9/39 sarcomatoid carcinomas, 7/7 desmoid tumors, 1/3 endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 1/2 malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that p16 is highly sensitive for retroperitoneal DDL.

The molecular mechanisms underlying p53 action imply transactivation of p53 dependent genes such as WAF1 (for wild type p53 associated fragment 1) and the murine double minute (MDM2) gene. In some cases, inactivation of the p53 gene results from p53 gene mutations leading to p53 protein accumulation, but in others it may results from mechanisms other than mutation, such as interaction with viral or cellular proteins. The expression of p53 protein and p53 transactivated gene proteins p21/WAF1 and MDM2, combined with in situ detection of apoptosis, was studied in specimens of CMV-infected patients as an in vivo model of p53 alteration not due to point mutation. p53 positivity was found in CMV + cells in different tissues, in cells with typical inclusion bodies, and in in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry CMV + cells without inclusions (hidden infection). Although this p53 reactivity was accompanied by the expression of MDM2 and p21/WAF1 proteins, the patterns of MDM2 and p21/WAF1 protein expression were mutually exclusive, and were associated with the presence or absence of inclusion bodies. Nuclei bearing inclusion bodies were usually MDM2+, p21/ WAF1-, while hidden infected cells were usually MDM2-, p21/WAF1+. Apoptosis was not detected in any tissue section from CMV-infected patients. Two alternative patterns were found in CMV-infected tissues: p53+, p21/WAF1+, MDM2-, or p53+, p21/WAF1-. MDM2+ protein expression. These may represent examples of p53 dependent alternative effects in the course of CMV infection. Early stages are represented by CMV + cells without inclusion bodies, which display p53 and p21/ WAF1 expression, suggesting that p53 could be acting as a growth suppressor protein. Late CMV infection is represented by cells harbouring inclusion bodies. These cells showed a p53+, p21/WAF1-, MDM2+ profile, consistent with MDM2 mediated p53 inactivation. The absence of p21/WAF1 expression and lack of apoptosis suggest that the p53 protein expressed by MDM2+ cells could be functionally inactivated in CMV-infected cells with inclusion bodies. Previous studies have suggested that p53 inactivation by MDM2 over-expression occurs in sarcomas and lymphomas. Our observations seem to indicate that this mechanism of MDM2 mediated p53 inactivation may play a role in the late phase of CMV infection.",

In some cases, some translocations have a prognostic value (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) whereas it is discussed in others (synovial sarcoma).

While targeted therapy based on tyrosine kinase inhibition such as imatinib and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors plays an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), some progress was also achieved in non-GIST sarcomas. Targeting the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway has been shown to be clinically promising in a diversity of different sarcoma subtypes, and inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor pathway is of special interest in vascular sarcoma subtypes.

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on DNA samples from 29 LMS, 9 ARMS, 7 anaplastic ERMS and 6 classic ERMS. Alteration of one or more of the 12q13-15 genes was revealed in 13/29 LMS (45%) and 12/22 RMS (54%) including 5/9 ARMS (56%), 5/7 anaplastic ERMS (71%) and 2/6 classic ERMS (33%). The potential importance of overproduction of protein products in neoplastic development, led us also to study a possible high expression of cdk4, mdm2 and gli proteins in immunohistochemical staining experiments on paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the same cases. Among LMS and RMS most cases with CDK4, MDM2 and GLI gene alterations also showed a simultaneous high expression of the relative protein. In summary, these results indicate that amplification or overerepresentation of genes at 12q13-15 region involve both LMS and RMS. Moreover these genes alterations reveal predominantly in the alveolar and in the anaplastic variant of the embryonal subtype. These two seem to have a more similar behavior than anaplastic and classic embryonal that are classified in the same subtype.",

Reactivation of p53 results in a G 1 cell cycle arrest, leading to inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis. Nutlin-3 inhibits the growth of \"KS-like\" tumors resulting from xenografted TIVE-KSHV cells in nude mice. In addition, Nutlin-3 strongly inhibits expression of the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokine angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2).

Transcriptome sequencing techniques have brought forward new diagnostic tools for identifying fusions and/or characterizing unclassified entities. Next-generation sequencing and advanced molecular techniques were also applied to identify potential targets for directed and epigenetic therapy, where preclinical studies reported results for agents active within the receptor tyrosine kinase, mTOR, Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Hsp90, and MDM2 signaling networks. At the level of clinical practice, modest developments were seen for some sarcoma subtypes in conventional chemotherapy and in therapies targeting the pathways activated by various receptor tyrosine kinases.

One-third of the tumours developed in patients carrying a germline mutation of RB1 that predisposed them to retinoblastoma and radiation-induced sarcomas. The genetic inactivation of RB1 and/or TP53 genes was frequently observed in these sarcomas. These inactivations were owing to an interplay between point mutations and losses of large chromosome segments. Radiation-induced somatic mutations were observed in TP53, but not in RB1 or in the four other genes, indicating an early role of TP53 in the radio-sarcomagenesis. RB1 and TP53 genes were biallelically coinactivated in all sarcomas developing in the context of the predisposition, indicating that both genes played a major role in the formation of these sarcomas. In the absence of predisposition, TP53 was biallelically inactivated in one-third of the sarcomas, whereas at least one allele of RB1 was wild type. In both genetic contexts, the TP53 pathway was inactivated by genetic lesions and not by the activation of the ARF/MDM2/MDMX pathway, as recently shown in retinoblastomas. Together, these findings highlight the intricate tissue- and aetiology-specific relationships between TP53 and RB1 pathways in tumorigenesis.",

The assessment of MDM2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a routine ancillary tool for diagnosing atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDL/DDL) in specialist sarcoma units. We describe our experience of its utility at our tertiary institute. Methods. All routine histology samples in which MDM2 amplification was assessed with FISH over a 2-year period were included, and FISH results were correlated with clinical and histologic findings. Results. 365 samples from 347 patients had FISH for MDM2 gene amplification. 170 were positive (i.e., showed MDM2 gene amplification), 192 were negative, and 3 were technically unsatisfactory. There were 122 histologically benign cases showing a histology:FISH concordance rate of 92.6%, 142 WDL/DDL (concordance 96.5%), and 34 cases histologically equivocal for WDL (concordance 50%). Of 64 spindle cell/pleomorphic neoplasms (in which DDL was a differential diagnosis), 21.9% showed MDM2 amplification. Of the cases with discrepant histology and FISH, all but 3 had diagnoses amended following FISH results. For discrepancies of benign histology but positive FISH, lesions were on average larger, more frequently in \"classical\" (intra-abdominal or inguinal) sites for WDL/DDL and more frequently core biopsies. Discrepancies of malignant histology but negative FISH were smaller, less frequently in \"classical\" sites but again more frequently core biopsies. Conclusions. FISH has a high correlation rate with histology for cases with firm histologic diagnoses of lipoma or WDL/DDL. It is a useful ancillary diagnostic tool in histologically equivocal cases, particularly in WDL lacking significant histologic atypia or DDL without corresponding WDL component, especially in larger tumors, those from intra-abdominal or inguinal sites or core biopsies. There is a significant group of well-differentiated adipocytic neoplasms which are difficult to diagnose on morphology alone, in which FISH for MDM2 amplification is diagnostically contributory. ",

The efficacy of selinexor was investigated in vitro and in vivo using 17 cell lines and 9 sarcoma xenograft models including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcomas, and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). Most sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to selinexor with IC50s ranging from 28.8 nM to 218.2 nM (median: 66.1 nM). Selinexor suppressed sarcoma tumor xenograft growth, including models of ASPS that were resistant in vitro. In GIST cells with KIT mutations, selinexor induced G1- arrest without attenuation of phosphorylation of KIT, AKT, or MAPK, in contrast to imatinib. In LPS cell lines with MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, selinexor induced G1-arrest and apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation and irrespective of RB expression. Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not RNA level, indicating a post-transcriptional effect. These results indicate that selinexor has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of sarcoma models by inducing G1-arrest independent of known molecular mechanisms in GIST and LPS.

Molecular markers of tumor behavior, including amplification levels of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4) genes, have been explored in a limited number of cases. Here we investigate whether 'Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer' (FNCLCC) grade and MDM2 gene amplification levels have prognostic value in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. Fifty cases were retrieved, reviewed and FNCLCC grade was scored for the dedifferentiated component. Testing for MDM2 gene amplification was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Amplification was categorized as high level (≥20 copies) and as low level (<20 copies). Follow-up data was obtained through chart review. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effect of grade and level of MDM2 amplification on outcomes. Our series includes 50 patients (male n=28, female n=22) with an average age of 63 years (range, 28-88) and a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-120). Tumors were graded as grade 1 (6%), grade 2 (58%), and grade 3 (36%). When adjusted for age, sex, site, tumor size, and margin status, grade 3 patients had a higher recurrence rate than grades 1 and 2 (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.24, 7.62; P=0.015). Patients with high-level MDM2 amplification had higher recurrence rate on univariate analysis (P=0.028), but not on multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.94; P=0.221). FNCLCC grade 3 dedifferentiation confers a worse prognosis in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence. MDM2 amplification level remains a useful diagnostic tool in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, but has no prognostic value in terms of local recurrence. ",

To investigate further a possible role of the two genes in sarcomas, 24 large and deep-seated lipomas and 74 liposarcomas of various subtypes were analysed for mdm2 and p53 overexpression by immunocytochemistry. Nineteen cases of the same series were also molecularly analysed for both MDM2 gene amplification and TP53 mutations, and a further ten cases for non-random chromosomal abnormalities. In the retroperitoneal well-differentiated-dedifferentiated (WD-DD) group, 15/16 WD and 8/8 DD liposarcomas displayed the mdm2+/p53+ phenotype, consistent with MDM2 gene amplification in the absence of TP53 mutations. In the non-retroperitoneal WD-DD group, 5/11 WD liposarcomas also retained the mdm2+/p53+ phenotype whereas all DD liposarcomas showed an immunophenotype and, when assessed, a genotype consistent with mutant TP53. Null mdm2 immunophenotype, coupled with evidence of a specific chromosome translocation t(12;16), was constantly observed in both the usual and the cellular subtypes of myxoid liposarcoma, three cases of which also showed TP53 alterations at the genetic or protein level. Neither mdm2 nor p53 overexpression was observed in the lipomas. The results show the existence of three main pathogenetically distinct groups of liposarcoma. The first retroperitoneal WD-DD group, which represents a novel class of tumours within a single histological category of sarcoma, where MDM2-mediated inactivation of p53 could be related to the pathogenetic mechanism. The second is the non-retroperitoneal WD-DD group, where the TP53 mutations appear to correlate with the dedifferentiation process. The third is the myxoid group, which is characterized by its own unique cytogenetic profile and never shows any involvement of TP53 or MDM2 genes. As for diagnostic significance, the absence of mdm2 and p53 reactivity in lipomas seems to represent a useful marker for differential diagnosis from lipoma-like WD liposarcomas.",

To study mdm2 function in vivo, we generated an mdm2 null allele by homologous recombination. Mdm2 null mice are not viable, and further analysis revealed embryonic lethality around implantation. To examine the importance of the interaction of MDM2 with p53 in vivo, we crossed mice heterozygous for mdm2 and p53 and obtained progeny homozygous for both p53 and mdm2 null alleles.

The Mdm2 oncoprotein forms a complex with the p53 tumour-suppressor protein and inhibits p53-mediated transregulation of gene expression. Because Mdm2 expression increases in response to p53, Mdm2-p53 binding may autoregulate Mdm2 expression and modulate the activity of p53 in the cell. We have created Mdm2-null and Mdm2/p53-null mice to determine whether Mdm2 possesses developmental functions in addition to the ability to complex with p53, and to investigate the biological role of Mdm2-p53 complex formation in development. Mice deficient for Mdm2 die early in development. In contrast, mice deficient for both Mdm2 and p53 develop normally and are viable.

Doxorubicin, first reported to have activity in sarcomas 40 years ago, remains the generalizable first-line treatment of choice for many subtypes, with no other drug or combination having shown an overall-survival advantage. Other cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel for angiosarcoma or gemcitabine with docetaxel for leiomyosarcoma, are commonly used for certain histologic subtypes based on relatively small studies. Trabectedin, particularly active against leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma, is approved in many countries worldwide but not yet in the United States or Australia. Newer cytotoxic agents, including ifosfamide derivatives, are in current phase III testing. Although advances is systemic therapy of soft-tissue sarcomas have been hampered by their biologic heterogeneity, this diversity also serves as fertile ground for discovery and validation of targetable molecular drivers. The most notable success in this regard has been the development of small molecule therapies for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Other targets of recent interest include mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Molecular therapies that have shown activity in diverse sarcoma populations include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-R) inhibitors. Among the latter, pazopanib demonstrated a progression-free survival over placebo in prior-treated patients with advanced sarcoma, and is now approved for use in the sarcomas in many countries.

A large proportion of sarcomas are associated with specific molecular genetic lesions such as translocations, mutations, and amplifications, which are helpful in the diagnosis of individual cases. However, the exact impact of molecular genetics on the final diagnosis of sarcomas is unknown. In this study, all soft tissue and visceral sarcomas arising in patients living in 3 European regions in 2 countries (representing 13 million inhabitants) were collected and reviewed during 2 consecutive years. A molecular analysis was performed for all suspicions of sarcomas with specific genetic lesions [mutations of KIT/PDGFRA in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), reciprocal translocation, or amplification of MDM2 in atypical lipomatous tumors, well-differentiated liposarcoma-dedifferentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS)]. To evaluate the impact of molecular tests, a premolecular analysis diagnosis was proposed with 3 categories of certainty: certain, probable, or possible. A molecular analysis was performed in 763/1484 tumors corresponding to 295 cases in which GIST was suspected, 248 sarcomas with a suspicion of translocation, and 220 cases in which ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS was suspected. Molecular analysis was found to be useful (confirms a probable diagnosis) in 11 (4%) GISTs, 62 (26%) suspicions of translocation, and 66 (31%) suspicions of ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS; and necessary (allows a possible diagnosis) in 2 (<1%) GISTs, 31 (12%) suspicions of translocation, and 19 (9%) suspicions of ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS. This study performed in an epidemiological setting demonstrates the significant impact of molecular analysis on the final sarcoma diagnosis and favors such an analysis on any tumor with a suspicion of a specific genomic abnormality and for which the diagnosis is uncertain.

The purpose of this study was to determine the expression pattern of MDM2 in adenomas and colorectal adenocarcinomas and decide whether there is a correlation between MDM2 and p53 protein status. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 52 colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens and their adjacent normal tissue (N-CRC) were studied. In addition, 56 sporadic adenomas were investigated for the immunohistochemical expression of MDM2 and p53 proteins. Immunoreactivity of p53 indicating p53 gene mutation (p53+) was significantly higher in CRC (44%) compared to adenomas (23.2%) (P <0.01). None of the N-CRC specimens expressed the immunoreactive p53 protein. MDM2 overexpression (MDM2+) was similar in adenomas (30.3%) and CRC (25%), but only 2 (3.8%) of 52 N-CRC specimens showed overexpression of MDM2. In most cases MDM2 expression was associated with negative p53 expression (wild-type p53) in both adenomas (r = 0.59, P <0.001) and CRC (r = 0.69, P <0. 0001). No correlation was found between MDM2, p53 expression, and either the histologic grade, nodal stage or morphology of the tumors. There is greater p53 mutation in CRC compared to adenomas and N-CRC. The data indicate that MDM2 is overexpressed in CRC and is significantly associated with wild-type p53 compared to N-CRC specimens from the same patient. The MDM2 expression pattern is similar in adenomas and CRC, which may suggest that MDM2 overexpression is an early event in the progression of CRC.",

Loss of p53 tumor suppressor function is the most frequently observed alteration in human tumors. Immunohistochemical studies investigating the quantity of MDM2 protein in human sarcomas revealed an overexpression in 30% of the specimens. Here we describe the successful use of a monoclonal antibody (IF2) for the detection of MDM2 protein in paraffin-embedded tissue from human lung biopsies. 18 out of 44 specimens (41%), predominantly mucosal epithelial and glandular epithelial cells, stained positive for MDM2. No significant difference was observed between non-cancerogenic cells adjacent to tumor cells and those specimens without any tumor cells but altered by inflammatory processes. In general, the staining pattern was restricted not to the nuclei, but to selected subnuclear compartments, probably representing the golgi apparatus or the endoplasmatic reticulum.

We present a case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the lower limb in a 49-year-old female who has a long course of disease and suffered from twice local recurrences and lymph node affection of the tumor. The mass was subcutaneous and the margins were ill-defined. Morphologically, the tumor cells show diversity, composed of large spindle cells and round cells, both with abundant eocinophilic cytoplasm, mimicking rhybdomyoplasts and epitheloid cells respectively. The tumor cells show diffuse strong expression of Factor VIII, Fli-1, INI-1, vimentin, MDM2, and CDK4, local expression of CD31, AE1/AE3, EMA and P63, and no expression of CD34, S-100, actin-sm, desmin, MyoD1, and HMB45. Based on these information, this case is diagnosed as pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma after ruling out the main differential diagnosises including epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. From this case we suggest that pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma may be confused with a variety of soft tissue neoplasm histologically. The clinical feature of the case of a long course of disease with twice local recurrences and final lymph node involvement 10 years after excision of the primary tumor indicates a relative indolent behavior of this tumor.

As a result, two major growth regulation pathways may be inhibited. MDM2 may down regulate the p53-mediated growth control and CDK4 may affect pRB-mediated events. To determine the frequency of alterations in these genes and their correlation with clinicopathologic features, we analyzed the MDM2 and CDK4 protein levels by immunohistochemistry and assessed MDM2, CDK4 and SAS amplification by real-time PCR in nine osteosarcomas of the jaws. Positive staining for CDK4 and MDM2 was observed in eight cases (88.8%) and five cases (55.5%), respectively. Intense CDK4 staining was noted in four cases (two high grade, one intermediate grade and one low grade). Intense MDM2 staining was observed in the same four previous cases, as well as, one additional high-grade tumor. Individual DNA amplification for CDK4, MDM2 and SAS was observed in six cases for each gene. Co-amplification was observed in five cases that showed CDK4 and MDM2 concomitant amplification and four cases that displayed amplification for all of the genes. In addition, among the five cases that presented CDK4 and MDM2 amplification, strong overexpression of CDK4 and MDM2 was observed in three and in four cases, respectively (three high grade and one intermediate grade). These results suggest that 12q13-15 genes are involved in neoplastic disease and concurrent amplification and overexpression of these genes might help to define high-grade tumors.",

This convergent evolution reflects the common need of these viruses to inactivate these two important regulators of cell cycle progression and cell survival. Polyomavirus, a close relative of SV40, is different. Its large T protein complexes only with RB, not with p53. We have examined whether this is compensated by the frequent appearance of p53 mutations in polyomavirus-induced tumours. We tested the p53 status of 15 polyomavirus-induced sarcomas. Two sarcomas were p53-negative while six carried mutant p53. Another six sarcomas expressed low levels of wild-type p53. One tumour expressed high levels of wild-type p53 protein as shown by DNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining. MDM2 amplification was not detected in any of the tumours, but Northern blotting showed that MDM2 was overexpressed in at least two tumours that expressed wild-type p53 and in one tumour that expressed both wild-type and mutant p53. Treatment with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C caused p53 protein accumulation followed by induction of MDM2 and WAF1/p21 mRNA in four of the tumours expressing wild-type p53, indicating that p53-mediated transcriptional activation was unaltered in these tumours. However, p53-mediated transactivation of WAF1/p21 was impaired in the wild-type p53-expressing tumours that expressed elevated levels of MDM2. These results demonstrate that p53 mutation and inactivation are frequently but not invariably involved in polyomavirus-induced tumorigenesis.",

The present study investigates this hypothesis on synovial sarcoma (SS), assessing the frequency of expression and possible clinical implications of detecting alterations in critical cell cycle regulatory proteins. A homogeneous cohort of 49 patients with localized SS, restricted to the extremity and with available long-term follow-up information, was selected from our files. We focused our study on molecules involved in the G1 checkpoint and G1-S transition, including cyclins D1 and E, p21(WAF1), p27(Kip1), mdm2, p53, and Ki67. A cutoff point of 10% immunoreactive tumor cell nuclei was selected to define a positive phenotype for any given marker, except for Ki67. High Ki67 proliferative index was considered when >/=20% tumor cells displayed nuclear immunoreactivity. Biphasic SS were analyzed, taking into account separately the expression of these proteins in the spindle and glandular components. Disease specific survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test and Cox regression. The cohort of patients analyzed included 23 females and 26 males, and the histological type distribution was 35 monophasic and 14 biphasic SS. The median follow-up for survivors was 53 months, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 63% and a metastatic disease-free survival of 40%. The positive phenotypes identified for the different markers studied were as follows: cyclin D1, 59%; cyclin E, 29%; p21, 51%; p27, 69%; mdm2, 59%; p53, 16%; and Ki67, 59%. We observed that positive p53, cyclin E, and high Ki67 proliferative index were correlated with survival, but only Ki67 and p53 were independent variables for prognostication. The present study suggests that alterations of cell cycle regulators are more common events in SS than originally thought. p53 overexpression could be of use as a marker together with a high Ki67 proliferative index, in identifying a subset of SS patients with increased risk of tumor relapse.",

Recently, an amplicon originating from 1q21-23, containing the candidate oncogenes COAS1, COAS2 and COAS3 (Chromosome One Amplified Sequence) was identified. The presence, distribution and copy number level of extra COAS sequences were investigated in 48 bone and soft tissue tumor (BSTT) samples using metaphase FISH analysis. Amplification was seen in 27/48 (56%) samples. With few exceptions, all 3 genes were involved, but on average COAS2 exhibited higher copy numbers. The presence of extra COAS signals, irrespective of copy numbers, was found at similar frequencies in different histologic tumor subtypes. However, medium or high level amplification was common in lipomatous tumors but rare in other, nonlipomatous tumors (9/21 vs. 2/27 samples). The most common localization of extra COAS signals in lipomatous tumors was in supernumerary ring and giant marker chromosomes. Among nonlipomatous tumors, the distribution of extra COAS genes was more disperse, being located in various unidentified chromosomal structures, including double minutes, and only rarely in ring chromosomes. Because MDM2 is known to be amplified frequently in BSTTs, and in particular in atypical lipomatous tumors, cases with extra copies of COAS were studied also with an MDM2 probe. Twelve out of 18 lipomatous tumors had extra copies of both COAS and MDM2, and the 2 genes were found to be coamplified and interspersed exclusively in ring and giant marker chromosomes. Also 12 out of 18 nonlipomatous tumors exhibited simultaneous gain of COAS and MDM2, but colocalization in the same chromosome was less frequent. The role of the frequent coamplification of COAS, or some other yet unknown gene in the 1q21-23 region, and MDM2 remains to be elucidated.",

Alternatively, MDM2 gene amplification or up-regulation represents a mechanism of p53 wild-type inactivation, mainly reported in soft tissue sarcomas. In a previous TP53 analysis carried out on sporadic and NF1-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, in two cases, we observed the occurrence of C238Y missense mutation, leading to p53 stabilization unexpectedly coupled with immunophenotypic MDM2 overexpression. To investigate this TP53 missense mutation not yet functionally characterized in mammalian cell, we did MDM2 Southern blot and p53(C238Y)/MDM2 biochemical and functional analyses followed by molecular modeling. The results showed a lack of MDM2 gene amplification, evidence of p53-MDM2 protein complexes, and presence of a p53 that retains the ability to become phosphorylated on Ser15 and to induce the transcription of p21(waf1). Additional molecular modeling data highlighted the structural similarities between p53(C238Y) and wild-type p53, further supporting that the p53(C238Y) mutant still retains functional wild-type p53 properties.",

Detection of MDM2 amplification may supplement histopathology and aid to distinguish liposarcoma from other soft tissue neoplasia.;Here we present two cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with challenging presentation. Case 1 features a myogenic component. As the tumour infiltrated the abdominal muscles and showed immunohistochemical expression of myogenic proteins, rhabdomyosarcoma had to be ruled out. Case 2 has an osteosarcomatous component resembling extraosseous osteosarcoma. The MDM2 status was determined in both cases and helped making the correct diagnosis. Overexpression of MDM2 and co-overexpression of Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The underlying MDM2 amplification is shown by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Since low grade osteosarcoma may also harbour MDM2 amplification it is emphasised that the amplification has to be present in the lipomatous parts of the tumour to distinguish liposarcoma from extraosseous osteosarcoma.;The two cases exemplify challenges in the diagnoses of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Liposarcoma often has pleomorphic histology and additionally may feature heterologous components that mimic other soft tissue neoplasms.

We reviewed a series of 65 sarcomas with a myogenic differentiation developed in the internal trunk for which initial diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (37), rhabdomyosarcoma (6), malignant mesenchymoma (6), and DLPS (16). Immunostainings for MDM2, CDK4, alpha smooth actin, desmin, caldesmon, myogenin, c-kit, and progesterone receptor were performed. In 48 cases, the amplification status of MDM2 and CDK4 could be evaluated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction on paraffin-embedded tissues extracted DNAs. After review of the cases, final diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (35), rhabdomyosarcomatous (20) or leiomyosarcomatous (7) DLPS, probable DLPS (2), and malignant mesenchymoma (1). DLPS were bigger tumors (median: 18.2 cm) than leiomyosarcomas (median: 12 cm).

In conclusion, most sarcomas with a rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation occurring in the internal trunk of adults are DLPS.

Although KSHV has been recognized as a tumor virus for over a decade, the pathways for its tumorigenic conversion are incompletely understood, which has greatly hampered the development of efficient therapies for KSHV-induced malignancies like PEL and Kaposi's sarcoma. There are no current therapies effective against the aggressive, KSHV-induced PEL. Here we demonstrate that activation of the p53 pathway using murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibitor Nutlin-3a conveyed specific and highly potent activation of PEL cell killing. Our results demonstrated that the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) bound to both p53 and MDM2 and that the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a disrupted the p53-MDM2-LANA complex and selectively induced massive apoptosis in PEL cells. Together with our results indicating that KSHV-infection activated DNA damage signaling, these findings contribute to the specificity of the cytotoxic effects of Nutlin-3a in KSHV-infected cells. Moreover, we showed that Nutlin-3a had striking antitumor activity in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. Our results therefore present new options for exploiting reactivation of p53 as what we believe to be a novel and highly selective treatment modality for this virally induced lymphoma.",

Recently, DDLPSs with lipoblastic differentiation, i.e. morphologically lipogenic DDLPSs, were reported. Because of the lipoblastic differentiation, these tumours caused confusion, and were reported under different names. However, cytogenetic and molecular studies have revealed their DDLPS nature. So far, the cases reported have been high-grade pleomorphic liposarcoma-like tumours. In this study we have collected another series that contains low-grade tumours, and expand the histological spectrum.;Eighteen cases of DDLPS with lipoblastic differentiation from various anatomical locations were analysed by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, and MDM2 fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Two main histological patterns were seen: one featured a spindle cell sarcoma containing lipoblasts with variable nuclear pleomorphism, and the other a pleomorphic liposarcoma-like tumour including the epithelioid variant. Two cases showed low nuclear grade and lipogenic activity in the metastatic foci. CDK4, MDM2 and p16(INK) (4a) overexpression was seen in all except one case. MDM2 amplification was found in all 16 cases tested.;We have expanded the spectrum of this variant of DDLPS to include low-grade tumours, in which a careful search for increased mitotic activity is essential.

Especially malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) reveals a reduced ifosfamide (IF) chemosensitivity when compared to other sarcoma entities. This is the first study to analyze MFH cells for the effects of IF on the expression of the pathways P16-CDK4-Rb and P14ARF-MDM2-P73 regulating cell cycle. The aim was to identify candidate genes possibly involved in the anti-apoptotic response of p53-deficient MFH cells during chemotherapy. PCR, real-time RT-PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy were applied on primary cultures of MFH cells containing defective p53 genes. The cultures were treated with different concentrations of IF. A non-treated MFH culture served as negative control. A threshold concentration of IF (100 microM) was determined sparing the majority of the cells (99%), whereas higher IF quantities caused complete apoptosis. Data collected over a period of 48 h showed that the MFH cells surviving 100 microM IF overexpressed the kinase gene CDK4 and oncogene MDM2 by a factor of 63. A similar strong increase was observed at the protein level for both proteins. In contrast, the other proteins analyzed were not detectable. Additionally, the MFH cells induced complex patterns of MDM2 mRNA splicing and an abnormal mRNA transcript carrying a novel MDM2 missense mutation. These effects were neither observed in the non-treated culture nor in cultures completely inducing spontaneous apoptosis. Therefore, we speculate that the induction of the gene CDK4, and especially of MDM2, is involved in anti-apoptotic mechanisms of p53-negative MFH cells tolerating IF in vitro. Further experiments are necessary to test whether the novel candidate genes favor development of chemoresistance and whether MDM2 mRNA splicing variants contribute to this process in vivo.",

We have previously shown that E2F-1 overexpression induces apoptosis of MDM2-overexpressing sarcoma cells, which is related to the inhibition of MDM2 expression. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effect of combined treatment of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in human sarcoma cells. Two human sarcoma cell lines, OsACL and U2OS, were treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors (Etoposide and Adriamycin), alone or in combination with adenoviral vectors expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) or E2F-1 (Ad-E2F-1). E2F-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Ad-E2F-1 gene transfer at a low dose (multiplicity of infection, 2) markedly increased the sensitivity of human sarcoma cells to topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment. This cooperative effect of E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors was less marked in SAOS-2 cells (p53 and pRb null). Topoisomerase II inhibitors also cooperated with E2F-1 overexpression to enhance tumor cell killing in an in vivo model using xenografts in nude mice. When combined with Adriamycin or Etoposide, E2F-1 adenovirus therapy resulted in approximately 95% and 85% decrease in tumor size, respectively, compared to controls (P<.05). These results suggest a new chemosensitization strategy that is effective in MDM2-overexpressing tumors and may have clinical utility.",

Liposarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma in adults, account for approximately 20% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. There are no effective chemotherapies for majority of these tumors. Efforts made to define the molecular basis of liposarcomas lead to the finding that besides the amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2, Aurora Kinase A, also was shown to be overexpressed. Based on these as well as mathematic modeling, we have carried out a successful preclinical study using CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors in liposarcoma. MLN8237 has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora A. MLN-8237, as per our results, induces a differential inhibition of Aurora A and B in a dose dependent manner. At a low nanomolar dose, cellular effects such as induction of phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) mimicked as that of the inhibition of Aurora kinase A followed by apoptosis. However, micromolar dose of MLN-8237 induced polyploidy, a hallmark effect of Aurora B inhibition. The dose dependent selectivity of inhibition was further confirmed by using siRNA specific inhibition of Aurora A and B. This was further tested by time lapse microscopy of GFP-H2B labelled cells treated with MLN-8237. LS141 xenograft model at a dose of 30 mg/kg also showed efficient growth suppression by selective inhibition of Aurora Kinase A. Based on our data, a dose that can target only Aurora A will be more beneficial in tumor suppression. ",

It is also reported that the CDK4 gene is coamplified with other sequences in the 12q13-15 region, including the MDM2 and SAS genes. Using 146 DNA samples derived from a variety of bone and soft tissue tumors, we have studied the pattern of amplification of these three genes, CDK4, MDM2, and SAS, to investigate whether there are any tumor type specific patterns of amplification. Amplification of at least one of these three genes was found in 18 tumors, and five different patterns of amplification were observed. Amplification of all of these three genes was detected in 9 cases. Amplification of the CDK4 gene without MDM2 amplification was observed in osteosarcomas and a chondrosarcoma but not in soft tissue tumors, whereas amplification of MDM2 gene alone was observed in malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), liposarcomas, and lipomas, but not in bone tumors. These results suggested that the CDK4 region is the primary target for amplification in bone tumors, whereas the MDM2 region is in soft tissue tumors. We also investigated the relationship of CDK4 amplification with retinoblastoma (RB) gene mutations in osteosarcomas, for which we have already performed the mutation analyses in detail. Interestingly, contrary to the prevailing theory that CDK4 amplification is an alternative mechanism for RB gene mutation, we found that three of four cases with amplification of the CDK4 gene showed loss of expression of the RB protein, one of which was proved to have an gross DNA alteration in the RB locus. This redundancy of mutations may indicate that the amplification of CDK4 may have some roles other than the inactivation of the RB protein in the development of osteosarcomas.",

Both MDM2 and MDMX function as powerful oncogenes and are commonly over-expressed in some cancers, including sarcoma (~20%) and breast cancer (~15%). In contrast to tumors that are p53 mutant, whereby the current therapeutic strategy restores the normal active conformation of p53, MDM2 and MDMX represent logical therapeutic targets in cancer for increasing wild-type (WT) p53 expression and activities. Recent preclinical studies suggest that there may also be situations that MDM2/X inhibitors could be used in p53 mutant tumors. Since the discovery of nutlin-3a, the first in a class of small molecule MDM2 inhibitors that binds to the hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminus of MDM2, preventing its association with p53, there is now an extensive list of related compounds. In addition, a new class of stapled peptides that can target both MDM2 and MDMX have also been developed. Importantly, preclinical modeling, which has demonstrated effective in vitro and in vivo killing of WT p53 cancer cells, has now been translated into early clinical trials allowing better assessment of their biological effects and toxicities in patients. In this overview, we will review the current MDM2- and MDMX-targeted therapies in development, focusing particularly on compounds that have entered into early phase clinical trials. We will highlight the challenges pertaining to predictive biomarkers for and toxicities associated with these compounds, as well as identify potential combinatorial strategies to enhance its anti-cancer efficacy.

We examined the effect of MAP30 on the expression of viral and cellular genes in BC-2 during latent and lytic states of the viral life cycle. By Northern analysis and RT-PCR, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of viral cyclin D (vCD), viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), and viral FLIP (vFLIP), genes involved in cell cycle regulation, viral pathogenesis, and apoptosis. By pathway-specific cDNA microarray analysis, we found that BC-2 cells express high levels of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, skp1, and IL-2, cellular genes involved in mitogenesis, tumorigenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis in NFkappaB and p53 signaling pathways. These results define for the first time the specific cellular pathways involved in AIDS-related tumorigenesis and suggest specific novel targets for the treatment. Furthermore, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, and Skp1, while it upregulates the pro-apoptotic-related genes Bax, CRADD, and caspase-3.

        "Doc_abstract":"Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most commonly occurring soft-tissue sarcoma in children. Some reports have discussed the altered expression and molecular abnormalities of cell-cycle-regulatory proteins in rhabdomyosarcoma; however, variable frequencies of occurrence have been noted. In the current study, among 72 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, the authors evaluated for the expression of p53, MDM2, p16, p21/WAF1, p27, cyclin D1, cyclin E, pRb and E2F-1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed for proliferative activities using MIB-1. We also analyzed the mutation of the p53 gene in 45 cases, the amplification of the MDM2 gene in 18 cases and the mutation of the H-ras gene in 29 cases, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between clinicopathologic factors and the results of both immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. Alveolar type affected older patients, and it had a significantly higher mitotic rate compared with the embryonal type (P=0.0226). p53 overexpression was detected in 22 (30.6%) of 72 cases, and 10 (22.2%) of 45 cases had p53 gene abnormalities. As for MDM2, its overexpression was found in nine (12.5%) of 72 cases, and three (16.7%) of 18 cases showed MDM2 amplification. A statistically significant association was observed between immunoreaction for MDM2 and p53 overexpression (P=0.0002), and p53 and MDM2 overexpression was significantly correlated with high MIB-1 labeling indices. E2F-1 labeling indices showed a significantly higher score in alveolar type compared with that seen in embryonal type (P=0.0334), but MIB-1 did not. In conclusion, our study suggests that p53 overexpression may be related to tumor progression because tumors with p53 overexpression have a high proliferative activity in the current study. Alveolar type had a significantly higher both mitotic rate and E2F-1 labeling indices when compared with the embryonal type. The current study is the first report of the correlation of E2F-1 with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.",

Expression of the p53 gene was examined in freshly isolated tumor biopsy specimens from 15 patients with AIDS-KS. p53 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in both the AIDS-KS tumors and in normal skin control samples. p53 protein was detected in 4 of the 15 AIDS-KS specimens by immunohistochemical staining. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis PCR-products (PCR-SSCP) was used for detection of mutations of the p53 gene. One of the p53 positive AIDS-KS samples showed mobilized shifts in exon 6 suggestive of a mutation. Sequencing data showed the mutation to be located in codon 210. We examined other mechanisms that could stabilize p53 protein. SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1B protein were not found in the AIDS-KS specimens. MDM2, a p53-binding protein, was also detected in five of the AIDS-KS specimens, two of which also contained p53-positive cells.

The aim of this study was to analyse the clinicopathological and genetic features of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS with prominent myxoid stroma.;  Fifty-six cases of LPS (22 well-differentiated; 34 dedifferentiated) with prominent myxoid stroma were evaluated. Most arose in the retroperitoneum, abdominal cavity, or spermatic cord. The mean size was 170 mm. Myxoid LPS-like plexiform vessels were conspicuous in 11 cases of well-differentiated LPS. In 22 cases of dedifferentiated LPS, myxofibrosarcoma-like curvilinear vessels were prominent. In other cases, the myxoid component had variably bland or pleomorphic morphology. By immunohistochemistry, staining for MDM2 was positive in 95% of cases, and CDK4 in 78%. Cytogenetics in 13 cases showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed amplification of 12q13-15 in six cases evaluated. Of 30 patients with follow-up, all but one had local recurrences (up to four), but only one has so far had distant metastases.;  Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS with prominent myxoid stroma can closely resemble other sarcoma types, especially myxoid LPS and myxofibrosarcoma. The clinical presentation (large retroperitoneal or abdominal tumour) is a clue to the correct diagnosis; the degree of nuclear atypia helps to exclude myxoid LPS. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 and genetic analysis can be useful to confirm the diagnosis.",

The constituent cells of the dedifferentiated component were peculiar in that, they were relatively uniform cells with atypia and did not have pleomorphism to such an extent that it mimicked myxofibrosarcoma. This myxoid component was confidently differentiated from myxoid liposarcoma with the help of immunohistochemical analysis using CDK4 and MDM2.

As p53 needs to be inactivated in order for tumor cells to survive and thrive, pediatric tumors typically make use of other mechanisms to keep p53 in check. One of the critical negative regulators of p53 is the MDM2 oncoprotein. Many anticancer drug development efforts in the past decade have therefore been devoted to the discovery and optimization of small molecules that selectively disrupt the interaction between MDM2 and p53, which could provide, in principle, a potent means to restore p53 function in tumor cells with wild-type p53. The nutlins are the class of selective inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction that are currently most advanced in their clinical development. We review here the preclinical data that support the potential therapeutic use of nutlin drugs in the treatment of various pediatric tumors, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

A key role for p53 in tumour progression of this subset of liposarcomas has been suggested on the basis of p53 immunopositivity. A series of 14 dedifferentiated liposarcomas has been investigated by analysing the p53 gene and protein together with the p53-related molecules p21Waf1 and mdm2, to verify whether the p53 pathway is involved in the development and progression of this tumour type. The results indicate that the p53 gene is rarely involved in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (7 per cent of cases analysed) and that low percentages of p53 immunopositivity are still compatible with integrity of the p53 gene. This concept is also supported by the observed preservation of p21Waf1 immunoreactivity in all but the p53-mutated cases. By contrast, mdm2 overexpression emerges as the most frequent abnormality in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (57 and 78 per cent of cases in well-differentiated and high-grade areas, respectively).",

Heretofore, fusion transcripts were mainly detected in frozen tissues, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we aimed to develop a reliable method to detect these in paraffin-embedded tissues, and to examine the clinicopathologic characteristics of a series of translocation-positive LGFMS. Sixty-three neoplasms with typical morphologic features of LGFMS and 66 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors) were examined. RNA of sufficient quality could be extracted from 111/129 (86%) cases (59 LGFMS, 52 non-LGFMS). Of all, 48/59 (sensitivity, 81%) LGFMS contained detectable transcripts (45 FUS-CREB3L2, 3 FUS-CREB3L1). Most relevant clinicopathologic features of fusion-positive LGFMS included predominance in lower extremities (22/48; thigh: 13/48), deep situation (46/48), and occasional presence of unusual histologic features, for example, hypercellular areas (16/48), foci of epithelioid cells (13/48), and giant rosettes (6/48).

Eleven presumed LGFMS were fusion negative. Of all, 7/52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained FUS-CREB3L2 transcripts, of which 4 had been diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. In conclusion, FUS-CREB3L1/L2 fusion transcripts can be detected in paraffin-embedded LGFMS in a sensitive manner, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most fusion-positive LGFMS are EMA-positive and CD34/S100/smooth muscle actin negative.

Interestingly, infection of neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with Ews/Fli-1 switches the differentiation program of neuroblastomas to Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumors. Here we examined the status of cytoplasmically sequestered wt-p53 in neuroblastomas after stable expression of Ews/Fli-1. Immunofluorescence revealed that in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines, p53 went from a punctate-pattern of cytoplasmic sequestration to increased nuclear localization. Western blot analysis revealed that PARC was down-regulated in one neuroblastoma cell line but not expressed in the second. Therefore, decreased PARC expression could not fully account for relieving p53 sequestration in the neuroblastoma tumor cells. Neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines showed marked increases in p53 protein expression without transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, p53 was primarily phosphorylated, without activation of its downstream target p21(WAF1). Western blot analysis revealed that whereas MDM2 gene expression does not change, p14(ARF), a negative protein regulator of MDM2, increases. These observations suggest that the downstream p53 pathway may be inactivated as a result of abnormal p53. We also found that p53 has an extended half-life in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants despite the retention of a wild-type sequence in neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines. We then tested the p53 response pathway and observed that the neuroblastoma parent cells responded to genotoxic stress, whereas the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants did not. These results suggest that Ews/Fli-1 can directly abrogate the p53 pathway to promote tumorigenesis. These studies also provide additional insight into the relationship among the p53 pathway proteins.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) substrate 2 (FRS2) is an adaptor protein that plays a critical role in FGFR signaling. FRS2 is located on chromosome 12q13-15 that is frequently amplified in liposarcomas. The significance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling in high-grade liposarcomas is unknown. Herein, we first comparatively examined the amplification and expression of FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Amplification and expression of the three genes were identified in 90% to 100% (9-11 of 11) of DDLS, whereas that of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 were observed in 55% (41 of 75), 48% (36 of 75), and 44% (33/75) of clinically diagnosed UHGPS, suggesting that these \"UHGPS\" may represent DDLS despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated FRS2 protein indicated that the FGFR/FRS2 signaling axis was generally activated in about 75% of FRS2-positive high-grade liposarcomas. Moreover, we found that FRS2 and FGFRs proteins are highly expressed and functional in three high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2, and SW872. Importantly, the FGFR selective inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 significantly inhibited the growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Attenuation of FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cell lines decreased the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT and repressed cell proliferation. These findings indicate that analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will more accurately characterize pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Activated FGFR/FRS2 signaling may play a functional role in the development of high-grade liposarcomas, therefore, serve as a potential therapeutic target.",

Histologically, liposarcomas themselves are heterogeneous and fall into four distinct subtypes: well-differentiated/atypical lipomatous tumor, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid (round cell) liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Surgical resection with negative margins remains the mainstay for definitive treatment for operable disease. For unresectable disease, retrospective studies have identified myxoid (round cell) and pleomorphic sarcomas to be relatively responsive to chemotherapy. Recent studies have identified distinct genetic aberrations that not only aid in the diagnosis of particular liposarcoma subtypes, but represent actionable targets as they are considered central to disease pathogenesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) are overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas and offer tantalizing opportunities that are being pursued in clinical trials. Myxoid (round cell) liposarcomas appear to be sensitive to trabectedin, which is currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. Liposarcomas do not represent a uniform disease and understanding the underlying molecular mechanism will help not only in accurate diagnosis but in selecting the appropriate treatment. ",

DDL is defined as nonlipogenic sarcoma that is juxtaposed to WDL, occurs as a recurrence of WDL or which can arise de novo, and typically has the appearance of undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma. DDL have a propensity for local recurrence, whereas distant metastasis is rarer, and behavior is related to anatomic site, with retroperitoneal neoplasms showing a significantly worse prognosis. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, and medical options for patients with aggressive recurrent or metastatic disease are limited. DDL share similar genetic abnormalities to WDL, with high-level amplifications of chromosome 12q14-15, including the MDM2 and CDK4 cell cycle oncogenes, and DDL harbor additional genetic changes, particularly coamplifications of 6q23 and 1p32.

Data concerning the occurrence of cell cycle aberrations in this subset of mesenchymal malignancies are very limited. Therefore, we analyzed a histologically homogeneous series of 21 cases of myxoid and round cell liposarcoma. The p53 pathway was studied by investigating the TP53 gene and protein, mdm2 protein, and p21Waf1 protein. The Rb-cyclin D pathway was analyzed by studying the pRb protein, the p16MTS1 gene, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, p27Kip1, cdk4, and cdk6 proteins. In contrast with the rare involvement of the TP53 gene in well differentiated liposarcoma, aberrations of the TP53 gene were observed in approximately 30% of cases of myxoid and round cell liposarcoma. Notably, mdm2 overexpression was seen in 56% of cases and correlated with histological grade, therefore indicating a possible role in tumor progression. Abnormalities involving the Rb-cyclin D pathway were observed in more than 90% of cases. pRb loss was present in one-third of cases and, at variance with that observed in other subsets of sarcoma, overexpression of cyclin Ds represented a rare event.

Detailed mapping studies of the amplified region are necessary for definition of the impact of these amplification events on the tumor cell phenotype. By using the genes in this region and genomic fragments isolated by chromosome microdissection, we have established a series of ordered probes from 12q13-15 for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis. These probes have been used for physical mapping of two portions of the interval from GLI to D12S8. The centromeric region extends 1.8 Mb from GLI to microclone M79 and contains at least five genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4. The more telomeric region includes the p53 regulator MDM2 and covers 1.1 Mb. We used the same group of probes to determine the pattern of amplification in three cell lines and three tumor specimens carrying amplified sequences from 12q13-15. In addition, we used a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig of several megabases covering the entire region from SAS to D12S8 for FISH to determine the pattern of amplification in the neuroblastoma cell line NGP-127. The results suggest that the MDM2 and CDK4 regions may be either coamplified or amplified independently, and they illustrate how the map positions of genes and their functions may interact to determine the pattern of DNA amplification in human malignancies.",

Magnetic resonance imaging exhibited a large mass composed of two components with heterogeneous signal intensities, suggesting the coexistence of a fatty area and another soft tissue component. The grossly heterogeneous mass was histologically composed of an ALT/WDLS component transitioning abruptly into a dedifferentiated component. Immunohistochemistry was positive for murine double-minute 2 (MDM2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and p16 in both components, although a more strong and diffuse staining was found in the dedifferentiated area. The MIB-1 labeling index was extremely higher in the dedifferentiated area compared to the ALT/WDLS area. Cytogenetic analysis of the ALT/WDLS component revealed the following karyotype: 46,X,-Y,+r. Notably, cytogenetic analysis of the dedifferentiated component revealed a similar but more complex karyotype. Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that the ring chromosome was entirely composed of material from chromosome 12.

Given the low cell content of this tumor type, we utilized flow cytometry to isolate the diploid normal and aneuploid tumor populations from a well-differentiated liposarcoma prior to array comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing. This work revealed massive highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2, a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred. Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2, which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib, that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma. Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein.

Between 6 and 12 months, aggressive rhabdomyosarcomas formed around tungsten/nickel/cobalt pellets, while those of tungsten/nickel/iron or pure tungsten did not cause cancers. Electron microscopy showed a progressive corrosion of the matrix phase of tungsten/nickel/cobalt pellets over 6 months, accompanied by high urinary concentrations of nickel and cobalt. In contrast, non-carcinogenic tungsten/nickel/iron pellets were minimally corroded and urinary metals were low; these pellets having developed a surface oxide layer in vivo that may have restricted the mobilization of carcinogenic nickel. Microarray analysis of tumors revealed large changes in gene expression compared with normal muscle, with biological processes involving the cell cycle significantly up-regulated and those involved with muscle development and differentiation significantly down-regulated. Top KEGG pathways disrupted were adherens junction, p53 signaling, and the cell cycle. Chromosomal enrichment analysis of genes showed a highly significant impact at cytoband 7q22 (chromosome 7) which included mouse double minute (MDM2) and cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK4) as well as other genes associated with human sarcomas.

Expression levels of miR-579-3p decrease from nevi to stage III/IV melanoma samples and even further in cell lines resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-579-3p acts as an oncosuppressor by targeting the 3'UTR of two oncoproteins: BRAF and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2. Moreover miR-579-3p ectopic expression impairs the establishment of drug resistance in human melanoma cells.

The vif1 peptide binds the HAUSP TRAF domain, competitively blocking substrate binding, whereas the vif2 peptide binds both the HAUSP TRAF and catalytic domains, robustly suppressing its deubiquitination activity. Peptide treatments comprehensively blocked HAUSP, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in culture and to tumor regression in xenograft mouse model.

In this study, we established a new human cell line, FU-DDLS-1, which originated from a dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising in the retroperitoneum of a 61-year-old man. This cell line was characterized by immunocytochemistry, conventional banding analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome painting probe, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). FU-DDLS-1 cells were spindle or polygonal shaped and possessed oval nuclei and slender cytoplasmic processes. The cultured cells were successfully maintained in vitro for over 90 passages over more than 30 months. The histologic features of heterotransplanted tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency mice were essentially the same as those of the original nonlipogenic sarcoma resembling a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Both in vitro and in vivo, the cells exhibited immunopositive reaction for mdm2 and p53 proteins. Cytogenetically, FU-DDLS-1 displayed a hypertetraploid karyotype with giant marker chromosomes composed partly of chromosome 12 material. In addition, CGH analysis demonstrated that DNA sequence copy number changes including a gain of 12q12-q21 detected in FU-DDLS-1 were essentially the same as those in the original sarcoma. The FU-DDLS-1 cell line, which exhibits the unique conventional and molecular cytogenetic characteristics of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, should be a particularly useful model for studying the molecular pathogenesis of human dedifferentiated liposarcoma.",

Vimentin and protein S100 were focally expressed by the tumor cells. The differential diagnosis of the pleural mass included malignant solitary fibrous tumor. Cytogenetic analysis showed supernumerary ring chromosomes in the pleural tumor, as well as strong amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes in both tumors.

In addition, 1 of the 2 NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene-negative tumors showed amplification of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes. It was suggested that a certain proportion of tumors previously diagnosed as malignant SFTs with high-grade nuclear atypia lacking NAB2-STAT6 should be categorized into a special subtype of SFT, which is genetically different from conventional SFTs, and which cannot be apparently distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

This study was undertaken to determine whether, in leiomyosarcomas (LMS) occurring in different anatomic locations, there were differences in patterns of expression of molecules that have been demonstrated to be associated with biologically aggressive behavior in malignant neoplasms, and also to determine their diagnostic utility. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were selected from 16 extrauterine leiomyosarcomas (EULMS), 14 cases of uterine leiomyosarcomas (ULMS) and from five cases each of uterine and extrauterine leiomyomas (LM). Utilizing immunohistochemical (ABC) techniques with antigen retrieval, we assessed serial sections of each tumor for immunoreactivity with Glut1, CD44s, bcl2, cyclin D1, and estrogen receptor. Molecular genotyping for detecting k-ras-2 point mutation, p53 gene loss, and mdm2 gene amplification was performed on microdissected tumor samples from the same histologic sections. All of the uterine and extrauterine LM were diffusely positive for CD44s, bcl2, and cyclin D1, and uniformly negative for Glut1. In contrast, 50% of the ULMS and 25% of EULMS were Glutl positive. Moreover, Glut1 positivity closely correlated with aggressive biologic behavior reflected by distant metastatic spread. Eighty-percent of LM and 70% of the ULMS were estrogen receptor positive, whereas only one retroperitoneal tumor had focal weak positivity. Over 80% of the extrauterine and 50% of the uterine sarcomas showed absence of CD44s immunoreactivity. Percentage of cyclin D1 immunoreactivity was independent of tumor grade and inversely proportional to the percent of bcl2 positivity. An LMS of the male breast contained k-ras-2 exon 1 point mutation (codon 12 aspartate substitution of glycine). P53 allelic imbalance was present in 29% of ULMS and 57% EULMS. Mdm2 amplification was present in three of six EULMS but not in ULMS. In addition to clinical staging, Glut1 positivity together with patterns of immunoreactivity of CD44 and bcl2 may be helpful in identifying aggressive smooth muscle tumors of the uterus and some EULMS. The presence of estrogen receptor staining may be helpful in identifying uterine versus nonuterine LMS. Although sample numbers are too small for definite conclusions, this study suggests that there are differences in glucose transport, expression of adhesion molecules, and estrogen receptors in ULMS and EULMS, which in part may be due to the estrogen dependency of the ULMS. P53 mutations and mdm2 amplifications appear to be more frequent in EULMS.",

In this series, there were 36 men and 21 women aged from 22 to 87 years (median: 59). Tumors were mainly located in the lower limbs (27 cases), trunk wall (15 cases), and upper limbs (10 cases). Most tumors were deeply located (51/54) with a size from 1 to 30 cm (median: 8 cm). Cases were classified in 3 histologic categories: spindle cell RMS (25 cases), pleomorphic RMS (16 cases), and mixed type (16 cases). Forty-one tumors were grade 3 and 16 grade 2. Immunohistochemistry showed that every case was positive for desmin and myogenin. Alpha smooth muscle actin was positive in 21%, pankeratin AE1/AE3 in 20%, and CD34 in 13.2%. Treatment modalities and follow-up were available in 46 cases. Median follow-up was 60.9 months. Eight patients developed a local recurrence and 16 a distant metastasis with a 5-year overall survival rate of 52.6% and a 5-year metastasis-free survival of 62.9%.

Due to absence of clinically effective treatment options in inoperable situations and resistance to chemotherapeutics, a critical need exists to identify novel therapeutic targets. We analyzed LPS genomic landscape using SNP arrays, whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing to uncover the genomic information for development of specific anti-cancer targets. SNP array analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R). Carboxypeptidase M (CPM), recurrently amplified gene in well-differentiated/de-differentiated LPS was noted as a putative oncogene involved in the EGFR pathway. Notable deletions were found at chromosome 1p (RUNX3, ARID1A), chromosome 11q (ATM, CHEK1) and chromosome 13q14.2 (MIR15A, MIR16-1). Significantly and recurrently mutated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05) included PLEC (27%), MXRA5 (21%), FAT3 (24%), NF1 (20%), MDC1 (10%), TP53 (7%) and CHEK2 (6%). Further, in vitro and in vivo functional studies provided evidence for the tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in different subtypes of LPS. Pathway analysis of recurrent mutations demonstrated signaling through MAPK, JAK-STAT, Wnt, ErbB, axon guidance, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and cell cycle pathways were involved in liposarcomagenesis. Interestingly, we also found mutational and copy number heterogeneity within a primary LPS tumor signifying the importance of multi-region sequencing for cancer-genome guided therapy. In summary, these findings provide insight into the genomic complexity of LPS and highlight potential druggable pathways for targeted therapeutic approach. ",

In this study, we evaluated the expression of p53, MDM2, MIB-1 (Ki-67), p21, p27, p16, cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin E by immunohistochemistry in 45 cases of myxofibrosarcoma. First, we searched for possible clinicopathologic prognostic factors in 61 cases of myxofibrosarcoma for which follow-up data were available. In univariate analysis, large tumor size (> or =5 cm), deeply situated tumor, and high histological grade (grade 2 or 3) significantly decreased survival (log-rank test, P <0.05). Among 43 cases of myxofibrosarcoma for which immunohistochemical findings were available, high MIB-1 labeling index (LI) (cutoffs of 10 and 22.5 on average), high cyclin A LI (cutoffs 10% and 13.8% on average), low p21 LI (cutoffs 10 and 20.7 on average), and reduced abnormal expression of p16 were adverse prognostic factors. In multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model), high mitotic rate (>15/10 high-power fields), p53 immunoreactivity (cutoff 10%), high MIB-1 LI (>22.5), low p21 LI (<20.7), and low p27 LI (<47.8 on average) were independent poor prognostic factors.

The median tumor size was 10.9 cm (range: 3 to 30 cm). Six cases were low-grade DDL, 28 were high-grade DDL, and in 8 cases both coexisted.

Heterologous differentiation is seen in 5% to 10% of dedifferentiated LPS, usually with myogenic or osteo/chondrosarcomatous elements. Adipocytic differentiation in the dedifferentiated component is incompatible with the current definition of dedifferentiated LPS. Pleomorphic LPS is a high-grade sarcoma containing lipoblasts. At least in areas, pleomorphic LPS can be indistinguishable from dedifferentiated LPS, except for the presence of lipoblasts in pleomorphic LPS and well-differentiated LPS areas in dedifferentiated LPS. We evaluated 12 unusual liposarcomas: 11 cases with pleomorphic LPS-like morphology affecting patients with concomitant or previous well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS, and 1 case resembling inflammatory \"MFH\" with scattered lipoblasts. Clinical and histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 was carried out. Amplification of 12q13 to q15 was studied by FISH analysis of the HMGA2 locus. The tumors arose in the retroperitoneum (7), proximal lower extremity (3), chest wall (1), and neck (1) of 9 males and 3 females (median age 66 y; range 49 to 76). Size ranged from 9 to 32 cm (median 23 cm). In 3 cases, there was an abrupt transition between well-differentiated LPS and sheets of pleomorphic lipoblasts, indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. Four cases consisted of otherwise typical dedifferentiated LPS (with adjacent well-differentiated LPS), except for the presence of lipoblasts in the high-grade component. One case contained both nonlipogenic spindle cell areas and an inflammatory \"MFH\"-like component with numerous admixed lipoblasts. Four cases were composed exclusively of pleomorphic LPS-like areas developing in 1 of the recurrences or metastases of a prior typical dedifferentiated LPS. Two cases also showed heterologous smooth muscle differentiation. MDM2 and CDK4 were positive in both the dedifferentiated LPS and pleomorphic LPS-like components in 12/12 and 11/12 cases, respectively. FISH analysis showed high-level amplification of 12q14.3 in all 8 cases successfully tested. Karyotypes were available for 3 cases and showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Follow-up, available for 11 patients, ranged from 19 to 196 months (median 36 mo). Seven patients developed local recurrences (multiple in 3), and 3 developed lung metastases. Thus far, 5 patients have died of disease, 3 are alive with recurrent or metastatic disease, and 3 are alive with no evidence of disease. We conclude that dedifferentiated LPS can show lipoblastic differentiation in the high-grade component, resulting in areas indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. The available clinical and molecular data support the notion of \"homologous\" lipoblastic differentiation in dedifferentiated LPS, rather than mixed-type LPS.",

Cellular and viral microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression. A better knowledge of the miRNA-mediated pathways affected by KSHV infection is therefore important for understanding viral infection and tumor pathogenesis. In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze miRNA and cellular mRNA expression in a cell line with latent KSHV infection (SLKK) as compared to the uninfected SLK line. This approach revealed 153 differentially expressed human miRNAs, eight of which were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. KSHV infection led to the dysregulation of ~15% of the human miRNA pool and most of these cellular miRNAs were down-regulated, including nearly all members of the 14q32 miRNA cluster, a genomic locus linked to cancer and that is deleted in a number of PEL cell lines. Furthermore, we identified 48 miRNAs that were associated with a total of 1,117 predicted or experimentally validated target mRNAs; of these mRNAs, a majority (73%) were inversely correlated to expression changes of their respective miRNAs, suggesting miRNA-mediated silencing mechanisms were involved in a number of these alterations. Several dysregulated miRNA-mRNA pairs may facilitate KSHV infection or tumor formation, such as up-regulated miR-708-5p, associated with a decrease in pro-apoptotic caspase-2 and leukemia inhibitory factor LIF, or down-regulated miR-409-5p, associated with an increase in the p53-inhibitor MDM2. Transfection of miRNA mimics provided further evidence that changes in miRNAs are driving some observed mRNA changes. Using filtered datasets, we also identified several canonical pathways that were significantly enriched in differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the interleukin-8 signaling pathways. Overall, our data provide a more detailed understanding of KSHV latency and guide further studies of the biological significance of these changes. ",

Mice lacking ARF are highly prone to tumor development, and in this study, 80% of these animals spontaneously developed tumors and died within their first year of life. Mice that were heterozygous for ARF also developed tumors after a longer latency, whereas their wild-type littermates did not. In heterozygotes, tumor formation was accompanied by loss of the residual ARF allele and/or lack of ARF mRNA expression, implying that ARF can act as a canonical \"two-hit\" tumor suppressor gene. Tumors occurred earlier in life in ARF-null animals that were neonatally irradiated or given dimethylbenzanthrene, and several animals treated with carcinogen simultaneously developed multiple forms of malignancy arising from distinct cell lineages. Although p53-null mice primarily develop lymphomas and fibrosarcomas, the frequency of these two tumor types was inverted in ARF-null animals, with undifferentiated sarcomas predominating in a 3:2 ratio; 28% of ARF-null animals developed carcinomas and tumors of the nervous system, which have been rarely observed in untreated p53-null mice. The longer latency of tumor formation in ARF-null versus p53-null mice, therefore, appears to enable a broader spectrum of tumors to emerge.",

Our previous studies showed that an MDM2-inhibiting motif (residues 15-29) in the p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) mediates the interaction with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In this study, we provided structural models of the complexes between the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide and Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) Bcl-2 using NMR chemical shift perturbation data. The binding mode of the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide is highly conserved among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins despite their distinct specificities for pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. We also identified the binding of a phage-display-derived MDM2-inhibiting peptide 12-1 to anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein by using NMR spectroscopy. The structural model of the Bcl-XL/12-1 peptide complex revealed that the conserved residues Phe4, Trp8, and Leu11 in the MDM2-inhibiting peptide fit into a hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-XL in a manner similar to that of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) peptides.

However, little is known about the human, inherited genetics of this important signaling pathway.;Studies of human genetic variants in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and MDM2 oncogene have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) can affect p53 signaling, confer cancer risk, and alter outcome, and also suggest that the pathway is under evolutionary selective pressure.

Although this process is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, dedifferentiated liposarcomas rarely produces metastases. The case reported here is rather uncommon: A retroperitoneal WDLPS gave lung metastases that were diagnosed as highly malignant osteosarcomas. We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and Southern blot analyses to characterize the copy number changes and genetic aberrations occurring at different stages of the disease. In the primary tumor, the only detectable aberration was amplification of 12q13-q14, which was present only in a fraction of the cells and revealed by FISH analysis. High-level amplification of 12q13-q14, involving CDK4, MDM2, and HMGIC, was seen both in the relapse and the metastases. The second most common change, gain or high-level amplification of 1q22-q24, was detectable by CGH only in the osteogenic metastases, as was loss of the distal 2q. FISH analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity in the samples, and the percentage of cells showing aberrations was significantly higher in the metastatic samples. In particular, increased copy numbers of 789f2, a marker for 1q21 amplification in sarcomas, was observed in more than 65% of the cells in the metastatic samples, but in less than 10% of the cells from the recurrent samples. These observations could indicate that 1q amplification, in particular, may be indicative of a more malignant phenotype and ability of metastasis in WDLPS, as has also been suggested by others.",

Rhabdomyosarcomas resemble developing skeletal muscle, notably in their expression of the MRF family of transcription factors and the PAX3 and PAX7 genes. These PAX genes are also involved through specific translocations, t(2;13)(q35;q14) and variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) in the alveolar subtype, which result in PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion genes, respectively. The fusion genes are thought critically to affect downstream targets of PAX3 and PAX7 or possibly have novel targets. Similar downstream changes may also be involved in embryonal and fusion gene negative cases. Genomic amplification of such genes as MYCN, MDM2, CDK4, and PAX7-FKHR is a feature mainly of the alveolar subtype, while specific chromosomal gains, including chromosomes 2, 8, 12, and 13, are associated with the embryonal subtype. Loss of alleles and imprinting at 11p15.5 and disruption of genes such as IGF2, ATR, PTC, P16, and TP53 have also been implicated in rhabdomyosarcoma development. Whereas there is now a realistic possibility of cure in the majority of cases, there remains a subset that is resistant to multimodality therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy. Characterization of the defining molecular features of tumors that are likely to behave aggressively represents a particular challenge. Current research is leading toward a better understanding of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis, which may ultimately result in novel therapeutic strategies that increase the overall cure.

Currently, sarcomas with multilineage differentiation fulfilling the criteria of MM tend to be diagnosed as specific sarcomas with heterologous differentiation (e.g., de-differentiated liposarcoma) rather than MM; however, some cases of these tumors are difficult to classify. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of these unclassifiable tumors, the so-called MM, and to determine whether some parameters are a useful adjunct for the classification of these tumors from the viewpoint of clinical outcome. Twelve cases of so-called MM were investigated retrospectively. The patients (six male, six female) ranged in age from 6 to 71 years (mean 48 years). Tumor size ranged from 3 to 20 cm (mean 13 cm). Tumor locations included the retroperitoneum (five cases), abdominal wall (two), thigh (two), forearm (one), lung (one), and parotid gland (one). The differentiated mesenchymal components were rhabdomyosarcomatous (RMS) (six cases), liposarcomatous (five), chondrosarcomatous (five), osteosarcomatous (five), or leiomyosarcomatous (four). Follow-up in all cases (range 4-129 months; mean 36 months) showed a 67% local recurrence rate, a 33% metastatic rate, and a 50% disease-related mortality. The patients who were under 40 years of age or who had an RMS component showed significantly worse survival than did patients in the other groups. The other mesenchymal components showed no significant correlation with survival. The immunophenotypes of p53 and mdm2 were almost identical between the two mesenchymal components in each case; however, there was no significant correlation between either of these immunophenotypes and the clinical outcome. None of the other factors (gender, tumor site, tumor size, or MIB-1-labeling index) was found to be a statistically significant prognostic indicator. In conclusion, a patient age under 40 years and the presence of an RMS component appear to be poor prognostic indicators of survival in patients with so-called MM, and to be a useful adjunct for the classification of these tumors.",

We aimed to study the incidence of local recurrence of 90 cases of atypical lipomatous tumours and an additional 18 cases of de novo dedifferentiated liposarcoma. All tumours were diagnosed on the basis of MDM2 amplification: all patients had their first treatment in the same specialist sarcoma unit and were followed for a minimum of 60 months. The tumours were diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 and followed until the end of 2014. Seventy cases (78%) of atypical lipomatous tumours were located in the thigh (mean size 195 mm on presentation). Eight atypical lipomatous tumours (8.9%) recurred locally, of which 50% recurred after 60 months. The only two tumours with intralesional excisions recurred. Seven of the eight recurrent tumours were detected by the patient by self-examination. One case recurred a second time as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Seventeen per cent of the de novo dedifferentiated liposarcomas recurred within 60 months of presentation. Extending the study period revealed that atypical lipomatous tumour could recur up to 40 years after the first surgery. Furthermore, of 26 tumours that recurred in the extended study, 27% recurred more than once, and three of the seven that recurred more than once transformed into a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. We recommend that, following post-operative wound care, patients with atypical lipomatous tumour are referred back to their general practitioner for follow up, but that in the event of a suspected recurrence they have rapid access back to the specialist unit using a 'supported discharge' scheme. In the event of an intralesional excision and if a lesion recurs, patients are followed in a specialist unit at regular intervals: whether MRI scanning is a valuable means of monitoring such patients is unclear and requires an evidence base.
