Subsequent studies have also characterized morphologic features corresponding to ALK and NTRK1 translocations. In this study, we sought to further compare morphologic features across a range of 49 genetically defined spitzoid neoplasms with ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, or RET fusions to determine discriminating features. We also compared them with a group of 22 spitzoid neoplasms, which were confirmed to be negative for fusions in ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, and RET. Features with the highest discriminatory value included diameter of the lesion, dermal architecture, and certain cytomorphologic features. Specifically, cases with a large diameter (≥9 mm) and wedge-shaped, plexiform dermal architecture of nests of large, spindle-shaped cells were most likely to have an ALK fusion. NTRK1-fused cases were most likely of the fusions to have Kamino bodies and were typically arranged in smaller nests with smaller predominantly spindle-shaped cells, occasionally forming rosettes. BRAF fusion cases were the only fusion subtype to have a predominance of epithelioid cells, were less organized in nests, and commonly had a sheet-like growth pattern or dysplastic Spitz architecture. BRAF fusion cases were most likely to have high-grade nuclear atypia, to be diagnosed as spitzoid melanoma, to have a positive result by melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, and to develop copy number gains in the kinase domain of the fusion protein. On the basis of experience from this cohort, BRAF-fused cases appear most likely to progress to melanoma.",

Deletions and translocations involving this region of the long arm of chromosome 6 occur frequently in human malignant melanoma, and there are anecdotal reports of MYB gene rearrangements in this cancer. In the current study, Southern blotting and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) have been performed to determine whether MYB or its flanking regions are commonly altered in malignant melanoma. Southern blotting failed to document obvious rearrangement of the MYB gene in 15 cases studied. To extend analysis of the MYB region, a long-range restriction map was established by PFGE. This map was then linked to the known restriction map of frequent cutting enzymes. Based on the mapping data and analysis of the MYB region in melanomas, ClaI tissue-specific variation due to methylation was demonstrated. Also, two melanomas (containing alterations in band 6q13) also demonstrated by PFGE a unique restriction fragment for the MYB gene. These results extend significantly the physical map surrounding the MYB locus and provide further evidence for the rearrangement of chromosome 6 in malignant melanoma.",

The presence of melanoma cells was confirmed by microscopic identification of melanin, tyrosinase activity, and electron microscopy characterization of melanosomes. The MGSA is found in cytoplasmic granules after immunocytochemical stain. Three of the cultures did not produce MGSA and showed no distinctive cytogenetic differences. Breakpoints in derivative chromosomes were concentrated in region 1p1, and among all cultures chromosome 1 was the most frequently rearranged. It also has a low copy number of normal homologs. Chromosomes 18, X, and Y were never derivative, and chromosomes 2 and 4 were rarely so. Thus the cytogenetic data indicate that 4q13-21, the hybridization site for MGSA cDNA, is spared from gross change, although it could be under the influence of another site on chromosome 1 that is lost or rearranged. The ratio of abnormal to normal autosomes (mean per cell) in no culture exceeded 0.5, and for no autosome exceeded 0.8, suggesting a limit to the rearrangement tolerated for cell survival. If the Y is retained, the X:Y ratio varies around a normal figure of 1. The ratio of autosomes to sex chromosomes varies around a normal figure of 22. These data suggest stability of the X chromosome in cells undergoing multiple rearrangements of the autosomes.",

Previous cytogenetic characterizations of this tumor consistently revealed chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes 3, 6, and 8; reports of other abnormalities vary in frequency. We defined cytogenetic abnormalities of this tumor using complementary in situ hybridization techniques on 10 uveal melanoma cell lines. Synthesis of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and spectral karyotyping (SKY) results revealed that chromosomal rearrangement is involved in DNA sequence copy number abnormalities throughout the genome, but monosomy 3 was not found. Monosomy 3 is thought to be a significant prognostic indicator, so its absence was investigated further. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome 3 revealed approximately 1 centromere signal per cell, but probes for 3p and 3q revealed multiple telomere signals per cell, suggesting chromosomal rearrangement without whole-chromosome loss. Based on combined CGH, SKY, and FISH data, we propose that chromosome 3 is more frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements than whole-chromosome loss in uveal melanoma. Future approaches should be designed to confirm and enhance the resolution of regions of imbalance in primary tumors. Once identified, conserved chromosomal alterations that contribute to uveal melanoma may reveal the underlying aspects of uveal melanoma onset, metastasis and resistance to current treatment modalities.",

Specific breakpoints are reported for malignant melanomas throughout the chromosome but especially at 1p36 and at several sites throughout 1p22-q21. In addition, partial deletions and loss of heterozygosity have been found on 1p indicating the possible location of tumor suppressor genes. Here we have characterized the involvement of chromosome 1 in a series of seven malignant melanoma cell lines. Initial chromosome painting studies revealed that six of the cell lines had chromosome 1 rearrangements. Deletions involving 1p10-32, 1q11-44, and 1q25-44 were observed. The other rearrangement breakpoints included three in the 1q10-p11 region with the rest at 1p36, 1p34, 1p32, 1p31, 1p12-13, 1q21, and 1q23. The breaks at 1q10-p11 were investigated further using an alpha-satellite 1 centromere probe and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) from the region. Two of the 1q10-p11 breaks mapped in the centromeric region, while the others mapped to variable sites. This suggests that the role of these rearrangements in the pathogenesis of melanomas does not involve the alteration of specific oncogenes in the breakpoint region. During the YAC mapping a previously undetected, small (<1 Mbp) del(1)(p10p11) was identified. This deletion lies within minimal overlapping deleted regions reported in head and neck as well as breast carcinomas and it could therefore facilitate the isolation of a carcinoma-associated tumor suppressor gene.",

These alterations are of prognostic relevance and have also be shown to correlate to high risk and low risk metastatic categories of uveal melanoma as defined by micro-array analysis. It is, however, possible that a catalogue of relevant genetic alterations, involving gene rearrangement rather than amplification, have as yet eluded identification. To address this point we examined 14 primary uveal melanomas, using 24 colour multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH). All tumours were karyotyped following G-Banding, and M-FISH was performed to confirm and clarify the identity of abnormal chromosomes. M-FISH data were obtained from all tumours and was able to establish the nature of most abnormalities not fully characterized by cytogenetics. Abnormalities of chromosome 6 were far more frequent than previously indicated, in approximately 70% of cases, indicating they have been substantially underrepresented in past studies of uveal melanoma. Spindle melanomas were found to have novel rearrangements affecting in particular chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, suggesting that juxtaposition of genes through translocational events may play a role in the development of some uveal melanomas. In conclusion, this study is the largest of primary uveal melanoma analysed by M-FISH and indicates that alterations of chromosome 6 have previously been underestimated. Furthermore spindle melanomas are prone to rearrangements affecting chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, which may relate to early changes in uveal melanoma development or associate with those melanomas of a more differentiated status.",

The prevalence of these mutations makes these kinase signal transduction pathways an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, tumors have generally shown adaptive resistance to treatment. This adaptation is achieved in melanoma through its ability to undergo neovascularization, migration and rearrangement of signaling pathways. To understand the dynamic, nonlinear behavior of signaling pathways in cancer, several computational modeling approaches have been suggested. Most of those models require that the pathway topology remains constant over the entire observation period. However, changes in topology might underlie adaptive behavior to drug treatment. To study signaling rearrangements, here we present a new approach based on Fuzzy Logic (FL) that predicts changes in network architecture over time. This adaptive modeling approach was used to investigate pathway dynamics in a newly acquired experimental dataset describing total and phosphorylated protein signaling over four days in A375 melanoma cell line exposed to different kinase inhibitors. First, a generalized strategy was established to implement a parameter-reduced FL model encoding non-linear activity of a signaling network in response to perturbation. Next, a literature-based topology was generated and parameters of the FL model were derived from the full experimental dataset. Subsequently, the temporal evolution of model performance was evaluated by leaving time-defined data points out of training. Emerging discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data at specific time points allowed the characterization of potential network rearrangement. We demonstrate that this adaptive FL modeling approach helps to enhance our mechanistic understanding of the molecular plasticity of melanoma. ",

The aim of this study was to characterize pathological features and clinical outcome of primary cutaneous melanomas associated with PCs. Moreover, we investigated the origins of the melanoma-associated PCs. Finally, we studied the outcome of patients with primary melanomas with PCs. We reviewed 710 melanomas to correlate the presence of PCs with histological prognostic markers. Immunohistochemistry for CD138 and heavy and light chains was performed in primary melanomas (PM) and in loco-regional lymph nodes (LN), both metastatic and not metastatic. In three PM and nine LN with frozen material, VDJ-rearrangement was analyzed by Gene Scan Analysis. Survival analysis was performed on a group of 85 primary melanomas >2 mm in thickness. Forty-one cases (3.7%) showed clusters/sheets of PCs. PC-rich melanomas occurred at an older age and were thicker, more often ulcerated and more mitotically active (P<0.05). PCs were polyclonal and often expressed IgA in addition to IgG. In LN, clusters/sheets of IgA+ PCs were found both in the sinuses and subcapsular areas. Analysis of VDJ-rearrangements showed the IgA to be oligoclonal. Melanomas with clusters/sheets of PCs had a significantly worse survival compared with melanomas without PCs while, interestingly, melanomas with sparse PCs were associated with a better clinical outcome (P=0.002). In conclusion, melanomas with sheets/clusters of PCs are associated with worse prognosis. IgG and IgA are the isotypes predominantly produced by these PCs.

As demonstrated by cytogenetics and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, between 70% and over 90% of clear cell sarcomas have a t(12;22) translocation, fusing the EWS and ATF1 genes on chromosomes 22q12 and 12q13, respectively. Identification of this translocation distinguishes clear cell sarcoma from histologic mimics, most importantly conventional malignant melanoma. We report our experience with a commercially available, dual-color, break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe, which allows detection of EWS (22q12) gene rearrangement in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Histologically and immunophenotypically well-characterized cases of clear cell sarcoma (n = 10) and malignant melanoma (n = 32) were evaluated with a 22q12 dual-color, break-apart probe (Vysis, Downer's Grove, IL, USA), which spans the known common breakpoints in the EWS gene on chromosome 22 (introns 7-10). Signals from tumor cell nuclei were counted under a fluorescence microscope and the presence of red-green break-apart signals was recorded. Of the clear cell sarcoma cases, seven of 10 showed evidence of an EWS gene rearrangement with a mean of 81.6% positive cells per sample (range: 60-95%). All cases of malignant melanoma (n = 32) showed virtually absent break-apart signals in the EWS gene (less than 4% cells per case). FISH detects EWS gene rearrangement in a substantial proportion of clear cell sarcomas, with excellent specificity. Importantly, EWS FISH is negative in malignant melanoma, a clinically dissimilar tumor, which may closely mimic clear cell sarcoma histologically and immunohistochemically. As the studied probe can be utilized in routinely processed tissue, FISH provides an excellent alternative to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in cases where fresh tissue is unavailable.",

Germline CDKN2A mutations affecting p16(INK4a) were detected in 8 unrelated probands (13.6 %), including 7 familial cases and one patient with multiple melanomas; 4 out of 8 mutation carriers met the criteria for familial melanoma and had multiple primary lesions. Although this study adds to the literature on melanoma susceptibility in Latin America, it is limited by the small size of the cohort. Our findings suggest that stringent inclusion criteria led to a substantially increased rate of CDKN2A mutation detection. This consideration should be taken into account when referring patients for genetic screening in a setting of limited budget, such as in developing countries.",

However, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and CD117 labeled the neoplasm, prompting consideration of a late metastatic melanoma with loss of antigen expression. Subsequent immunolabeling for CD4, CD43, and CD30 and clonal T-cell gene rearrangements enabled the correct diagnosis of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

In clones derived from the B16F10BL6 subline, expression of the transfected or endogenous H-2Kb gene resulted in alterations of various phenotypic properties of these melanoma cells, among which was the loss of melanoma-associated antigen (MAA) expression. Because our previous immunoelectron microscopy studies showed that MAA was associated with a C-type ecotropic retrovirus specific for melanomas of C57BL/6 origin, we examined the effect of class I H-2Kb as well as class II H-2IAk gene expression on retrovirus production in subclones of BL6 melanoma cells. Here we have shown that expression of the transfected or endogenous H-2Kb gene resulted in the loss of production of budding, MAA-specific, C-type retrovirus particles. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression of ecotropic retroviral mRNAs in both particle-producing and non-producing BL6 melanoma clones. Southern blot analysis of high-molecular-weight cellular DNAs using an ecotropic env-specific DNA probe indicated that the parental BL6-8 melanoma cells contained the C57BL/6 endogenous ecotropic MuLV (Emv-2) and at least three additional, novel ecotropic retroviral DNAs. Restriction enzyme analysis of the proviral DNA suggests that the loss of retrovirus production in the H-2Kb-expressing melanoma clones is the result of multiple rearrangements in the novel proviral DNAs. Thus, phenotypic changes observed in the H-2Kb gene-transfected BL6 melanoma cells were associated with loss of endogenous melanoma-specific ecotropic retrovirus production.",

However, the mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase regulates these effects are still unclear. In this work, we investigate the role of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS in the signaling events that coordinate melanoma cell survival. Using the highly metastatic human melanoma cell line MV3, we observed that pharmacological NADPH oxidase inhibition reduced melanoma viability and induced dramatic cellular shape changes. These effects were accompanied by actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, diminished FAKY397 phosphorylation, and decrease of FAK-actin and FAK-cSrc association, indicating disassembly of focal adhesion processes, a phenomenon that often results in anoikis. Accordingly, NADPH oxidase inhibition also enhanced hypodiploid DNA content, and caspase-3 activation, suggesting activation of the apoptotic machinery. NOX4 is likely to be involved in these effects, since silencing of NOX4 significantly inhibited basal ROS production, reduced FAKY397 phosphorylation and decreased tumor cell viability. Altogether, the results suggest that intracellular ROS generated by the NADPH oxidase, most likely NOX4, transmits cell survival signals on melanoma cells through the FAK pathway, maintaining adhesion contacts and cell viability.

We analyzed 15 conventional melanomas (CMs), 3 melanomas arising in congenital nevi (CNMs), and 5 spitzoid melanomas (SMs), using various platforms, including whole genome or exome sequencing, the molecular inversion probe assay, and/or targeted sequencing. CMs demonstrated a high burden of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with each case containing a TERT promoter (TERT-p) mutation, 13/15 containing an activating BRAF V600 mutation, and >80% of the identified SNVs consistent with UV damage. In contrast, the three CNMs contained an activating NRAS Q61 mutation and no TERT-p mutations. SMs were characterized by chromosomal rearrangements resulting in activated kinase signaling in 40%, and an absence of TERT-p mutations, except for the one SM that succumbed to hematogenous metastasis. We conclude that pediatric CM has a very similar UV-induced mutational spectrum to that found in the adult counterpart, emphasizing the need to promote sun protection practices in early life and to improve access to therapeutic agents being explored in adults in young patients.

We have performed loss-of-heterozygosity studies to confirm these original findings and identify the most frequently rearranged or deleted region of 9p. Eight markers were analyzed, including (from 9pter to proximal 9q) D9S33, the beta-interferon (IFNB1) locus, the alpha-interferon (IFNA) gene cluster, D9S126, D9S3, D9S19, the glycoprotein 4 beta-galactosyltransferase (GGTB2) gene, and the argininosuccinate synthetase pseudogene 3 (ASSP3). Two or more of these loci were found to be hemizygously reduced in 12 of 14 (86%) informative metastatic melanoma tumor and cell line DNAs, and homozygous deletions of the marker D9S126 were observed in 2 of 20 (10%) melanoma cell lines. These findings have resulted in the identification of a small critical region of 2-3 megabases on 9p21 in which a putative melanoma tumor-suppressor gene appears likely to reside. Several 9p candidate genes, including IFNB1, the IFNA gene cluster, GGTB2, and the tyrosinase-related protein (TYRP) locus, have all been eliminated as potential targets because they are located outside of the homozygously deleted regions.",

Few studies have examined the prevalence of all chimeric types and variants to assess the usage of ancillary genetic testing in routine diagnosis. We investigated rearrangement prevalence in 17 clear cell sarcomas, two positive control cell lines, and two melanomas (negative controls). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the LSI EWSR1 break-apart probe and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay optimized for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue to detect all four reported EWSR1/ATF1 clear cell sarcoma chimeric types and the EWSR1/CREB1 variant was performed. All 15 cases available for testing by FISH were positive for EWSR1 rearrangement including two cases with insufficient RNA for RT-PCR. Thirteen of 15 cases successfully tested by RT-PCR harbored a type 1 chimeric transcript (EWSR1 exon 8/ATF1 exon 4), of which five tumors simultaneously carried a type 2 chimeric transcript (EWSR1 exon 7/ATF1 exon 5). One case carried a type 2 transcript alone and one case contained an EWSR1/CREB1 transcript. Both control cases were positive by both techniques with one case carrying both types 1 and 2 chimeric transcripts and the other types 2 and 3 (EWSR1 exon 10/ATF1 exon 5). Consequently, both techniques are equally effective in assessing for an EWSR1 rearrangement and are useful ancillary diagnostic tests for clear cell sarcoma. They also reinforce the prevalence of this translocation in these tumors. In addition, EWSR1-CREB1 was identified in a clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue providing further evidence that this chimeric variant is not exclusive to gastrointestinal clear cell sarcomas and should be included in RT-PCR assays of soft tissue clear cell sarcomas.",

Recent studies suggest that the gene responsible may be CDK41, since it encodes a putative cell cycle inhibitor, p16, and is frequently lost or rearranged in melanoma cell lines. In this study we examined whether germline alterations in CDK41 could be identified in patients with melanoma of the uveal tract. From an archive of bloods collected from patients with uveal melanoma, we identified 13 samples drawn from patients with a history in a family member of uveal (n = 6) or cutaneous (n = 7) melanoma. An additional 24 'control' bloods (without melanoma or any other primary malignancy in a family member), similar to the 'cases' in age and number of first-degree relatives, were also selected for study. For each sample, DNA was extracted from the red blood cell fraction. Using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method, we screened for alterations in p16. Specific changes were characterized by DNA sequencing. Six nucleotide changes were detected in five (13.5%) of the 37 samples examined. An altered gene was found in one (7.7%) of the 13 patients with a family history (of intra-ocular melanoma) and four (16.7%) of the 24 patients with no family history (P = 0.64) of melanoma. In this series the group with a positive family history was predominantly female and most pedigrees involved matrilineal descent. In these data prevalence of germline alteration in p16 was similar in familial and sporadic cases. The results provide evidence against a significant role for p16 in familial clustering of intra-ocular and cutaneous melanomas.",

The primary tumor showed an inversion of chromosome 1 where the p36 region, often proposed in literature as the location of a melanoma susceptibility gene, was involved. Three cutaneous and one lymphonodal metastases presented the same nine clonal chromosomal aberrations. In particular, one is a further rearrangement of the marker present in the primary tumor; another is a deletion of the 9p21pter region in which the p16 gene is located.

Chromosomal instability was quantified using array comparative genomic hybridization to identify somatic copy number alterations (deletions and duplications). Primary human melanocytes displayed an average of 8.5 alterations per cell primarily representing known polymorphisms. Melanoma cell lines displayed 25 to 131 alterations per cell, with an average of 68, indicative of chromosomal instability. Copy number alterations included approximately equal numbers of deletions and duplications with greater numbers of hemizygous (-1,+1) alterations than homozygous (-2,+2). Melanoma oncogenes, such as BRAF and MITF, and tumor suppressor genes, such as CDKN2A/B and PTEN, were included in these alterations. Duplications and deletions were functional as there were significant correlations between DNA copy number and mRNA expression for these genes. Spectral karyotype analysis of three lines confirmed extensive chromosomal instability with polyploidy, aneuploidy, deletions, duplications, and chromosome rearrangements. Bioinformatic analysis identified a signature of gene expression that was correlated with chromosomal instability but this signature provided no clues to the mechanisms of instability. The signature failed to generate a significant (P = 0.105) prediction of melanoma progression in a separate dataset. Chromosomal instability was not correlated with elements of DNA damage response (DDR) such as radiosensitivity, nucleotide excision repair, expression of the DDR biomarkers γH2AX and P-CHEK2, nor G1 or G2 checkpoint function. Chromosomal instability in melanoma cell lines appears to influence gene function but it is not simply explained by alterations in the system of DDR.",

PKC, when measured by immunoreactivity or a functional assay, was found to be more abundant in melanoma cells than in melanocytes.

PKC-beta was expressed in melanocytes, but was undetectable by Northern analysis in 10 out of 11 melanoma cell strains. Southern analysis revealed that no gross deletions or rearrangements of the PKC-beta gene had occurred. These data suggest that down-regulation of the PKC-beta gene occurs frequently during the process of transformation of melanocytes. Furthermore, differential expression of PKC isotypes may explain the different effects of TPA on melanocyte and melanoma cell growth.",

Abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 11 are also evident in a wide variety of other human solid tumors, including carcinomas of the breast, ovary, cervix, and lung. In melanomas, these abnormalities tend to cluster in the lower half of the long arm of chromosome 11, indicating the possible presence of a melanoma tumor suppressor gene in this region. We tested this possibility by using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to introduce normal copies of human chromosome 11 into two human malignant melanoma cell lines. In one cell line, MelJuSo, the presence of an additional copy of chromosome 11 severely reduced the ability of the cells to grow in culture. In a second cell line, UACC 903, there was a moderate reduction in cell growth in vitro, and the ability of the hybrid cells to form tumors in animals was suppressed. Suppression of tumorigenicity was even more strongly pronounced in a microcell hybrid that received an isochromosome 11q derived from the donor copy of chromosome 11. The formation of tumors was accompanied by a reduction in the copy number of chromosome 11. This provides functional evidence that a melanoma tumor suppressor resides on the long arm of chromosome 11.

Most of these are cytotoxic to tumor cells, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. In this study, it was demonstrated that stellettin A (1), obtained from Geodia japonica, inhibited the growth of B16F10 murine melanoma cells by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins. Immunoblotting analysis revealed abnormal glycosylation patterns of two melanoma marker proteins, tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1, and the retention of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Compound 1 induced the upregulation of the unfolded protein chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 78, in a dose-dependent manner. Increase of autophagosome-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) in a membrane-bound form (LC3II) and its immunofluorescence co-localization with tyrosinase suggest the possible removal of deglycosylated and unfolded proteins by autophagy of the cells. There was no change in either the expression of the apoptosis marker protein Bcl-2 or the appearance of apoptotic nuclei in 1-treated cells.

The fact that nearly all B- or T-cell malignant lymphomas and leukemias have one or more rearranged antigen receptor genes provides a biologic basis for a diagnostic test. To formally analyze the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of human lymphoproliferative disease, the authors conducted a large, multiinstitutional study. Through a blinded, controlled approach, gene rearrangement analysis of 275 cases was shown to carry a high correlation with conventional phenotyping and histologic diagnosis, with only minor false-positive and false-negative rates. Significantly, no rearrangements were detected in normal lymphoid tissues or carcinomas, sarcomas, or melanomas. In a randomized study of 50 cases, laboratory results showed a high rate of interlaboratory agreement, regardless of the level of previous experience. Furthermore, the reproducibility of interpretation of data (Southern blot autoradiograms) of 192 cases showed high concordance among 11 observers from multiple laboratories. Based on these findings, the authors propose a set of guidelines for interpretation of gene rearrangement analysis that, if carefully followed, renders this a highly reproducible, safe, and accurate addition to the diagnostic regimen for human lymphoproliferative processes.",

Fixed samples of a further 10 CCS and 14 MM were investigated by means of sequencing for BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS mutations and FISH analyses for the gain of chromosomes 22 and 8. RTK analysis of all CCS/MM samples showed activation of short-form (sf) recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) RTK and of PDGFRB, MET, and HER3. Analysis of downstream signaling revealed consistent phosphorylation patterns of PI3K/AKT, RSK, and the mTOR targets S6 and 4EBP1. Analysis of frozen and fixed material from 21 CCS and 21 MM showed the presence of the V600E BRAF mutation in 2/12 EWSR1+ and 3/9 EWSR1- CCS and 9/21 MM and demonstrated a significant (P < 0.001) correlation between the gain of chromosomes 22 and 8 and EWSR1- CCS. Our results show that BRAF mutation can also be present in CCS and support the proposed aberration of chromosomes 22 and 8 as a possibly useful nonrandom hallmark of EWSR1- CCS. Besides, they broaden the spectrum of the similarities of RTK pathway activation between CCS and MM, thus suggesting that new drugs found to be active in melanoma and RON inhibitors could have a role in CCS treatment. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, there is no information available concerning its antimetastatic effect. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, is involved in many aspects of cellular processes such as proliferation, adhesion, and invasion. Studies have shown that FAK is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in melanoma. In the present study, proliferation of B16F10 cells was suppressed when exposed to various doses of galangin. Inhibition on proliferation by galangin was also detected by clonogenic survival assay. The capabilities of cell adhesion, cell spreading, and cell motility were impaired by galangin, reinforced by F-actin rearrangement. Molecular data showed that both FAK mRNA level and protein level were reduced dose-dependently. Additionally, galangin reduced phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr397) protein. Transient transfection reporter assays showed that galangin suppressed the transcription of FAK gene, indicating FAK expression is a candidate target of galangin. The antimetastatic function of galangin is further supported by the fact that it could inhibit the formation of tumor colonies in the lung tissue on C57BL/6J mouse lung metastatic model using B16F10 melanoma cells. Immunochemical analyses showed that galangin decreased FAK expression in vivo. These data add to our new understanding that galangin can inhibit B16F10 melanoma metastasis both in vivo and in vitro, and that FAK is a valid therapeutic target against melanoma.",

In this study, we investigate the rearrangement of the TCR-Vbeta as well as the junctional diversity in T cells infiltrating melanoma metastases following treatment with DNP vaccine. In 19 of 26 control specimens, V-D-J length analysis showed the expected polyclonal patterns. In contrast, postvaccine tumors from 9 of 10 patients showed dominant peaks of V-D-J junction size in one or more Vbeta families. Dominant peaks were seen most frequently in six Vbeta families (Vbeta7, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 23) and were never seen in seven others. Further analysis of the oligoclonal Vbeta products showed dominant peaks in the J region as well. Of particular interest was the finding that Vbeta and Jbeta peaks were similar in inflamed metastases obtained at different times or from different sites from the same patient. Although 6 of 10 patients expressed HLA-A1, there was no common pattern of TCR rearrangements among them. Finally, the amplified PCR products from seven of these specimens were cloned and sequenced and the amino acid sequence of the complementarity-determining region 3 was deduced. In six of seven specimens, the same complementarity-determining region 3 sequence was repeated in at least two clones and in five of seven in at least three clones.

In this study, we observed ectopic lymphoid structures, defined as lymphoid follicles comprising clusters of B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells (DC), associated with high endothelial venules (HEV) and clusters of T cells and mature DCs, in 7 of 29 cutaneous metastases from melanoma patients. Some follicles contained germinal centers. In contrast to metastatic lesions, primary melanomas did not host follicles, but many contained HEVs, suggesting an incomplete lymphoid neogenesis. Analysis of the repertoire of rearranged immunoglobulin genes in the B cells of microdissected follicles revealed clonal amplification, somatic mutation and isotype switching, indicating a local antigen-driven B-cell response. Surprisingly, IgA responses were observed despite the nonmucosal location of the follicles.

Following hormone or ultraviolet (UV) light stimulation, the melanin pigments contained in melanocytes are transferred through the dendrites to the surrounding keratinocytes to protect against UV light damage or carcinogenesis. This has been considered as a morphological indicator of melanocytes and melanoma cells. Small GTPases of the Rho family have been implicated in the regulation of actin reorganization underlying dendrite formation in melanocytes and melanoma cells. It has been proven that ultraviolet light plays a pivotal role in melanocyte dendrite formation; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process has not been fully elucidated. The effect of small GTPases, such as Rac1 and RhoA, on the morphology of B16 melanoma cells treated with narrow-band UVB radiation was investigated. The morphological changes were observed under a phase contrast microscope and the F-actin microfilament of the cytoskeleton was observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope. The pull-down assay was performed to detect the activity of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. The morphological changes were evident, with globular cell bodies and increased numbers of tree branch-like dendrites. The cytoskeletal F-actin appeared disassembled following narrow-band UVB irradiation of B16 melanoma cells. Treatment of B16 melanoma cells with narrow-band UVB radiation resulted in the activation of Rac1 in a time-dependent manner.

This study determined chromosomal anomalies from peripheral blood samples on 30 patients with melanoma and on 23 control subjects using conventional cytogenetics (G Banded), where a high incidence in numerical anomalies and a low incidence in recurrent structural rearrangements were observed. Chromosomic losses were prevalent in all the tumor stages studied. The analysis showed that the chromosomes X, 9 and 17 were mainly affected. Among the numerical anomalies, monosomies in X and 17 chromosomes, as well as trisomies formed by a marker chromosome, were the most common in both early and late stages of the disease. Deletions and chromosomal crossovers appeared to be as isolated anomalies. In the control group no anomaly was identified, and a low percentage of fragility was observed when compared with the patients group. A high frequency in chromosomal anomalies was observed in patients, in contrast with the control subjects. This suggests the existence of heterogeneity and genetic predisposition during the illness development. To further research, these must be analyzed and validated as possible sources of molecular markers, which could be of use for the early diagnosis, treatment and follow up of the disease.",

The cells may be fractionated by Percoll gradient centrifugation into several subpopulations (A, B, and C) with different characteristics. Subpopulation A is the slowest growing, and most of the DNA-synthesizing cells are concentrated in fractions B and C. Every subpopulation expresses S 100 and cytokeratin intermediate filaments, whereas only subpopulation B and C express GD2 and GD3. Pigmented cells are concentrated mainly in subpopulation C.

Data were obtained using billing records for Current Procedural Terminology diagnosis codes. RVUs were used to quantify the value added to each practice from these closures.

Other prognostic features, however, which are not yet used in daily practice, might add important information and thus improve prognosis, treatment, and survival. Therefore a search for new markers is desirable. Previous studies have demonstrated that fractal characteristics of nuclear chromatin are of prognostic importance in neoplasias. We have therefore investigated whether the fractal dimension of nuclear chromatin measured in routine histological preparations of malignant melanomas could be a prognostic factor for survival.;We examined 71 primary superficial spreading cutaneous melanoma specimens (thickness > or = 1 mm) from patients with a minimum follow up of 5 years. Nuclear area, form factor and fractal dimension of chromatin texture were obtained from digitalized images of hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue micro array sections. Clark's level, tumor thickness and mitotic rate were also determined.;The median follow-up was 104 months. Tumor thickness, Clark's level, mitotic rate, nuclear area and fractal dimension were significant risk factors in univariate Cox regressions. In the multivariate Cox regression, stratified for the presence or absence of metastases at diagnosis, only the Clark level and fractal dimension of the nuclear chromatin were included as independent prognostic factors in the final regression model.;In general, a more aggressive behaviour is usually found in genetically unstable neoplasias with a higher number of genetic or epigenetic changes, which on the other hand, provoke a more complex chromatin rearrangement. The increased nuclear fractal dimension found in the more aggressive melanomas is the mathematical equivalent of a higher complexity of the chromatin architecture. So, there is strong evidence that the fractal dimension of the nuclear chromatin texture is a new and promising variable in prognostic models of malignant melanomas.",

The prevalence of the BRAF(V599E) mutation in PTC is the highest reported to date in human carcinomas, being only exceeded by melanoma.

The reported immunophenotype of SEF is nonspecific. Some SEF cases show morphologic and molecular overlap with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), suggesting a relationship between these tumor types. MUC4 has recently been identified as a sensitive and specific marker for LGFMS; MUC4 expression was also observed in 2 tumors with hybrid features of SEF and LGFMS. We investigated MUC4 expression in SEF and other epithelioid soft tissue tumors to determine (1) the potential diagnostic utility of MUC4 for SEF and (2) the association between MUC4 expression and FUS rearrangement in SEF. Whole sections of 180 tumors were evaluated: 41 cases of SEF (including 29 \"pure\" SEF and 12 hybrid LGFMS-SEF), 20 epithelioid sarcomas, 11 clear cell sarcomas, 11 metastatic melanomas, 10 perivascular epithelioid cell tumors, 10 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 10 epithelioid angiosarcomas, 10 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, 10 epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 10 myoepithelial carcinomas, 17 ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, 10 leiomyosarcomas, and 10 biphasic synovial sarcomas. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed after antigen retrieval using a mouse anti-MUC4 monoclonal antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 33 SEF cases using FUS break-apart probes. A subset of cases was also evaluated for EWSR1 and CREB3L2/L1 rearrangements by FISH. Strong diffuse cytoplasmic staining for MUC4 was observed in 32 of 41 (78%) cases of SEF, including all 12 hybrid tumors. FUS rearrangement was detected in 8 of 21 (38%) MUC4-positive cases of SEF with successful FISH studies. The prevalence of FUS rearrangement was similar in hybrid LGFMS-SEF (2 of 6; 33%) and SEF without an LGFMS component (6 of 15; 40%). FUS rearrangement was not detected in any cases of MUC4-negative SEF. Two hybrid tumors had both EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements. MUC4 expression was also seen in 9 of 10 (90%) biphasic synovial sarcomas, predominantly in the glandular component. All other tumor types were negative for MUC4, apart from focal reactivity in 5 ossifying fibromyxoid tumors, 2 epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 1 myoepithelial carcinoma. MUC4 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for SEF among epithelioid soft tissue tumors. MUC4 expression occurs more frequently than FUS rearrangement in SEF. The finding of EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements in 2 cases of hybrid LGFMS-SEF suggests that SEFs are genetically heterogenous. MUC4-positive SEFs with FUS rearrangement are likely closely related to LGFMS. MUC4-positive SEFs that lack FUS rearrangement may be related to LGFMS but could have alternate fusion partners, including EWSR1. SEF without MUC4 expression may represent a distinct group of tumors. MUC4 expression correlates with glandular epithelial differentiation in biphasic synovial sarcoma and is very limited in other epithelioid soft tissue tumors.",

The main goal of this study was to examine the effects of recombinant lumican on actin organization, the state of actin polymerization, actin isoform expression, and their sub-cellular distribution in the A375 human melanoma cell line.;Fluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to observe actin cytoskeletal organization and the sub-cellular distribution of cytoplasmic beta- and gamma-actins. The ability of actin to inhibit DNaseI activity was used to quantify actin. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the expression levels of the actin isoforms.;A375 cells grown on lumican coatings changed in morphology and presented rearranged actin filament organization: from filaments evenly spread throughout the whole cell body to their condensed sub-membrane localization. In the presence of lumican, both actin isoforms were concentrated under the cellular membrane. A statistically significant increase in the total, filamentous, and monomeric actin pools was observed in A375 cells grown on lumican.;Novel biological effects of lumican, an extracellular matrix SLRP, on the actin pool and organization are identified, which may extend our understanding of the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of lumican on the migration of melanoma cells.",

Evaluation of this revealed the cause to be massive myelopoiesis due to ectopic granulocyte/ colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production by the melanoma cells. Because of these observations linking G-CSF expression with metastasis of human melanoma, we decided to investigate the mechanism of this ectopic production. No gross amplification or rearrangement of the G-CSF gene could be detected as the basis for the increased transcriptional activity in any of these lines. Human-human somatic cell hybridization studies carried out between the metastatic C8161 and several different nonmetastatic non-G-CSF-expressing lines revealed, in addition to metastatic dominance, 3- to 10-fold enhancement of G-CSF transcription and expression in the fusions compared with C8161 itself. The suggestion of a trans-dominant mechanism was further supported by transfection studies with a human G-CSF promoter-CAT-reporter construct, which revealed 3- to 5-fold increased reporter activity in only those melanoma lines and hybrids expressing G-CSF. Furthermore, no obvious autocrine or paracrine effects of this ectopic G-CSF expression on the melanoma lines' growth or metastasis were apparent, as all of the G-CSF-expressing lines lacked the G-CSF receptor and injections of purified recombinant G-CSF exerted no stimulatory effects on their tumorigenicity, latency, growth, or metastasis in Scid mice. Thus, we advance the hypothesis that G-CSF expression is serving as a marker of a more generalized trans-dominant pathway linked to tumor progression and metastasis. This hypothesis has direct relevance to many human cancers where ectopic hormone or growth factor production occurs with no obvious autocrine or paracrine benefit to the tumor.",

Melanomas are characterized by recurring chromosome alterations, and it is important to identify those genes whose altered expression may be causally related to melanocytic transformation. This short report presents an overview of strategies used which combine the materials and technologies of the Human Genome Project with clinically directed studies of melanoma biology. The Human Genome Project combines various technologies, including cytogenetic, physical mapping, genetic mapping and DNA sequencing, in order to identify all of the human genes, but especially the 4000 estimated to contribute to human disease. This report focuses first on advances in genome technology that provide information on chromosome rearrangements and DNA copy number changes. This includes a discussion of chromosome microdissection as well as the microexcision of tissue specimens to gain insights into chromosome regions altered in association with melanocyte transformation. Next, there is a brief discussion of the generation and characterization of subtracted cDNA sublibraries which allow the identification of genes uniquely expressed in association with the transformed phenotype of human melanoma cells. Finally, we briefly discuss the feasibility of using a recently developed system for parallel examination of multiple genes based upon robotic printing of cDNAs on glass slides, and simultaneous two-colour fluorescence hybridization to study the expression patterns of cDNAs for their association with melanoma tumour suppression. The combination of these varied molecular technologies may provide insights into previously unrecognized genes involved causally in the pathobiology of this important neoplasm, and may provide new targets for clinical intervention.",

Herein we have extended these studies to the effects of ODAM on cultured melanoma cell lines.;The A375 and C8161 melanoma cell lines were stably transfected with ODAM and assayed for properties associated with tumorigenicity including cell growth, motility, and extracellular matrix adhesion. In addition, ODAM-transfected cells were assayed for signal transduction via AKT which promotes cell proliferation and survival in many neoplasms.;ODAM expression in A375 and C8161 cells strongly inhibited cell growth and motility in vitro, increased cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, and yielded significant cytoskeletal/morphologic rearrangement. Furthermore, AKT activity was downregulated by ODAM expression while an increase was noted in expression of the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor gene, an antagonist of AKT activation. Increased PTEN in ODAM-expressing cells was associated with increases in PTEN mRNA levels and de novo protein synthesis. Silencing of PTEN expression yielded recovery of AKT activity in ODAM-expressing melanoma cells. Similar PTEN elevation and inhibition of AKT by ODAM was observed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells while ODAM expression had no effect in PTEN-deficient BT-549 breast cancer cells.;The apparent anti-neoplastic effects of ODAM in cultured melanoma and breast cancer cells are associated with increased PTEN expression, and suppression of AKT activity.

Somatic mutations of BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene were recently found in MM as well as in uveal melanoma and kidney cancer among the Caucasian and Japanese people. However, frequency of mutations varies among the reported studies, which might be due to presence of undetected gross rearrangements of BAP1 gene that might escape detection by sequencing strategy. We investigated the presence and frequency of gross genomic rearrangements in the BAP1 gene by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 17 Japanese cases of MM tumors. We found five tumors with partial deletion of BAP1 gene; each tumors displayed partial deletion of exons 1-4 (MM39), exons 1-5 (MM48), exons 11-17 (MM57), exons 1-15 (MM19) and exons 1-16 (MM21). Two tumors (MM34, MM14) had biallelic deletion and four tumors (MM29, MM35, MM45 and MM56) had monoallelic deletion of entire BAP1 gene. Therefore, MLPA analysis revealed large gene rearrangements of BAP1 gene in 65% of MM (11/17). Unusually high frequency of large deletions indicates that the 3p21 chromosomal region surrounding BAP1 gene is structurally unstable. MLPA was useful in characterizing both monoallelic and biallelic deletion of BAP1 gene precisely at exon level. ",

Human melanoma cells may escape immune recognition by a variety of means, including global or allelic down-regulation of MHC class I molecules. Stable MHC class I cell surface expression requires delivery of cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum by the peptide transporter molecules TAP1 and TAP2, with peptides subsequently transported to the cell surface in complexes containing MHC class I heavy chain and beta2-microglobulin. We have evaluated a series of mechanisms resulting in MHC class I down-regulation in a human melanoma cell line, Mz18, typed as HLA-A2(+), A3(+), B7(+), B57(+), Cw1(+), and Cw6(+) by genomic PCR analysis. The melanoma cell line Mz18 exhibits a global down-regulation of MHC class I heavy chain transcripts; beta2-microglobulin; the proteasome subunits LMP2/7, involved in generating cytosolic peptide fragments; and the peptide transporter molecules TAP1 and TAP2, involved in peptide transport from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum. IFN-gamma treatment of Mz18 melanoma cells leads to up-regulation of LMP2/7 and TAP1/2, as well as to up-regulation of HLA-B and HLA-C MHC loci alleles, but not HLA-A2 or HLA-A3. Karyotypic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome 6 and MHC class I-specific probes showed complex rearrangement of one chromosome 6 involving the MHC class I locus on 6p and translocation of 6q to the long arm of chromosome 19. To evaluate the capability of melanoma Mz18 to present tumor-specific peptides to HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific CTLs, we restored HLA-A2 surface expression by retroviral-mediated transfer of functional HLA-A2 cDNA. Melanoma peptides could only be presented and recognized by CTLs if the HLA-A2-transfected Mz18 cell line was first treated with IFN-gamma, thereby restoring LMP2/7 and TAP1/2 expression and function. Because several melanoma antigens recognized by T cells have been reported to be presented by HLA-A2 (MART-1/Melan-A, tyrosinase, gp100, and MAGE-3), the loss of HLA-A2 molecules may represent an important mechanism by which many melanomas evade immune recognition. These findings suggest that patients entering clinical trials for immunotherapy with melanoma vaccines should be carefully examined for tumor cell allelic MHC class I loss and whether such MHC class I antigen down-regulation can be restored by cytokines.",

We compared WBRT with WBRT plus vandetanib in the treatment of patients with melanoma brain metastases.;In this double-blind, multi-centre, phase 2 trial patients with melanoma brain metastases were randomised to receive WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) plus 3 weeks of concurrent vandetanib 100 mg once daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in brain (PFS brain). The main study was preceded by a safety run-in phase to confirm tolerability of the combination. A post-hoc analysis and literature review considered barriers to recruiting patients with melanoma brain metastases to clinical trials.;Twenty-four patients were recruited, six to the safety phase and 18 to the randomised phase. The study closed early due to poor recruitment. Median PFS brain was 3.3 months (90% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-5.6) in the vandetanib group and 2.5 months (90% CI: 0.2-4.8) in the placebo group (P=0.34). Median overall survival (OS) was 4.6 months (90% CI: 1.6-6.3) and 2.5 months (90% CI: 0.2-7.2), respectively (P=0.54). The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, alopecia, confusion and nausea. The most common barrier to study recruitment was availability of alternative treatments.;The combination of WBRT plus vandetanib was well tolerated.

Cyclic AMP assays revealed that cell flattening and the increase in adhesive properties caused by BUdR is not accompanied by an increase in the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP. However, electron micrographs of cells grown in the presence of BUdR show a striking increase in the number of organized microtubules and microfilaments. Colchicine binding revealed no difference in the amount of tubulin present in untreated or BUdR-treated cells indicating that the increase in the number of microtubules is due to the polymerization of pre-existing tubulin subunits.

        "Doc_abstract":"Histopathological evaluation of melanocytic tumours usually allows reliable distinction of benign melanocytic naevi from melanoma. More difficult is the histopathological classification of Spitz tumours, a heterogeneous group of tumours composed of large epithelioid or spindle-shaped melanocytes. Spitz tumours are biologically distinct from conventional melanocytic naevi and melanoma, as exemplified by their distinct patterns of genetic aberrations. Whereas common acquired naevi and melanoma often harbour BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or inactivation of NF1, Spitz tumours show HRAS mutations, inactivation of BAP1 (often combined with BRAF mutations), or genomic rearrangements involving the kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, BRAF, RET, and MET. In Spitz naevi, which lack significant histological atypia, all of these mitogenic driver aberrations trigger rapid cell proliferation, but after an initial growth phase, various tumour suppressive mechanisms stably block further growth. In some tumours, additional genomic aberrations may abrogate various tumour suppressive mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, telomere shortening, or DNA damage response. The melanocytes then start to grow in a less organised fashion and may spread to regional lymph nodes, and are termed atypical Spitz tumours. Upon acquisition of even more aberrations, which often activate additional oncogenic pathways or alter cell differentiation, the neoplastic cells become entirely malignant and may colonise and take over distant organs (spitzoid melanoma). The sequential acquisition of genomic aberrations suggests that Spitz tumours represent a continuous biological spectrum, rather than a dichotomy of benign versus malignant, and that tumours with ambiguous histological features (atypical Spitz tumours) might be best classified as low-grade melanocytic tumours. The number of genetic aberrations usually correlates with the degree of histological atypia and explains why existing ancillary genetic techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), are usually capable of accurately classifying histologically benign and malignant Spitz tumours, but are not very helpful in the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Nevertheless, we expect that progress in our understanding of tumour progression will refine the classification of spitzoid melanocytic tumours in the near future. By integrating clinical, pathological, and genetic criteria, distinct tumour subsets will be defined within the heterogeneous group of Spitz tumours, which will eventually lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

Agents known to promote differentiation, such as retinoic acid, butyrate, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, induce marked alterations in cell shape which are often accompanied by changes in cell functions. In this paper we study the effects of the differentiating polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on cytoskeleton, adhesion, and growth properties of cultured mouse B16 melanoma cells. DMSO induced a progressive reorganization of the cytoskeleton which was fully developed in 4 days of continuous exposure to the agent. DMSO-treated cells developed thick and regularly oriented microfilament bundles of the stress fiber type ending at vinculin-rich areas of focal contact between the ventral membrane and the substratum (interference reflection microscopy-dark adhesion plaques). Such a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton resulted in increased adhesion to the substratum and inhibition of cell growth in comparison to control untreated cells. Cells which became highly flattened and tightly adherent after exposure to DMSO for 4 days progressively reverted their phenotype to that of control untreated cells within 3 days of DMSO withdrawal. Namely, they lost stress fibers and adhesion plaques, became rounded and less adherent, and increased their growth rate. These results indicate that DMSO can change the transformed appearance of B16 mouse melanoma cells to a phenotype which is typical of a variety of nontransformed cells in culture.",

Although modest, this difference is statistically significant both by t-test (P=0.049) and after adjustment for covariates of age, gender, and cigarette smoking by regression analysis (P=0.001).

Furthermore, analyses of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement patterns revealed hprt mutants originating from the same in vivo clone in both peripheral blood and a tumor-bearing node. The finding of elevated hprt MFs not entirely explained by genotoxic therapies in patients compared to controls can be explained either by hypermutability or in vivo T-cell activation. The similar MFs in peripheral blood and tumor bearing lymph nodes, as well as the finding of mutant representatives of the same in vivo T-cell clone in both locations, support monitoring peripheral blood to detect events in the nodes. If in vivo proliferation accounts for the current findings, the hprt deficient (hprt-) mutant fraction in blood may be enriched for T-cells that mediate the host immune response against malignant melanoma. Further studies will characterize the functional reactivity of hprt mutant isolates against melanoma-related antigens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The mechanism of action of fotemustine, a relatively new chloroethylnitrosourea, was evaluated in human melanoma cells in order to assess its potential as an agent for hyperthermic limb perfusion. Fotemustine was more toxic to O6-alkylguanine methyl transferase (AGT) deficient (Mer-) cells than Mer+ cells, implicating AGT as a major determinant of resistance. Mer+ cells derived from Mer- cell lines following exposure to the monofunctional alkylating metabolite of dacarbazine (DTIC) were also resistant to fotemustine. Mer status did not influence the replication of fotemustine-damaged adenovirus 5, whereas virus treated with the monofunctional alkylating agent N-methyl-N1-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was replicated much more efficiently by Mer+ cells. This suggests that the initial O6-alkylated product, if not immediately repaired, rearranges to form DNA crosslinks which cannot be repaired by AGT. Replication of a control virus was not affected by treating the cells with fotemustine, indicating that the drug acted primarily on DNA rather than at epigenetic levels. Fotemustine generally produced a G2-M block in the cell cycle, most strikingly in Mer- cells at low, minimally toxic concentrations; MNNG and high doses of fotemustine induced S phase arrest. Concurrent hyperthermia (41.5 degrees C for 1 h) increased the toxicity of fotemustine in some cell lines. Fotemustine decomposed in culture medium in two phases; the first was complete within 5 min and was most marked in Mer+ cells. The results suggest that fotemustine may be suitable for isolated limb perfusion in melanoma, with the potential for overcoming resistance by including inhibitors of AGT.",

We tested this hypothesis in a human tumour spontaneous metastasis model, using six clones and variants isolated from the parental poorly metastatic M4Be melanoma cell line, and expressing various metastatic abilities. The spontaneous rates of mutation to ouabain resistance measured in these cells by Luria and Delbrück fluctuation analysis correlated with the metastatic ability of the cells: moderately and highly metastatic cells showed spontaneous mutation rates 10 to 50 times higher than those of poorly metastatic cells. Genomic instability at the chromosome level was assessed by searching for accumulated structural abnormalities in the moderately and highly metastatic cell lines. All the cell lines appeared hypertriploid, and showed comparable modal numbers and great chromosome dispersion. Unstable DNA amplification in the form of double minute chromosomes was shown in one of the four poorly metastatic cell lines, and in a significantly higher proportion of the cells of two of the three metastatic cell lines. Abnormal chromosomes were demonstrated in all cell lines, with markers involving specific rearrangements of chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 and 15, as frequently observed in human melanoma cells. Clonal markers were present in all cell lines, documenting the common origin of all variants and clones, and specific marker amplification was noticed in highly metastatic cells compared to poorly metastatic lines.

Therefore, it has been discussed as a tumor marker. However, systematic in vivo analyses of the functional relevance of L-plastin for tumor cell metastasis were so far lacking.;We investigated the relevance of L-plastin expression and phosphorylation by ectopical expression of L-plastin in human melanoma cells (MV3) and knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in prostate cancer (PC3M). The growth and metastatic potential of tumor cells expressing no L-plastin, phosphorylatable or non-phosphorylatable L-plastin was analyzed in a preclinical mouse model after subcutaneous and intracardial injection of the tumor cells.;Knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in human prostate carcinoma cells led to reduced tumor cell growth and metastasis. Vice versa, and in line with these findings, ectopic expression of L-plastin in L-plastin negative melanoma cells significantly increased the number of metastases. Strikingly, the metastasis promoting effect of L-plastin was not observed if a non-phosphorylatable L-plastin mutant was expressed.;Our data provide the first in vivo evidence that expression of L-plastin promotes tumor metastasis and, importantly, that this effect depends on an additionally required phosphorylation of L-plastin.

However, Top2-based chemotherapy has been associated with higher incidences of secondary malignancies, notably the development of acute myeloid leukemia in VP-16-treated patients. This association is suggestive of a link between carcinogenesis and Top2-mediated DNA damage. We show here that VP-16-induced carcinogenesis involves mainly the beta rather than the alpha isozyme of Top2. In a mouse skin carcinogenesis model, the incidence of VP-16-induced melanomas in the skin of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-treated mice is found to be significantly higher in TOP2beta(+) than in skin-specific top2beta-knockout mice. Furthermore, VP-16-induced DNA sequence rearrangements and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are found to be Top2beta-dependent and preventable by cotreatment with a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting the importance of proteasomal degradation of the Top2beta-DNA cleavage complexes in VP-16-induced DNA sequence rearrangements. VP-16 cytotoxicity in transformed cells expressing both Top2 isozymes is, however, found to be primarily Top2alpha-dependent.

The analysis was validated by genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR) on an extended set of cases (n = 64) and the results were correlated with the clinical outcome. To investigate TrkA molecular pathways and cellular function, we generated inducible activation of the NGF-TrkA signaling in human MM cell lines.;We identified amplification of 1q23.1, where the TrkA locus resides, as a candidate hotspot implicated in the progression of MM. Across 40 amplicons detected, segmental amplification of 1q23.1 showed the strongest association with tumor thickness. By validation of the analysis, TrkA gene amplification emerged as a frequent event in primary melanomas (50 % of patients), and correlated with worse clinical outcome. However, experiments in cell lines revealed that induction of the NGF-TrkA signaling produced a phenotype of dramatic suppression of cell proliferation through inhibition of cell division and pronounced intracellular vacuolization, in a way straightly dependent on NGF activation of TrkA. These events were triggered via MAPK activity but not via AKT, and involved p21(cip1) protein increase, compatibly with a mechanism of oncogene-induced growth arrest.;Taken together, our findings point to TrkA as a candidate oncogene in MM and support a model in which the NGF-TrkA-MAPK pathway may mediate a trade-off between neoplastic transformation and adaptive anti-proliferative response.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Altered expression of beta-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, is involved in a variety of cancers because increased levels of beta-catenin protein are frequently associated with enhanced cellular proliferation. Although our previous study demonstrated that gene silencing of beta-catenin in melanoma B16-BL6 cells by plasmid DNA (pDNA) expressing short-hairpin RNA targeting the gene (pshbeta-catenin) markedly suppressed their growth in vivo, gene silencing of beta-catenin could promote tumor metastasis by the rearranging cell adhesion complex. In this study, we investigated how silencing of beta-catenin affects metastatic aspects of melanoma cells. Transfection of B16-BL6 cells with pshbeta-catenin significantly reduced the amount of cadherin protein, a cell adhesion molecule binding to beta-catenin, with little change in its mRNA level. Cadherin-derived fragments were detected in culture media of B16-BL6 cells transfected with pshbeta-catenin, suggesting that cadherin is shed from the cell surface when the expression of beta-catenin is reduced. The mobility of B16-BL6 cells transfected with pshbeta-catenin was greater than that of cells transfected with any of the control pDNAs. B16-BL6 cells stably transfected with pshbeta-catenin (B16/pshbeta-catenin) formed less or an equal number of tumor nodules in the lung than cells stably transfected with other plasmids when injected into mice via the tail vein. However, when subcutaneously inoculated, B16/pshbeta-catenin cells formed more nodules in the lung than the other stably transfected cells. These results raise concerns about the gene silencing of beta-catenin for inhibiting tumor growth, because it promotes tumor metastasis by reducing the amount of cadherin in tumor cells.",

One line each was established from the first two cases. Lines III and IV were established from two different methyl cellulose colonies derived from the primary tumor of case 3; line III was from a non-pigmented and line IV from a pigmented colony. Cloning of line IV resulted in two highly malignant (IV Cl 1 and IV Cl 3) and one less malignant (IV Cl 2) clone. Clone IV Cl 1 was inoculated intracardially in nude mice and gave rise to adrenal and brain metastases. Lines V and VI were derived from such metastases. Multiple structural and/or numerical chromosome abnormalities were detected in all lines. Line I had 57-61 chromosomes, with structural changes affecting 1p, 2p, 3q, 7p, 7q, 11p, 14q, 17q, and 22q, as well as one unidentified marker. Line II had 40-48 chromosomes, with structural changes of 1p, 1q, 4q, 5p, 6p, 8p, 11p, 11q, 14p, 20p, and two unidentified markers. Line III had 45 chromosomes, 6q+, del(11p), and a centric fusion between chromosomes 14 and 15. Line IV had 45-46 chromosomes. The clonal changes included rearrangements of 1p, 9p, 11p, and the centric fusion of chromosomes 14 and 15. Line V was pseudodiploid and contained aberrations of 1p, 9p, 11p, 14q, 20q, an isochromosome for 21q, and an unidentified marker.

Although no single identical aberration was shared by all six lines, structural abnormalities of 11p were invariably present and, hence, might constitute a common cytogenetic feature in melanoma development.

        "Doc_abstract":"Due to a variety of known and unknown control mechanisms, the human genome is remarkably stable when compared to most other species. The long latency periods of most solid tumors, during which the cell undergoes malignant transformation, are presumably due to this stability. The molecular basis responsible for the induction of genetic instability and the resultant biological characteristics manifest in tumor populations is not well understood. The discovery of both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, however, has placed the phenomenon of human genome stability on a more solid conceptual footing. These types of genes clearly place multiple barriers to oncogenic transformation, and traversing these barriers apparently requires both time and the accumulation of genetic defects that cannot be corrected. The evolution of neoplasias can, therefore, be predicted to be due to: (1) consistent and progressive loss of tumor suppressor genes; (2) gene amplification, resulting in the over-expression of proteins that aid in tumor progression; (3) gene mutation, which alters the orderly biochemistry of the normal cell; (4) genes that allow a cell like the melanocyte to escape the confining nature of the epidermis and to invade through the dermis into the circulatory and lymphatic systems in order to disseminate itself to other organs (e.g., proteolytic enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, integrins, metastases genes, chemotactic factors etc.); (5) factors, perhaps such as TGF beta 2, that may impact negatively on MHC antigens and confuse host defense mechanisms; and (6) S.O.S.-type genes, which may be expressed as a direct response to the accumulating damage in an attempt to correct the damage, but that may then become part of the problem instead of the solution. The extraordinary plasticity and instability of the genome of a melanoma cell suggests an inordinate amount of genetic flux. In addition to activating and inactivating various genes, this constant shuffling and rearranging of the genome in neoplasms such as MM may be constantly altering gene dose. Cytogenetic and molecular biological studies have been the Rosetta stone for understanding the etiological relevant genetic events in human cancers. Genetic alterations fundamental to the pathology of MM have begun to be defined. Studies designed to understand these perturbations at the biochemical and organismic level are underway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

These receptors play important roles in various physiological processes. Matrixmetallo-proteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) components in physiological conditions. MMPs can degrade all structural components of the ECM, which is one of the critical aspects of tumor cell invasion. The role of matrilysin (MMP-7) in the progression of various carcinomas was recently addressed. Evidence of interplay between integrin function and ECM matrix integrity has come from experiments showing that integrin-ECM contacts can regulate expression and function of MMPs. In this communication, we report on an interesting interrelationship between cell surface alpha5beta1 integrin (fibronectin receptor) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-7).;The zymographic analysis showed that ligation of cell surface alpha5beta1 integrin by alpha5 monoclonal antibody leads to the expression and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-7 in B16F10 melanoma cells. The immunoblot confirmed the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in B16F10 cells grown in presence of alpha5 monoclonal antibody, indicating the transduction of signal via FAK. The immunocytochemical study demonstrated that alpha5beta1 integrin stimulation causes rearrangement of actin fibers and its accumulation in focal adhesion sites.;alpha5beta1 integrin-induced expression and activation of MMP-2 and -7 indicates the role of tumor cell surface integrin receptor in the modulation of MMPs and, thereby, the invasive property of tumor cells.",

RT in situ PCR for TCR beta expression with CD3 co-labeling demonstrated which of these lesions was a B-cell-rich T-cell lymphoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"There have been significant advances with regard to BRAF-targeted therapies against metastatic melanoma. However, the majority of patients receiving BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) manifest disease progression within a year. We have recently shown that melanoma patients treated with BRAFi exhibit an increase in melanoma-associated antigens and in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in response to therapy. To characterize such a T-cell infiltrate, we analyzed the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) β chain-coding genes in tumor biopsies obtained before the initiation of BRAFi and 10-14 d later. We observed an increase in the clonality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of 8 patients receiving BRAFi, with a statistically significant 21% aggregate increase in clonality. Over 80% of individual T-cell clones detected after initiation of BRAFi treatment were new clones. Interestingly, the comparison of tumor infiltrates with clinical responses revealed that patients who had a high proportion of pre-existing dominant clones after the administration of BRAFi responded better to therapy than patients who had a low proportion of such pre-existing dominant clones following BRAFi. These data suggest that although the inhibition of BRAF in melanoma patients results in tumor infiltration by new lymphocytes, the response to treatment appears to be related to the presence of a pre-existing population of tumor-infiltrating T-cell clones.",

PRL-activated Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) phosphorylates the p21-activated serine-threonine kinase (PAK)1 and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adapter protein SH2B1β. SH2B1β is an actin-binding protein that cross-links actin filaments, whereas PAK1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton by different mechanisms, including direct phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNa). Here, we have used a FLNa-deficient human melanoma cell line (M2) and its derivative line (A7) that stably expresses FLNa to demonstrate that SH2B1β and FLNa are required for maximal PRL-dependent cell ruffling. We have found that in addition to two actin-binding domains, SH2B1β has a FLNa-binding domain (amino acids 200-260) that binds directly to repeats 17-23 of FLNa. The SH2B1β-FLNa interaction participates in PRL-dependent actin rearrangement. We also show that phosphorylation of the three tyrosines of PAK1 by JAK2, as well as the presence of FLNa, play a role in PRL-dependent cell ruffling. Finally, we show that the actin- and FLNa-binding-deficient mutant of SH2B1β (SH2B1β 3Δ) abolished PRL-dependent ruffling and PRL-dependent cell migration when expressed along with PAK1 Y3F (JAK2 tyrosyl-phosphorylation-deficient mutant). Together, these data provide insight into a novel mechanism of PRL-stimulated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility via JAK2 signaling through FLNa, PAK1, and SH2B1β. We propose a model for PRL-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton that integrates our findings with previous studies.",

More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

DNAs were extracted from blood and tumor samples from 21 BCC, 7 SCC, 11 MM and 7 lesions. Banding patterns were obtained by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and specific D9S50 and D9S52 microsatellites (9p21). D9S50 patterns revealed microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 36% BCC, 25% SCC, and 57% MM tumors. D9S52 microsatellite showed 28.5%; 42.8%; and 71.4% altered tumors, respectively. No microsatellite alterations were found in MN and AK. On the other hand, genomic rearrangements detected by RAPD were present in 100% tumors. In BCC, the mean number of tumor DNA alterations showed predominant gain of bands. On the contrary, MM samples presented loss, or decreased intensity signal of RAPD bands. Genome alterations in skin cancers would result from chromosomal rearrangements, aneuploidy and/or polysomies. The low-cost and quick RAPD technique may reveal unknown genes or DNA sequences associated with tumor development and progression, and may be easily implemented in clinical diagnosis.",

Here, we describe the identification of a novel melanoma antigen recognized by an human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR1-restricted CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)1363 using a genetic cloning approach. DNA sequencing analysis indicated that this was a fusion gene generated by a low density lipid receptor (LDLR) gene in the 5' end fused to a GDP-L-fucose:beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (FUT) in an antisense orientation in the 3' end. The fusion gene encoded the first five ligand binding repeats of LDLR in the NH2 terminus followed by a new polypeptide translated in frame with LDLR from the FUT gene in an antisense direction. Southern blot analysis showed that chromosomal DNA rearrangements occurred in the 1363mel cell line. Northern blot analysis detected two fusion RNA transcripts present only in the autologous 1363mel, but not in other cell lines or normal tissues tested. Two minimal peptides were identified from the COOH terminus of the fusion protein.

Naturally occurring melanins from cephalopod ink and B16 mouse melanoma were found to be much more similar to melanins prepared in the presence of metal ions than to standard melanins prepared in the absence of metal ions.

We also investigate the contribution of NO to the formation of skin melanoma in mice.;Similar to the TOP2-targeting drug, etoposide (VP-16), the NO-donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), induces skin melanomas formation in 7,12-dimethyl- benz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. To explore the mechanism(s) underlying this NO-induced tumorigenesis, we use a co-culture model system to demonstrate that inflamed macrophages with inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression cause γ-H2AX activation, p53 phosphorylation, and chromosome DNA breaks in the target cells. Inhibitor experiments revealed that NO and TOP2 isozymes are responsible for the above described cellular phenotypes. Notably, NO, unlike VP-16, preferentially induces the formation of TOP2β cleavable complexes (TOP2βcc) in cells. Moreover, GSNO induced TOP2-dependent DNA sequence rearrangements and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the incidences of GSNO- and VP-16-induced skin melanomas were also observed to be lower in the skin-specific top2β-knockout mice.

CCS is sometimes confused with other types of melanoma because of its melanocytic differentiation. Although BRAF and KIT mutations are well-known melanocytic tumour-promoting mutations frequently found in cutaneous melanoma, they are rare or absent in CCS. We present two cases of CCS with different clinical and genetic features. Both female patients, aged 25 and 20 years, presented with a palpable nodule on a lower extremity. Biopsies of both tumours revealed features diagnostic of CCS. Each tumour cell was positive for S100 protein and HMB-45. However, one patient's tumour was localized to the dermis, with many multinucleated giant cells, whereas the other was located in the deep subcutaneous fat layer near bone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of a characteristic Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein (EWSR)1 gene rearrangement in both cases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR product revealed an EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 type 1 fusion transcript in both cases. In addition, we detected BRAF mutation in the dermal type and KIT mutation in the subcutaneous type. It is of interest that the BRAF and KIT mutations are known to be very rare in CCS.

To examine this issue, highly specific oligoclonal MHC class I-restricted cytolytic TIL grown in bulk culture from patient 397 were used to immunoselect a TIL-resistant variant tumor from the autologous cultured melanoma line 397-mel. Four cycles of immunoselection produced tumor 397-R4, a variant completely resistant to 397 TIL but not to allogeneic LAK cell lysis in 4-h 51Cr release assays. By flow microfluorometry analysis, this tumor variant had not lost MHC molecules, adhesion molecules, or a variety of tumor-associated Ag expressed by the parent tumor but showed decreased expression of many Ag examined. Failure of 397-R4 to cold target inhibit TIL lysis of 397-mel suggested that cell-surface modification was at least one mechanism causing TIL resistance. The inherent lysability of 397-R4 was equal to 397-mel, as confirmed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, lysis by non-MHC restricted allogeneic TIL, and lysis by a second line of 397 TIL grown independently from tumor 397. Treatment of 397-R4 with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, +/- TNF-alpha for 72 h before cytolytic assays enhanced TIL lysis of this target slightly, and enhanced surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. The resistant phenotype of 397-R4 was evident in all clones of 397-R4 examined and has been maintained in serial culture for over 13 mo and through passage in nude mice, suggesting that such stable tumor variants may provide an in vivo escape mechanism from specific immune reagents such as TIL. Evolving patterns of TIL culture clonality over time, as well as the spontaneous emergence of different clones in two long term TIL cultures grown under identical conditions from the same source of cryopreserved tumor, were documented by analyzing TCR gene rearrangements and suggest that TIL from different culture passages or lines may be used to overcome resistant tumor subpopulations.",

BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

Genetic aberrations can be found in the entire biological spectrum of spitzoid neoplasms (i.e. Spitz nevi, atypical Spitz tumors and spitzoid melanoma) and are, therefore, probably not useful for distinguishing benign from malignant tumors; however, genetic aberrations represent important targets for therapeutic interventions and offer investigational treatment options for patients with metastatic disease.

Loss of HLA class I antigens was more frequent on basal cell carcinomas and sarcomas and was related to tumour differentiation on larynx carcinoma. Class I expression was heterogeneous on breast, larynx and stomach primitive neoplasias. Class I negative tumours were more frequent on metastatic than on primitive melanomas. Divergence of class I between primary tumours and autologous metastases was observed on melanomas, larynx and colorectal carcinomas. Class II expression was heterogeneous on all tumours and in a large number of cases was associated with high intensity of leukocytic infiltrate. HLA-DR expression was higher than HLA-DP and HLA-DQ (DR greater than DP greater than DQ) and was related to tumour progression. Four human tumour cell lines were modulated with recombinant interferon-gamma for HLA class I and II antigens. Different HLA profiles were obtained: increased class I and II expression, increased class II or a low response. Finally, class I genes from 22 tumours were compared with autologous normal cells by Southern blot analysis: 12 tumours were class I positive and 10 negative.

On this basis it has been suggested that there may be a region on chromosome 3 containing genes involved in Fe transport and that rearrangements in this region of chromosome 3 may in some circumstances be associated with malignant transformation. Furthermore, it is unresolved whether all cell types express structurally identical transferrin receptors.

Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 24 cases, whereas 5 had normal karyotypes and 4 were uninformative due to lack of mitoses. Trisomy 12 was detected in 2 small intestine carcinoids, suggesting that +12 may be of pathogenetic importance in this tumor type. The breast and head-and-neck carcinomas and the uveal melanoma displayed aberrations previously reported as characteristic in primary tumors, e.g., der(1;16) and deletion of 3p in the breast cancer, losses of 3p and 8p and partial gain of 8q in the head-and-neck carcinoma, and monosomy 3 and i(8)(q10) in the uveal melanoma, indicating that cytogenetic investigations provide important diagnostic information in secondary liver tumors. In the 18 CRC metastases with chromosomal abnormalities, the cytogenetic findings agreed well with previously reported primary CRC. Common numerical abnormalities included gains of chromosomes 7, 11, 13, and 20, and losses of Y, 4, 18, 21, and 22.

        "Doc_abstract":"There are major differences between tumors in children and adults, viz. the incidence of tumor types, the predisposition of certain organs and tissues (e.g. sympathetic nervous tissue, kidney, and soft tissues) to develop tumors, problems related to tumor classification, and the biologic behavior of childhood malignancies, which are usually characterized by high rates of proliferation activity. A large number of new entities, especially in soft tissue tumors, have been published over the past years, including nodular mesothelial hyperplasia, which is a tumor-like lesion derived from peritoneal macrophages; infantile myofibromatosis, which can mimic leiomyosarcoma; intermediate grade fibrohistiocytic tumors, like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-related giant-cell fibroblastoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor and angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma displaying evidence of myogeneous differentiation; finally, the high-grade intraabdominal desmoplastic small cell tumor. With modern methods we can gain better insights into the biology of tumors. For example, tumors of the Ewing's sarcoma family have in common a characteristic t(11; 22) chromosomal translocation, the Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) (22q12) gene rearrangement, and the MIC2 gene. The EWS gene rearrangement is not restricted to tumors of the Ewing's sarcoma family (classic Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor), however, but occurs in malignant melanoma of the soft tissue and in intraabdominal desmoplastic small cell tumor. Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) can be divided into two basic types with different prognoses: embryonal RMS, including botryoid and spindle-cell variants, and alveolar RMS, including the solid variant. The prognosis of alveolar RMS is poorer than that of classic embryonal RMS, mainly due to early tumor dissemination in alveolar RMS. The prognosis of neuroblastoma is mainly based on chromosomal and molecular biologic findings. Structural chromosome 1 abnormalities, double minute chromosomes, homogeneously staining regions, N-myc amplifications, and DNA diploidy are indications for an unfavorable outcome. Despite progress in childhood solid tumor pathology, many questions remain open, including those relating to basic chromosomal defects in germ cell tumors and the obscure nature of tumor heterogeneity.",

Nm23-H1 also was shown to bind pDbl which is the proto-oncoprotein of Dbl. Interestingly, the interaction between Nm23-H1 and Dbl-1 rescues the suppression of the cell motility activity Nm23-H1. Moreover, this interaction results in loss of the ability of the Dbl-1 oncoprotein to function as a GEF for the critical Rho-GTPase family member Cdc42.

An early-stage CDDP-sensitive human melanoma cell line, WM35, was infected with a defective amphotropic murine retrovirus (murine stem cell virus), and the pooled cells were subsequently selected for CDDP-resistant variants. Nine CDDP-resistant clones independently derived from murine stem cell virus-infected WM35 cells were analyzed and it was found that five of these clones acquired an identical retroviral integration site, designated as CDDP resistance locus 1 (CRL-1), as revealed by isolation of retroviral flanking sequences. Furthermore, using the flanking sequence as probe, we have detected a 3.5-4.0-kilobase message, the expression of which is strongly increased in clones carrying a rearranged CRL-1 locus. These results strongly suggest that overexpression of CRL-1 confers resistance to CDDP in these clones.

In 14 of 15 clones tested, we found that the degree of actin organization was inversely correlated to their metastatic capability. We have further shown that remarkable variations exist in the adhesive properties and locomotor activity of four K-1735 melanoma cell variants that exhibit distinct metastatic properties. The low-metastatic cell variants displayed large focal adhesion plaques, tightly packed actin bundles, elaborate extracellular networks of fibronectin, and restricted motility. In contrast, the high-metastatic variants were poorly attached with only few distinct actin bundles, were unable to reorganize extracellular fibronectin into cables, and exhibited high motile activity. Electron microscopic examination of local s.c. tumors of the high- and low-metastatic lines indicated that the former formed loose tumor masses with very few intercellular connections, while the low-metastatic line developed into a considerably more compact tumor with numerous intercellular contacts, in line with the in vitro findings. It is proposed that the differences in cellular properties manifested by these cell lines may be related to their metastatic properties. Specifically, the highly metastatic cells of this tumor system may easily detach from the primary tumor mass, form weak and transient connections with surrounding connective tissue, and actively migrate through it. Furthermore, these results point to the close interrelationships between different mechanochemical features in cells, including specific cell adhesiveness, cytoskeletal organization, locomotion, and rearrangement of extracellular fibronectin.

A target effect of the drug on the cell membrane structure was hypothesized. Thus, in order to elucidate better the mechanism of action of LND, the drug effects on the cell surface as well as on main cytoskeletal elements, i.e. actin microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments, were investigated. In particular, an immunocytochemical and ultrastructural study was performed using two different cell lines: epithelial squamous carcinoma (A431) and melanoma (M14) cells. Treatment with 0.8 mM LND for 8 hr induced a remarkable rearrangement of the F-actin molecules with the disappearance of the stress fibers. As far as microtubules are concerned, formation of perinuclear patches of tubulin were detected after LND treatment. Intermediate filaments appeared to be differently affected by LND in the two cell types. Such changes were detected as an early phenomenon and the extent of the effects observed was positively related to the cell surface alterations and to the loss of cell viability, suggesting that the cytoskeletal elements might represent an additional target in the mechanisms of cytotoxic action of LND.",

In the present study we identified filamin A as a novel binding partner for the CEACAM1-L cytoplasmic domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Direct binding was shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis and by affinity precipitation assays. The association was shown for human and rodent CEACAM1-L in endogenous CEACAM1-L expressing cells. To address functional aspects of the interaction, we used a well-established melanoma cell system. We found in different migration studies that the interaction of CEACAM1-L and filamin A drastically reduced migration and cell scattering, whereas each of these proteins when expressed alone, acted promigratory. CEACAM1-L binding to filamin A reduced the interaction of the latter with RalA, a member of the Ras-family of GTPases. Furthermore, co-expression of CEACAM1-L and filamin A led to a reduced focal adhesion turnover. Independent of the presence of filamin A, the expression of CEACAM1-L led to an increased phosphorylation of focal adhesions and to altered cytoskeletal rearrangements during monolayer wound healing assays. Together, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for how CEACAM1-L regulates cell migration via its interaction with filamin A.",

The tumor has a proclivity to involve the tendons and aponeuroses of distal extremities of relatively young individuals and is characterized by multiple local recurrences with late metastases and a high rate of tumor deaths. Since its seminal description in 1965, there have been many studies verifying the uniqueness of this entity and probing its differentiation. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies have shown melanocytic differentiation, whereas molecular genetic studies have shown cytogenetic rearrangements resulting in a EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene that is characteristic but not entirely unique for clear cell sarcoma (similar fusion genes are also seen in angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma). Detection of this fusion gene and the absence of BRAF gene mutations clearly distinguish clear cell sarcoma from cutaneous melanoma. Adverse prognostic factors identified to date include larger tumor size and any microscopic tumor necrosis. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for this high grade sarcoma, with chemotherapy having little effect. Although the melanocytic differentiation of clear cell sarcoma is indisputable, its precise lineage remains unclear. Thus, clear cell sarcoma maintains the status of a unique yet enigmatic clinicopathologic entity of ever increasing complexity 40 years after its original description by an extraordinarily gifted man.",

Lumican, a small extracellular matrix leucine-rich proteoglycan, has been shown to inhibit human melanoma cell migration by binding to α2β1 integrin and affecting actin cytoskeleton organization. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lumican overexpression on the migration ability of human colon adenocarcinoma LS180 cells. The cells stably transfected with plasmid containing lumican cDNA were characterized by the increased chemotactic migration measured on Transwell filters. Lumican-overexpressing cells presented the elevated filamentous to monomeric actin ratio and gelsolin up-regulation. This was accompanied by a distinct cytoskeletal actin rearrangement and gelsolin subcellular relocation, as observed under laser scaning confocal microscope. Moreover, LS180 cells overexpressing lumican tend to form podosome-like structures as indicated by vinculin redistribution and its colocalization with gelsolin and actin at the submembrane region of the cells. In conclusion, the elevated level of lumican secretion to extracellular space leads to actin cytoskeletal remodeling followed by an increase in migration capacity of human colon LS180 cells. These data suggest that lumican expression and its presence in ECM has an impact on colon cancer cells motility and may modulate invasiveness of colon cancer.",

Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently observed in many types of cancer. Pathway activation can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gene amplification or rearrangement, loss of negative regulators, epigenetic alterations, and point mutations in key pathway components. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells, CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Moreover, combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with other targeted therapies may help overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance. Ongoing studies include combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancers, and with selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for tumors with alterations in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as melanoma. In particular, the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, such as palbociclib's recent first-line approval in combination with letrozole, is expected to transform the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219).

The tumor metastasized to the liver and lungs, and the patient died of disseminated disease 5 years after his initial presentation. Both the primary and metastatic tumors were composed predominantly of spindle cells with occasional more epithelioid areas that were inconsistently arranged in nests. In both primary and metastatic sites, the tumor surrounded and entrapped normal epithelial elements, mimicking the biphasic appearance of Wilms' tumor.

EphA2 kinase is frequently up-regulated in several different types of cancers, including prostate, breast, colon, and lung carcinomas, as well as in melanoma. The existing data do not clarify whether EphA2 receptor phosphorylation or its simple overexpression, which likely leads to Eph kinase-independent responses, plays a role in the progression of malignant prostate cancer. In this study, we address the role of EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation in prostate carcinoma cell adhesion, motility, invasion, and formation of metastases. Tumor cells expressing kinase-deficient EphA2 mutants, as well as an EphA2 variant lacking the cytoplasmic domain, are defective in ephrinA1-mediated cell rounding, retraction fiber formation, de-adhesion from the extracellular matrix, RhoA and Rac1 GTPase regulation, three-dimensional matrix invasion, and in vivo metastasis, suggesting a key role for EphA2 kinase activity. Nevertheless, EphA2 regulation of cell motility and invasion, as well as the formation of bone and visceral tumor colonies, reveals a component of both EphA2 kinase-dependent and -independent features. These results uncover a differential requirement for EphA2 kinase activity in the regulation of prostate carcinoma metastasis outcome, suggesting that although the kinase activity of EphA2 is required for the regulation of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement, some distinct kinase-dependent and -independent pathways likely cooperate to drive cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis outcome.",

The E6 protein of cutaneous β-HPV types encodes functions consistent with a role in tumorigenesis, and E6 expression can result in papilloma formation in transgenic animals. The E6 proteins of high-risk α-HPV types, which are associated with the development of anogenital cancers, have a conserved 4 aa motif at their extreme C terminus that binds to specific PDZ domain-containing proteins to promote cell invasion. Likewise, the high-risk β-HPVs HPV5 and HPV8 E6 proteins also share a conserved C-terminal motif, but this is markedly different from that of α-HPV types, implying functional differences. Using binding and functional studies, we have shown that β-HPV E6 proteins target β1-integrin using this C-terminal motif. E6 expression reduced membrane localization of β1-integrin, but increased overall levels of β1-integrin protein and its downstream effector focal adhesion kinase in human keratinocytes. Altered β1-integrin localization due to E6 expression was associated with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and increased cell migration that was abolished by point mutations in the C-terminal motif of E6. We concluded that modulation of β1-integrin signalling by E6 proteins may contribute towards the pathogenicity of these β-HPV types. ",

Array comparative genomic hybridization of 19 of these tumors demonstrated a high frequency of chromosome 2 aberrations (where ALK resides, 63%) and chromosome 1p loss in 37% of the cases. Spitz tumors with ALK fusions demonstrated unique histopathologic features. Clefts and small vesicle-like spaces were arrayed between plump spindled melanocytes with fibrillar cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer results from the interaction of multiple aberrations including activation of dominant oncogenes and upregulation of signal transduction pathways. Identification of the genes involved in malignant transformation is a pre-requisite for understanding cancer and improving its diagnosis and treatment. Quite a few of the genes that have been implicated in cancer are mutant or aberrantly expressed versions of genes that are important mediators of the normal growth that occurs during development. An important example of this is Vav1, a cytoplasmic signal transducer protein initially identified as an oncogene. Physiological expression of Vav1 is restricted to the hematopoietic system, where its best-known function is as a GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor for Rho/Rac GTPases, an activity strictly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation. Vav1 was shown to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement during activation of hematopoietic cells. Vav1 can also mediate other cellular functions including activation of the JNK, ERK, Ras, NF-kB, and NFAT pathways, in addition to association with numerous adapter proteins such as Shc, NCK, SLP-76, GRB2, and Crk. Although the oncogenic form of Vav1 has not been detected in clinical human tumors, its wild-type form has recently been implicated in mammalian malignancies such as neuroblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic tumors and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This review addresses the physiological function of wild-type Vav1, its mode of activation as an oncogene, and its emerging role as a transforming protein in human cancer.",

In an attempt to characterize the host cellular immune response to the melanoma, lymphocyte cell lines have been generated from peripheral blood and designated as peripheral blood lymphocyte cell lines (PBLCLs). The cell lines were expanded in vitro without the addition of exogenous mediators, cloned by limiting dilution, and characterized by flow microfluorimetry, Western, and Northern blot analysis. The cell lines were shown to be CD2-, CD4-, CD8-, and slg-, a phenotype consistent with a null cell population described in swine. The null cell population in swine has been reported to consist of a subpopulation of cells which express the gamma delta T cell receptor (TCR) heterodimer, swine gamma delta T lymphocytes. The PBLCLs were further analyzed by flow microfluorimetry and observed to express the IL-2R, swine MHC Class II antigens, and the endothelial lymphocyte adhesion marker (CD44), which can function as a homing receptor for the skin. In addition, the PBLCLs were observed to express the antigen which is recognized by mAb 86D, an antibody that has been reported to recognize an external epitope on a subset of gamma delta TCR bearing swine T lymphocytes. Western blot analysis of Triton X-114 phase fractions of a PBLCL revealed a protein recognized by the W6 antibody, an antibody which recognizes a conserved region of the C delta chain. Furthermore, Southern and Northern blot analysis indicated that the PBLCL have rearranged the TCR gamma chain gene and express mRNA from the TCR gamma and delta chain genes prior to and following treatment with ionomycin or Concanavalin A. Therefore, the data indicates that the PBLCLs represent swine gamma delta T lymphocyte cell lines which should enable us to enhance our understanding of the role of gamma delta T lymphocytes in the porcine immune system.",

The distinctive immnohistologic features are helpful in enabling a diagnosis of this rare tumor, otherwise diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, specific for detecting TFEB gene rearrangement.;Herein, we report a case of this rare tumor in a 11 years old boy, with the objective of highlighting distinctive light microscopic and immuno-phenotypic features of this rare sub-type of translocation associated renal cell carcinoma, otherwise diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. Morphologically tumor showed distinctive biphasic population of cells, large epitheloid cells with voluminous eosinophillic cytoplasm and smaller cells with much lesser amount of cytoplasm and small rounded nuclei. The smaller cells at places clustered around hyaline pink material forming \"pseudorosettes\". population. Immunohistochemically both types of tumor cells showed negativity for pan CK (cytokeratin), EMA (epitheleal membrane antigen) and TFE3 (transcription factor E3).

Immunostains for TFE3 have always been negative in the reported cases. It is noteworthy that immunoreactivity for melanocytic markers HMB45 and Melan A and immunonegativity for epithelial markers pan CK and EMA may lead to misdiagnosis of angiomyolipoma to the unwary.;Knowledge of distinctive morphological and immuno-histochemical features of this tumor can help in establishing a diagnosis of this rare subset of translocation associated RCC on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and immunophenotyping.",

WNT2B gene encodes two isoforms due to alternative splicing of alternative promoter type. WNT2 and WNT2B isoform 2 (WNT2B2) are positive regulators of the WNT - beta-catenin - TCF signaling pathway. Here, a novel ST7-related gene ST7R (ST7-like, ST7L) was identified by using bioinformatics, and ST7R cDNAs were isolated by using cDNA-PCR. ST7R gene encoded 575-amino-acid polypeptide with leucine zipper domain and 3 tyrosine-phosphorylation sites. Human ST7R was homologous to human ST7 (72.1% total-amino-acid identity) and Drosophila CG3634 (56.8% total-amino-acid identity). Leucine zipper domain was unique to ST7R. Tyr 268 and Tyr 441 of ST7R were conserved in ST7 and CG3634. ST7R-homologous domains (S7H1, S7H2, and S7H3) were conserved among ST7R, ST7, and CG3634. ST7R gene consisted of at least 15 exons, and four ST7R isoforms were transcribed due to alternative splicing. ST7R and WNT2B genes, located in human chromosome 1p13 region, were clustered in tail-to-tail manner with an interval of less than 5.0-kb. ST7R-WNT2B and ST7-WNT2 gene clusters might be generated due to duplication of an ancestral gene cluster. Because allelic loss or rearrangements of human chromosome 1p13 region are reported in breast cancer, germ cell tumors, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal stromal/smooth muscle tumors (GIST), meningioma, melanoma, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7), and Kaposi's sarcoma, ST7R might be a novel tumor suppressor gene on human chromosome 1p13.",

We have previously determined the structure of the MHC class I molecule HLA-A1 bound to a melanoma antigen-encoding gene (MAGE)-A1-derived peptide in complex with a recombinant antibody fragment with TCR-like specificity, Fab-Hyb3. Here, we compare the X-ray structure of HLA-A1:MAGE-A1 with that complexed with Fab-Hyb3 to gain insight into structural changes of the MHC molecule that might be induced by the interaction with the antibody fragment. Apart from the expulsion of several water molecules from the interface, Fab-Hyb3 binding results in major rearrangements (up to 5.5 A) of heavy chain residues Arg65, Gln72, Arg145, and Lys146. Residue 65 is frequently and residues 72 and 146 are occasionally involved in TCR binding-induced conformational changes, as revealed by a comparison with MHC class I structures in TCR-liganded and -unliganded forms. On the other hand, residue 145 is subject to a reorientation following engagement of HLA-Cw4 and KIR2DL1. Therefore, conformational changes within the HLA-A1:MAGE-A1:Fab-Hyb3 complex include MHC residues that are also involved in reorientations in complexes with natural ligands, pointing to their central importance for the peptide-dependent recognition of MHC molecules.",

It is much more interesting than success.\" This CCR Focus section is aimed at identifying lessons to be learned from difficulties encountered in recent years during development of anticancer agents. Clearly, we have not found a silver bullet tyrosine kinase inhibitor against solid tumors comparable with imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Although vemurafenib for B-Raf-mutated melanoma and crizotinib for non-small cell lung cancers with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements were developed rapidly and offer hope for individualized targeted therapies, the development of agents targeting a number of other pathways has been slower and less successful. These agents include drugs for blocking the insulin-like growth factor I/insulin receptor pathways, mitotic kinase inhibitors, and Hsp90 antagonists. Several potentially useful, if not groundbreaking, agents have had setbacks in clinical development, including trastuzumab emtansine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and satraplatin. From experience, we have learned the following: (i) not every altered protein or pathway is a valid anticancer target; (ii) drugs must effectively engage the target; (iii) the biology of the systems we use must be very well understood; and (iv) clinical trials must be designed to assess whether the drug reached and impaired the target. It is also important that we improve the drug development enterprise to enhance enrollment, streamline clinical trials, reduce financial risk, and encourage the development of agents for niche indications. Such enormous challenges are offset by potentially tremendous gains in our understanding and treatment of cancer.",

Lymphoid cell lines were established from 78 untreated patients with breast carcinoma, 2 with cervical carcinoma, 24 with colon carcinoma, 12 with prostate carcinoma, 3 with melanoma, and the remaining from asymptomatic family members. Lymphoid cells from all 119 patients and their asymptomatic family members constitutively produced as much as 240 units/ml of TNF-beta in vitro. In contrast, TNF-alpha was produced by lymphoid cells from only 6 patients; a related cytokine with similar biological properties to TNF-beta. Sixty-five of these 119 samples were also analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities by standard cytogenetic technique. The production of TNFs was accompanied with varying degrees of chromosomal abnormalities in the cells from all patients. These included both structural and numerical abnormalities. We also examined the direct effect of TNF-beta on the induction of chromosomal abnormalities in growing cultures of both T and B lymphocytes. Our preliminary results indicate that treatment of lymphocytes with this cytokine induced chromosomal rearrangements in a dose-dependent manner.

The regions around the GH1 and GH2 domains of GIPC1 are involved in dimerization and interaction with myosin VI (MYO6), respectively. The PDZ domain of GIPC1 is involved in interactions with transmembrane proteins [IGF1R, NTRK1, ADRB1, DRD2, TGFβR3 (transforming growth factorβ receptor type III), SDC4, SEMA4C, LRP1, NRP1, GLUT1, integrin α5 and VANGL2], cytosolic signaling regulators (APPL1 and RGS19) and viral proteins (HBc and HPV-18 E6). GIPC1 is an adaptor protein with dimerizing ability that loads PDZ ligands as cargoes for MYO6-dependent endosomal trafficking. GIPC1 is required for cell-surface expression of IGF1R and TGFβR3. GIPC1 is also required for integrin recycling during cell migration, angiogenesis and cytokinesis. On early endosomes, GIPC1 assembles receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and APPL1 for activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and RGS19 for attenuation of inhibitory Gα signaling. GIPC1 upregulation in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers promotes tumor proliferation and invasion, whereas GIPC1 downregulation in cervical cancer with human papillomavirus type 18 infection leads to resistance to cytostatic transforming growth factorβ signaling. GIPC2 is downregulated in acute lymphocytic leukemia owing to epigenetic silencing, while Gipc2 is upregulated in estrogen-induced mammary tumors. Somatic mutations of GIPC2 occur in malignant melanoma, and colorectal and ovarian cancers. Germ-line mutations of the GIPC3 or MYO6 gene cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. As GIPC proteins are involved in trafficking, signaling and recycling of RTKs, GPCRs, integrins and other transmembrane proteins, dysregulation of GIPCs results in human pathologies, such as cancer and hereditary deafness.",

One hundred ninety-five cases diagnosed as adult FS in somatic soft tissue were retrieved from our institutional archives for the period 1960 to 2008. Thirty-two cases with insufficient material were excluded. On the basis the morphology of the final 163 cases, immunohistochemical studies (IHC) was conducted using some combination of: wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5 y, range 2 to 99 y), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females (median 50 y, range 6 to 74 y), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range <1 to 35 y). Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease (median follow-up 1-year; range <1 to 8 y), 6 patients (25%) were alive without disease (median follow-up 11.5 y; range 2.5 to 35 y), and 6 patients (25%) died of other causes (median follow-up 10 y; range 9 to 18 y) (). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great caution.",

As part of efforts to isolate the genes involved in these disorders, we have begun to develop a comparative transcription map spanning this region in both species. Using techniques of cross-species conservation and hybridization, exon trapping, and cDNA selection we have identified four known genes or members of gene families--caltractin, a member of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor gene family, a member of the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family, and several members of the murine-specific, X-linked lymphocyte regulated gene (Xlr3) family. Trapped exons and, in some cases, longer cDNAs have been isolated for potentially 7-9 additional genes. One cDNA demonstrates highly significant homology with members of the Krüppel family of zinc finger transcription factors. A second novel cDNA demonstrates homology at the 3' end of the predicted amino acid sequence to a LIM domain consensus. Gene order appears conserved among those cDNAs determined to be present in both human and mouse. Three of the murine transcripts appear to be present in multiple copies within the Bpa/Str critical region and could be associated with a predisposition to genomic rearrangements.

One of these molecules is the suppressor of tumor metastasis Nm23-H1 which linked to invasiveness and metastatic potential of human cancers. Nm23-H1 expression is down-regulated in human melanoma and invasive breast carcinoma. Recent studies have shown an association between the Nm23-H1 and oncoprotein Dbl-1 which is associated with guanine exchange and belongs to a family of Guanine Exchange Factors (GEF). In this report we show a direct interaction in vitro and in human B cells and specifically identified the pleckstrin homology domain of Dbl-1 as the domain which binds to Nm23-H1. Furthermore, Nm23-H1 and Dbl-1 colocalized in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells when expressed exogenously and showed predominant signals at the periphery of the cells particularly at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, Dbl-1 and Cdc42 expression rescued the suppressive activities of Nm23-H1 in cell migration assays. We show that Cdc42 a regulatory protein involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, cell growth and development can bind to Nm23-H1 and the kinase deficient mutant H118F but only weakly to the mutant P96S which lacks the ability to suppress cell migration and metastasis. Cdc42 also colocalized with Nm23-H1 and the Dbl-1 proteins as specific punctate signals in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. Nm23-H1 also lead to the reduction in membrane ruffles and protuberances when expressed with Dbl-1 and Cdc42. Surprisingly, Nm23-H1 interacted with Cdc42 as well as Rac1 but somewhat weaker with RhoA. These studies suggests that Nm23-H1 can negatively regulate cell migration and tumor metastasis by modulating the activity of Cdc42 and possibly other Rho family members through interaction with Dbl-1.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We studied the clinicopathological and imaging characteristics of primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PCNS-DLBCL). Imaging, pathologic histology, and immunohistochemical staining characteristics were analyzed, and the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene rearrangement of 25 PCNS-DLBCL cases was examined. MicroRNA was extracted from 10 cases each of PCNS-DLBCL, extracerebral germinal center DLBCL (GC-DLBCL), and extracerebral non-GC-DLBCL (NGC-DLBCL); we conducted chip hybridization and comparatively analyzed the difference among the three. PCNS-DLBCLs typically involved no less than two cerebral lobes (10/25); the frontal lobe was affected most often (6/25). Target-shaped structures were observed in all PCNS-DLBCLs due to the proliferation of centroblast-like large lymphocytes surrounding the vessels. There was strong and diffuse immunostaining for CD20 and CD79a, and negative immunostaining for CD3, CD5, CD23, and cyclin D1 for all PCNS-DLBCLs. The percentage of cells with nuclear positivity for anti-Ki67 antibody ranged 50-90% (mean, 80%). Three, 19, and 22 PCNS-DLBCLs were CD10-, Bcl-6-, and melanoma ubiquitous mutated 1-positive, respectively. Twenty-four PCNS-DLBCLs were B-cell monoclonal. MicroRNA hybridization showed that 788 PCNS-DLBCL microRNAs/segments increased to at least twice that of NGC-DLBCLs, and 401 PCNS-DLBCL microRNAs/segments declined to less than half of that of NGC-DLBCLs. Six hundred and eleven PCNS-DLBCL microRNAs/segments increased to at least twice that of GC-DLBCLs, and 229 PCNS-DLBCL microRNAs/segments declined to less than half of that in GC-DLBCLs. PCNS-DLBCL typically affected multiple sites, tended to occur in older men, arose from activated B cells, had high B-cell monoclonality; its microRNA expression differed from that of NGC-DLBCL and GC-DLBCL.

        "Doc_abstract":"Resorcylates are a large group of bioactive natural products that are biosynthesized from acetate and malonate units via the intermediacy of polyketides. These polyketides undergo cyclization reactions to introduce the aromatic core. The bioactivities of the resorcylates including resorcylate macrocyclic lactones include anticancer, antimalarial, mycotoxicity, antifungal, and antibiotic properties, and several compounds in the series are already in use in medicine. Examples are prodrugs derived from mycophenolic acid as immunosuppressants and the Hsp-90 inhibitor, AT13387, which is in phase-II clinical trials for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and melanoma. In consequence of these biological activities, methods for the concise synthesis of diverse resorcylates are of considerable importance. In natural product chemistry, biomimetic total synthesis can have significant advantages including functional group tolerance in key steps, the minimization of the use of protection and deprotection reactions and the shortening of the total number of synthetic steps. This Account provides a description of our adaption of the dioxinone chemistry of Hyatt, Clemens, and Feldman for the synthesis and retro-Diels-Alder reactions of diketo-dioxinones. Such dioxinones, which were synthesized by a range of C-acylation reactions, were found to undergo retro-Diels-Alder reactions on heating to provide the corresponding triketo-ketenes with the loss of acetone. The ketene reactive intermediates were rapidly trapped both inter- and intramolecularly with alcohols to provide the corresponding β,δ,ζ-triketo-esters. These compounds, which consist of keto-enol mixtures, readily undergo cycloaromatization to produce resorcylate esters and macrocyclic lactones. We have established the use of diketo-dioxinones as key general intermediates for the synthesis of diverse resorcylate natural products and for the synthesis of new classes of compounds for the generation of medicinal chemistry lead structures. Many of the methods used were found to be tolerant of multiple sensitive functional groups. These include enolate C-acylations with acyl chlorides, 1-acyl-benzotriazoles, acyl imidazolides, or Weinreb amides to prepare diketo-dioxinones and their subsequent use to prepare β,δ,ζ-triketo-esters and lactones and hence resorcylates. In addition, in most cases, phenol protection was avoided. As an alternative to the synthesis of β,δ,ζ-triketo-esters, diketo-dioxinones were also found to undergo cycloaromatization with retention of the ketal entity via a nonketene pathway. Finally, diketo-dioxinones with an allyl, prenyl, geranyl, or other 2-alkenyl carboxylate esters at the γ-carbon underwent decarboxylative rearrangement with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium catalysis to produce α-substituted diketo-dioxinones and resorcylates with 3-allyl, prenyl, geranyl, or other 2-alkenyl groups. Such diketo-dioxinone chemistry was used in the total synthesis of natural products including aigialomycin, cruentaren A, and the oligomeric resorcylate antibiotics ent-W1278 A, B, and C. Additionally, tandem use of the decarboxylative rearrangement process and cycloaromatization was used in the total synthesis of natural products including the methyl ester of cristatic acid, mycophenolic acid, and hongoquercin B. The methodology was also applied to the synthesis of 9,10-anthraquinones, o-aminoalkyl resorcylates, dihydroxyisoindolinones, oligomers, and resorcinamides. The development of this methodology is described in this Account, showcasing its applicability and versatility for the synthesis of complex resorcylate products. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Reducing sugars can react non-enzymatically with amino groups of protein to form Amadori products. These early glycation products undergo further complex reaction such as rearrangement, dehydration, and condensation to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives, termed advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The formation and accumulation of AGEs in various tissues has been known to progress at an accelerated rate under hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes. Recent understanding of this process has revealed that AGEs have been implicated in the development of many of the pathological sequelae of diabetes and aging, such as atherosclerosis and diabetic microangiopathy. Furthermore, recently, AGE-their receptor (RAGE) interaction was also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, melanoma growth, expansion and metastasis. These observations suggest that blockade of AGE formation may be a novel promising target for therapeutic intervention in these devastating AGE-related disorders. We have recently found that unicellular green alga Chlorella inhibited the formation of AGEs in vitro. Since several lines of evidence have shown anti-atherogenic effects of Chlorella on animal models, we hypothesize here that the beneficial aspects of Chlorella on atherosclerosis could be ascribed, at least in part, to its AGE inhibitory property and that Chlorella may have therapeutic potentials in treatment of patients with other AGE-related disorders such as diabetic microangiopathy and Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypotheses. Does daily intake of Chlorella reduce the risk of the incidence and progression of diabetic vascular complications including atherosclerosis? Does Chlorella treatment prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease and/or improve the cognitive impairment of patients with this disorder? If the answers are yes, are plasma or tissue levels of AGE in these patients actually suppressed by Chlorella treatment? And, does the extent of the AGE reduction by Chlorella predict the beneficial effects of Chlorella on these disorders? These prospective studies will provide further valuable information whether blockade by Chlorella of the AGE formation could be clinically relevant.",

In the study described here, we tested in mouse models a vaccine consisting of a peptide encompassing the tumor-specific mutated segment of EGFRvIII (PEP-3) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH (PEP-3-KLH)].;C57BL/6J or C3H mice were vaccinated with PEP-3-KLH and subsequently challenged either s.c. or intracerebrally with a syngeneic melanoma cell line stably transfected with a murine homologue of EGFRvIII. Control mice were vaccinated with KLH. To test its effect on established tumors, C3H mice were also challenged intracerebrally and subsequently vaccinated with PEP-3-KLH.;S.c. tumors developed in all of the C57BL/6J mice vaccinated with KLH in Freund's adjuvant, and there were no long-term survivors. Palpable tumors never developed in 70% of the PEP-3-KLH-vaccinated mice. In the C57BL/6J mice receiving the PEP-3-KLH vaccine, the tumors that did develop were significantly smaller than those in the control group (P < 0.05). PEP-3-KLH vaccination did not result in significant cytotoxic responses in standard cytotoxicity assays; however, antibody titers against PEP-3 were enhanced. The passive transfer of sera from the immunized mice to nonimmunized mice protected 31% of the mice from tumor development (P < 0.05). In vivo depletion studies showed that the effector cell population was natural killer and CD8+ T cells, and in vitro assays showed that macrophages could lyse target tumor cells with serum from the PEP-3-KLH-vaccinated mice. Peptide vaccination was also sufficiently potent to have marked efficacy against intracerebral tumors, resulting in a >173% increase in median survival time, with 80% of the C3H mice achieving long-term survival (P = 0.014). In addition, C3H mice with established intracerebral tumor that received a single treatment of PEP-3-KLH showed a 26% increase in median survival time, with 40% long-term survival (P = 0.007).;Vaccination with an EGFRvIII-specific peptide is efficacious against both s.c. and established intracerebral tumors.

In this study, we examined 36 synovial sarcomas of the head excluding tumors in the oral cavity, sinonasal tract, submandibular area, neck, and intracranial space. There were 19 men and 17 women with a mean age of 35 years (range: 4 to 85 y). There was a marked predilection for the parotid (n=14) and temporal regions (n=9), and cheek (n=4). Other locations included mastoid area (n=2), infratemporal fossa (n=2), and one each from the supra-auricular scalp, maxillary, submaxillary, mandibular, and nasolabial regions. Histologically, 25 examples were of monophasic type, 10 were biphasic. Five of these cases contained a poorly differentiated Ewing sarcoma-like component and 1 was purely poorly differentiated. Histologically, 9 tumors involved skeletal muscle, 4 parotid gland (focally or in the interlobular septa), and 1 intertrabecular spaces of bone; the others involved subcutis or fascia and rarely skin. The tumor size ranged from 0.6 to 7.0 cm (median: 3.5 cm) and mitotic activity varied from <1 to 85 per 10 high-power fields (HPFs) (median, 6/10 HPFs). Keratin-positive tumor cells were detected in 19 of 19 monophasic and 1 of 1 of poorly differentiated tumors that were examined. SS18 gene rearrangement was confirmed in all 14 cases examined (3 biphasic and 11 monophasic tumors). Follow-up on 29 patients revealed that 11 were alive without disease from 2 to 31 years (median, 14 y). Ten patients died of disease 1 to 18 years after the diagnosis (median, 3 y); most of these patients had a tumor >5 cm and 6 of 10 had mitotic counts >10/10 HPFs. One patient died of an unrelated cause (metastatic melanoma) and 7 died of unknown causes. Four other patients had subsequent malignancies, including carcinomas of the breast, esophagus, rectum, and parotid gland. The latter was possibly radiation-induced, diagnosed 30 years after the synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma of the head has a striking predilection for the parotid and temporal regions and the prognosis varies with many patients having long tumor-free survivals.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Proteins of the mammalian PYHIN (IFI200/HIN-200) family are involved in defence against infection through recognition of foreign DNA. The family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) binds cytosolic DNA via its HIN domain and initiates inflammasome formation via its pyrin domain. AIM2 lies within a cluster of related genes, many of which are uncharacterised in mouse. To better understand the evolution, orthology and function of these genes, we have documented the range of PYHIN genes present in representative mammalian species, and undertaken phylogenetic and expression analyses.;No PYHIN genes are evident in non-mammals or monotremes, with a single member found in each of three marsupial genomes. Placental mammals show variable family expansions, from one gene in cow to four in human and 14 in mouse. A single HIN domain appears to have evolved in the common ancestor of marsupials and placental mammals, and duplicated to give rise to three distinct forms (HIN-A, -B and -C) in the placental mammal ancestor. Phylogenetic analyses showed that AIM2 HIN-C and pyrin domains clearly diverge from the rest of the family, and it is the only PYHIN protein with orthology across many species. Interestingly, although AIM2 is important in defence against some bacteria and viruses in mice, AIM2 is a pseudogene in cow, sheep, llama, dolphin, dog and elephant. The other 13 mouse genes have arisen by duplication and rearrangement within the lineage, which has allowed some diversification in expression patterns.;The role of AIM2 in forming the inflammasome is relatively well understood, but molecular interactions of other PYHIN proteins involved in defence against foreign DNA remain to be defined. The non-AIM2 PYHIN protein sequences are very distinct from AIM2, suggesting they vary in effector mechanism in response to foreign DNA, and may bind different DNA structures. The PYHIN family has highly varied gene composition between mammalian species due to lineage-specific duplication and loss, which probably indicates different adaptations for fighting infectious disease. Non-genomic DNA can indicate infection, or a mutagenic threat. We hypothesise that defence of the genome against endogenous retroelements has been an additional evolutionary driver for PYHIN proteins.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the design of new approaches to cancer prevention, it is important to realize that most cancers develop stepwise over a long period of time with nonmalignant precursor lesions that only slowly evolve toward cancer. With many chemicals and some radiations, as well as some viruses (DNA and some retroviruses), cancer development can be divided into 3 major stages or periods, initiation, promotion and progression. Initiation is frequently associated with a more or less permanent change in the phenotype of a rare target cell, presumably due to a change in base composition in DNA or to gene rearrangements. During promotion, these rare cells expand by proliferation to generate focal proliferations that resemble benign neoplasms. These in turn exercise at least one of two options, regression to normal appearing tissue or slow evolution to cancer. Progression is self generating but can be modulated by dietary manipulations or by other drugs or xenobiotics. The prolonged nature of the promotion-progression stages in most tissues and its modulatability indicate that these stages are vulnerable sites for the development of dietary and other ways to prevent the progression to cancer. This overall pattern is known to occur in the liver, skin and urinary bladder and is probable in several other tissues or organs including the colon, breast and pancreas. What we know about the human suggests that the patterns may be very similar for cancer development in many sites. The best worked out is melanoma. The phenotypic pattern of the precursor lesions in the experimental animals is remarkably similar in any single organ. For example, the hepatocyte nodules are very similar to each other with many different carcinogens and promoting environments even though the ultimate cancers are quite heterogeneous and diverse. The diversity and heterogeneity appears to be an acquisition that is quite late in the step-by-step development of cancer. Although its exact step has not been delineated as yet, it appears to be acquired as malignancy is. Unlike the cancers, the commonality or homogeneity in the precursor lesions offers many opportunities for interrupting the process and thus in preventing cancer. The experience to date in experimental systems with some hormones, drugs and dietary manipulations indicates that inhibition of the development of cancer may be most readily achieved by affecting the promotion and progression sequences in carcinogenesis.",
