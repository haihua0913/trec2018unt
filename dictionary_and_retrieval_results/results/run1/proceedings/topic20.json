With the low rate of survival for distant metastatic patients with melanoma, especially in men, studies aimed at elucidating the immunological and hormonal mechanisms underlying the gender disparity are warranted.Procedures', ' To investigate the gender disparity observed between men and women affected by melanoma, we used an experimental murine model where B16 melanoma cells were injected i.v. into C57BL/6 mice and lung colonization was assessed at day 14. The roles of neutrophils and NK cells were then investigated by specific cell depletion using anti-Ly6G(1A8) and anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Depleting antibodies or control IgG were injected every 3 days, starting one day before melanoma cell injection. To elucidate the role of hormones, ovariectomy or castration surgeries were performed 4 weeks before B16 injection and 60 day slow release pellets were inserted at the time of surgery. Findings were reproduced with a second murine melanoma cell line (YUMM1.7) derived from a genetically engineered mouse harboring human mutations in BrafV600, as well as loss of Cdkn2a and PTEN.Data', ' Compared with males, nave female mice injected with melanoma (B16 or YUMM1.7) cells have higher lung tumor burden, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and decreased NK cell activation. Ovariectomy of female mice did not affect lung tumor burden, indicating that estrogen and progesterone are not protective. Interestingly, castrated males revealed increased lung metastasis and worse survival rates compared with sham male mice, suggesting a protective role for testosterone. Further, testosterone replacement in castrated mice significantly reduced the elevated lung tumor burden to equal levels observed in sham males. Depletion of NK cells greatly increased tumor burden in both male and female mice in a gender independent manner. In contrast, neutrophil depletion increased lung tumor burden only in male mice and had no significant affect in female mice, indicating a potential gender difference in neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophil depletion in male mice also reduced NK activation and IFN- production, suggesting a stimulatory relationship between neutrophils and NK cells.Conclusion', ' Our data indicates that both neutrophils and NK cells are important for the initial response against melanoma colonization of the lung. Neutrophil depletion, as well as our castration data, indicate that there is a gender specific differential response, which may contribute to the gender disparity seen in human melanoma incidence and survival. Further, testosterone replacement at physiological levels may benefit a subset of melanoma patients.']",

In this study, we evaluate whether soluble levels of angiogenin, transforming growth factor-1 and VEGFR-1 and -2 play a role in metastatic malignant melanoma patients and to determine if they have any relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Methods', ' Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, angiogenin TGF-1, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were measured in sera of 70 patients with a fully documented history of metastatic malignant melanoma in comparison with 30 healthy controls.

In a Ph1b trial (BRIM7), combining vemurafenib (vem) with a MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib (cobi), BRAFi-nave patients (pts) with advanced BRAFV600-mutated melanoma attained 87% confirmed response rate, by RECIST and median progression-free survival of 13.7 months.

A follow-up randomized phase III study of DTIC  OBL is ongoing in pts with low-normal baseline LDH ( 0.8 x ULN; AGENDA trial). To further assess the relation between LDH and tumor burden, we performed a comparative analysis of data from the new AGENDA trial and the prior study.

With the low rate of survival for distant metastatic patients with melanoma, especially in men, studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying metastasis and the gender disparity are warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify the immune cells and cellular interactions that are crucial for initial colonization of metastatic melanoma in a gender dependent manner.Experimental Procedures', ' We used a B16 melanoma metastatic model in which 2105 cells are injected via the tail vein of B6 mice and allowed to colonize for 14 days. Positive organs are analyzed by visual counting of the metastases, extraction of the melanin pigment and measurement by spectrophotometry, and by flow cytometry. To investigate the role of innate immunity, we injected ip either anti-Ly6G, 1A8 (neutrophil depletion), anti NK1.1, PK136 (natural killer [NK] cell depletion) or control IgG every 3 days, starting 1 day before tumor injection. For hormone ablation studies, an LHRH antagonist was injected.Data', ' Nave mice injected with B16 cells revealed that females have higher lung tumor burden than males. Previous castration studies indicate that this may be dependent on androgens. Intriguingly, neutrophil depletion increases tumor burden only in male mice when compared to male IgG and does not significantly affect tumor burden in female mice, indicating a potential gender difference in neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion in male mice also reduced NK activation and IFN- production, indicating a stimulatory relationship between neutrophils and NK cells. A subsequent NK depletion study revealed significantly increased tumor burden in both male and female NK-depleted mice when compared to the gender-matched controls. However, the increased tumor burden normally seen in lungs of females compared to males was still apparent when comparing lungs of NK depleted male mice to NK depleted female mice. This study also revealed that NK cells are crucial for the prevention of liver metastasis as both genders of NK depleted mice revealed multiple melanoma tumor nodules on the surface of the liver.Conclusion', ' Our data indicates that both neutrophils, and to a greater extent, NK cells are important for the initial response against B16 melanoma colonization of the lung and may be necessary to prevent metastasis. For the liver, NK cells were absolutely crucial for the prevention of melanoma colonization in this organ. Neutrophil depletion, as well as our previous castration data, indicated that there is a gender specific differential response of these cells, which may contribute to the gender disparity seen in human incidence and survival.

The current studies utilize the B16F10 mouse spontaneous melanoma syngeneic transplantable mouse model system. Previous published work with this vaccine platform has indicated the MIP-3 component targets nascent peptides to immature dendritic cells leading to processing by class I and class II MHC pathways. It has further been shown in this tumor system that prophylactic vaccination with the DNA construct alone delayed tumor growth. Other studies have provided evidence that PD-1 or IL-10 neutralizing antibodies enhance immunological melanoma therapies by modulating the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment. First, this study expanded previous results by finding a significant decrease in tumor burden and increase in survival by prophylactic intramuscular electroporation [IM EP] of the DNA vaccine construct. Adding three therapeutic doses of IL-10 given subcutaneously [subQ] at the tumor site to the treatment further increased mouse survival. The development of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were documented for the first time in this system by Elispot and in-cell ELISA assays. Secondly, a novel therapeutic vaccination protocol was developed by initiating vaccination and antibody therapies after tumor challenge. With this therapeutic protocol, we demonstrated for the first time that vaccine significantly delays tumor burden and increases median survival from 17 to 21 days (p = 0.006). Addition of IL-10 (subQ) and PD-1 (intra-peritoneally) antibodies led to further highly significant decreases in tumor burden and increased median survival from 17 to 25 days (p = 0.0005). Efficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to the ex vivo dendritic cell antigen loading protocols currently undergoing clinical investigation.

Tumor infiltration with PV-10 leads to rapid necrosis of the injected lesion, with complete resolution common within 2-8 weeks.

Treatment was generally well tolerated, with adverse events confined mainly to the injection site and no grade 4 or 5 adverse events associated with use of PV-10.

Recent studies have focused on identifying genomic and immune predictors of response, but consistent, robust biomarkers have yet to be fully characterized.

Chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was used to increase the number of tumour non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and thus mutational load. Responses to PD-1 blockade were compared between tumours having low (10 SNVs) and high (>100 SNVs) mutation burden and tumours were subsequently subjected to comprehensive molecular and immune profiling using whole exome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry.Our initial data suggest there is no significant correlation between tumour mutation burden and response in our model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma, and we will present a detailed analysis of low- and high-mutation burden tumours in light of their response to PD-1 blockade.

Methods', ' In an effort to implement a robust and useful measure of tumor burden for patients with metastatic melanoma in a German national skin cancer registry (ADOReg) we evaluated the melanoma tumor burden score (MTBS), originally developed for analyzing chemotherapy data in melanoma patients. The MTBS contains a simple categorization of size, number an distribution of metastatic lesions in individual patients. It is aimed at being used on routine radiologic report allowing for a certain level of uncertainty and imprecise quantification of metastatic lesions. Basically, the lesions are categorized per affected organ with respect to number (solitary, few, multiple) and size (1cm, >1- 5cm, >5cm). For evaluation of prognostic significance the summary score was calculated and included in univariate and multivariate survival analysis. We performed extensive sensitivity analyses for a variety of different model settings. Results', ' In the primary analysis set we re-evaluated 898 radiologic reports in a total of 235 various chemotherapies in n=128 stage IV melanoma patients.

Studies have found it to play a key role in tumor growth and neo-vessel formation in numerous cancer types. We are currently evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of MORAb-004, a humanized monoclonal IgG targeting endosialin/TEM-1, in clinical trials. Because MORAb-004 only recognizes human antigen and has no cross-reactivity with rodent endosialin/TEM-1, we generated a human endosialin/TEM-1 knock-in mouse in order to assess its activity in vivo. Previously, in this transgenic model, we found that MORAb-004 significantly inhibited subcutaneous B16-F10 melanoma progression by 70% when administered intravenously for 5 consecutive days. Moreover, using the Lewis Lung Carcinoma model of metastatic disease our results showed that MORAb-004 had a significant inhibitory effect on the number of lung metastases. For these studies, supporting clinical trials for using MORAb-004 in combination with standard of care chemotherapeutics, we developed a B16-F10 melanoma lung colonization model. In this model, the human endosialin/TEM-1 knock-in mice were implanted intravenously with B16F10 cells adapted for in vivo lung colonization. These mice were treated with Docetaxel, MORAb-004, or the combination of the two agents, respectively. A group of the tumor-bearing mice receiving PBS served as control. At the end of the study, the lungs of each mouse were harvested. A ratio of the area of tumor nodules versus total lung surface area is calculated as tumor burden. MORAb-004, at 50 mg/kg three times weekly for a total of 7 i.v. injections reduced tumor burden by 45%. Treatment of Docetaxel, at 3mg/kg twice weekly for a total of 5 i.p. injections, reduced less than 20% of tumor burden in the lungs. When MORAb004 was added to Docetaxel treatment, a significant enhancement of efficacy was observed. The reduction of tumor nodules in the lungs was increased to approximately 70%. A similar trend is seen in combination therapy where MORAb-004 was added to gemcitabine regimen. Our results demonstrate the ability of MORAb-004 to inhibit tumor growth in a murine model. Moreover, when added to the chemotherapeutic regimen, it significantly enhances the therapeutic effect of traditional chemotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Desmoplastic melanomas (DMs) comprise 4% of the overall melanoma burden and have a 5-year survival rate of 85%. DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

In this regard, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of a novel dichlorophenyl urea compound called SR4 in melanoma. The SR4 treatment decreased the survival and inhibited the clonogenic potential along with inducing apoptosis in vitro cultures of melanoma. SR4 treatments lead to inhibition of GST activity along with inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Oral administration of 4 mg/kg b.w. SR4 leads to effective inhibition of tumor burdens in both syngeneic and nude mouse models of melanoma. The SR4 treatment was well tolerated and no overt toxicity was observed. The histopathological examination of resected tumor sections reflected decreased blood vessels, decrease in the levels of angiogenesis marker, CD31, and proliferation marker, Ki67, along with an increase in pAMPK levels.

More importantly, the toxicity and financial burden of receiving such therapy warrants a personalized, or precision medicine, approach to appropriate selection of treatment, thus molecular predictors of response may become as important as biomarkers such as PDL1 expression. Recently the high mutational burden of malignant melanoma was shown to be related to the degree of response to the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, but mutational burden alone was not sufficient to predict benefit1. Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2. Moreover, insight into the molecular evolution of melanoma was recently established3, wherein somatic mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, or GNA11 occur early during progression and additional mutations of TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN are seen in late-stage disease. To better evaluate the relationship of these mutations to immunotherapy response, our institution has profiled 95 patients with melanoma with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of the 95 patients profiled, the most common mutations identified were BRAF (38%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (18%), PTEN (14%), TERT (9%), and CDKN2A (8%).

As melanoma is highly immunogenic, here we tested whether TMB associates with immune recognition during tumor progression, hence impacting melanoma overall survival (OS), independently of IT treatment. Methods', ' We have generated somatic mutation data from 314 IT-naive metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the TCGA cohort, TMB has been calculated for 210 genes (200GS) previously established from TMB studies of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 IT. For validation, we have sequenced exonic regions of 20 genes (20GS) with the highest TMB among 200GS in 89 IT-naive metastatic melanomas ascertained at New York University Langone Medical Center. The TMB was defined using total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations in either 200GS (TCGA discovery) or 20GS (validation), respectively. For discovery and validation cohorts, OS from primary diagnosis of samples with high TMB was compared against low TMB, using thresholds established in previous studies. Results', ' We found that total TMB predicts better OS (p = 0.03, HR = 2.64) in TCGA melanomas. Restricting the analysis only to the established 200GS, this association became more significant in all patients (p = 0.01, HR = 2.67) as well as in patients without IT (p = 0.01, HR = 2.67). In the validation stage of 89 melanomas without prior IT treatment, a high TMB in a subset of 20GS accurately determined favorable OS (p = 0.02, HR = 2.69) and confirmed TCGA observations from the 200GS. Conclusions', ' Here we show, for the first time, that in addition to IT, high TMB predicts more favorable OS in patients that never received IT, potentially serving as a novel marker of prognosis of melanoma and likely other immunogenic tumors at early stages. In addition, our study suggests that TMB test can be robust when applied to only a small subset of genes that trigger significantly higher immunogenicity. This may also eventually assist with accurate sub-selection of early stage patients likely to respond to IT regimens.']",

        "Background":"['The pathogenic mutations in melanoma have largely been catalogued, but the order of their occurrence is not known. We identified 82 cases of melanocytic neoplasia with two or more histopathologically distinct precursor and descendent portions. These portions spanned several histopathologic stages including benign nevi, intermediate neoplasms such as dysplastic nevi, melanoma in situ, invasive melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. In total, 277 histopathogically distinct areas were microdissected and sequenced using a panel of several hundred cancer-genes at an average of 275-fold coverage. In all cases precursor lesions harbored mutations known to activate the MAPK pathway, most commonly affecting BRAF or NRAS, and thus these were considered initiating mutations. TERT promoter mutations were the earliest secondary mutations to occur, emerging in intermediate neoplasms and in situ melanomas. Bi-allelic CDKN2A mutations and/or deletions arose predominantly at the transition to invasive melanoma. TP53 and PTEN mutations occurred comparatively later in thicker primary melanomas. In the 12 cases in which matched primaries and metastases were sequenced, no pathogenic mutations were specifically associated with the transition to metastatic melanoma, suggesting that metastatic capability was already present in the primary tumors. Unequivocally benign neoplasms, which mostly consisted of conventional nevi, disproportionately harbored BRAFV600E mutations as the only apparent pathogenic alteration. Lesions that were histopathologically intermediate, such as dysplastic nevi, had two or more pathogenic mutations and were enriched for NRAS mutations. These findings provide genetic support for the existence of an intermediate stage of melanocytic neoplasia, resolving a long-standing controversy. We also found that melanomas with different initiating mutations evolve through distinct evolutionary trajectories linked to specific histopathologic precursors. A mutational signature of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage predominated in lesions from all histopathologic stages, implicating UV-radiation in both the initiation and progression of melanoma. The point mutation burden increased steadily from one progression stage to the next, stabilizing once melanomas became invasive. By contrast, copy number alterations only became prevalent at the transition to invasive melanoma. Melanomas evolve from benign lesions linearly, whereas, they show patterns of branched evolution when they evolve from intermediate lesions; this indicates that evolution may accelerate once a melanocytic neoplasm reaches an intermediate stage. In summary, our study outlines a framework of the genetic evolution of melanocytic neoplasms from precursor lesions and unveils the rate-limiting homeostatic factors that become disrupted as neoplasms progress from one stage to the next, as well as the pathogenic factors driving this evolution.']",

The detection of CTCs has gained increasing interest for prediction of clinical outcome. However, it remains to be determined whether uveal melanoma cells circulating in a peripheral vein predict systemic recurrence and poorer overall prognosis.Uveal melanoma, the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults, is unique in that the uveal tract is devoid of lymphatics. Since systemic recurrence develops exclusively via hematogenous spread, patients with uveal melanomas present a special opportunity to explore the prognostic potential of CTCs. Although the lung is the first organ through which venous drainage from the affected eye passes and indeed the only organ through which all venous blood must pass, 80-95% of systemic metastases are found first in the liver without development of lung metastases. To address these issues, we investigated the numbers of CTCs in paired arterial (femoral) and venous (antecubital) blood specimens obtained from uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.Methods', ' CTCs in blood specimens were measured in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases, including 10 patients with liver-only metastases and 7 patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases. Peripheral arterial and venous blood specimens were collected at the same time prior to liver directed treatment. CTCs were analyzed using CellTracks Circulating melanoma Cell Kit by CellSearch System. The clinical information and sources of blood specimens were blinded when CTCs were analyzed.Result', ' CTCs were detectable from all 17 arterial blood specimens (100%) (median 5, range 1 to 168).

More importantly, there is no significant correlation between numbers of arterial CTCs and the degree of tumor volume in the liver in patients who have liver-only metastases.Conclusions', ' Using this technology, the detection of uveal melanoma cells in peripheral blood is feasible. Peripheral capillary beds effectively filter CTCs from venous blood; thus venous blood might not be the best source for measurement of CTCs in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The paucity of clinically evident non-hepatic metastases despite the effective filtration by peripheral capillary beds remains unexplained and may be a demonstration of the seed and soil hypothesis.

        "Background":"['Drug resistance is a major problem in clinical treatment of malignant melanoma. A characteristic feature of melanoma is the abnormally high levels of basal free radicals produced in transformed melanosomes when compared to normal melanocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate pro-oncogenic signaling pathways that promote cancer progression, metastasis and contribute to chemotherapeutic drug resistance. However, an excessive overload of ROS in cells beyond a certain tolerance limit may trigger oxidative damage and cell death. Thus cellular ROS modulation presents a valuable therapeutic strategy for melanoma. Based on the above observations, we hypothesize that causing ROS agglomeration in cells, either through depletion of antioxidants or by initiating uncontrolled ROS production, is a plausible strategy to selectively kill melanoma cells, and that -phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound known to disable cellular GSH antioxidant system, will be effective for this purpose. We showed that that PEITC exhibited potent inhibitory effect on malignant melanoma cells with an average IC50 value of approximately 3 M. Interestingly, MEL624 and HS294T cells, which are resistant to existing antitumor agents used in melanoma treatment such as AZD6244 and Vemurafenib, were highly sensitive to PEITC. The cell death was primarily apoptotic; the effect of PEITC could be partially reversed using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. Furthermore, treatment of cells with PEITC lead to an aberrant increase in reactive oxygen species levels, as evidenced by FACS analysis using the fluorescent ROS dyes DCF-DA, DAF-FM and dihyroethidium. ROS increase upon PEITC treatment occurred as early as one hour, indicating that seemed to a primary event leading to subsequent cell damage. This increase in ROS was associated with a decrease in the glutathione levels in cells, suggesting that depletion of the glutathione antioxidant could be the reason for the abnormal ROS elevation induced by PEITC. This was further verified by using PEITC in combination with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, which completely rescued the cells from the toxic effect of PEITC. Importantly, normal melanocytes were minimally sensitive to PEITC. In addition, combination of PEITC with other standard melanoma drugs like carmustine and temozolomide exhibited synergistic effect, suggesting the possibility of using this compound to overcome drug resistance. This was further validated through in vivo studies in mice, where a combination of PEITC with BCNU seemed to reduce the tumor burden. The cytotoxic effect of PEITC was also validated in primary cancer cells isolated from melanoma specimens from patients. Thus PEITC proves to be an effective antimelanoma agent that warrants further investigation.']",

To identify additional high-penetrance susceptibility genes for familial CMM, we performed whole exome sequencing in 101 CMM cases/obligate carriers in 56 unrelated melanoma-prone families recruited from the Romagna area in Italy. We identified a germline founder mutation in Protection Of Telomeres 1(POT1) (g.7', '124493086 C>T, p.S270N) in five unrelated melanoma-prone families. The mutation was also found in a single sporadic CMM case from Romagna out of 1,824 Italian cases examined, but it was not seen in public databases, our internal exome databases of over 1000 subjects, and 878 Spanish CMM cases and 3,489 controls (2,038 Italian and 1,451Spanish) genotyped. POT1 is a component of the telomeric shelterin complex that plays a critical role in maintaining telomere integrity and regulating telomere length. The p.S270N mutation is highly conserved among vertebrates and predicted to be deleterious by most computational programs we evaluated. Carriers of the p.S270N mutation had increased length and heterogeneity as well as increased average number of fragile telomeres in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA compared to age-matched CMM cases (controls) without the mutation. Exome sequencing analysis of Italian families also identified two other rare missense substitutions in POT1 (g.7', '124464052 C>G [p.Q623H] and g.7', '124503540 C>T [p.R137H]) that were found in all cases sequenced in two families.

Methods', ' Primary NM and SSM patients prospectively enrolled at NYU (2002 - 2016) were compared to the most recent SEER cohort (1973 - 2012) and analyzed with respect to MSS.

The effect of hotspot C250 or C242T/C243T tandem mutations on telomerase expression has not yet been determined. To assess telomerase expression levels in melanomas harboring C250 or C242T/C243T mutations, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in a sample set of pediatric melanocytic tumors for which the methylation status and the mutational profile of the TERT promoter were known.

Patients whose tumors have a high mutational burden have a better response to anti-CTLA-4 treatment with ipilimumab in melanoma5, and to anti-PD-1 treatment with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung6 and colorectal cancer7. These results suggest that a sufficiently high non-synonymous somatic mutation burden in the tumor may lead to protein alterations that serve as neo-antigens to stimulate CD8 T-cell immune response. This immune response may be blocked by the tumor by engaging the immune checkpoint pathway, making such tumors especially vulnerable to immune checkpoint disruption. However, the specific criteria to identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy have remained elusive so far.Using somatic mutation and RNA-Seq data from TCGA, we propose that there exists a mutational threshold, which we call the Activated Immune Mutational (AIM) Threshold, which can identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Compared to AIM- patients (potential non-responders), AIM+ patients (potential responders) have tumors that meet four criteria', ' (1) a high non-synonymous mutation burden; (2) a high level of immune infiltration in the tumor; (3) a high CD8 T cell fraction in the leukocyte component of the immune infiltrate plus high expression of the T cell marker CD8A; and (4) a high expression of immune checkpoint genes PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4.We find that in melanoma, endometrial, colon, cervical and breast cancer, a clear AIM threshold satisfying all four criteria exists. The distribution of mutations in AIM- versus AIM+ tumors for these cancers is very different. In the former, there are high frequency somatic mutations in only a few genes, while in the latter, high frequency somatic mutations are found in many genes distributed over the whole genome.Pathological analysis of high-resolution images from 150 TCGA tumors (30 from each of the five tumor types) validated the presence of significantly higher lymphocytic infiltration in the AIM+ tumors compared to AIM- tumors.

To address this question we induced colitis associated colon cancer in conditional PTEN-KO mice and found an increase in tumor burden and a reduction in survival in male KO mice. This was accompanied by increased numbers of splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the immune checkpoint regulators PD-L1 and PD-L2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis in these cells revealed a shift towards gene expression profiles found in professional APCs capable of cross-presentation. As expected, ex-vivo stimulated T-cells from KO-mice showed a reduction in proliferative capacity. These findings were further substantiated by findings in a second tumor model using implanted B16 melanoma cells. In this model myeloid PTEN-deficient mice showed a decrease in T-cell activation and a reduction in melanoma cell killing capacity.Taken together, our findings show that genetic deletion of PTEN in cells of myeloid origin increases splenic APCs expressing immune checkpoint regulators resulting in a decrease in tumor immune surveillance. Our study shows that PI3K-inhibitors which are currently tested as anti-cancer drugs might have additional beneficial effects on immune cells by shifting their inflammatory phenotype.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma shows frequent Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway activation via frequent mutations in NRAS and BRAF. Novel mutations in other components of this pathway such as MEK1, MEK2, MAP3K5, and MAP3K9 have been reported recently by high-throughput sequencing efforts. In addition, NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), one of the Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs), has been shown to be mutated or suppressed in melanoma. However, importance of other RasGAPs has not been addressed in melanoma.To obtain a comprehensive view of melanoma genomes, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 metastatic melanomas and matched normal PBMC genomes from 13 melanoma patients. All melanoma genomes from these 13 patients contained at least one mutation in genes of Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (MAPK1, MAP3K1, MAP4K2, MAP3K14, NRAS, and BRAF). Our whole genome analyses also identified two novel somatic missense mutations (p.Tyr472His and p.Leu481Phe) in or around the PH domain in RASA1 gene. RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator (GTPase activating protein) 1, also called as p120RasGAP) is a GTPase activation protein that negatively regulates Ras by catalyzing the hydrolysis of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP. In this study, we addressed possible roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. To determine RASA1 level in melanocytic lesions, immunohistochemical analysis of RASA1 on human melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) containing nevi (n=34), primary melanomas (n=63), lymph node metastasis (n=35), and distal metastasis (n=29) was performed. This analysis has shown the inverse correlation of RASA1 expression to melanoma progression. Functionally, ectopic expression of RASA1 mutant increased soft-agar colony formation and tumor growth while that of wild-type RASA1 decreased. shRNA-mediated knock down of RASA1 promoted soft-agar colony formation and invasion of melanocytes and melanoma cells with BRAF mutation as a consequence of the elevated Ras activity.Here, we established the functional significance of novel somatic missense mutations in RASA1 identified in our WGS study. Collectively, these data implicated that RASA1 inactivation by loss of expression and/or mutation may promote melanoma tumorigenesis.']",

Uveal melanoma is also notable for a characteristic set of driver mutations that cluster into two groups. The first group consists of mutually exclusive gain-of-function mutations in members of the Gαq signaling pathway (GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2 and PLCB4), which are present in almost all uveal melanomas. These mutations are not prognostic, and are thought to represent initiating events that are insufficient alone to cause full malignant transformation. The second group consists of near-mutually exclusive mutations in BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX. These are thought to occur later in tumor progression and are prognostic of patient outcome.

This analysis evaluated the association between baseline LDH levels and disease control (stable or reduced measurable tumor burden) in previously treated pts with M1c-stage melanoma (metastasis to vital organs other than the lungs) who received ipilimumab in 2 recently completed Phase II studies (CA184008 and 022).

Methods', ' Proteins isolated from 99 frozen melanoma tumors were measured by reverse phase protein arrays (RRPA). A total of 53 proteins were assessed using validated antibodies.

Results', ' Samples from 75 regional metastases (LN or in-transit) and 24 distant metastases were analyzed. Technical replicates (same lysate) and biological replicates (same tumor, different lysates) demonstrated average Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of > 0.90, supporting the high technical quality of the analysis. A positive correlation was observed between levels of p-AKT and known AKT substrates p-GSK3 and p-TSC2 (p < 0.001 for both), and a negative correlation with PTEN (p < 0.01), supporting the maintenance of phosphorylation events during sample processing. Relative differences in p-AKT by RPPA were also confirmed by immunohistochemistry of representative tumors. Tumors with BRAF mutations had higher levels of p-AKT than tumors with NRAS mutations (p = 0.03). Indeed, tumors with NRAS mutations had p-AKT levels similar to tumors wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (p =0.73). Detailed analysis demonstrated that all tumors with elevated p-AKT had low PTEN expression. Similar results were seen in human melanoma cell lines. Analysis of distant metastases demonstrated that brain metastases had higher levels of p-AKT, p-GSK3, and p-TSC2, and lower levels of PTEN, compared to metastases to the lung or liver.

The melanomas were divided based on known mutually exclusive mutations (BRAF, NRAS and KIT) vs those without (WT). We compared RNA data between each group. KIT group had significantly higher expression of KIT than BRAF, NRAS and WT (p<0.01, FDR<0.01) and isoform 2 expression was higher than 1.

We evaluated the tumors for the primary type of genetic damage. The three signatures that appeared most divergent were CC>TT for UV, (G/A)C(G)>(G/A)T(G) for deamination, and G>T for oxidative damage. UV and deamination appeared inversely proportional, while oxidative damage appeared to be independent of those other two features. KIT and WT had a greater% of non UV high deamination tumoral environments. A fraction of these tumors also had very high oxidative signatures. We then compared 2 KIT subgroups UV vs non UV (absence of CC>TT mutations) for germline ethnicity differences. Asian SNPs were highly increased in non UV subgroup whereas Caucasian SNPs were in UV subgroup. Further, we divided KIT non UV subgroup into deamination and oxidative damage subgroups and compared ethnicity differences. Deamination was significantly higher in Asians whereas oxidative damage was higher in Caucasians. A similar analysis was done to the WT group, where African SNPs were significantly increased in the non UV subgroup and were primarily associated with oxidative damage.

Despite current progress in the identification of promising drugs for treating melanoma, drug resistance has emerged as a serious issue indicating that novel therapeutic strategies may be required. It is well documented that the process of converting the epithelial tumorigenic cell to a mesenchymal phenotype, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is responsible for conferring an invasive phenotype to cancer cells. An EMT-like process has been shown to occur during melanoma progression. High-mobility-protein AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is a multi-function transcription factor linked to oncogenesis and EMT in a variety of cancers. HMGA2 is a small DNA-binding protein with three “AT-hook” DNA-binding motifs that specifically recognize the minor groove of AT-rich DNA sequences. HMGA2 is significantly upregulated in human primary melanoma and metastases, including those with BRAF mutations. We accessed the potential application of netropsin, a potent inhibitor of HMGA2-DNA interactions, as an EMT blocking agent of BRAF mutated melanoma cells. Three murine melanoma cells lines that carry mutations in the BRAF gene and show resistance to vemurafenib (D4M, YUMM1.1, and YUMM1.7) were used. Cells were treated with EMT Inducing Media Supplement along with Netropsin and the expression of E-cadherin as well as their migratory behavior were evaluated. Netropsin treatment of EMT induced cells was not cytotoxic, prevented changes in cell morphology, maintained high levels of E-cadherin expression and decreased migratory behavior. All three cell lines express HMGA2 which continues to be expressed in the tumors resulting from subcutaneous injections in mice. YUMM1.1 cells showed the highest levels of expression of HMGA2 amongst the three cell lines. Interestingly, in our preliminary study only YUMM1.1-derived tumors generated overt metastasis in the lung 30 days after the injections. Altogether our data showed that Netropsin is capable of blocking EMT of murine BRAF mutated melanoma cells.

Traditionally, activating RAS mutations have been considered oncogenically equivalent, yet recent studies suggest important clinical distinctions between colon cancers containing K-RAS codon 12 vs. codon 13 mutations. More than 20% of human melanomas harbor N-RAS mutations, the vast majority of which target codon 61, as opposed to N-RAS mutations of codon 12 or 13, which are common in other tumor types. To address this issue, we characterized syngeneic knock-in mouse models conditionally expressing either N-RasG12D or N-RasQ61R under the control of the endogenous locus. In primary melanocyte cultures, activation of either N-Ras allele reduced cellular proliferation even in the presence of concomitant p16INK4a deletion. Correspondingly, melanocyte-specific N-RasG12D expression combined with p16INK4a loss failed to efficiently promote melanoma formation in mice. In contrast, melanocyte-specific N-RasQ61R induction readily combined with p16INK4a loss to promote melanoma formation in vivo with short latency and high penetrance.

Cell free DNA (cfDNA) provides a commercially available, non-invasive mechanism for monitoring disease activity in malignancy.

It remains unclear if cfDNA can predict recurrent metastatic disease in high-risk uveal melanoma patients. Methods', ' We conductedan exploratory study of cfDNA following treatment for primary intraocular uveal melanoma. Three cohorts were investigated', ' high-risk patients ( > 50% estimated recurrence rate) with no clinical evidence of metastatic disease (cohort 1), patients with newly developed metastatic disease of the liver by surveillance MRI (cohort 2), patients with previously established metastatic disease (cohort 3). cfDNA profiles were provided by Guardant360 complete exon sequencing and analyzed for the presence of GNAQ/GNA11 mutations and MYC amplification which represent driver mutations present in > 80% of uveal melanomas. cfDNA was evaluated within 1 week of surveillance imaging studies. Results', ' Cohort 1 revealed no G-protein/MYC abnormalities by cfDNA (0/32). 34.4% (11/32) of patients in cohort 1 had mutations unrelated to G-protein/MYC. Cohort 2 showed a 10% (1/10) G-protein/MYC detection rate. Cohort 3 showed a G-protein MYC detection rate of 75% (18/24) which approaches the expected mutation rate in uveal melanoma. Interestingly, cfDNA did not detect G-protein/MYC abnormalities in hepatic tumors less than 2.0cm in diameter, regardless of cohort. Conclusions', ' MRI is a more sensitive screening test than cfDNA for detection of hepatic metastasis in uveal melanoma. cfDNA negative for G-protein/MYC alterations correlates with the absence of clinically detectable disease (100% specificity) and a positive result in the adjuvant setting should prompt further evaluation. This study suggests a detection threshold for cfDNA of > 2.0cm hepatic tumor diameter, which may have implications for the utilization of cfDNA across tumor types.']",

        "Background":"['The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) is an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy as it controls both immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-tumor T cells. We tested depleting Tregs as immunotherapy using anti-CD25 (high-affinity IL-2R subunit) antibodies (αCD25) in ID8agg mouse ovarian cancer (OC). αCD25 reduced ascites and Treg numbers but failed to reduce tumor burden, possibly because it depleted newly activated anti-tumor T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Thus, αCD25 could be novel malignant ascites palliation, but has limited stand-alone efficacy. We then tested IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL-2c) that selectively stimulate medium-affinity (CD122/CD132) IL-2R thought to expand anti-tumor T cells preferentially, but with little Treg effects. In contrast to several single agents we tested that failed to treat ID8agg (e.g., αCD25, αPD-L1, IL-2 fusion toxin denileukin diftitox), IL-2c alone durably reduced ID8agg tumor burden despite lowering the tumor microenvironmental CD8+/Treg ratio. Thus, we hypothesized that IL-2c improved CD8+ function, reduced Treg function, or both. IL-2c increased polyfunctional IFN-γ+TNF-α+ anti-tumor T cells as expected, an effect that persists weeks after drug clearance. IL-2c also increased anti-tumor T cell CD25 expression that increased IL-2 sensitivity and STAT5 phosphorylation, a likely mechanism for increased polyfunctionality. Unexpectedly, IL-2c reduced the Treg functional mediators CD25, TIGIT and granzyme B, and reduced Treg suppressive function. Thus, favorable Treg modifications are a novel IL-2c mechanism of action. Adding αCD25 to IL-2c to deplete Tregs further unexpectedly worsened IL-2c efficacy in ID8agg and reduced effector memory T cells and polyfunctional T cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for CD25 in IL-2c therapy. Similar data were seen in B16 melanoma, suggesting αCD25 reduction of IL-2c efficacy is not tumor or compartment-specific (ID8agg is peritoneal and B16 is subcutaneous). αPD-L1, an ineffective monotherapy in ID8agg, combined with IL-2c to promote complete responses, suggesting potential for potent, novel combinatorial approaches. Our data suggest that antagonizing high affinity IL-2R (such as to deplete Tregs with αCD25) has limited cancer immunotherapy utility without more specific Treg targeting. In contrast, stimulating medium-affinity IL-2R with CD122-selective IL-2c has great translational promise by simultaneously improving beneficial anti-tumor T cells and reducing detrimental Treg function.']",

        "Background":"['Hyperactivation of the Ras/Raf/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been commonly observed in melanoma via frequent activating mutations in NRAS and BRAF. Novel mutations in other components of this pathway such as MEK1, MEK2, MAP3K5, and MAP3K9 have been reported recently by high-throughput sequencing efforts. In addition, Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs) that negatively regulate Ras, such as NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1) and RASA2, have been shown to be mutated or suppressed in melanoma. However, importance of other RasGAPs in melanoma has not been addressed.To obtain a comprehensive view of melanoma genomes, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 metastatic melanomas and matched normal PBMC genomes from 13 melanoma patients. All melanoma genomes from these 13 patients contained at least one mutation in genes of Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (MAPK1, MAP3K1, MAP4K2, MAP3K14, NRAS, and BRAF). In addition, we identified two novel, clustered somatic missense mutations (p.Tyr472His and p.Leu481Phe) in RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, p120RasGAP). In this study, we addressed functional roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. The RNAi-mediated down-regulation of RASA1 promoted, while ectopic expression of wild type RASA1 decreased, anchorage-independent colony formation, tumor growth, and RAS activation. Interestingly, RASA1 Y472H mutant enhanced soft agar colony formation and tumor growth, while RASA1 L481F mutant lost its tumor suppressive activity. Mechanistically, RASA1 required RasGAP activity to suppress colony formation and showed higher activity toward R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform among the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Moreover, RASA1 consistently suppressed Ral-A among Ras downstream effectors. Reduced R-Ras or Ral-A expression via siRNAs suppressed anchorage-independent growth induced by RASA1 loss. Interestingly, RASA1 expression was frequently down-regulated in metastatic melanoma samples (11.4% (4/35) of lymph node metastasis and 3.4% (1/29) of distal metastases) compared to primary melanomas (33.3% (21/63)) and dysplastic nevi (44.1% (15/34)). We also observed significantly shorter overall survival of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations when RASA1 mRNA expression is low, which may be explained by possible cooperative interactions between activation of BRAF/MAPK/ERK and RASA1/R-Ras/Ral-A pathways. Taken together, these data support that RASA1 is a novel melanoma tumor suppressor that is inactivated by suppressed expression or by mutation.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', 'Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer presenting in approximately 50% of cases activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene. For these patients new therapeutic options are represented by the combination of BRAF inhibitors and MEK-inhibitors. However, a major limitation is the occurrence of resistance related in the majority of cases to mutations causing either reactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway or of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway. This complex scenario is worsened by the absence, in a significant proportion of cases, of new mutations. This suggests the involvement also of epigenetic or post-transcriptional changes at the basis of resistance. We have focused our attention over the past years to adaptive changes occurring in melanoma cells upon exposure to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors in order to identify new therapeutic targets. Here we hypothesize that miRNAs deregulation upon cell exposure to kinase inhibitors may contribute to the development of drug resistance.Experimental procedures', 'The involvement of specific miRNAs in the establishment of drug resistance in melanoma was investigated through the online software miR while target predictions were performed with TargetScan and microrna.org. Impact on melanoma cell growth, migration and establishment of drug resistance was assessed through enforced-transient miR overexpression. Tumor biopsies were obtained from patients before therapy with kinase inhibitors or after relapse and used for RNA extraction.Results', 'We identified by bioinformatics analysis a novel miRNA, miR-579-3p, relevant for BRAF mutated melanoma progression and found that it targets both BRAF, the relevant oncoprotein in these melanomas, and MDM2. miR-579-3p expression levels are high in nevi, heavily decline in stage III-IV melanomas and further decrease in melanomacells selected in vitro for resistance to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors. Through in vitro studies we obtained evidence that mir-579-3p is able to inhibit melanoma cell growth and migration and to induce apoptosis alone or in combination with BRAF and/or MEKi. Moreover we found that miR-579-3p overexpression impairs the establishment of resistance to BRAFi in human melanoma cells. Finally we found this miR to be down-regulated in tumor samples obtained from patients who developed resistance to target therapies and its expression to be inversely correlated to the expression levels of its target genes, BRAF and MDM2.Conclusions', 'Our results strongly demonstrate that miR-579-3p is a novel oncosuppressor miRNA, controlling melanoma progression and development of drug resistance and which could be used as a new therapeutic target for intervention.']",

        "Background":"['Our pre-clinical in vitro data suggested that all BRAF-mutated cell lines, and some NRAS-mutated melanoma are sensitive to MEK inhibition. BRAFwt/NRASwt were uniformly resistant. Among the sensitive cell lines, those with enhanced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway did not undergo apoptosis. This is consistent with a recent phase II trial with Selumetinib, an allosteric MEK inhibitor, which showed a 6% response rate in unselected melanoma patients. Retrospectively, 5 of 6 of the responders were found to harbor BRAFV600E mutations. We hypothesized that treatment of BRAF-mutated or NRAS-mutated melanomas with Selumetinib will induce clinical responses only in the subset of tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is not activated. In this phase II trial, melanoma patients with either BRAF or NRAS mutation were stratified based on phospho-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low), as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of pre-treatment tumor specimens. Patients were treated with Selumetinib 75 mg p.o. daily in 28-day cycles. We found that the incidence of high pAKT melanoma tumors was about 4 times higher than low pAKT tumors. None of the 10 patients in the high pAKT cohort responded, although 4 patients showed stable disease for 4 months. This cohort was closed to further accrual. In contrast, in the low pAKT group, 1 patient had a true partial response (PR) and 2 others had near PRs. One of these patients had to discontinue treatment due to toxicity; the other had his remaining tumor resected. This cohort was closed due to slow patient accrual. We used an exon capture, next-generation sequencing assay to define the mutational status of 230 cancer associated genes in pre-treatment tumors, derived from patients belonging to both cohorts. The assay detects point mutations, small indels and copy number alterations. Among the two low pAKT patients who were resistant to MEK inhibition, one had a mutation in MAP2K1 that encodes for a K57N mutation in helix A of MEK1. We speculate that this is an activating mutation, since a missense mutation in the amino acid just proximal (Q56P) was previously shown to be highly activating. The other non-responding patient in the low pAKT cohort had an activating mutation in EGFR. Both of these could drive increased activation of the MAPK pathway, thus explaining the resistance to the drug. We conclude that future trials with MEK inhibitors in melanoma should exclude patients with high pAKT tumors. The occurrence of complex genetic changes in melanoma requires studies to better stratify the patients according the prediction of response to MEK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is increasing in incidence by up to 3% annually, and metastatic melanoma, which is resistant to most conventional therapies, has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Immunotherapy is able to yield durable response in melanoma; however, the response rate is limited (20-30%). It has been shown that tumor immunogenicity is highly correlated to the response to immunotherapy. The mutational load and the characteristics of the neoantigens displayed by the tumor cells are theorized to play an important role in the immunogenicity of the tumor. We used genetically engineered preclinical mouse models to study the role of these neoantigens in melanoma response to immune therapy. Three syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse melanoma models were developed', ' UV induced melanoma in albino BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- mice (1), DMBA induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) mice (2), and UV induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg mice. These three models were found to have varying degrees of tumor immunogenicity based on vaccination studies. The UV induced BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- model displayed poor immunogenicity, while the DMBA induced HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) model exhibited moderate immunogenicity and the UV induced HGF-tg model showed the highest immunogenicity. Exome sequencing results showed that high immunogenicity is associated with mutations of genes in DNA damage responses and frameshift mutations. To test the role of neoantigens, RNA from each of the melanoma models was sequenced and analyzed for mutational and expression profiles. We will be comparing the response of these three mouse models to correlate immunogenicity with response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We plan to analyze the pathways in which mutated genes were enriched, allowing the identification of druggable targets to enhance therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CRISPR/Cas9-based screening approaches will be used to identify specific neoantigens able to influence response to immune therapy. In conclusion, our preclinical mouse models show that tumor immunogenicity may be correlated to the carcinogenic mechanisms, and RNA sequence has provided further insight into the role of mutational load and neo-epitopes on immune-based therapeutic response.(1) Provided by Marcus Bosenberg (Yale School of Medicine, New Heaven, CT), Martin McMahon (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT).(2) Provided by Thomas Tueting (University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany).']",

Results', ' The study included 697 MM, 17,756 non-MM (mean age 56.1 and 54.4 yrs respectively) and their matched NC controls. For MM patients vs. NC controls, PPPM utilization was 2-7 times higher for inpatient (0.07 vs. 0.01), out-patient (2.42 vs. 0.64), and office visits (1.05 vs. 0.41), all with p < 0.0001, but similar for emergency room (ER) visits (0.10 vs. 0.07, p = 0.51). For non-MM vs. NC, utilization was similar for ER (0.06 vs. 0.07, p = 0.86) and inpatient visits (0.0103 vs. 0.0105, p = 0.98), and marginally higher for outpatient (1.08 vs. 0.59, p < 0.0001) and office (0.65 vs. 0.40, p < 0.0001) visits. The PPPM total cost was 7.5 times higher for MM vs. NC ($3,118 vs. $415, p < 0.0001) and 1.7 times higher for non-MM vs. NC ($562 vs. $340, p < 0.0001).

        "Background":"['Despite the prevalence of recurrent, high activating BRAF V600 mutations in 45% of tumors, cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a heterogeneous malignancy resulting from aberrant signaling in multiple pathways. It has been traditionally characterized by activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle disruption. In recent years, whole-genome and exome sequencing studies have identified several new genes associated with melanomagenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of concurrent, and mutually exclusive, mutations in tumors is currently lacking. Using a custom targeted capture of 108 genes previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, massively parallel sequencing was performed on 94 human melanoma cell lines, 67 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 5 cell lines made from PDX, all untreated. Samples were then clustered into groups based on deleterious mutations. 83% of samples had deleterious mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 92 high activity BRAF (55%), 35 RAS codon 61 (21%), 7 with multiple mutations (e.g. low activity BRAF/RAS codons 12/13) (4%) and 10 NF1 (6%) mutated samples. Likely deleterious NF1 mutations were found in several BRAF or NRAS-mutated samples. PI3K pathway mutations were found in 10% of samples, predominantly associated with BRAF mutations. TP53 mutations were found in 24% of samples and were associated with all MAPK signaling mutations. Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A/1B, ARID2, TRRAP, and BAP1) were mutually exclusive with each other and primarily found in tumors with high activity BRAF or NRAS mutations. The majority of BRAF or RAS-mutated samples with a mutation in a chromatin remodeling gene lacked mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and PI3K signaling genes; however, 100% of deleterious, or likely deleterious, NF1-mutated samples with a chromatin remodeling gene mutation harbored additional mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and/or PI3K signaling genes. Of particular interest, five of the 10 NF1-mutated samples (50%) lacked BRAF, RAS, and MEK1/2 mutations but harbored likely deleterious mutations in MAP3K5 or MAP3K9, suggesting the potential involvement of the JNK signal transduction pathway in this particular cohort. Only 4% of samples did not have a deleterious mutation in any of the genes on the panel. These data reveal novel insights into the genetics of melanomas lacking a canonical BRAF V600 mutation. Functional assays are needed to confirm the biological relevance of likely deleterious mutations, which will further facilitate a more thorough classification of CM subsets.']",

Increased tumor neo-antigenic burden has been linked to PD1/PD-L1 therapeutic response in several conditions including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma and microsatellite instable (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the challenges and high cost associated with neo-antigen discovery has shifted focus towards more efficient methods of response stratification. As such, mutational burden determination from whole exome sequencing and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) has emerged as a potential solution. In CRC, MSI-H may serve as a predictive biomarker for activity of PD1/PD-L1 therapy, reflecting an unquantified immunogenic mutational burden. Herein, we explore the ability to quantify tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a potential predictive biomarker of PD1/PD-L1 therapy in CRC. Methods', ' Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections from 2013 cases of CRC were sequenced with CGP (FoundationOne assay). MSI status and PD-L1 gene amplification were determined as previously described. TMB was calculated by counting mutations across a 1.25Mb region spanning 315 genes. Patients were classified as TMB high or low using the top quartile threshold and microsatellite instable (MSI-H) or stable (MSS) using a computational algorithm developed by Foundation Medicine. Results', ' MSS tumors were observed in 1934 of 2013 (95.2%) cases and MSI-H tumors were observed in 79 of 2013 (3.9%) cases. 79 of 79 (100%) MSI-H cases were TMB high (range 16.8-72.7 mut./Mb) and 1510 of 1934 (78.1%) MSS cases were TMB low (range 0.0-8.0 mut./Mb). Consequently, 424 of 1934 (21.9%) MSS cases were confirmed as TMB high (range 8.8-43.1 mut./Mb). Of note, less than 0.1% of cases featured PD-L1 gene amplifications. Conclusions', ' Tumor mutational burden as estimated by CGP, as opposed to MSI assessment alone, significantly increases the number of patients with metastatic CRC who may benefit from checkpoint inhibitor based therapeutic approaches.

Here, we investigated whether deletion of this transcription factor in a mouse model expressing mutant N-RasQ61K transgene under the control of the tyrosinase promoter in combination with a homozygous CDKN2A deletion, leads to modified melanoma formation. Interestingly, we found decreased survival in male mice that do not express STAT3 in melanoma cells. We analyzed primary tumor development, metastasis, and survival using histo-pathological examination between groups of STAT3 positive and negative mice.To further assess whether the enhanced tumor progression upon loss of STAT3 is a cell autonomous effect we established melanoma cell lines derived from mouse tumors with or without STAT3.

However, most of these studies remain descriptive without further functional and clinical validation of the candidate alterations, mainly due to the overwhelming number of somatic alterations present. To discover novel driver mutations of melanoma, massively parallel whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to characterize 15 metastatic melanomas derived from 13 patients. A large number of somatic alterations were discovered in these tumors and hybridization capture-based validation confirmed 17,361 tier 1 point mutations, 84 tier 1 indels, and 411 somatic structural variants. As a pilot study to exploit this genomic data in order to identify novel genetic alterations driving melanoma tumorigenesis, we performed mutation proximity analysis to select candidates for further analysis. In this study, we addressed possible roles of DBC1 (Deleted in Bladder Cancer 1) and RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1), which showed previously undocumented neighboring mutations. RASA1 is a GTPase activation protein that acts as a suppressor of RAS function. RASA1 has been implicated in actin filament polymerization, vascular development, cellular apoptosis, and cell motility. Our whole-genome analyses of melanomas identified two somatic missense mutations, targeting highly conserved neighboring Y472 and L481 in or around the PH domain in RASA1 in two samples. DBC1, also called BRINP, DBCCR1, and FAM5A, was previously shown to undergo loss of heterozygosity at 9q32-q33 in bladder cancer, and methylation silencing in bladder, breast, and lung cancers. Ectopic expression of DBC1 in bladder and lung cancer cells was reported to cause cell death and to inhibit cell proliferation, respectively. We observed six DBC1 missense mutations by whole genome analyses in four patients, including 2 neighboring mutations targeting S688 and S690. The shRNA-mediated knock down of DBC1 and RASA1 in melanocyte derived from Ink4a/Arf deletion/BRAF mutation background promoted proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and invasion. Ectopic expression of wild type DBC1 and RASA1 in human melanoma cell lines SKmel28 and WM983C (all with BRAFV600E), respectively, decreased soft agar colony formation, supporting their tumor suppressive roles. Various mutant forms of RASA1 and DBC1 were addressed for their roles. Interestingly, loss of RASA1 conferred decreased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib. In order to address the mutation frequency of DBC1 and RASA1, we analyzed additional melanoma samples and observed mutation rates of 21% for DBC1 (20/96 patients) and 9% for RASA1 (20/221). Therefore, our findings support that DBC1 and RASA1 play roles in melanoma suppression and the utility of genomic data for the identification of novel genes involved in tumorigenesis.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is the major cause of skin cancer death, and the annual incidence of melanoma continues to increase. Despite the impressively high rates of response to BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanomas harboring BRAF mutations, most of these patients eventually relapse after developing resistance to the drug, due in part to secondary mutations in NRAS. Although NRAS mutation is the second most common genetic mutation in melanoma patients (after BRAF mutation), there is currently no treatment option that targets NRAS-mutated melanomas. New targeted therapies are urgently needed. Our previous reports have demonstrated the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cell lines carrying oncogenic KRAS mutations to apoptosis initiated by inhibition of protein kinase C delta (PKCd), suggesting that PKCd inhibitors might be effective in melanomas with primary or acquired NRAS mutations. PKCd is not required for normal mammalian development, making it a potential tumor-specific target. In this study, we investigated the effect of PKCd inhibition, and the efficacy of a new PKCd inhibitor BJE6-106 (B106), in melanoma. Inhibition of PKCd by B106 (at nano-molar concentrations), or by siRNA, inhibited the growth of multiple melanoma cell lines carrying NRAS mutations, and induced apoptosis mediated by terminal caspase activation. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in this NRAS signaling-targeted approach demonstrated activation of the JNK pathway after PKCd inhibition, leading to the activation (phosphorylation) of H2AX, a histone H2A variant. Activation of H2AX was attenuated when JNK1/2 levels were repressed, indicating that H2AX activation is mediated by the JNK pathway in response to PKCd inhibition. Although the phosphorylation of H2AX has in the past been primarily known for its role in repair of DNA double strand breakage, more recent studies have proposed an active role for phospho-H2AX in the induction of apoptosis. Consistent with these reports, knockdown of H2AX prior to inhibition of PKCd mitigated the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. To explore the potential activity of new PKCd inhibitors in inhibitor-resistant BRAF-mutant tumors, we derived melanoma cell lines harboring BRAF mutations that evolved resistance to a BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib). B106 effectively induced cytotoxicity in these cells, suggesting the potential clinical application of targeting PKCd in patients who have relapsed following treatment with PLX4032. Taken together, our present study suggests that inhibition of PKCd causes caspase-dependent apoptosis in melanomas with NRAS mutations and in PLX4032-resistant BRAF mutant melanomas. This apoptosis is mediated via activation of the JNK-H2AX pathway, which involves a novel role for phospho-H2AX in the execution of apoptosis.']",

Finally, we analyzed TERT expression in these tumors.The mutation frequencies observed confirmed the prevalence of GNAQ mutations in cases with disomy of chromosome 3 that have a better prognosis whereas GNA11 was more frequent in monosomic cases. Together these two mutations account for more than 85% of the cases. BAP1 mutations are associated with chromosome 3 monosomy but not with progression free survival. SF3B1 and EIF1AX mutations occur in 10.3 and 22.5% of uveal melanomas, in disomic cases only.

These gain-in-function mutations in the ras gene or constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase receptors upstream of the Ras protein drive tumor cell growth by activating Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Ras has been an elusive drug target for which no inhibitors are available to treat Ras-driven cancers. Screening a library of indene derivatives in a differential phenotypic assay identified a novel compound class displaying high potency and selectivity to inhibit the growth of tumor cells harboring mutant Ras relative to tumor cells with wild type (WT) Ras. Lead optimization resulted in a drug development candidate (DC070-547) and several back-up analogs (e.g. ADT-006) with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range and selectivity indices of 100 fold or greater to inhibit the growth of tumor cells with constitutively activated Ras relative to tumor cells with low levels of activated Ras. Sensitivity among a large panel of tumor cell lines to this compound class strongly correlated with levels of activated Ras, but did not appear to be limited to a specific ras gene mutation or Ras protein isoform. Here, we report that DC070-547 and ADT-006 potently and selectively inhibit the growth of the human melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-2, harboring a mutation in the ras gene that encodes the constitutively active N-Ras protein with IC50 values of 7 and 25 nM, respectively. In addition, both compounds potently inhibited the growth of the murine melanoma cell line, B16-F10 with WT ras, but harboring a mutation in a tyrosine kinase receptor upstream of Ras, specifically PDGFRα, which results in high levels of active, GTP-bound Ras as confirmed by Ras-RBD pull-down assays. To determine if treatment can disrupt Ras signaling, B16-F10 cells were incubated with the compounds before being subjected to Western blotting for phosphorylated signaling molecules downstream of Ras. Treatment reduced levels of phosphorylated c-Raf and MEK at concentrations that inhibit tumor cell growth.

It is associated with a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanoma, with higher proportions of patients developing metastatic disease. Combination treatments targeting the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway and immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved overall survival in patients with stage IV disease. However, resistance to both modalities remains a challenge. This is exemplified by our comprehensive analysis of a patient presenting with acral melanoma that developed resistance to both immune and targeted therapy.The patient developed metastatic disease in multiple sites and we obtained fresh tumour tissue and generated cell lines from a skin metastasis at baseline prior to nivolumab. Following an initial complete response, the patient developed new mediastinal lymph node and brain metastases, which were also resected. On further relapse, the patient commenced dabrafenib with a partial response. Despite ongoing extra-cranial control, the brain lesion progressed and was therefore resected.To investigate resistance to immune therapy, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis and gene expression profiling on the lesions from the three sites, which identified common mutations in all three lesions and a low overall mutational burden consistent with acral melanoma. Heterogeneity of the MHC class I and II restricted antigen profile of the pre-treatment subcutaneous metastasis versus lymph node and brain progressions could not account for the development of resistance to immunotherapy. Gene expression profiling revealed up-regulation of known mechanisms of immune tolerance in both the lymph node and brain metastasis compared to the pre-treatment subcutaneous metastasis.To investigate resistance to targeted therapy, we compared patient-derived cell lines from brain lesions taken pre (DabS) and on progression on dabrafenib (DabR), and showed ongoing sensitivity to dabrafenib despite the patient having progressed in the brain. When cells from the DabR cell line were cultured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the presence of dabrafenib, we observed a reduction in cell death. Thus, extrinsic factors present in CSF may have resulted in the progression of the brain lesion in this patient.Using a combination of platforms to study patient derived tissues, we show that immune editing through selection of cells with an immune resistant phenotype may have resulted in the resistance of this patient's tumours to immune therapy whilst resistance to MAPK targeted therapy could have been mediated by extrinsic factors in the CSF.\"]",

Benign melanocytic nevi are nearly universal, and although progression of nevi to melanoma is very rare, 20-50% of melanoma appear to arise from a pre-existing nevus. UV exposure, particularly childhood sunburn, is believed to play an important role in the development of melanocytic nevi and melanoma, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Alterations in MAPK pathway genes, especially NRAS and BRAF, are common in both benign nevi and melanoma, but approximately 1/3 of melanomas do not have an identified driver mutation. Studying nevus initiation and progression prospectively in the human population is impractical due to the long latency to progression and repeated UV exposures Our laboratory has developed a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) genetically engineered mouse model with “humanized” junctional distribution of melanocytes on an iDCT-GFP background with melanocyte-specific GFP expression, allowing melanocytic lesions to be tracked through percutaneous GFP imaging. Following a single relevant dose of UV modeling childhood sunburn, HGF iDCT-GFP develop discrete, small melanocytic lesions consistent with nevi. Most nevi remain stable over the lifetime of the mouse, but around 1 in 30 progress to melanoma usually starting at 6-12 months. The melanocytic lesions are histologically similar to human nevi and melanoma, label with melanocyte markers and tumors are transplantable into syngeneic mice. Melanomas that arise in the model are heterogeneous and include radial growth phase and vertical growth phase tumors and sometimes metastasize to liver and lung. Exome sequencing of 28 nevi and melanomas show that vertical growth phase melanomas have approximately 3x more mutations than radial growth phase melanomas or nevi. The increased number of mutations in vertical growth phase tumors is due to an increase in C>T transitions despite the lack of additional UV exposure. Interestingly, melanocytic nevi and melanomas with DNA repair pathway mutations average 3x more mutations than lesions without mutations in these pathways. Melanomas sometime contain mutations in hotspot locations from human melanomas, including GNAQ, but most do not have a previously identified dominant driver. Genes potentially involved in the initiation of melanocytic lesions or progression to aggressive melanomas and relevant to human melanoma have been identified and are being functionally tested using CRISPR to introduce point mutations or knock out genes and in vitro skin reconstitution assays.

A subset of the nonsynonymous SNPs was validated by direct sequencing, resulting in the identification of a somatic BRAF L597R mutation. Surrogate kinase assays suggest that this mutant is sensitive to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Subsequent mutational analyses showed that BRAF L597 mutations were in 2 of 34 (6%) pan-negative tumors. Collectively, these data demonstrate the frequency and potential therapeutic implications of BRAF L597 mutations in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  V600E and V600K mutations are the most common BRAF mutations in melanoma. We previously showed that non-V600 BRAF mutations account for 12% of all BRAF mutations in melanoma. Limited clinical data are available for non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. To better understand non-V600 BRAF mutations in melanoma, characteristics of tumor and clinical outcomes were investigated.  Methods', \"  Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively in patients (pts) with melanoma who had multi-gene mutation analysis (next-gene sequencing) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Fisher's exact test was used for all comparisons.  Results\", '  We found 52 pts with non-V600 BRAF mutations, among whom 8 had NRAS/non-V600 co-mutations. Common non-V600 mutations were K601E (17.3%), G469E (15.4%), G469R (7.7%), D594G (5.8%), L597S (5.8%), and S467L (5.8%). Compared with V600E mutations as a control (n=82) , the presence of a non-V600 mutations was significantly associated with older age (median, 58 years vs 50; P=0.001), less superficial spreading type (13.6% vs 32.9%; P=0.02), more lentigo maligna type (20% vs 1.2%; P=0.001), more mucosal subtype (9.1% vs 1.2%; P=0.03), more head/neck primary tumor location (36.4% vs 15.9%; P=0.03), less lower extremity primary tumor location (4.5% vs 24.4%; P=0.003), more co-mutations with NRAS (15.4% vs 2.4%, p=0.005) and stage IV disease at initial diagnosis (31.8% vs 7.3%; P=0.0003).  Among the 33 pts with non-V600 mutant metastatic melanoma, 7 received selective BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi). Of the 5 evaluable patients (2 could not tolerate treatment), all had disease progression within 2 months.  Conclusions', '  Non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas have more aggressive clinical characteristics, more likely to have co-mutations with NRAS, and not responsive to selective BRAFi than V600E mutations.  A larger cohort and a longer follow-up will better define the prognostic indication of non-V600 mutated melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF gene mutations have been observed in 30-70% of malignant melanoma patients. Recent development of therapeutic intervention using BRAF inhibitors requires an accurate and rapid detection system for BRAF mutations. In addition, there are only a few reports that investigated the clinical characteristics of the melanoma associated with BRAF mutations in Japanese patients on a large scale evaluation. We recently established quenching probe system (QP) for detection of an activating BRAF mutation, V600E and evaluated 113 melanoma samples diagnosed in Saga University Hospital from 1982 to 2011. The QP system includes fully automated genotyping, based on analysis of the probe DNA melting curve, which binds the target mutated site using a fluorescent guanine quenched probe. BRAF mutations were detected in 54 of 115 (47%) including 51 of V600E and 3 of V600K in Japanese melanoma cases. Among clinical subtypes of melanoma, nodular melanoma showed high frequency (12 of 15; 80%) of mutation followed by superficial spreading melanoma (13 of 26; 50%). The QP system is a simple and sensitive method to determine BRAF V600E mutation, and will be useful tool for patient-oriented therapy with BRAF inhibitors.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Defining the role of PAK7 variants in melanoma",
        "Background":"['Melanoma mortality is directly linked to its profoundly metastatic nature and inherent resistance to conventional chemotherapy. For this reason, increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving melanoma progression is of utmost importance. The p21-activated serine/threonine kinases (PAKs) are frequently mutated or overexpressed in cancer and have recently been implicated in tumor metastasis, proliferation, and apoptotic resistance. This observation has inspired drug discovery efforts to limit PAK activity; yet, mechanistic understanding of how PAKs (especially Type II PAKs) contribute to tumor initiation and progression is still evolving. PAK7, a type II PAK, is mutated in 16-18% of all melanomas. Melanoma-associated PAK7 mutations occur throughout the gene and have unknown biochemical and physiological consequences. The objective of this study was to determine how tumor-associated PAK7 variants mechanistically contribute to melanoma initiation and progression. First, we characterized PAK7 protein expression in a panel of 39 melanoma cell lines and primary melanocyte cultures. PAK7 levels were similar in both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells and failed to correlate with the status of common melanoma driver mutations (e.g. NRASQ61, BRAFV600). In an array of 101 human tumor biopsies, PAK7 expression did not significantly change with advancing melanoma stage; however, PAK7 levels were higher in regional lymph node biopsies when compared to primary skin lesions. Since mutation is the predominant mechanism affecting PAK7 in melanoma, we investigated the biochemical and physiological consequences of common PAK7 variants. 11 distinct PAK7 mutations were stably expressed at low levels in VMM39 (melanoma) and NCI-H441 (lung) cells. Using these clones, changes in the phosphorylation of downstream PAK7 targets associated with cellular migration (p120), proliferation (CRAF), and apoptotic resistance (BAD, MDM2) were examined. In addition, we defined phenotypic alterations in cellular morphology, proliferation, migration, and apoptotic resistance associated with the expression of each mutant. These data allowed us to classify PAK7 variants of unknown significance into groups associated with specific cellular outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to functionally characterize a wide variety of melanoma-associated PAK7 mutations and represents a critical first step in understanding how this kinase contributes to tumor initiation and progression.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  The discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2) gene is mutated in a subset of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. In lung cancer, targeting of DDR2 with the inhibitor dasatinib has been shown to inhibit DDR2-mutated cell line growth. Responses to dasatinib in DDR2-mutated lung tumors are currently being investigated in clinical trials. We investigated whether somatic DDR2 mutations also occur in melanomas using a set of different clinical subtypes bearing a variety of melanoma-associated molecular alterations.  Methods', '  DNA was extracted from macrodissected FFPE sections of 168 melanomas and subjected to next-generation sequencing using a custom-designed 36-amplicon panel including the coding regions of DDR2 and exons 11 and 15 of BRAF. PCR products were prepared by Access Array, sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM, and analyzed using Sequence Pilot software.  All DDR2 mutations were confirmed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. Relative expression analysis of the DDR2 gene was performed using RT-PCR on RNA extracted from FFPE sections, with levels normalized to ABL1 and GAPDH.  Results', '  Heterozygous DDR2 point mutations were identified in 3.4% of BRAF-mutated melanoma (n=117) but not in any cases that lacked BRAF mutations (n = 51).  All DDR2-mutated melanomas were advanced stage with lymph node and/or extensive soft tissue involvement and included both BRAF V600K and V600E cases. In contrast to the range of mutation sites reported in lung cancers, DDR2 mutations in melanoma (I488S, F574C, S667F and L701F) were at highly evolutionarily conserved positions in the kinase domain. The mutations are expected to be disruptive and may therefore modulate kinase activity.  DDR2 transcripts were expressed in tumor cells in all mutated cases.  Conclusions', '  DDR2 mutations in advanced stage melanoma may provide a targetable genetic feature for tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib. The invariant association of DDR2 mutation with activating BRAF mutations suggests synergy in transformation between these distinct signaling pathways.']",

        "Background":"['Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is an etiologically heterogeneous disease with genetic, host, environmental factors, and their interactions contributing to its development. CDKN2A and CDK4 are the two established major susceptibility genes for melanoma identified so far. Recent evidence suggests that copy number variations (CNVs) may contribute to disease susceptibility in several inherited diseases including cancer. The goals of this study were 1) to assess whether the frequency of CNVs varied by CMM or CDKN2A/CDK4 mutation status; and 2) to identify rare CNVs that were related to melanoma predisposition in these high-risk families. We used genome-wide tiling CGH arrays (Nimblegen 720K exon-focused) to investigate characteristics of CNVs in 174 CMM cases, 44 high-risk unaffected family members (with dysplastic nevi/large number of moles or germline CDKN2A mutations), and 48 unrelated spouses from 50 American melanoma-prone families (21 CDKN2A+, 2 CDK4+, 27 mutation negative). We used the Nexus Copy Number built-in FASST2 algorithm to identify significant CNVs (significant threshold = 0.000001; minimal number of probes per segment = 5; log2 ratio>0.3 for gains and -0.3 for losses). We found that the median number of total CNVs, or gains or losses separately, did not show significant differences in CMM cases, high-risk unaffected family members, and unrelated controls. Among CMM cases, CNV frequencies were not significantly associated with germline CDKN2A/CDK4 mutation status, age at melanoma diagnosis, or number of melanomas. Similar results were obtained when number of genes and lengths of DNA segments affected by CNVs were analyzed. Restriction to large CNVs (>10 kb or >100 kb) or rare CNVs (not reported in the Toronto CNV database) did not change results significantly. On the other hand, we identified several rare large CNVs (>10 kb, not reported in unrelated controls) that either involved known melanoma genes or co-segregated with melanoma (observed in multiple CMM cases) within families. These included a 1.3Mb deletion in PARP1 in a single CMM case, a 10 kb deletion in CDKN2A in 4 of 5 CMM cases and two obligate gene carriers in a large family that was negative for CDKN2A mutations by sequencing, a 175 kb deletion in LINGO2 in 2 of 3 CMM cases in one family, a 10 kb deletion in 8q24 in 3 of 4 CMM cases in one family, a 110 kb deletion in 2q22.1 in all three cases in a family, and a 57 kb duplication in 4q32.2 in all five cases in a CDKN2A mutation positive family. The role of these CNVs, particularly those involving genes that have unknown function related to CMM development, in CMM susceptibility remain to be investigated.']",
