Here we report the antitumor activities of icotinib, a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), as second-line treatment for advanced esophageal cancer with EGFR over-expression or amplification. Methods', '    In this phase II, single-arm study, eligible patients were adults with advanced esophageal cancer confirmed by histology, who had received at least first-line chemotherapy, with EGFR over-expression [immunohistochemistry (IHC), 3+] or amplification [positive fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH)]. Participants were treated with oral icotinib (250 mg, three times daily).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR).  Results', '    Between December, 2013 and January, 2015, 38 patients were enrolled (37 with squamous cell carcinoma, 1 with adenocarcinoma) with a median age of 60, in which 36 were IHC 3+ (94.7%) and 2 were IHC 2+ with positive FISH. And as of the December 31, 2014 cutoff, 33 patients were evaluable for response. The ORR was 15.2% (5/33), consisting of 1 CR and 4 PRs, and the disease control rate was 54.5% (18/33). The median duration of treatment in 18 patients (CR + PR + SD) is 12.3 weeks with the longest being 28+ weeks. Twenty-three out of 33 patients (69.7%) experienced at least one adverse event (AE) with rash (42.4%), diarrhea (24.2%), pain (21.2%), fatigue (15.2%) and vomiting (12.1%) as the most common ones. Most AEs were mild and reversible and no grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported.  Conclusions', '    Second-line icotinib treatment in advanced esophageal cancer with EGFR over-expression or amplification demonstrated favorable outcome along with a high safety profile.

        "Background":"['Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 10% due to lack of effective therapeutic agents. This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein, on esophageal carcinoma, targeting both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), because both EGFR and HER2 have been shown overexpression in over 30% of esophageal cancers. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was encoded by a gene that was genetically constructed by fusing the oligopeptides ligand Ec (22 amino acids of EGF COOH-terminal) and Hr (VH CDR3 region of anti-HER2 C6.5 antibody) with lidamycin (LDM, an enediyne antibiotic with potent cytotoxicity) via two (G4S)3-linker. The encoded 18.4 kDa fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized its binding affinity with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells by flow-cytometry-based immunofluorescence assay. The results showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE protein bound to ESCC cells EC9706 and KYSE150 with high affinity (the Kd values were 5.283mol/L and 3.562mol/L, respectively). The potency of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was determined on four human ESCC cell lines with differential expression of EGFR and HER2 using MTT assay. The bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to EC1, EC109, EC9706 and KYSE150 cells with IC50 values in the picomolar level. Moreover, the bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was more potent than the monospecific counterparts (Ec-LDP-AE and LDP-Hr-AE) and LDM. Cell cycle distribution assay revealed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE caused G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, in which the G2-M phase cells reached the peak with 0.1nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE treatment. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE also induced cancer cell apoptosis in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells and the induction of apoptosis was in a dosage-dependent manner. The apoptotic index in the EC9706 cells exposed to 0.1, 0.5, or 1 nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE were 15.0  0.3%, 38.1  0.6%, and 50.0  0.4%, respectively. Western blotting showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage, indicating that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondria-caspase cascade. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited KYSE150 cancer cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules (e.g. AKT and ERK). In summary, the bispecific energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells in vitro, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via targeting EGFR and HER2. These results suggest that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could be a promising candidate for esophageal cancer targeting therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its family members HER2, HER3 and HER4 are found in a variety of human malignancies and their roles in cancer development and progression has been widely recognized for long time. Molecular drugs targeting EGFR family, such as small-molecule inhibitors and specific monoclonal antibodies, are now under intensive investigation in clinical setting. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), EGFR and HER2 are frequently overexpressed and their poor prognostic impacts have been reported to date. However, there is no study evaluating gene amplification of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 simultaneously in ESCC in a large cohort. We examined gene amplification of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 using realtime PCR-based copy number assay on 196 surgical specimens of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Gene amplification of EGFR and HER2 (copy number > 4) was observed in 7 % and 11%, respectively. Although the copy numbers were relatively low, we found gene amplification of HER3 and HER4 to be observed in 8% and 7%, respectively. Gene amplification at least one or more genes was observed in 23 % (45/196) of ESCC samples. Overlapping gene amplification was identified in 8 % (15/196) of samples. In relation with clinical characteristics, gene amplification of HER2 and HER4 was significantly involved in shorter relapse-free survivals in stage III ESCC. In conclusion, gene amplification of EGFR family was frequently observed in ESCC and PCR-based copy number assay could be a powerful tool for detecting gene amplification using FFPE samples. Our results strongly encourage the development of EGFR family-targeted therapy for ESCC with gene amplification.']",

Sym004 is a novel anti-EGFR antibody mixture that consists of two recombinant IgG1 antibodies against domain III of the EGFR. The primary mechanism of action of Sym004 is thought to be EGFR cross-linking, internalization and degradation of the EGFR from the cell surface. EGFR is highly expressed in the overwhelming majority of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We, therefore, investigated the effect of Sym004 in human ESCC cell lines in the present study.Method', ' In this preclinical study, approximately 50 ESCC cell lines and 3 kinds of anti-EGFR antibodies (Sym004, cetuximab, and panitumumab) were used. According to protein expression status and gene mutation status analyzed by Western blotting and next generation sequencing, these ESCC cell lines were classified into several groups. High EGFR-expressing cell lines were used for further investigations. Internalization of anti-EGFR antibodies into ESCC cells and inhibition of the EGFR signaling cascade by anti-EGFR antibodies were studied in in vitro experiments. Growth inhibitions by anti-EGFR antibody treatment were investigated in in vitro and in vivo experiments. The present preclinical studies were conducted at the National Cancer Center East Japan as collaborative studies with Merck Serono.Result', ' Even though protein expression of EGFR was detected in all ESCC cell lines, a variety of the expression levels were seen among the cell lines consistent with the previous data of clinical specimens. In addition, following gene alterations were found', ' EGFR amplification, Ras mutation, and PIK3CA mutation, and their frequency was 17% (8/48), 6.3% (3/48) and 8.3% (4/48), respectively.

In a growth inhibition assay, more potent anti-proliferative activity of Sym004 was observed than those of other anti-EGFR antibodies in some cell lines. No obvious correlation between EGFR expression and the anti-proliferative activity was observed, although cell lines with higher EGFR expression showed a trend toward higher sensitivity to Sym004. In vivo xenograft studies of Sym004 using human ESCC cell lines are currently underway and will be presented in the annual meeting.Conclusions', ' These studies showed that Sym004 exhibited antitumor activity in some ESCC cell lines in preclinical settings, and are expected to provide a scientific rationale along with a possible clinical indication of ESCC in clinical setting.']",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level and mutations of tumor related genes in resected esophageal cancer and to assess correlation of the profiling with clinical outcome.  Methods', '  135 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy at Shizuoka Cancer Center and Toyama University between October 2002 and November 2011 were analyzed. Protein expression of MET, EGFR, ALK and HGF was determined by Automated QUantification Analysis. Copy number of EGFR, PIK3CA, MET and FGFR1/2 was analyzed by real time PCR. The translocation of ALK gene and mutations of tumor related genes were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel, respectively. Prognostic factors associated with survival were identified by multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results', '  Overall, heavy smoking was significantly associated with high HGF expression (p=0.03938), but was not an independent prognostic factor. After adjustment for clinical features by multivariate Cox regression analysis, high expression of ALK was associated with poor OS in patients without neoadjuvant therapy (HR 4.589, p=0.0102).

Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histologic subtype of esophageal cancer, particularly in Asia. Currently, no targeted therapy has been approved for treating this type of disease. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains to be the standard care for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer with limited efficacy. Activation of EGFR/HER3/PI3K pathway is frequently observed in esophageal cancer, however, their therapeutic value remains to be further tested.Methods', ' In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LJM716, a fully human anti-HER3 antibody, either alone or in combination with anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or PI3K alpha subunit inhibitor BYL719 in esophageal squamous cancer. LJM716, cetuximab and BYL719 single agent as well as their pair-wised combination activity were assessed in 24 esophageal squamous cancer cell (ESCC) lines using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Single agent and combination anti-tumor activities of these reagents were also tested in selected cell line xenograft and patient derived xenograft mouse models.Results', ' NRG1 expression (60%), PIK3CA mutation (8%), moderate PIK3CA (30%) and EGFR (30%) amplification were detected in a panel of 24 ESCC lines. Anti-HER3 antibody LJM716 potently inhibited HER3 phosphorylation and decreased pAKT level in these cell lines. In vitro, LJM716 inhibited proliferation of a sub-set of ESCC lines.

Here, we report that kinase-dead Ikka knock-in mice (hereafter referred to as mutant mice) develop APECED-like autoimmune disease due to developmental defects in thymus and lack of central tolerance. Similar to human APECED patients who develop esophageal mucosal fungal infection on average at the age of five, mutant mice develop fungal infection in oral cavity and esophagus as early as seven weeks old. About 20% of mutant mice develop ESCC during aging, which exhibits specific molecular signatures observed in human ESCC, such as p16 gene silencing, elevated EGFR phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression, etc. Autoreactive T cell depletion, or central tolerance reconstitution and/or normal T cell transfer prevents fungal infection and ESCC development in mutant mice. Importantly, antifungal drug treatment inhibits inflammation and ESCC development in mutant mice. However, oral inoculation of Clasdosporium, one of the major fungal species isolated from mutant mice, increases the tumor incidence from 20% to 63% in mutant mice.

        "Background":"[\"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rising rapidly throughout the Western world, and is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). BE is intestinal metaplasia of squamous esophageal epithelium, important clinically due to the fact that it increases an individual's chance of progression to EAC 30 to 125-fold higher than people without BE. Despite its clinical importance, the molecular pathogenesis of BE is poorly understood. One limitation in the study of BE pathogenesis has been the lack of suitable experimental models. There is a critical need to develop good preclinical models of BE. ErbB2 was reported to be amplified and overexpressed in BE, EAC, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the role of erbB2 in the development and progression of esophageal cancer is still unknown. In this study, we utilized BK5.erbB2 mice, in which erbB2 is overexpressed in epithelial cells under the control of the bovine keratin 5 promoter to determine whether the interaction between erbB2 and bile acids is important in the etiology of esophageal cancers. BK5.erbB2 mice (2 months of age, n=8) and age matched wild type mice (n=10) were treated with porcine bile extract (10mg/mouse in 200L water), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) (0.1mol/mouse in 200L water), or water control, 3 times weekly for 14 weeks by gavage. In the BK5.erbB2 mice, exophytic tumors in the forestomach, which has the same histological structure of esophagus, were observed in 20%, 33%, and 0% of mice treated with bile extract, TCDC, and water control, respectively. No tumors were observed in wild type mice. All tumors observed in BK5.erbB2 mice were diagnosed as SCC. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the bile acid treatment increased the levels of p-EGFR, p-MAPK, and p-Akt in the forestomachs of the BK5.erbB2 mice. Furthermore, CDX2 (a marker of BE) was significantly expressed in BK5.erbB2 mice treated with bile extract or TCDC. No development of intestinal metaplasia in forestomach was found. We further investigated using a surgically manipulated reflux model. Eleven 7 week-old BK5.erbB2 and 5 wild type mice were given an esophagogastroduodenostomy. Mice were sacrificed at post-operative week 8, and examined histologically. Hyperkeratosis and intestinal metaplasia were observed at the anastomosis sites in both BK5.erbB2 and wild type mice. These histological changes were more prominent in BK5.erbB2 mice. Interestingly, dysplastic lesions were observed only in BK5.erbB2 mice. These results indicate that more persistent exposure of bile via surgery induce the development of not only SCC, but also precancerous lesions of adenocarcinoma in the esophagus/forestomach of BK5.erbB2 mice. The interaction between erbB2 and bile acids is important in esophageal tumor formation and intestinal metaplasia. A surgical model using BK5.erbB2 mice could possibly be a promising model for the study of the development of EAC.\"]",

        "Background":"['BackgroundEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents the most common form of esophageal cancer worldwide, especially in East Asia, where alcohol drinking and smoking have been implicated in the field carcinogenesis of ESCC. However, the oncogenic process therein has been poorly understood in terms of gene mutations.Patients & MethodsA total of 100 samples, including cancer, dysplastic, and non-dysplastic esophageal tissues, were obtained from 24 individual with (N = 14) or without (N = 10) ESCC (a median of 2.5 samples per case', ' 129) either by endoscopy or surgery and were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). An additional paired cancer/non-caner samples from 32 patients was analyzed by targeted sequencing (TS). All samples were analyzed for copy number alterations (CNAs) using SNP array- and/or digital sequencing-based karyotyping.ResultsIn WES, clonal evolution in esophageal epithelia, as determined by the presence of somatic mutations, was detected in 21 of 21 cancer, 12 of 12 dysplastic, and 63 of 67 non-dysplastic samples, where the mean number of mutation per sample showed a significant trend to increase in cancer (65) and dysplastic samples (50) compared to non-dysplastic samples (13) (P = 2.110-11). CNAs, especially those involving CDKN2A, CCND1, YAP1, and EGFR, were frequently affected in cancer samples, but rarely so in non-dysplastic samples. Non-dysplastic samples tended to have smaller allelic burden and therefore, clone size, compared to dysplastic and cancer samples (P = 2.210-16). Mutations had a predominant age-related signature in non-dysplastic samples but increasing APOBEC3A/3B patterns was observed in cancer and dysplastic samples. Shared mutations were found only within cancer tissues but never among dysplastic or non-dysplastic samples, suggesting the latter lesions are clonally independent from each other. In accordance with previous reports, TP53 mutations were found in 21/21 cancer samples and also found in dysplastic (11/12) and non-dysplastic samples at a lower frequency (26/67). Strikingly, non-dysplastic samples harbored a very high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations (51/67), which were also found in cancer (3/21) and non-dysplastic (8/12) samples but at much lower frequencies (P = 6.610-7). TS of validation samples confirmed the trend of higher NOTCH1 (84% vs. 25%) and lower TP53 mutation rates (38% vs. 100%) in non-dysplastic samples compared to cancer samples. The number of mutations in non-dysplastic samples was higher in drinkers than non-drinkers. Multiple NOTCH1 mutations were more common in cancer patients and drinkers than non-drinkers.ConclusionClonal proliferation in non-cancer esophageal epithelia is common even in non-ESCC cases and extensive in ESCC cases. NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations play major roles in clonal evolution in common but may have differential impacts on esophageal carcinogenesis, which is likely to be shaped by APOBEC-induced mutations and CNAs.']",

Chi-square tests determined differences between histological subtypes. Kaplan-Meier methodology estimated survival. Results', ' A total of 966 tumors (883 EACs and 113 ESCCs) were examined. Most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (71%), BRCA2 (10%), HNF1A (9%), APC (8%), SMAD4 (6.3%), PIK3CA (4.4%), ATM (5.3%), cMET (3%), ERBB2 (2.2%), PTEN (2%), and NOTCH1 (1%). When we compared EACs with ESCCs, KRAS (6.5%), NRAS (1.4%), GNAS (1%), and BRAF (0.7%) mutations were seen only in EACs, whereas, NFE2L2 mutations (R34P and E79G), and HER-2/neu overexpression (12%) and amplification (20%), were seen only in ESCCs (p < 0.001).

        "Background":"['Esophagus cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in China. According to Chinese cancer registry annual report in 2012, esophagus cancer accounts for nearly 1 in 10 of all cancer deaths. Despite the fact that much progress has been made in diagnosis and systemic chemotherapy regimens, the overall prognosis of esophagus cancer is disappointing. The 5-year survival rate, all stages included, is around 1525%. There remains a significant unmet medical need for esophagus cancer treatment.EGFR expression was reported in 3090% esophagus cancers and overexpression of EGFR was found to be associated with poorer survival. Unlike colon cancer, K-ras mutation was less frequently found in esophagus cancer (510%), suggesting EGFR pathway blockade might bring therapeutic benefit to those patients with EGFR activation or overexpression. In this study, as of November 2013, 35 surgical esophagus tumor samples were collected from a local hospital in Shanghai. 31 of the 35 samples were identified as squamous cell carcinoma. EGFR gene amplification, protein expression and K-ras mutation were studied. In addition, 9 patient derived esophagus cancer xenograft models (PDX) were developed and anti-tumor effect of a novel and highly potent EGFR inhibitor was evaluated in 6 PDX models.Positive EGFR protein expression was found in 66% (23/35) of esophageal cancer samples. EGFR gene amplifications were observed in 9% patients (3/35). In 9 established PDX models, 7 of them showed EGFR expression and 2 with EGFR gene amplification. No K-ras mutation was observed in the 9 models. A novel and highly potent EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), developed by Hutchison and currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials in China, demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in several PDX models with tumor growth inhibition in a range of 70% to >100%. One PDX model with EGFR gene amplification and overexpression exhibited the highest sensitivity to EGFRi with remarkable tumor regression. EGFR signaling transduction was evaluated and the EGFRi inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK.In conclusion, EGFR expression and/or gene amplification was frequently found in Chinese esophagus cancer. EGFR inhibition resulted in potent anti-tumor effect in multiple patient derived esophagus cancer models carrying EGFR amplifications or high expression, suggesting the potential benefit that anti-EGFR agents might bring to esophagus cancer patients with abnormal EGFR activation.']",

        "Background":"['Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most common used assay for detecting/quantifying defined protein biomarkers in specific tissue location in clinical/preclinical settings as prognostic/drug-predictive biomarker assays. However, IHC suffers from several key drawbacks, limiting its applications, including semi-quantitative nature, inconsistence, low sensitivity, narrow dynamic detection range and inadequacy for multi-target analysis, etc. An alternative method is immunofluorescence (IF), but with even lower usage for its disadvantageous photo-instability. A sensitive, quantitative and robust assay is thus an urgent/unmet need. We have recently developed a novel fluorescence nanoparticle (PID, phosphor integrated dye) with highly compact phosphor inside. PID has several key advanced features', ' 1) enhanced fluorescence (30,000x brighter over the conventional fluorescence and significantly above tissue auto-fluorescence), 2) enhanced photo-stability (stained slide is stable for >2 years); 3) highly quantitative by broadened detection dynamic range through enumeration of the bright fluorescent dots (nanoparticles) instead of signal amplification as in IHC (digital vs. analog); 4) fine subcellular imaging; 5) potentials for multi-color and H&E/bright light imaging. PDX is a well-accepted experimental cancer model mimicking original patients in histo- & molecular pathology(1), as well as drug response. We previously conducted a series of mouse clinical trial (MCT) of Erbitux on PDX cohorts of NSCLC, CRC, gastric and esophageal cancers (2,3), showing specific subsets of high-EGRF-expressing PDXs responded to the drug, where EGFR expression was measured by either RNAseq (mRNA) or IHC (protein). To assess PID-EGFR as a new biomarker assay platform, we analysed and compared its quantification to RNAseq and IHC, particularly in terms of the correlation to the drug efficacy. Our data demonstrates a greatly enhanced correlation of PID scores to mRNA levels in all cancer types, and to the tumor growth inhibition of gastric (3) and esophageal (4) carcinoma, but not in CRC (2) and NSCLC (Li et al., unpublished) as anticipated. The results demonstrated that PID-EGFR is a significantly improved histopathology based EGFR protein quantification assay over IHC-EGFR assay, warranting further clinical confirmation.']",

P alone is active in EGFR expressing CRC as well. Our group has empiric evidence for the activity of cetuximab + I as third-line treatment for advanced EAC. As such, a phase II study was designed to evaluate P + I as second-line therapy for advanced EAC. Trial Design', ' The primary endpoint is overall response (OR) as measured by RECIST (cross-sectional imaging every 2 cycles). Secondary endpoints include overall survival, safety/toxicity and correlative studies. Patients with confirmed EAC with history of one prior treatment are treated with P 9 mg/m2 on day 1 and I 125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle to a maximum of 6 cycles. Inclusion criteria include confirmed EAC, measurable disease, no prior I or P, PS <2 and normal organ function. A Simon two-stage design is used with power of 80% and a type I error of 0.05. 18 patients will be tested in the first stage and will terminate the trial if 2 or fewer respond.

        "Background":"['Tumor cells are genetically unstable, driven by genetic mutations that stimulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. These genetic mutations are generally linked to particular types of cancer. Oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is essential for NSCLC development and growth. However, the precise roles of EGFR in lung cancer metabolism are still unclear. Here we show that glucose (Glc) metabolism is critical for EGFR stability required for tumor growth and survival. EGFR mutation leads to a robust increase in Glc uptake, lactate production and glycolytic flux. Moreover, EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines are much more sensitive than EGFR WT to inhibition of Glc metabolism through EGFR degradation, suggesting that EGFR mutant NSCLCs rely more heavily than EFGR WT on aerobic glycolysis. Knockdown of EGFR in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs results in a decrease in expression level of genes that encode glycolysis enzymes, indicating that EGFR mutation leads to an increase in Glc metabolism and Glc dependence for growth and survival. Furthermore, inhibition of Glc metabolism shows a significant decrease in intracellular ATP, oxygen consumption and level of TCA cycle intermediates. Indeed, the addition of pyruvate dramatically rescues apoptotic cell death caused by EGFR degradation upon inhibition of Glc metabolism, suggesting that Glc to fuel the TCA cycle is essential for tumor survival. In addition, the inhibition of Glc metabolism overcomes T790M-mediated resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Together, our data suggest that the EGFR mutation mediates the reprogramming of Glc metabolism and this metabolic alteration represents an attractive target for new therapy of EGFR-mutated NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Recent accumulating evidences suggest that genetic mutations in tumor cells cause several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cancerous cell proliferation. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induce oncogenic addiction in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). However, the linkage between oncogenic mutated EGFR and cancer metabolism has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this study, we measured extracellular lactate production, glucose consumption and the glucose-induced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) after the inhibition of EGFR signaling in LAD cell culture. Using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolomic techniques, the major intracellular metabolites in EGFR-mutated LAD cells were quantified in the absence or presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) erlotinib. The molecular profile regulating the metabolic enzymes at the transcriptional and post-translational levels was characterized by RT-PCR, Western blotting and flow cytometry. We demonstrated that EGFR signaling was required for lactate production, glucose consumption and glucose-induced ECAR, indicating that EGFR signaling promoted the Warburg effect in LAD cells. Moreover, comprehensive metabolomic analysis revealed that the levels of key intermediate metabolites in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were decreased after treatment with EGFR inhibitors. The glucose transport carried out by GLUT1 and GLUT3 was the most rapid and critically regulated function of glucose metabolism linked to EGFR signaling, although the expression of MYC-dependent glycolytic genes and the phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM2) were down-regulated by EGFR inhibition at a later time point. A modest down-regulation of both total and membrane-bound GLUT3 was also observed after EGFR inhibition. Despite an equivalent total amount of GLUT1 in LAD cells, the levels of membrane-bound GLUT1 was decreased by EGFR-TKI treatment, suggesting that EGFR signaling controlled GLUT1 function through post-translational modification. We concluded that EGFR signaling regulated aerobic glycolysis in EGFR-mutated LAD cells. Our data suggests that the glycolytic pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.

In NSCLC with EGFR-sensitive mutations, we first found that higher TG2 expression level and lower PTEN and IκB-α expression levels in the intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC compare with EGFR-TKI sensitive NSCLC.

However, response duration is variable. The predictive value of EGFR mutation for response is superior to previously reported clinical predictors, namely female gender, Asian ethnicity, smoking status, and histology. It is unclear, however, whether any clinical characteristics have additive predictive value for duration of response to EGFR-TKI. Here, we attempted to identify clinical predictors of response duration to EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Methods', ' Review of a prospectively collected lung cancer patients database at a tertiary care hospital was performed. Stage IV EGFR-mutant patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 who received EGFR-TKI for  3 months, at any line of treatment, were included. The following variables were collected for purpose of analysis', ' age, gender, smoking status, tumor histology, specific EGFR mutation (exon 19 versus 21 mutation), ECOG PS, line of TKI treatment, and serum CRP levels. Chi square and t-test were used where appropriate. Univariate and mutivariate modeling was used to explore the predictive power of covariates. Results', ' One hundred ten patients with EGFR mutant stage IV lung cancer were included in this study. Patients were predominantly female (77%), never or light smokers (57%), with non-squamous histology (93%) and an exon 19 mutation (66%). Mean duration of treatment with EGFR-TKI was 14.4 (range 3-86) months. In univariate analysis, never-smoking status, exon 19 mutation and low serum CRP were predictive of a longer EGFR-TKI treatment duration. However, in multivariate analysis only exon 19 and CRP level were significantly associated with longer duration of response to EGFR-TKI. Conclusions', ' Gender, smoking status and ethnicity- although initially identified as predictors of response to EGFR-TKI in an unselected population- do not confer additional predictive potential of treatment response duration in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. Only serum CRP level- and exon 19 mutation status- are independently associated with duration of response to EGFR-TKI in this population.']",

        "Background":"['Although epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is a rational targeted drug with dramatic survival benefit in lung cancer, susceptibility to the drug is restricted in lung cancer with activating mutations of EGFR. Nevertheless, the EGFR-TKI still remains an attractive anticancer drug in lung cancer with wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate unknown mechanism which can contribute to response of the EGFR targeted therapy using gefitinib, a well-known EGFR-TKI, in eight lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. We first examined differential effects of gefitinib on cell survival, morphology, motility, cell cycle and EGFR signaling between the TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells. As a result, although the TKI-resistant cells did not show any changes in cell phenotype by gefitinib treatment, phosphorylation of EGF induced EGFR and downstream effectors was inhibited by the drug treatment as if those in the TKI-sensitive cells. Additionally, we found difference in cellular distribution of EGF induced EGFR after gefitinib treatment between the TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells and it was associated with EGFR endocytosis. Based on our results, we next investigated that regulation of EGFR endocytosis could affect on the response of gefitinib in lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. Inhibition of EGFR endocytosis by combination treatment with gefitinib and two endocytosis inhibitors, dynasore and dynole 34-2, led to significantly decreased cell viability in the TKI-resistant cells compared with treatment of these drugs alone. Moreover, the reduced cell survival after the combination treatment was concerned with increased apoptotic cell death, accompanying by elevated cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Survivin and Livin among anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, we found differentially expressed Rab25, a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, between the TKI-sensitive and-resistant cells through genome-wide gene expression analysis. The expression status of Rab25 was partially associated with response of gefitinib in lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. Furthermore, the silencing of Rab25 in the TKI-sensitive cells with its normal expression reversed sensitivity to gefitinib treatment. In conclusion, our results provided molecular evidences that EGFR endocytosis might contribute to cell survival and response to the EGFR-TKI as a bypass survival mechanism in lung cancer with wtEGFR. Thus, targeting EGFR endocytosis could help us to overcome therapeutic limitation of EGFR-TKI in lung cancer with wtEGFR and Rab25 expression may be an important tool for predicting efficacy of the drug treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Triple-negative breast cancers have a poor prognosis and lack an effective targeted therapeutic. Even though 50% of triple-negative breast cancers express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), they are resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Although the activation of several tyrosine kinases including Met, c-Src, and IGF-IR have been found to correlate with EGFR TKI resistance, the mechanism of this de novo resistance is still being elucidated. The BT20 breast cancer cell line has amplified EGFR expression yet is resistant to EGFR TKIs. Phospho-proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins that remain phosphorylated after gefitinib treatment. These proteins included Raptor, PDK1, and GSK3, implicating the Akt and mTOR pathways in EGFR TKI resistance. Despite activation of these pathways, BT20 cells were resistance to the mTOR antagonist temsirolimus. However, temsirolimus was able to sensitize BT20 cells to gefitinib which led to a synergistic decrease in cell survival. Similar results have been observed by others using different inhibitors; however, the mechanism of this synergistic decrease in cell survival has not been identified. These data suggest that EGFR and mTOR activation regulate cell survival through parallel signaling pathways and that both pathways need to be inhibited to abrogate growth and survival. This is supported by the observation that the PI3Kinase/Akt signaling pathway was unaffected by gefitinib or temsirolimus treatment alone. In addition, the combination of EGFR and mTOR inhibitors had no effect on PI3Kinase/Akt or Ras/MAPK signaling, despite the synergistic decrease in cell survival. However, further immunoblotting showed a pronounced inhibition in activation of the eIF4 family in the mTOR translational control pathway with dual treatment of gefitinib and temsirolimus, an abrogation not significantly observed with either treatment alone. These results suggest that inhibiting mTOR signaling alone is insufficient to modulate the translational control pathway in BT20 cells and that EGFR signals independent of mTOR to activate this pathway. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation and subsequent regulation of these translational control molecules may be critical to the survival of BT20 cells. Indeed, the combination of gefitinib and temsirolimus stimulated apoptosis in BT20 cells, supporting the idea that inhibiting the mTOR pathway will sensitize breast cancers expressing EGFR to gefitinib inhibition. In summary, these data provide strong evidence for the presence of a de novo EGFR TKI resistance pathway in breast cancers that occurs through the activation of the mTOR pathway and therapy for EGFR positive breast cancers could be improved with dual treatment of EGFR TKI and an mTOR antagonist.']",

Patients of male, with multiple lymph node station metastasis, visceral metastasis, no response to TPN treatment, and without radiotherapy had worse OS. Even in some patients with multiple stations lymph node metastasis or recurrent disease of local-regional lymph node metastasis, TPN with sequential radiation seemed could bring longer survival time. But multivariate cox-regression analysis only confirmed that the TPN treatment was associations with OS. Compared with those of complete and partial response, patients of stable disease and progression had poor OS (HR = 2.32, 95% CI', ' 1.03-5.05, p = 0.03).

        "Background":"['EGFR mutant lung cancers are highly sensitive to first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; gefitinib and erlotinib), but resistance invariably develops. In the majority of patients, such acquired resistance is mediated by a second-site T790M mutation in EGFR. Second generation EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib, have minimal efficacy in patients with acquired resistance; by contrast, combinations of afatinib with cetuximab or panitumumab - anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies - are synergistic in pre-clinical models, and afatinib/cetuximab has shown a 30% response rate in a phase Ib trial for patients with acquired resistance. Sym004, currently in phase II trials, is a novel mixture of two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies binding non-overlapping epitopes in the extracellular domain III of EGFR. The primary mechanism of action of Sym004 is thought to be EGFR cross-linking, internalization and degradation of the EGFR from the cell surface. To determine if the combination of afatinib and Sym004 shows greater efficacy against TKI-resistant EGFR mutant lung cancer than afatinib combined with individual anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, we are investigating mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to afatinib plus Sym004 in EGFR mutant TKI-resistant lung cancer. Similar to cetuximab, Sym004 has minimal effect on the growth of EGFR mutant cells in 2D culture. However, Sym004 induces growth inhibition of TKI-resistant PC-9/BRc1 cells (EGFR exon 19 deletion/T790M) in soft agar and xenograft models, and afatinib plus Sym004 is more effective at inhibiting growth than either drug alone. In immunoblotting studies, the combination induces greater decrease of total EGFR than either drug alone or afatinib plus cetuximab. Using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Sym004 and confocal microscopy, the drug induces more efficient internalization and degradation of EGFR than cetuximab in H1975 cells (L858R/T790M). Additional confocal studies will be performed in other TKI-resistant EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. We are also assessing whether addition of Sym004 to TKIs can prevent or delay the acquisition of T790M-mediated resistance in vitro. Finally, we are developing cell lines from PC-9/BRc1and HCC827/R1 (exon 19 deletion/T790M) xenografts that develop resistance to either Sym004, cetuximab, or combinations with afatinib.

However, the potential molecular mechanism that expands the therapeutic benefit of EGFT-TKI in patients who have wild-type EGFR non-small cell lung cancer (wtEGFR NSCLC) remains unclear. Recently, several studies revealed EGFR endocytosis mechanism could mediate signal transductions that influence in cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, our previous study demonstrated that EGFR endocytosis is related to gefitinib sensitivity in wtEGFR NSCLC and EGFR endocytosis could be a novel therapeutic target in lung cancer with wtEGFR (Oncotarget. 2014 15;5(5)', '1265-78). In this study, we investigated whether EGFR-TKI resistance could be restored in wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines by endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (PAO). To investigate effects of PAO in vitro, we analyzed EGF-induced EGFR internalization and performed Annexin V and propodium iodide (PI) staining by flow cytometry. As a result, EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis is decreased and apoptotic cell death is induced accompanied by G0/G1 arrest after PAO treatment. In addition, we observed that cell viability is reduced significantly when PAO and EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) treated together. Furthermore, we verified signaling transduction that associated with proliferation and apoptosis by western blot. To confirm combination effects of PAO and EGFR-TKI in vivo, we established xenograft mouse model using gefitinib-insensitive SNU1327 cell lines. After Tumor sizes reached 100-200mm3, mice were treated with PAO or gefitinib alone, or combined treatment for 3 weeks. We observed that tumor sizes of combination group were more decreased than other groups.In these result, we validate endocytosis inhibitor PAO is potential drug for overcoming therapeutic limitation of EGFR-TKI in gefitinib-insensitive wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines, though further experiment is needed to explain more accurate mechanism.

        "Background":"['Approximately 10-15% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations resulting in increased sensitivity to 1st generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib. For common mutations in EGFR, treatment with 1st generation TKIs results in approximately 70% overall response rate, increased progression free survival, and increased quality of life compared to chemotherapy alone. However, resistance to 1st generation TKIs typically develops within ~12 months, and approximately 55% of patients acquire a secondary mutation in EGFR Exon 20, T790M. To overcome resistance, 2nd and 3rd generation covalently binding TKIs targeting T790M mutations have been developed. Recent studies show that approximately 40% of acquired resistance to 2nd and 3rd generation TKIs can also occur via a third acquired EGFR mutation at the site of covalent binding, C797S. To date, there are no standard approved targeted therapies for treating EGFR C797S mutant NSCLC. Moreover, with proposed increased use of covalent inhibitors in the first line setting, C797S mutations are expected to become more prevalent and new strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance will be required. To this end, we have generated stable Ba/F3 and HCC827 NSCLC cell lines expressing C797S mutant EGF receptors with common mutations in EGFR including, L858R/T790M/C797S, and Ex19del/T790M/C797S. EGFR mutant cell lines expressing C797S were screened against 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation EGFR TKIs and cell viability was determined using Cell Titer Glo. Triple mutant cell lines containing T790M and C797S mutations were not sensitive to any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation inhibitors with IC50 values of >10µM, 7.0µM, and 7.6µM, respectively. However Ba/F3 and HCC827 cell lines transfected with EGFR triple mutants were inhibited by non-covalent inhibitors', ' CUDC-101, an EGFR, HER2 and HDAC inhibitor, and PKC412, a FLT3 inhibitor. In triple mutant Ba/F3 cells, CUDC-101 and PKC412 had IC50 values of 470nM and 250nM in Ex19del/T790M/C797S EGFR mutants, respectively, and IC50 values of 690nM and 270nM in L858R/T790M/C797S EGFR mutants. In HCC827 cells, PKC412 had IC50 values of 610nM and 520nM in L858R/T790M/C797S and Ex19del/T790M/C797S triple mutants, respectively. In addition, western blot analysis of triple mutant Ba/F3 cells showed decreased phosphorylation of EGFR in presence of 50nM PKC412 and 500nM of CUDC-101. Moreover, PKC412 partially decreased p-EGFR expression at 50nM in HCC827 triple mutant cell lines. In conclusion, unlike other EGFR TKIs, the non-covalent EGFR inhibitors CUDC-101 and PKC412 inhibit both T790M and C797S EGFR mutants at low concentrations.

Most patients whose tumors harbor exon 19 deletions or L858R EGFR mutations have responses to reversible ATP-mimetic EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib. Exon 20 inframe insertion mutations comprise 4% of all EGFR mutations, occur at the N-lobe of EGFR after its C-helix (after AA M766; notwithstanding some C-helix exon 20 insertions have been reported affecting E762 to Y764), and most NSCLCs with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations display lack of responses to EGFR TKIs. The reported response rate is below 5% and most patients have short intervals of disease control (Yasuda et al. Lancet Oncol 2011). Up to now, very few EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations had been studied using in vitro models and there was no available NSCLC cell line with such a mutation. Objectives', ' In the present study, we have attempted to', ' 1) study the most comprehensive panel of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, 2) evaluate their pattern of response/resistance to EGFR TKIs, and 3) derive a novel NSCLC cell line with an exon 20 insertion mutation. Methods', ' Response to EGFR TKIs of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated NSCLCs was compiled. We generated a panel of representative exon 20 EGFR mutant constructs using site-directed mutagenesis.

In addition, NSCLC cell lines with EGFR mutations were evaluated and compared to a novel malignant pleural effusion-derived cell line. Results', ' The NSCLC with EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA (located within the C-helix of EGFR) achieved a partial response to erlotinib that lasted 18 months. Most other exon 20 insertion mutation-positive NSCLCs (15/16, p=0.11) did not respond. The cell line with EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA had phosphorylated EGFR, ERK and AKT inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of erlotinib; and subsequently underwent upregulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only BIM and apoptosis. Eight different exon 20 insertion mutations were studied (including EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA, A767_V769dupASV, D770_N771insNPG, H773_V774insH). All, but A763_Y764insFQEA, were resistant to micromolar concentrations of erlotinib/other TKIs. Ba/F3 cells with EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA underwent apoptosis upon exposure to nanomolar concentrations of erlotinib. Detailed analysis of these exon 20 insertion mutations is ongoing. Conclusions', ' Not all EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are resistant to EGFR TKIs, and in specific EGFR-A763_Y764insFQEA can be labeled an EGFR TKI-sensitive mutation. This finding has clinical implications for the care of the 10,000 cases of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutated NSCLC diagnosed yearly and points towards the need to define the molecular mechanisms that underlie the differential response to EGFR TKIs in EGFR mutated NSCLC.']",

Here we provide preliminary evidence of a possible interplay between RANK and EGFR signaling in breast cancer. Methods', ' TCGA (cancergenome.nih.gov) publicly available mRNA and protein expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) for EGFR and TNFSRF11A (RANK) genes from an unselected cohort of 1036 breast cancer patients and 58 breast cancer cell lines were retrieved and analyzed. EGFR and TNFSRF11A mRNA expression were also evaluated through real-time RT-PCR in a panel of 7 human breast cancer cell lines and 22 FFPE breast cancer samples.

However, despite the initial success, all patients progress with a median PFS of 12 to 16 months. Acquired resistance is driven by the occurrence of a secondary EGFR mutation (T790M) in about 50% of the cases and by c-Met amplification in 5 to 10 % of the cases. We report the activity of a new reversible and ATP-competitive c-Met inhibitor, EMD1214063, in the setting of primary lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR activating mutations and in two models of acquired resistance. EMD1214063 showed to be specifically active in c-Met amplified and c-Met dependent cells in a large panel of genotypically characterized lung cancer cell lines. In the context of acquired resistance, we studied the effect of EMD1214063 alone and in combination of afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, in PC9 cells (EGFR Exon19del), H1975 cells (EGFR L858R and T790M), HCC827 (EGFR Exon19del, not c-Met amplified) and in HCC827GR cells (EGFR Exon19del and c-Met amplified). Treatment of HCC827GR cells with EMD1214063 resulted in substantial growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. The in vitro results showed a significant synergistic effect of the combination of EMD121039 and afatinib in the induction of growth inhibition in the context of c-Met amplification and EGFR T790M mutation. Combination treatment robustly suppressed expression of downstream pErk and pAkt, showing efficient suppression of PI3K and MAPK signaling. To determine whether the antitumor activity of the combination observed in vitro might also be apparent in vivo, we injected these cells in nude mice to elicit the formation of solid tumors. Mice were treated with EMD121043 (25mg/kg), afatinib (10mg/kg) or the combination of both. In H1975 xenografts only the combination therapy could significantly reduce tumor growth, thus confirming the results obtained in vitro. In the c-Met amplified setting, we treated mice harboring HCC827, HCC827GR and mixed xenografts. HCC827-driven tumors strongly responded to both afatinib monotherapy and to the combination, leading to complete remission within 40 days of therapy. HCC827/HCC827GR mixed xenografts containing 0.1%, 1% and 10% of HCC827GR cells partially responded to afatinib monotherapy; however, growth was completely abolished by combination therapy. Treatment with EMD1214063 led to significant growth reduction in mice harboring HCC827GR tumors. In this model, only the combination therapy led to massive tumor shrinkage. Assessment of cell proliferation in vivo by [18F]FLT-PET showed a decline in FLT-uptake of 40% in both the combination therapy and the EMD1214063 monotherapy. In conclusion, the combination of EMD1214063 and afatinib promote tumor regression in erlotinib acquired resistant lung cancers driven by EGFR L858R/T790M or EGFR Exon19 del/c-Met amplification.']",

We aimed to determine potential mechanisms of resistance to WZ4002 and explore alternative strategies to overcome acquired resistance to pyrimidine based EGFR inhibitors. Methods and Results', ' We performed an ENU mutagenesis screen in Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR L858R, L858R/T790M, Del E746_A750 and Del E746_A750/T790M followed by culture in the presence of WZ4002 (100 nM or 1 M). Using RT-PCR, we sequenced resistant clones for secondary EGFR mutations. No EGFR T790M mutations were identified. We detected novel secondary EGFR L718Q (9/27; 33%) or L844V (1/27; 3%) mutations in the drug resistant cells. We also recovered the EGFR C797S (1/27; 3%) mutation previously known to prevent covalent binding and decrease potency of WZ4002. Unlike EGFR T790M, EGFR L718Q and EGFR L844V did not lead to constitutive EGFR phosphorylation, were not transforming in Ba/F3 cells and required EGF for proliferation and survival. The EGFR L858R/L844V Ba/F3 cells were resistant to WZ4002 (IC50 0.7 M) but sensitive to irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors CL-387,785, HKI-272 (neratinib) and BIBW2992 (afatinib) (IC50 values all < 10 nM). Similar findings were observed with the EGFR L858R/L718Q cells although the IC50 values were slightly higher (100 nM or less) and with the Del E746_A750/L718Q and Del E746_A750/L844V cells. All triple mutants harboring EGFR T790M (e.g. L858R/T790M/L844V) were resistant to WZ4002 and irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors. EGFR L858R/L844V and L858R/L718Q Ba/F3 cells were growth inhibited by clinical concentrations (1 M) of gefitinib and the combination of 1 M gefitinib and 100 nM WZ4002 completely prevented the emergence of resistant clones in our ENU assay. Using structural modeling, both the L718Q and L844V mutations likely lead to steric hindrance and could impact WZ4002 binding. To verify this hypothesis, we developed a biotinylated-WZ4002 compound and used it to assay binding to different EGFR mutant proteins. This agent effectively bound to EGFR L858R and DelE746_A750 (with or without T790M). However, in the presence of a concurrent L718Q or L844V mutation, protein binding was significantly reduced, consistent with the reduced in vitro efficacy in the Ba/F3 cells.

        "Background":"['Background', \" Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved overall survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumors have EGFR activating mutations. After treatment with EGFR-TKIs, NSCLC tumors with EGFR activating mutations become resistant to EGFR-TKIs, and development of novel treatment strategies is needed to improve survival in such patients.Next-generation EGFR-TKIs have been developed, and a clinical trial showed clinical activity of 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with acquired resistance, especially secondary mutation T790M to EGFR-TKIs. Moreover, clinical trials demonstrated survival benefit of combination with cytotoxic agents and EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In contrast, the IMPRESS study showed that continuation of gefitinib in addition to cisplatin and pemetrexed didn't show survival benefit in patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib.Several basic studies reported that efficacy of targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy is schedule dependent. We, therefore, conducted an in vitro study to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC with EGFR mutations. Methods\", ' In vitro effects of docetaxel and an EGFR-TKI, gefitinib (AstraZeneca) or AZD9291 (Selleckchem), were examined in five lung cancer cell lines (PC9, PC9GR, HCC827, HCC827GR, and H1975) using a 3D culture model (PrimeSurface 96, SUMITOMO BAKELITE CO.). The NSCLC cells were treated with the combinationeither concurrently or sequentially (EGFR-TKIs after docetaxel or docetaxel after EGFR-TKIs). Combination Index (CI) values were calculated at various levels of cytotoxicity (the Chou-Talalay method). We evaluated changes in MAPK pathway activation and in expressions of Bcl2 family proteins and cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling) by western blot analysis. Results', ' Docetaxel followed by EGFR-TKIs weremore effective at CI, compared with EGFR-TKIs followed by docetaxel in two of the five cell lines with EGFR activating mutations, PC9GR (EGFR19del+T790M) and HCC827GR (EGFR19del+METamp) cells. The HCC827GR cells were likely to be more sensitive than PC9GR to the combination with docetaxel and gefitinib. The combo led to inactivation of the MAPK pathway and alteration of the Bcl2 family proteins. d) Conclusion', ' In conclusion, our results suggest that the sequential combination of docetaxel followed by EGFR-TKIs was effective against NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.']",

However, patients invariably develop resistance through secondary EGFR mutations, c-MET amplification, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), small cell lung cancer transformation, PIK3CA mutation and other unknown mechanisms. Here we examined whether Cripto1, which has been shown to induce EMT, could cause erlotinib resistance. We show that innate erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinomas carrying sensitizing EGFR mutations exhibit higher level of Cripto1 expression than their erlotinib sensitive counterparts. Ectopic expression of Cripto1 rendered erlotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cells resistant to erlotinib both in vitro and in a xenograft model. Moreover, Cripto1 activated Zeb1/EMT signaling pathway in EGFR-TKI resistant cells. High Cripto1 expression correlated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Our study provides a novel Cripto1-dependent mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance that may pave the way for the development of therapies to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer patients.']",

However, clinical benefit is predominantly limited to the subgroup of patients with an activating EGFR mutation (10%). Treating the remaining 90% of patients with wild type (wt) EGFR is an unmet clinical need. Aim', ' To evaluate the effect of an allosteric AKT inhibitor (AKTi 1/2) in combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib on cell proliferation, apoptosis and signalling output in EGFR mutant/wt NSCLC cell lines. Methods', ' Four NSCLC cell lines were selected', ' NCI-H522 and NCI-H1651 (EGFR wt and K-RAS wt), PC9 and HCC827 (EGFR mutant). The 96hr sulphorhodamine assays was used to assess the effect of gefitinib and AKTi 1/2 on growth inhibition, and median effect analysis to calculate combination indices (CIs) to assess the effect of both drugs in combination. The expression of p-EGFR, p-AKT, p-S6, p-ERK and cleaved PARP were studied by Western blotting in the EGFR wt NCI-H522 and the EGFR mutant PC9 cell lines. Results', ' EGFR wt cell lines NCI-H522 and NCI-H1651 were relatively resistant to gefitinib (IC50 values of 7.0  2.5 uM and 8.8  0.9 uM, respectively) compared with the EGFR mutant cell lines PC9 and HCC827 (IC50 values of 0.07  0.03 uM and 0.004  0.0005 uM, respectively). The combination of gefitinib and AKTi 1/2 produced synergistic inhibition of growth in both EGFR wild type and mutant cell lines. Synergism was more marked in EGFR wt cell lines with CI values (ED50) of 0.53  0.28 and 0.49  0.17 for NCI-H522 and NCI-H1651 respectively, compared with 0.74  0.11 and 0.76  0.14 for the EGFR mutant cell lines PC9 and HCC827, respectively. Concomitant exposure of cells to gefitinib and AKTi 1/2 for 24 hrs caused incremental inhibition of p-AKT, p-S6 and p-ERK in both the EGFR wt (NCI-H522) and EGFR mutant (PC9) cell lines. Gefitinib alone resulted in partial inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in PC9 cells and up-regulation in NCI-H522 cells. Incremental induction of cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis, was seen in PC9 cells treated with the combination of gefitinib and AKTi 1/2. Conclusions', ' These results demonstrate synergistic growth inhibition of EGFR wt and mutant NSCLC cell lines by the combination of gefitinib with AKTi 1/2. Additional pre-clinical studies are investigating this further. Clinical studies of the combination doublet are warranted to expand the utility of EGFR TKI in EGFR wt NSCLC.']",

Given the efficacy of EGFR TKIs in advanced EGFR-mutant lung cancer, adjuvant therapy with EGFR TKIs is also biologically appealing. However, there are conflicting findings to date regarding the potential benefit of adjuvant TKI in patients (pts) with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations (Janjigian JTO 2010; Goss ASCO 2010) To better understand these results, we studied the natural history of EGFR-mutant lung cancers which recurred despite adjuvant TKI.  Methods', ' Pts with recurrent EGFR-mutant lung cancer were identified from an institutional database of pts who received adjuvant/neoadjuvant TKI using an IRB approved waiver. Recurrent cancer specimens, when available, were tested for the T790M resistance mutation. Sensitivity to retreatment with EGFR TKI was evaluated.  Results', ' 23 pts were identified; all cases had an EGFR mutation (61% exon 19 deletion, 35% L858R, 4% other). Pts received adjuvant/neoadjuvant TKI for a median of 19 total months (range 1-39 months); median time to progression (TTP) was 29 months. 8 pts recurred while receiving TKI; 7 of these cases were tested for T790M, which was detected in 4 (57%). 15 pts recurred after stopping TKI (median of 13 months off TKI); however, T790M was not detected in any of the 8 cases tested (p=0.026, Fishers exact test). 13 pts who recurred after stopping TKI were retreated with a median TTP of 10 months. Radiographic response was seen in 8 of 10 pts (80%); 3 pts had no evaluable disease.  Conclusions', ' Pts with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who develop recurrence after stopping adjuvant TKI do not harbor T790M and commonly remain sensitive to TKI treatment. Recurrence of EGFR-mutant lung cancer after adjuvant TKI should not preclude a trial of TKI retreatment; a phase II trial of erlotinib in this setting is underway (NCT01189435).

        "Background":"['Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are sensitive to the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. In the majority of patients with this type of cancer, EFGR inhibition leads to a dramatic reduction in tumor size coupled with an abatement of symptoms. These responses are temporary, and in most cases the cancers become resistant after an average of one year. Recently, we and others have found that a subset of these cancers transform from NSCLC to SCLC as they acquire resistance to EGFR TKI. Details underlying this novel resistance mechanism are largely undiscovered. To assess the genetic changes associated with NSCLC to SCLC transformation, we carried out next generation sequencing analysis on NSCLC and SCLC resistant tumors. The sequencing results revealed that Rb, along with p53 and PIK3CA were specifically altered in the SCLC transformed tumors. An IHC assay to detect Rb indicated that while 10 out of 10 SCLC transformed cases have loss of Rb, resistant cancers that maintained an NSCLC histology largely retained Rb. To address the mechanism underlying the resistance to EGFR inhibition in these tumors, we demonstrated that upon the transformation to SCLC there is a marked reduction in EGFR expression, suggesting that in transforming to SCLC these cells become a cell type that no longer requires EGFR for their survival. Finally, utilizing cell lines generated from biopsies taken from resistant cancers, we identify the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor Abt-263 as a potential therapeutic approach to treat these resistant patients. Together, our results provide details underlying this novel mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy.']",

MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma) and SW620 (human colon cancer) was selected as a negative control. Specific binding of RBEGFR to cells and cancer tissue was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining and/or FACS analysis. In vivo imaging was done by i.v. injection of FNR-675 labeled RBEGFR (30 g/mouse) or 64Cu-NOTA- RBEGFR (7.4 MBq/mouse) in H1650, HCC827 and HT29-bearing mouse models using cooled CCD camera or microPET, respectively.

In vivo imaging was done by i.v. injection FNR-675 labeled RBEGFR (30 g/mouse) in AOM/DSS mouse models using cooled CCD camera or fluorescence microendoscopy.In vitro and in vivo IF staining demonstrated that strong binding of RBEGFR to H1650, HCC827 and HT29, but not to MDA-MB-435 and SW620. In vivo near infrared (NIR) imaging demonstrated specific targeting of FNR-675-RBEGFR to grafted H1650, HCC827 and HT29 tumor in mice. The 64Cu-NOTA- RBEGFR was detected at the implanted tumor from 1 h (SUVmax', ' 1.340.12) after the injection, peaked at 6 h (1.750.18), maintained to 24 h (1.330.17). The radioactivity significantly decreased by blocking with cold form of 50 M nave RBEGFR 1 day before injection of 64Cu-NOTA- RBEGFR, indicating specific binding of RBEGFR to EGFR in vivo. Optical NIR imaging after i.v. injection of FNR-675-RBEGFR showed specific signal in the abdomen of AOM/DSS mice, but not in control mice. Correlation with surgical/necropsy imaging, fluorescence endoscopy and pathology revealed strong accumulation of FNR-675-RBEGFR in malignant dysplasia, but weak or no accumulation in low grade tumor or benign lesion.In conclusion, the RBEGFR could be developed for specific targeting of cancer overexpressing EGFR. The fluorescence-labeled RBEGFR could be developed for imaging agent for detecting colonic dysplasia and assessing EGFR status. In particular, this agent may have a potential as an imaging companion diagnostics to predict therapeutic outcome of targeted therapy with monoclonal antibody for EGFR through pre-therapeutic visualization of EGFR status.

        "Background":"['Activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the high sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like erlotinib. However, acquired resistance limits the clinical efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, which is the most commonly caused by T790M mutation in EGFR. Second generation EGFR-TKIs such as afatinib are able to inhibit T790M mutation but the clinical efficacy in T790M positive patients is limited due to severe side effects associated with wild type (WT) EGFR inhibition.ASP8273 is a mutant-selective irreversible EGFR inhibitor currently in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier', ' NCT02113813,  NCT02192697). We have previously reported that ASP8273 covalently binds to mutant EGFR via C797 and inhibits kinase activity of mutant EGFR, which results in anti-tumor activity in xenograft models. To further explore the selectivity and the activity of ASP8273 on mutant EGFR, we evaluated effects of ASP8273 and other EGFR-TKIs on EGFR signal pathway, cell growth and anti-tumor activity.Phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK and Akt was determined by Western blot after treatment with EGFR-TKIs at 10, 100 and 1000nM. Apoptosis induction was analyzed by detecting caspase activity after 24h treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Anti-tumor activity of ASP8273 was evaluated in mice xenografted with HCC827 (deletion in exon 19 [del ex19]), NCI-H1975 (T790M/L858R), A431 (WT), and a patient derived LU1868 (T790M/L858R).ASP8273 selectively inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and its down-stream signal pathway, ERK and Akt from 10nM in HCC827 and NCI-H1975 while inhibitory effects were only detected at 1000nM in A431.In NCI-H1650 (del ex19), ASP8273 inhibited cell growth with an IC50 value of 70nM while other EGFR-TKIs were only partially effective. ERK and Akt phosphorylation were diminished after ASP8273 treatment at 1000nM, however, other EGFR-TKIs only partially reduced the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. ASP8273 potently enhanced the caspase activity in NCI-H1650 after 24h treatment, which is concordant with signal and cell growth inhibitory effect.In HCC827 and NCI-H1975 xenograft models, ASP8273 induced tumor regression at 10, 30 and 100mg/kg without affecting body weight. ASP8273 also produced tumor growth inhibition from 10mg/kg in the NSCLC patient derived tumor xenograft, LU1868 which express T790M/L858R. On the other hand, ASP8273 did not produce significant tumor growth inhibition at 10 and 30mg/kg in A431 xenograft model.ASP8273 selectively inhibited mutant EGFR compared to WT EGFR in preclinical models, showing activity in mutant EGFR cell line which is resistant to other EGFR-TKIs including AZD9291 and CO-1686. These results indicate the potential of ASP8273 to induce tumor shrinkage in patients with mutant EGFR positive tumors including those that do not respond to other EGFR-TKIs despite EGFR mutation.']",

However, patients develop resistance in short period of time, which results from secondary EGFRT790M mutation and other mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that activating mutations of EGFR significantly activated IKBKE, an IB kinase family member previously shown to activate Akt and NF-B pathways. Furthermore, we showed that EGFR directly interacts with and phosphorylates IKBKE on tyrosine 153 and tyrosine 179 residues. IKBKE-Y153F/179-F, a mutant that could not be phosphorylated by EGFR, largely reduced its kinase activity and failed to activate Akt and NF-B as well as inhibited EGFR signaling. Furthermore, phospho-IKBKE-Y153 correlated with EGFR activation in NSCLC patients. Notably, depletion of IKBKE by either small molecule inhibitor amlexanox or shRNA selectively inhibited cell viability in NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations. Moreover, we observed that inhibition of IKBKE led to feedback activation of the MAPK pathway. Combination of amlexanox with MEK inhibitor AZD6244 significantly inhibits cell survival and tumor growth in NSCLC cells driven by activating EGFR mutations including EGFRT790M. Thus, our findings not only identify IKBKE as a direct downstream target of EGFR but also provide a potential therapeutic strategy for EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC driven by secondary EGFR mutation.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' There are limited treatment options for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who fail intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The use of light as a means of therapy for bladder cancer (BC) has a long history but has been hampered by a lack of tumor specificity and toxicity. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugates represent an emerging therapeutic approach for malignancies that improves upon tumor specificity. The use of a mAb-photo-absorber (PA) conjugate is a more selective method of delivering light therapy and has been termed photoimmunotherapy (PIT). In this report, PIT is used to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a good tumor-specific target as it is enriched in the basal molecular subtype of BC. In the present study, anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab (pan) was labeled with the PA, IRDye 700Dx (IR700), to create a pan IR700 mAb-PA conjugate which is activated by near-infrared radiation (NIR). Methods', ' BC tissue microarray (TMA) and BC cell lines were analyzed for expression of EGFR. Mechanism of PIT induced cell death was studied using proliferation assays, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and production of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the in vivo effect was studied in xenografts. Results', ' EGFR staining of TMAs showed that while most BCs have expression of EGFR to some degree, squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) have the highest expression of EGFR. Pan IR700 activated by NIR light rapidly killed UMUC-5 cells, a bladder SCC line. Pan alone, pan IR700 without NIR, or NIR alone had no effect on cells. TEM demonstrated that cell death is due to necrosis. Singlet oxygen species contributed towards cell death. NIR-PIT with pan IR700 reduced growth compared to only pan IR700 treated UMUC-5 xenograft tumors. Conclusions', ' PIT is a new targeted treatment for BC. Our data demonstrate that pan IR700-induced PIT selectively kills EGFR-expressing bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and hence warrants further studies in orthotopic models and in patients. We suspect that EGFR-directed therapy with PIT is a viable strategy for the basal molecular subtype of BC and will be testing this hypothesis in the future.']",

        "Background":"['EGFR mutant lung cancers are highly sensitive to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but in the metastatic setting, acquired drug resistance is inevitable. Second-site EGFR mutations, MET amplification, PIK3CA mutations, and histologic changes (transformation to small cell lung cancer, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) have been reported as resistance mechanisms. Up to 40% of cases are still mechanistically unexplained. Surprisingly, despite the importance of the RAS signaling pathway downstream of EGFR, no RAS pathway signaling gene mutations have been reported to occur in acquired resistance. Here, we investigated further the significance of this pathway in preclinical models and tumor specimens. First, we screened 21 lung tumors from 11 mice with acquired resistance to erlotinib (Politi et al. Dis Model Mech. 2010; 3(1-2)', \" 111-9) and found one tumor with a KrasG12V mutation. Next, we established 6 new cell-line based models of acquired erlotinib resistance in 5 different drug-sensitive EGFR mutant cell lines. While 5 lines developed known mechanisms of resistance (i.e. EGFR T790M, MET amplification, EMT), 1 (11-18 cells) developed de novo a NRASQ61K mutation. Single cell cloning suggested that both the EGFR mutation (L858R) and NRASQ61K mutations were in the same cell. Consistent with these findings, NRAS activity was higher in 11-18 resistant cells (11-18R) compared to parental cells. In growth inhibition assays, 11-18R were sensitive only to combined EGFR inhibition with siRNA knockdown of NRAS or with MEK inhibitors. Expression of NRASQ61K in drug-sensitive PC-9 cells conferred resistance to erlotinib. Finally, we screened 127 tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance patients to EGFR-TKIs. No NRAS or KRAS mutations were found, but one patient's tumor harbored in addition to EGFR L858R both EGFRT790M and BRAFV600E mutations. BRAFV600E expression also conferred resistance to EGFR inhibition, both in PC-9 (EGFR exon 19 deletion) and PC-9R cells (EGFR exon 19 deletion plus T790M). Collectively, these data shown that mutations in RAS pathway signaling genes may be infrequent but occur and could influence therapeutic outcomes in trials for patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\"]",

        "Background":"['Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients suffer from a highly malignant and aggressive cancer that currently has no efficacious therapy. These patients have a high rate of relapse and often develop resistance to chemotherapy. Many TNBCs, both in vitro and in vivo, have elevated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) but are resistant to EGFR inhibitors as a monotherapy. The TNBC cell line, BT20, has increased levels of EGFR and is resistant to EGFR inhibitors. To identify the signaling pathways that remain phosphorylated after treatment with gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), we used mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomics. Through these assays we identified many components of the mTOR pathway phosphorylated in the presence of gefitinib and further sought to explore this pathway as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in TNBC. mTOR inhibitors have been investigated in the clinic due to their ability to inhibit the PI3Kinase/Akt pathway thus decreasing cell survival and proliferation. Inhibiting mTOR also importantly inhibits translation. Despite activation of these pathways our TNBC cell lines, BT20, MDA-MB-123, and MDA-MB-468 are resistant to temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. Our studies have found that dual treatment with an mTOR inhibitor and an EGFR TKI has a synergistic effect on decreasing TNBC cell viability, but the mechanism of this synergy is not understood. We have found that the abrogation of both EGFR and mTOR signaling does not alter the phosphorylation status of key signaling pathways including MAPK and Akt. Instead, our preliminary data have identified the translational control protein eIF4B as potentially key fragile point in EGFR and mTOR inhibitor synergy. Therefore, in this study we hypothesized that mTOR inhibition will sensitize TNBC cells to EGFR TKIs through the inhibition of eIF4B phosphorylation. Small molecules have yet to be identified to abrogate the function of eIF4B, which when phosphorylated enhances the helicase activity of eIF4A critical to translation. Therefore, we knockdown eIF4B expression and found a decrease in cell survival comparable to the decrease observed with gefitinib and temsirolimus treatment. In addition, we have identified p70S6K and p90RSK as kinases directly responsible for eIF4B phosphorylation, such that both molecules need to be inactivated in order for eIF4B phosphorylation to be inhibited. This inactivation correlates with a loss of cell growth and viability and a decrease in clonogenic cell survival. Lastly, we have shown that the downstream functions of eIF4B phosphorylation are abrogated with EGFR and mTOR inhibitors. Therefore, taken together these data suggest that in the presence of activated MAPK and AKT, EGFR and mTOR inhibitors have the ability to abrogate cell growth, viability, and survival via disruption of the translational control mechanisms through eIF4B.']",

        "Background":"['A mutant form of EGFR, EGFRvIII or EGFR, is common in glioblastoma (GBM) conferring enhanced tumorigenic activity as well as resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal EGFR antibody, has been shown to exert a modest activity in patients with GBM, but its specific activity against EGFR has not been fully investigated. We treated human glioma cells overexpressing either wild-type (wt) EGFR or EGFR with nimotuzumab with or without temozolomide (TMZ). Nimotuzumab treatment resulted in reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation at C-terminal of EGFR more preferentially than that of wtEGFR, albeit to a lesser extent than tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478. Nimotuzumab-induced EGFR tyrosine dephosphorylation was associated with a decrease in AKT phosphorylation, suggesting suppression of downstream signaling pathways. In animal models, growth of subcutaneous xenografts was suppressed by TMZ, but was not affected by nimotuzumab monotreatment. However, antitumor activity was synergistically enhanced when TMZ was combined with nimotuzumab in both U87MG.EGFR and LNZ308.EGFR xenografts, while such an effect was limited in wtEGFR-overexpressing xenografts. Similarly, compared with nimotuzumab or TMZ monotherapy, the combination treatment of TMZ with nimotuzumab significantly elongated survival of mice bearing intracerebral xenografts derived from U87MG.EGFR (p < 0.001, logrank test), and U87MG.wtEGFR to a lesser extent (p = 0.006). These anti-tumor effects by the combination treatment were associated with a decreased proliferation rate and an increase in apoptosis rate in treated xenografts. The U87MG.EGFR intracerebral tumors which had re-grown after the combination treatment with TMZ and nimotuzumab (escapers) exhibited an increase expression of MGMT as well as a decrease in mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, MSH6 and MLH1. The reduction of MMR expression was further retained in subcultured escaper cells. These expression changes were not observed in xenografts treated with any of vehicles or monotherapies. These results suggest that nimotuzumab has antitumor activity against mutant EGFR-expressing glioma in vivo when combined with TMZ, and the resistance to this combination treatment might involve expression change of both MGMT and MMR.Citation Format', ' Motoo Nagane, Yusuke Nitta, Saki Shimizu, Yukiko Shishido-Hara, Yoshiaki Shiokawa.

This phase I study will determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of AUY922 and E for pts with mutated EGFR and RECIST progression on EGFR TKIs. Methods', ' All pts have EGFR mutant lung cancer, with development of AR (per Jackman, JCO 2010) after treatment with an EGFR TKI.  Pts underwent repeat tumor biopsies after development of AR and prior to study entry.  Pts receive AUY922 IV weekly and E oral daily in 28-day cycles, with dose escalation using standard 3+3 design.  Pharmacokinetics, serial ophthalmology evaluations and weekly assessment for toxicity are required.  Tumor tissue from re-biopsy at study entry is analyzed for EGFR T790M and MET. Results', ' Since April 2011, 11 pts have been enrolled, in 4 of 5 planned cohorts (AUY922 25 mg/m2 + E 75 mg; AUY922 25 mg/m2+ E 150 mg; AUY922 37.5 mg/m2+ E 150 mg; AUY922 55 mg/m2+E 150 mg).  Prior to developing AR, pts were treated with EGFR TKIs for a median of 9 months (range 8-32).  Of 9 pts with tissue analyzed thus far, 6 had EGFR T790M.  Pts have received a median of two cycles (range 1-7), and 5 remain on study. There have been no dose-limiting toxicities.  Adverse events reported in  20% of pts were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and rash, all graded 1 or 2.  No cardiovascular, renal or hepatic toxicities have been observed.  Three pts have reported flashing lights and 2 pts transient night blindness, all grade 1.  Dose escalation continues.  No partial responses have been seen in 6 evaluable pts, 4 patients have confirmed stable disease at 8 wks. Conclusions', ' AUY922 and E is a well-tolerated combination at dose levels up to AUY922 55 mg/m2+ E 150 mg.  Further dose-escalation, MTD, and correlation with markers of AR will be reported.

        "Background":"['Purpose', ' Dysregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family is a hallmark of many cancers. Although targeting of EGFR family has improved outcomes, many patients ultimately fail this therapy. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have gained recent attention due to their unique selectivity in killing homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors while maintaining minimal toxicity in normal tissues. We have previously shown that EGFR inhibition induces synthetic lethality with PARPi in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) in vitro by attenuating DNA repair pathways. In this study, we validated these observations in vivo in HNSCCs xenografts. Importantly, we also tested this strategy in other EGFR dysregulated cancers. Methods', ' Cervical, breast, and head and neck cancer cell lines were used in this study. DNA damage and repair were assessed by immunofluorescence staining of cells for -H2AX, Rad51, and DNA-Pk foci and/or chromosomally integrated HR and nonhomologous end-joining based GFP reporter assays. Cell viability was determined via colony formation and ATPlite assays. Tumor growth delay was assessed in mice bearing tumor xenografts. Results', ' Combined EGFR and PARP inhibition resulted in the greatest tumor growth delay versus either agent alone in mice bearing head and neck tumor xenografts (9 week tumor growth delay when compared to PARPi alone, 3 week tumor growth delay when compared to EGFR inhibitor alone). This correlated with persistent -H2AX foci indicative of unresolved DNA damage. Interestingly, this combination was also effective in other EGFR dysregulated tumors. Human cervical and breast cancer cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity with EGFR and PARP inhibition compared to either agent alone (80-99% cytotoxicity with combination vs 0-20% with either agent alone). Similar to head and neck cancer, susceptibility to PARPi induced by EGFR inhibition was associated with deficient NHEJ- and HR-mediated DNA repair and subsequent persistence of DNA damage. Conclusions', ' Thus, by generating a DNA repair deficit, EGFR inhibition can induce synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition. This can be an innovative treatment strategy for tumors with dysregulated EGFR signaling.']",

Nanoscale TiO2 can be surface conjugated with various molecules and has the unique ability to induce reactive oxygen species after radiation activation. The two major questions that we wish to answer are (1) how are NCs internalized by cells and (2) is targeting of NCs using a small peptide achievable. To address these questions, we have created NCs targeted to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is enriched in many epithelial cancers. Methods', ' 3 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by low temperature alkaline hydrolysis. EGFR targeted NCs were created by conjugating an eleven amino acid EGF peptide to NPs through a dopamine linker. Cell growth and immunocytochemistry were done as usual. X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM) was performed at the 2-ID-E beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories. Results', ' Previous reports have shown that a part of epidermal growth factor (EGF) known as the B-loop is required for binding EGFR. We selected eleven amino acids from this region and synthesized FITC-labeled, dopamine-conjugated peptides. These peptides were then used to treat two isogenic colon cancer cell lines, one with high EGFR expression (SW480) and one with low EGFR expression (SW620). Immunofluorescent imaging of treated cells showed that FITC-labeled peptides colocalized with EGFR labeled with fluorescent antibodies on the cell surface and within the cytoplasm. The synthetic EGF peptides were then conjugated to NPs via dopamine to create EGFR targeted NCs. These NCs also colocalized with EGFR in treated cells by immunofluorescence imaging. This was confirmed using XFM which allows for direct detection of titanium as well as gold. These images showed that EGFR labeled with gold conjugated antibodies colocalized with titanium at the cell surface. Conclusions', ' TiO2 NCs are a promising vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents to certain cell types. Conjugating biomolecules that promote specific uptake and retention in tumor cells will allow for controlled drug delivery. In fact, we have shown that EGFR targeted NCs can successfully colocalize with EGFR on the surface of colon cancer cells.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death with poor survival rates worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and 60% of these have overexpression of wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR), which portends a poor prognosis. In addition, in a recent clinical trial 6 of 12 lung cancer patients whose tumors acquired a resistance-conferring T790M EGFR mutation during treatment with an EGFR TKI reverted to wtEGFR after treatment with Rociletinib/CO-1686, an irreversible EGFR TKI that is selective for the T790M mutant. These data suggest that targeting wtEGFR may improve treatment outcomes; however, to date single agents that target wtEGFR have not been effective in large scale clinical trials and new ways to target wtEGFR in this context are needed. Our laboratory previously identified the MerTK receptor tyrosine kinase as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC and developed MRX-2843 as a novel MerTK-selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with favorable properties for clinical translation. Irrespective of driver oncogene status, treatment with a MerTK inhibitor yields potent anti-tumor effects in NSCLC cell culture models and blocks tumor growth in xenografts of the MerTK-dependent wtEGFR-expressing A549 cell line. In an attempt to more potently block A549 lung cancer cell proliferation, we screened a library of 378 kinase inhibitors that are in various stages of development and identified synergy between MRX-2843 and multiple irreversible EGFR TKIs, including CO-1686 and Osimertinib/AZD-9291. Further, we found that wtEGFR and MerTK were frequently co-expressed and co-immunoprecipitated with each other in NSCLC cancer cell lysates. Synergistic inhibition of cell expansion was observed in a spectrum of NSCLC cell lines with wtEGFR expression treated with the combination therapy, including H1299 (NRAS mutation), H157 (KRAS mutation), H3122 (ALK fusion), and Colo699 (FGFR1 overexpression). On a mechanistic level, combined treatment with 1μM CO-1686 and 100 nM MRX-2843 dramatically inhibited phosphorylation of both MerTK and EGFR and downstream signaling through the PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK pathways, while treatment with equivalent doses of either single agent did not efficiently inhibit MerTK, EGFR or downstream signaling. Additionally, CO-1686 mediated synergistic inhibition of A549 expansion in combination with a PI3K or AKT inhibitor, suggesting a role for PI3K-AKT activation downstream of MerTK contributing to the resistance of wtEGFR NSCLCs to irreversible EGFR TKIs. Taken together, our data provide rationale for a novel strategy for treatment of NSCLC with wtEGFR overexpression by combining MRX-2843 and an irreversible EGFR inhibitor.']",

Patients with poor PS, brain metastasis prior to TKI and mild skin rashes tended to have lower disease control rate. Univariate analysis was used to compare overall survival within each group. Three variables, i.e. PS, response and different TKI had significant influence on the overall survival. Multivariate regression analysis of overall survival confirmed that, at alpha=0.05 level, three variables, which were PS (0-1 vs 3-4, HR, 2.51, 95%CI 1.11-5.68), response (PR+SD vs PD, HR, 4.61, 95%CI 1.97-10.77) and different TKI (gefitinib vs erlotinib, HR, 2.87, 95%CI 1.31-6.29), significantly impacted the overall survival.

The compound selectively inhibits T790M as well as activating EGFR mutations, with much less inhibition to the wild type EGFR. Enzymatic inhibition IC50 against EGFR T790M,T790M/Del19 and T790M/L858R is less than 1nM. In addition, enzymatic inhibition IC50 against EGFR activating mutations Del19 and L858R is around 1nM, with much less inhibition to the wild type EGFR, a 10-time selection ratio.

For the first time, perturbation data were generated using reverse phase protein array probed with 183 phosphorylated proteins involved in various signaling pathways at 11 different time points starting as early as 5 min and up to 24 hours. A novel signaling module comprised of phospho-ATM at Ser-1981, p-53(Ser15), p-IkB- (Ser32/36) and p-Bad (Ser112) was found to be highly upregulated following exposure to Sym004. Concomitantly, high resolution imaging also revealed rapid EGFR degradation and increased endosomal trafficking with Sym004 treatment. Correlation matrix on a temporal scale revealed distinct network topologies suggesting that phosphorylation occurs in distinct waves over time. These response patterns were highly distinct when comparing cetuximab with Sym004.

Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) with fluorescein (a non-specific contrast agent) can provide in vivo microscopy of the bladder as an adjunct to WLC. Targeted CLE with fluorescently labeled peptides against tumor surface markers may further enhance the utility of CLE for real time endoscopic imaging. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is over-expressed in most bladder cancer cells, but absent in the superficial layer of normal urothelium, making it an attractive target for cancer-specific imaging. We report our efforts to identify a non-activating, EGFR-binding peptide labeled with FITC as a cancer-specific contrast agent for ex vivo bladder imaging with CLE. METHODS To screen for EGFR binding peptides, fragments of the EGFR-binding motif of human EGF (EGF14) were displayed on phage surface. Binding affinity of the phage to recombinant EGFR and EGFR-expressing bladder cancer cell line was measured by ELISA. Peptides with the highest EGFR affinity were chemically synthesized and FITC labeled. Potential for activation of EGFR by the peptides was assessed in two EGFR-expressing cell lines by Western blot. For ex vivo imaging of urothelial cancer, fresh human bladder (n=1) or ureter (n=2) specimens were instilled and incubated with FITC-EGFR binding peptide, or a random sequence negative control peptide. Excess peptide was drained, specimens were opened and suspicious and normal appearing mucosa were imaged with CLE. Imaged tissue sections were excised for histopathologic comparison. The bladder and one ureter were first imaged with negative control peptide followed by imaging with the EGF peptide. RESULTS All phage displaying EGF peptides showed greater affinity to recombinant EGFR and EGFR-expressing cells compared to wild type phage. The two phage with highest affinity for EGFR in both ELISA assays were synthesized. Cell stimulation with both peptides did not induce phosphorylation of EGFR or downstream signaling molecules. In bladder and ureter specimens, greater fluorescence intensity was detected in areas of tumor compared to normal urothelium on CLE with EGF4-FITC. Histopathology confirmed that the suspicious regions of the bladder and ureter imaged were urothelial carcinoma. The random peptide showed minimal fluorescent signal on both normal and tumor areas imaged, and subsequent imaging of the same areas with EGF4-FITC demonstrated abundant fluorescent signal in tumor areas only. CONCLUSION We identified peptides derived from the EGF sequence that specifically bind, but do not activate EGFR. Ex vivo imaging of urothelial cancer with EGF4 peptide suggests that it can be used for cancer-specific molecular imaging. Future studies will be aimed at in vivo validation of EGF4 peptide on animal models for urothelial cancer.']",

Importantly, they can interact with other growth factor receptors and non-receptor tyrosine kinases to promote proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis. One such signaling crosstalk occurs between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) that are overexpressed in tumours. The amplification of c-Met in tumours overexpressing EGFR leads to signaling redundancy that causes resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Furthermore, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src has been shown to synergize with EGFR to promote tumour progression and to mediate the crosstalk between EGFR and c-Met. In order to investigate the mechanisms associated with the EGFR-c-Met-c-Src axis, we sought to identify tumour cell lines responding to the dual-inhibition of EGFR and c-Met and the triple-inhibition of EGFR, c-Met and c-Src using pharmacological inhibitions. We identified two androgen independent prostate cancer cell lines with exquisite sensitivity to EGFR-, c-Met-, c-Src-based combinations', ' DU145 and PC3. The results showed that the combination of crizotinib (c-Met inhibitor) + gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) was 2-5-fold more potent (DU145 IC50 = 1.9 M, PC3 IC50 = 1.9 M) than the drugs alone in growth inhibition assay. Furthermore, the addition of dasatinib (c-Src inhibitor) to the crizotinib + gefitinib combination further enhanced its potency (DU145 IC50 = 0.003 M, PC3 IC50 = 0.009 M). When compared with individual drugs, equieffective combinations of gefitinib with crizotinib showed 2-3-fold superior potency in blocking invasion and inducing cytotoxicity. More importantly, the addition of dasatinib to the crizotinib + gefitinib combination significantly enhanced anti-invasive potency and cell-killing by apoptosis. Analysis of signaling crosstalk between the three kinases showed that dasatinib alone or in combination induced re-phosphorylation of c-Src, EGFR, c-Met and STAT3, particularly after 2-6h of drug exposure. The results indicate that these apparent compensatory re-phosphorylation mechanisms induced by dasatinib did not affect the overall potency of the triple combination. Given the role of these three tyrosine kinases in driving proliferation, invasion and survival of cancer cells, our work suggests that triple-inhibition is required for optimal antitumour activity in cells co-expressing EGFR and c-Met.']",

        "Background":"['Recent advances in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stem from the paradigm shift of classifying patients into subtypes based upon the presence of distinct molecular drivers. Subsets of patients, such as those with EGFR mutations and ALK translocations, have dramatic responses in their tumors to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that specifically inhibit these oncogenic drivers. While many patients initially response to TKIs, therapeutic resistance is inevitable. For EGFR-mutant NSCLC, there are multiple described mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Previous studies have implicated the AXL kinase and ZEB1, an EMT transcription factor (EMT-TF), in EMT-mediated EGFR TKI resistance. We have previously demonstrated that the EMT-TF, TWIST1, is required for oncogene-driven NSCLC tumorigenesis, including those tumors with EGFR mutations. In this study, we investigated the role of TWIST1 in EMT-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs.']",

        "Background":"['EGFR is one of the oncogenic drivers in non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC AC). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib, show remarkable single agent activity in NSCLC AC with EGFR mutations. However, a majority of the tumors develop resistance within twelve months. T790M secondary EGFR mutation and activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as MET, are the two most common resistance mechanisms.To address this clinical challenge, we developed IMGN289, an EGFR antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the novel J2898A antibody (Ab), which selectively binds to and inhibits EGFR-driven tumor cell growth, conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a potent anti-microtubule agent, via the SMCC thioether linker. IMGN289 showed significantly enhanced cytotoxic activity, relative to cetuximab or unconjugated J2898A, against tumor cell line models that are dependent on EGFR signaling (Chittenden et al., AACR 2013). To evaluate the ability of IMGN289 to overcome mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance, IMGN289 activity was tested in erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant cell lines which overexpressed MET (HCC827-ER) or carry the T790M EGFR mutation (HCC827-EPR) (Suda et al., Clin Cancer Res 2010). Despite variable levels of EGFR expression in these cell lines, (193,000, 32,500 and 422,000 antigens per cell in HCC827, HCC827-ER and HCC827-EPR, respectively), IMGN289 showed comparable cytotoxic activities against these cell lines in vitro. In addition to MET overexpression, the MET pathway can also be activated by HGF, the MET ligand. While addition of HGF made the HCC827 cell line resistant to EGFR TKIs (Yano et al., Cancer Res 2008) and decreased growth inhibition by cetuximab, IMGN289 activity was unaffected. Additionally, we generated an erlotinib-resistant HCC827-ER-E4 cell line by exposing the EGFR-mutant HCC827 cells to increasing concentrations of erlotinib for 6 months, followed by subcloning. The HCC827-ER-E4 cell line expressed mesenchymal markers and acquired a mesenchymal phenotype. It expressed lower levels of EGFR, HER3 and MET compared to the parental cell line and showed no loss of PTEN. In the presence of erlotinib, HCC827-ER-E4 cells retained high levels of pAKT and pERK, suggesting that activation of alternative signaling pathways may be responsible for the erlotinib resistance. In vitro cytotoxic assays showed that IMGN289 was equally cytotoxic to the parental and the HCC827-ER-E4 cell line.In conclusion, IMGN289 demonstrated EGFR-targeted cytotoxicity against NSCLC cell lines that harbor some of the most common mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs. IMGN289 represents a promising novel candidate for treatment of EGFR-expressing NSCLC AC that has acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.']",

        "Background":"['The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) are receptor tyrosine kinases that each plays a key role in cancer signaling.Co-expression and activation of MET and EGFR are found in a number of tumor types, including non-small cell lung, colorectal, gastric, and head and neck cancers (Nanjo et al. 2013). Blocking one receptor tends to up-regulate the other, leading to resistance to single-agent treatment (Engelman et al. 2007). Amplification of MET and/or high levels of HGF expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with intrinsic or acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR (Engelman et al. 2007; Yano et al. 2011). Conversely, MET-amplified lung cancer cells exposed to MET-inhibiting agents for a prolonged period develop resistance via the EGFR pathway (McDermott et al. 2010). The crosstalk between the MET and EGFR pathways suggests that dual inhibition of these targets may lead to improved outcomes for patients with MET- and EGFR-positive cancers, and that simultaneous inhibition may overcome or delay resistance compared to the blockade of just a single pathway. LY3164530 is an engineered mAb-scFv bispecific antibody that consists of an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody to MET and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to EGFR fused to the N-terminus of each heavy chain (HC). LY3164530 binds to extracellular domains of MET and EGFR with high affinity and inhibits signaling via both MET and EGFR receptors by blocking ligand binding and internalizing and degrading both receptors. In tumor cells, it binds and co-immunoprecipitates both receptors. LY3164530 has increased avidity binding to MET in cells expressing higher level of EGFR. This increased avidity binding leads to better neutralization of HGF compared to parental MET antibody in these cells. Surprisingly, LY3164530 has superior activity in internalizing/degrading EGFR (wild type and mutant forms) in vitro and in vivo relative to the combination of LY2875358 (i.e., emibetuzumab) and cetuximab in cells expressing high MET and EGFR. In addition, LY3164530 has superior activity in overcoming HGF-mediated resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, or vemurafenib as compared to the combination of individual monoclonal antibodies targeting these receptors in cell-based assays. In vivo, administration of LY3164530 results in dose-dependent antitumor activity in multiple cell line-derived NSCLC and gastric xenografts. The antitumor activity of LY3164530 is equivalent, and in some cases superior to the combination of emibetuzumab and cetuximab in NSCLC and gastric tumor models. The Phase 1 study with LY3164530 is on-going (NCT02221882).']",

        "Background":"['Ameloblastoma is a locally destructive and invasive tumour that can recur despite adequate surgical removal. Growth factors and their receptors play a key role in the growth of normal tissues and the development and progression of human neoplasms. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a peptide growth hormone widely spread in human tissues, regulates proliferation of both normal and neoplastic cells. Increased expression or activity of EGFR has been shown in various cancers and in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas it is overexpressed in more than 90% of cases, emerging as a therapeutic target. The inhibition of EGFR has recently been suggested as a treatment option for ameloblastomas. Despite intense efforts that have been made to inhibit the activity of EGFR and HER2, most tumors do not respond well to treatment, and those that initially respond well after a time become resistant. Evidence shows a new pathway of EGFR activation, which activates the nuclear translocation of EGFR gene expression and other cellular processes. Upon signal activation, EGFR accumulates in the nucleus facilitated by binding with transcription factors E2F1 and STAT3 through importins, leading to up-regulation of B-Myb, iNos and cyclin D1. However, this nuclear translocation has not yet been investigated in ameloblastomas. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the EGFR nuclear translocation in encapsulated (unicystic) and infiltrative (multicystic) ameloblastomas using immunofluorescence analyzed by confocal microscopic. Eleven formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded ameloblastoma samples were included in the study (n = 8 multicystic and n = 3 unicystic). EGFR nuclear translocation was assessed by using immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopic analysis, after double staining with a mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody (clone 8G6.2)/rabbit polyclonal to lamin B1. To assess colocalization of nuclear EGFR and cyclin D1, we performed double staining with a mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody and rabbit monoclonal anti-cyclin D1. Inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma were used for comparison. Our results showed that ten cases of ameloblastoma exhibited nuclear translocation. This positive staining was observed in the ameloblast-like cells. The EGFR nuclear translocation was also observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and in the epithelium of inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia. In addition, nuclear EGFR colocalized with cyclin D1 in ameloblastomas. In conclusion, our study suggests that nuclear translocation of EGFR plays an important role in ameloblastoma pathogenesis and it may be associated with cell proliferation.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Emergence of acquired resistance invariably limits the efficacy of these agents, and the dynamics of clonal evolution during anti-EGFR blockade are poorly understood. At progression, RAS mutations represent the most common genetic alterations, while EGFR extracellular domain (ECD) mutations are acquired by a smaller cohort of patients. We found that the mutation profile correlates with the clinical outcome of patients; in particular those who develop RAS mutations upon EGFR blockade achieve reduced tumor shrinkage and shorter duration of response respect to patients in which EGFR ECD mutations emerge during therapy. We investigated in preclinical models the potential role of RAS and EGFR ECD mutations during the emergence of acquired resistance, by tracking the evolution of clones in a genetically barcoded population of CRC cells chronically treated with cetuximab. We observed that therapeutic (target therapy, chemotherapy) and environmental (reduced nutrient condition) pressures differentially shape the clonal composition of CRC cell populations, leading to the emergence of clones with the highest fitness in presence of the external pressure. In conclusion, a multistep clonal evolution process characterizes the development of drug resistance and is associated with the clinical outcome of CRC patients treated with anti-EGFR antibodies.']",

Methods', ' The patient material included 102 patients with KRAS exon 2 wt metastatic colorectal cancer treated with anti-EGFR antibodies.
