        "Background":"['E7386, a novel orally active CBP/beta-catenin modulator, has an impact on cancer cells with aberrant activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway driven by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation or beta-catenin mutation and shows significant antitumor activity in xenograft models. CBP/beta-catenin transcriptional activation has an important role in not only malignancy of cancer cells but also regulation of tumor microenvironment such as fibroblast, pericyte, endothelial cells and immune cells. In this study, we investigated E7386 effect on tumor microenvironment and if it leads to enhance antitumor activity of lenvatinib. Lenvatinib is a potent anti-angiogenic inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptors and other proangiogenic and oncogenic kinases. Firstly, we tested the combination of E7386 with lenvatinib in Wnt-1 tumor isogenic models, where tumors isolated from MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice were inoculated in mice. While E7386 and lenvatinib individually suppressed tumor growth and caused tumor dormancy, the combination resulted in approximately 75% tumor reduction. To clarify the effect on tumor microenvironment, we tested an isograft model of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells which was resistant to E7386 in vitro proliferation. E7386 and lenvatinib individual treatments showed a significant antitumor effect, but the antitumor effect of the combination was significantly superior to that of each mono-treatment. Therefore, we compared effects of E7386 and lenvatinib on tumor microenvironment in immunohistochemical analysis using CD31 Ab as an endothelial marker and alpha-SMA Ab as a pericyte and cancerous fibroblast marker. E7386 significantly decreased alpha-SMA positive cells and microvessel density in tumors. In addition, remaining tumor vessels were not covered with pericytes. In lenvatinib treated tumors, greater reduction of microvessel density was observed than in E7386 treated tumors, but tumor vessels covered with pericytes, which are known to be resistant against VEGF inhibitors, were remained. In combination treatment, most of the tumor vessels disappeared. The enhancement of antitumor activity in the combination was also observed in SEKI human melanoma xenograft model which is relatively resistant to lenvatinib. These data suggest E7386 sensitizes tumor to lenvatinib through the modulation of the tumor microenvironment that is resistant to VEGF inhibitors. Taken together, E7386 shows not only antitumor activity via the effect on cancer cells but also through the modulation of tumor microenvironment, and the treatment of E7386 with lenvatinib is a novel combination therapy to overcome resistance to VEGF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Colon cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Mutations of the APC gene are found in the majority of sporadic cases of polyps and cancer and are the cause of familial adenomatous polyposis.  The role of inflammation in the progression of polyps to cancer is well established.  Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a member of the CD28-B7 immunoglobulin superfamily that mediates non-antigen specific interactions w/ antigen presenting cells and prevents or down-regulates the activation of T-cells in response to a stimulus.  Treatment of cancer patients with anti-CTLA-4 antibody (aCTLA4) has shown some promise in melanoma, prostate and ovarian tumors.  We have recently observed polyp specific T-cell responses in a mouse model of polyposis and hypothesize that treatment with aCTLA4 will enhance this response, resulting in a reduction of polyps.  Methods', '  Using a well-established murine model of polyposis, APC468, animals were randomized to receive either 100g monoclonal aCTLA4, 9H10 (BioXCell), or PBS.  Intraperitoneal injections were performed every other day for 3 doses.  The primary endpoint was number of polyps in the small intestine and large intestine.  Animals were sacrificed and polyps were counted by gross inspection at 3-weeks (n=6 for each group) and 6-weeks (n=3 for each group) post injection.  Interferon- ELISPOT analysis was performed on splenic lymphocytes to evaluate tumor specific immunity.  Results', '  A reduction in small intestinal polyp count was seen in the 3-week aCTLA4 group compared to controls, 48 +/- 13 vs. 100 +/- 12 (p=0.0154).  This decrease was sustained at 6-weeks, 46 +/- 6 (p=0.0032).  No significant difference was noted in large intestinal polyp counts at 3- or 6-weeks.  Preliminary ELISPOT analysis revealed a trend toward increased spots in the aCTLA4 group.  Conclusions', '  Anti-CTLA4 treatment with a monoclonal antibody resulted in a reduction of polyp load in a murine model of intestinal polyposis up to six weeks following treatment.  Thus, aCTLA4 may be useful for treatment of intestinal pre-neoplasia.  Further studies are needed to assess the immunologic affect of aCTLA4 in the treatment of polyposis and colon cancer.']",

Effective uptake of tumor cells by APC is achieved pre-clinically by labeling them with -gal glycolipids (-gal) and exploiting the natural anti-Gal antibody response that constitutes approximately 1% of immunoglobulins in humans. The current study involves intratumoral injection of glycolipids expressing -gal epitopes in patients (pts) with advanced melanoma and evaluates, in HLA-A2+ treated pts, the development of immune responses to common melanoma-associated antigens (MAA).Methods', ' Eligibility criteria included unresectable metastatic melanoma (recurrent stage III or stage IV); at least one readily resectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or readily palpable lymph node metastasis; and a serum anti-Gal titer above 1', '50.

Similar increases were not observed for the other 5 pts with detectable MAA pentamer+ cells. Furthermore, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MAA pentamer+ T cells, an indirect measure of T cell activation potential, was markedly higher post-treatment, as compared to pre-treatment, for 2 of 3 pts in dose level 1 (11227 vs. 3027, and 4045 vs. 1581). Substantial changes in MFI were not observed for the other pts..Conclusions', ' Intratumoral injection of -gal glycolipids can increase the ex vivo frequency of circulating MAA reactive T cells in some pts with advanced melanoma.

Results', '    A family history of malignancy was noted in 301 of 397 pts (76%). Seventy-six pts (19%) were diagnosed with 99 additional malignancies, most frequently breast cancer (n=23), prostate cancer (12), melanoma (12), thyroid cancer (6) or a second sarcoma (10). Sarcoma was diagnosed prior to or synchronously (within 6 months) with another malignancy in 20 pts and metachronously in 56 pts. In 18 pts, sarcoma arose within a prior radiation field.

NX is obtained from the bark of the cork tree, Phellodendron amurense. A panel of melanocyte and melanoma cells was evaluated for basal autophagy level and effect of NX treatment, including protein levels and turnover of p62 and LC3B (+/- CQ), and number of autophagic puncta per cell. Trypan blue, MTT, and Annexin V-APC were used to evaluate the effect of NX on cell death, proliferation and apoptosis. Genetic approach using siRNA for p62 and overexpression using HA-p62 followed by survival, proliferation, and autophagy measurements were used to further evaluate the possibility of p62 as a molecular target for inhibition of autophagy seen using NX. We found that i) melanoma cells displayed high autophagic flux compared with melanocytes, ii) NX treatment a) inhibited autophagy in melanoma cells, b) inhibited melanoma cell survival, and c) induced apoptosis in melanoma cells, iii) knockdown of p62 resulted in a lesser inhibition of cell viability and autophagy after NX treatment in high p62-expressing melanoma cells, and iv) overexpression of p62 sensitized low p62-expressing normal melanocytes and melanoma cells to NX-mediated cell death and autophagy inhibition, suggesting that p62 is a bonafide molecular target of NX. Overall, we show that Nexrutine is able to inhibit the inherent high level of pro-survival autophagy in melanoma cells, leading to loss of cell viability and induction of apoptosis, while melanocytes remain unaffected by NX at the same doses. Further, SQSTM1/p62 was found to be a critical mediator of the NX-mediated inhibition of autophagy and cell viability. This study demonstrates that NX maybe a promising novel, non-toxic agent for melanoma.Supported by R21 CA125719 & ACRCF (RG); NIDCR T32 DE14318/COSTAR (HGH)']",

Previous studies have isolated hsp from autologous melanoma tumor cells in vitro and then re-inoculated into patients as exogenous therapeutic vaccines. Heating of cells by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to upregulate hsp expression in vivo. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a commercially available cytokine that works as an immune adjuvant by mediating dendritic cell (DC) maturation, increasing surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules of DCs, and enhancing antibody responses to known immunogens.

Our previous work demonstrated that the recombinant Hp-NAP fused with the maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli (rMBP-NAP) exert an important role in regulating the differentiation of Th1 cells. As a potential TLR2 ligand, it was reported to possess the ability to induce systemic antitumor immunity in murine hepatoma H22 and sarcoma S180 tumor models. To further understand the antitumor and immunomodulatory effect of rMBP-NAP, we elucidate the effect and mechanism of rMBP-NAP at the local immune response modulation in established mouse B16-F10 melanoma pulmonary metastasis model. Our results demonstrated that metastatic lung tumor growth was significantly arrested after rMBP-NAP treatment, along with marked reduction in the number of lung nodules and significant increase in survival. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping and Quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that rMBP-NAP could induce both local and systemic immune responses, which associated with higher influx of CD3+CD4+T cells, CD3+CD8+T cells and higher secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-27 cytokines. The intraperitoneal administration of rMBP-NAP in mice promoted infiltration of lymphocyte in the lungs and reduced the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF) -β, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect in local area. By comparing with control mice, mRNA expression of chemokines also revealed that rMBP-NAP treatment substantially decreased the expression of CCL2 and CCL20 in tumor tissues, which are central to recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) to tumor microenviroment and form immunosuppression. Moreover, we assess the expression of vascular marker CD34 in pulmonary section using immunohistochemical method, the results showed the vascularization was apparently inhibited in rMBP-NAP treated tumor bearing mouse. In conclusion, rMBP-NAP could induce the activation of effective Th1/Tc1 cells and the production of relevant inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are responsible for enhencing T cell immunity and reversing immunosuppression against metastatic cancer progression. Our findings strongly indicate that rMBP-NAP treatment might be a novel therapeutic approach against metastatic melanoma, and rMBP-NAP might be a potential template for the development of agents that could be used as immunomodulatory adjuvant in the therapy against melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Overcoming immune tolerance is critical for the development of effective immunotherapy against cancer. Tumor cells induce tolerance through a variety of modalities including the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-, the expression of inhibitory ligands, and the generation of cells with regulatory properties. Epigenetic modifiers have gained special attention due to their ability to modify immune regulatory pathways. In this context, a group of chemical compound collectively named histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have recently been shown to modulate tumor cell immunogenicity, adding a new property to their already well-documented cytotoxic effect against transformed cells. LBH589 is a potent, pan-HDACi that has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of several hematological malignancies. Here, we provide evidence of the anti-melanoma effect of LBH589 through its direct effects upon tumor cells as well as its modulatory effects upon immune cells. Indeed, treatment of human and murine melanoma cells in vitro with LBH589 resulted in inhibition of melanoma proliferation, characterized by cell cycle arrest in G1. Moreover, we found that LBH589 enhances the expression of MHC class I and II molecules on melanoma cells, which is critical for immune recognition. In addition, LBH589 treatment inhibits the production of IL-10, while enhancing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and the expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). LBH-treated APCs also displayed an enhanced capability to activate nave antigen-specific T-cells as evidenced by their increased production of IL-2 and IFN-. More importantly, LBH589-treated APCs also restored the function of anergic T-cells isolated from tumor bearing mice. Finally, in vivo treatment of B16 melanoma bearing mice with LBH589 resulted in a substantial decrease in tumor growth when compared to vehicle-control treated mice (mean 602mm3 vs. 1316mm3, respectively). In conclusion, the dual ability of the pan-HDACi LBH589 to target both melanoma cells and to enhance anti-tumor immune responses provides the rationale for evaluating this compound either alone or in combination with immune enhancing therapeutic approaches (eg, CTLA4 blockade) for melanoma treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid that is exposed on surface of apoptotic cells, tumor cells and tumor endothelium. PS has been shown to promote immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment. Antibodies that target PS have been shown to reactivate anti-tumor immunity by polarizing tumor associated macrophages into a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, reducing the number of MDSCs in tumors and promoting the maturation of dendritic cells into functional APCs. In a mouse B16 melanoma model, targeting PS in combination with immune checkpoint blockade promoted greater anti-tumor activity than either agent alone. This combination was shown to enhance CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in the tumors of treated animals. Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective focal treatment of primary solid tumors, but is less effective in treating metastatic solid tumors as a monotherapy. There is evidence that RT induces immunogenic tumor cell death and enhances tumor-specific T cell infiltration in treated tumors. The abscopal effect, a phenomenon in which tumor regression occurs outside the site of RT, has been observed in both preclinical and clinical trials when RT is combined with immunotherapy. In this study, we show that irradiation treatment of B16 melanoma causes an increase in PS expression on the surface of viable tumor and immune infiltrates. We subsequently examined the effects of combining RT with an antibody that targets PS (mch1N11) and immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1) in B16 melanoma. We found that treatment with mch1N11 synergizes with RT to improve anti-tumor activity and overall survival in tumor bearing mice. In addition, the triple combination of mch1N11, RT and anti-PD-1 treatment displayed even greater anti-tumor and survival benefit. Analysis of local immune responses in the tumors of treated animals revealed an increase in tumor-associated macrophages with a shift towards a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype after treatment with RT and mch1N11. In addition, analysis of the systemic immune responses in the spleen and tumor draining lymph nodes revealed an increase in CD8 T cell activation, effector cytokine production and differentiation into effector memory cells in the triple combination. This finding highlights the potential of combining these three agents to improve outcome in patients with advanced-stage melanoma and other cancers and may inform the design of clinical studies combining PS-targeting antibodies with RT and/or checkpoint blockade.']",

Indeed, TA can be encapsulated into erythrocytes that will be used as carrier to specifically deliver the TA to APC, which will ensure their degradation and presentation to T cells.Materials and Methods', ' The proof of concept was established with Ovalbumin (OVA), tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2 (melanoma TA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA, prostate TA).

Then, erythrocytes containing TA were intravenously injected to mice concomitantly with Poly(I', 'C) adjuvant. The CTL response was analyzed by IFN ELISPOT and in vivo lysis of TA-expressing target cells injected to immunized mice. Humoral response was assessed by the determination of TA-specific immunoglobulin titer in mouse serum.Results', ' All TA were efficiently encapsulated in erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. A strong T-cell response was induced after 2 injections of TA encapsulated in erythrocytes', ' 2g of OVA and 20g of TRP2 induced the in vivo lysis of 97% and 96% of TA-target cells, respectively. By comparison, injections of free antigen induced less than 5% of lysis. Furthermore, a significant number of TA-specific IFN-secreting cells was generated (1585 and 286 cells / 106 cells for TRP2 and PSA, respectively) compared to the free TA (< 80 cells / 106 cells for both TA). In addition, we established a dose-dependent PSA-specific humoral response. Finally, a significant delay of tumor growth was obtained in mice more than twenty days after the subcutaneous implantation of EG7-OVA or B16F10 (melanoma) tumor cell lines, compared to injections with free antigen or control vehicle.Conclusion', ' The use of erythrocytes as TA carrier to specifically deliver antigen to APC and induce efficient immune response against tumor can be a very promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy.']",

We could previously show that hyper-activation of the PI3K signaling cascade by genetic knock-out of the counteracting phosphatase PTEN induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype in myeloid cells. This resulted in protection of conditional knock-out mice in models of acute infection and inflammation.A reduction in pro-inflammatory responses could however increase tumor burden. To address this question we induced colitis associated colon cancer in conditional PTEN-KO mice and found an increase in tumor burden and a reduction in survival in male KO mice. This was accompanied by increased numbers of splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the immune checkpoint regulators PD-L1 and PD-L2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis in these cells revealed a shift towards gene expression profiles found in professional APCs capable of cross-presentation. As expected, ex-vivo stimulated T-cells from KO-mice showed a reduction in proliferative capacity. These findings were further substantiated by findings in a second tumor model using implanted B16 melanoma cells. In this model myeloid PTEN-deficient mice showed a decrease in T-cell activation and a reduction in melanoma cell killing capacity.Taken together, our findings show that genetic deletion of PTEN in cells of myeloid origin increases splenic APCs expressing immune checkpoint regulators resulting in a decrease in tumor immune surveillance.

Both model-antigen encoding RNA and physiologically-relevant tumor-derived RNA, when encapsulated in NPs, could expand potent anti-tumor T-cell immunity. We demonstrated that RNA-NPs harness the anti-viral defense mechanism against tumor antigens in a type I interferon dependent manner, and can be further engineered to deliver combinatorial therapies by co-encapsulating mRNAs encoding for immunomodulatory molecules (i.e. HCV PAMPs, GM-CSF).

We and others have therapeutically exploited this attractive target using IL13-based targeting strategies to deliver bacterial toxins, chemotherapeutics, nanoparticles, viruses and immunotherapy directly to the IL13R2 tumor-restricted biomarker. In past work, we found multiple mutational hotspots on IL13 that (a) abrogated its binding to the physiologically abundant IL13R1/IL4R receptor heterodimer, and (b) increased its binding to the tumor-restricted IL13R2. Based on these findings, we created a delivery platform established as an optimized IL13R2-Targeted Quadruple Mutant of IL13 (TQM13; IL13.E13K/R66D/S69D/K105R) that we demonstrated binds with high affinity towards IL13R2, but not the IL13R1/IL4R receptor heterodimer. Of importance, we demonstrated the ability of radiolabeled TQM13 to target IL13R2-expressing tumors in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). The objective of this current work was to demonstrate for the first time the in vivo IL13R2-targeted killing effect of our optimized TQM13 ligand genetically fused to a potent derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE).We successfully expressed TQM13 and TQM13-PE proteins in an E. coli expression system, denatured, refolded and purified them via Nickel-based affinity and ion exchange chromatography. We demonstrated IL13R2-specific affinity of TQM13 using a novel IL13R2-inducible system in which B16 melanoma cells expressed varying amounts of IL13R2 in proportion to the concentration of doxycycline. Of importance, the number of induced TQM13 binding sites (in vitro and in vivo) was comparable to the range seen in GBM and other malignancies (50,000-4,500,000 receptors/cell). In addition, we demonstrated that TQM13-PE killed cells in direct proportion to IL13R2 expression. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of TQM13-PE in an orthotopic murine GBM model by injecting mice with 1 g of TQM13-PE intracranially on day 7 and 14 post stereotactic tumor cell implantation. We found a significant increase in survival only in mice bearing IL13R2-expressing orthotopic tumors, in contrast to mice bearing IL13R2-negative tumors.Thus, we have successfully generated an optimized, biomarker-targeted anti-GBM agent that demonstrated specific therapeutic potential against the tumor-associated IL13R2 biomarker in vivo.']",

SEA-CD40 is derived from dacetuzumab, a humanized IgG1 previously developed and studied for B-lineage malignancies. Glycosylation of the antibody Fc is essential for Fc receptor-mediated activity and non-fucosylated antibodies show improved efficacy, particularly via increased binding to low affinity FcRIIIa. Enhanced functionality of SEA-CD40 was determined through FcRIIIa binding affinity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, activation of the immune response, and induction of antigen-specific T-cells. While SEA-CD40 and the parent antibody dacetuzumab bind to CD40 with similar affinity, the non-fucosylated SEA-CD40 binds equally well to the low (158F) and high (158V) affinity versions of FcRIIIa with higher affinity than dacetuzumab. The consequence of enhanced SEA-CD40/FcRIIIa binding is potent ADCC activity against a CD40+ lymphoma B cell line and improved agonistic signaling to antigen presenting cells (APCs). SEA-CD40 treatment of human PBMCs elicits a robust immune response as measured by increased cytokine production and up-regulation of maturation markers on APCs with maintained activity at antibody concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. The immune stimulatory properties of SEA-CD40 were observed in vivo as increased activity in xenograft and syngenic tumor models as well as induction of cytokine production in cynomolgus monkeys. Both in-vitro and in-vivo activity of SEA-CD40 was significantly greater than with dacetuzumab. The increased functionality of SEA-CD40 occurs through the non-fucosylated Fc domain as a F(ab)2 version loses the ability to induce ADCC, stimulate cytokines, or up-regulate APC activation markers. SEA-CD40 induction of antigen specific T-cells was assessed using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to influenza antigen. In the presence of SEA-CD40 influenza specific T-cells mount a robust antigen-specific response characterized by tetramer staining and elevated production of IFN. SEA-CD40 activity on PBMCs from donors with melanoma, pancreatic, or breast cancer was assessed and tumor antigen specific T-cell proliferation and IFN production was observed.

However, identifying patients best suited for specific immune therapies, and determining optimal treatment regimens continue to be a clinical challenge. Using a molecular-detailed computational systems pharmacology model to identify cellular biomarkers and optimize regimens, we may be able to predict the efficacy of regimens in specific patient populations, and expedite drug development for cancer treatment. We developed a cell/receptor-based multi-compartment systems pharmacology model focusing on the immune response against a growing tumor, with the intent to test the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 administered as mono- and combination therapies. Additionally, the model also allows for testing of other immuno-therapies, such as adoptive cell therapies, which can be combined with the checkpoint inhibitors. The model was designed and developed using the SimBiology plug-in in MATLAB. Simulations were performed with parameters that define the immune response at particular tumor stages of melanoma and NSCLC. All results were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to experimental pre-clinical and clinical data for model validation, or used for the generation of predictions suitable for further experimental testing. In silico, we have identified that administrations of the prescribed doses of 1-10 mg/kg of anti-CLTA-4 (based on binding kinetics) effectively saturates the receptors on the T cells, and promotes both an extended life span of the antigen presenting cells (APCs), and the maximum attainable activation levels of the effector T cells. The model further predicts that the effectiveness of anti-CTLA-4 therapy is limited by the immunogenicity of the system (i.e., the antigen intensity level and number of APCs presenting the antigens) in a monotonic fashion. Furthermore, injecting activated APCs without therapy would show a temporary tumor response and a subsequent recovery by the tumor to its original growth trajectory, while raising the antigen intensity had a sustained effect on tumor response. Other simulations indicate that, despite the lack of apparent tumor response, a sustained immune attack may be ongoing in the body; however, the immune activity is proportionally limited by the tumor and regulatory cells. Lastly, several dose-responses and clinical trials were simulated for both combination and monotherapies, and correlated with published clinical trial data.

Inhibition of HSP70 thus results in defective lysosome function, along with impaired autophagy. We previously reported that the HSP70 inhibitor phenylethynesulfonamide (PES) is a potent and effective autophagy inhibitor (1). PES shows marked cytotoxicity to tumor cells, but minimal effects in normal, non-transformed cells. We previously reported that PES binds to both HSP70 and to the constitutively-expressed family member HSC70; these are critical co-chaperones for HSP90, and we previously reported that treatment of tumor cells with PES leads to decreased function of HSP90 client proteins like HER2, AKT and CDK4 (2). We have recently performed a preliminary structure-activity relationship for PES. These studies revealed a novel PES analogue that we call PES-Cl, which shows 10-fold decreased IC50 for tumor cells, minimal cytotoxicity to normal cells, and a greatly enhanced ability to inhibit autophagy. In vitro we show that PES-Cl is cytotoxic to melanoma cells, including those with both intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors, but shows minimal cytotoxicity to primary melanocytes. In a pre-clinical model for B-cell lymphoma (Eu-myc transgenic mouse), we show that PES-Cl demonstrates significant ability to extend the life of mice (p=0.000006), with no evidence for liver pathology or toxicity. We report that PES binds to the substrate-binding domain of HSP70, and requires the C-terminal helical lid of this protein (amino acids 573-616) in order to bind. Using molecular modeling and in silico docking, we have identified a candidate binding site for PES in HSP70, and we identify point mutants that fail to interact with this compound. Our cell cycle analyses of PES-Cl-treated cells show that this compound induces G2/M arrest. Interestingly, we also show that this HSP70 inhibitor impairs the activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) in cell-free extracts.

Most frequently co-mutated genes in BRAF mt CRC were TP53 (56%), APC (26%), and PIK3CA (19%), and most frequently overexpressed proteins were TOP2A (90%), EGFR (77%), and cMET (57%). Most frequently co-mutated genes in BRAF mt Mel were CDKN2A (28%), ROS1 (19%), and TP53 (13%), and most frequently overexpressed proteins were PD1+ TILs (75%), and TS (71%). When compared with BRAF mt Mel, BRAF mt CRCs had a greater frequency of TP53 (56% vs. 13%), APC (26% vs. 3%), PIK3CA (19% vs. 1%), and SMAD4 (18% vs. 0%) mutations (all p-values < 0.01); however, mutations in CDKN2A (28% vs. 19%) and ROS1 (19% vs. 12%) appeared at higher rates in mt Mel (statistical significance not reached). BRAF mt CRC had a higher frequency of P-glycoprotein (PGP) (52% vs. 9%), cMET (57% vs. 13%), EGFR (77% vs. 6%), and HER2 (4% vs. 0%) overexpression (all p-values < 0.001), but lower PD1+ TILs (61% vs. 75%; p = 0.012) and ERCC1 (17% vs. 41%; p = 0.004) when compared with mt Mel. Co-occurring RAS mutations were rare, seen in 3 CRC and 2 Mel pts. MEK1 (1/31) and MEK2 (1/31) mutations were detected only in Mel. Mismatch repair deficiency and MSI were seen in 34% of BRAF mt CRC. On examining PD1+ TILs and PDL1 tumor expression in MSI-high (H) and MSIstable (S) CRC, and comparing with Mel, PD1+ TILs were found in 75% of Mel, 80% of MSI-H CRC, and 56% of MSI-S CRC (Mel or MSI-H CRC vs. MSI-S CRC; p < 0.01). PDL1 was positive in 10% of MSI-H and 15.8% of MSI-S CRC and 15% of Mel. Conclusions', 'BRAF mt CRCmay carry molecular alterations that are distinct from BRAF mt Mel, suggesting different carcinogenic pathways, and potential resistance mechanisms. Drug combinations that target these alterations (e.g., cMET, EGFR) may warrant further investigation.']",

        "Background":"['Significant progress has been made with targeted delivery of small molecule cancer therapeutics. The key to clinical success has been the use of extremely potent drugs conjugated to targeting antibodies. There are also classes of very potent and promising therapeutic macromolecules, including protein toxins and RNAi. However, there are several challenges unique to macromolecular payloads that cannot be adequately addressed when using antibodies alone for targeting. These include manufacturing complexity, blood-based catabolism, low payload capacity, poor loading efficiency, and inefficient endosomal escape. Several of these issues have also impeded clinical success with antibody-decorated liposomes. We are addressing these issues by using self-manufacturing nanoparticles, or minicells, derived from E. coli. Minicells are spherical, non-viable 400 nm nanoparticles containing all bacterial components, except the chromosome. Minicells bud off the end of rod-shaped bacteria as a result of unequal cell division after induced overexpression of a gene involved in septum formation. We have developed procedures for purification of minicells, including removal of parental bacteria. Our minicell-producing bacterial strains are genetically engineered to prevent growth outside the laboratory. In addition, we have introduced a lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis mutation, which significantly attenuates endotoxin-related inflammatory responses. We have produced minicells with surface expression of the beta1 integrin-targeting protein invasin. The minicells also contain a bacterially-expressed cholesterol-dependent endosomal membrane disrupting protein, such as listeriolysin O (LLO) or perfringolysin O (PFO), and a potent protein toxin, such as the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin (DT). Invasin binds with high affinity to certain 1-containing integrins, including 51, which is overexpressed in tumor vasculature and several solid tumors. Surface expression of invasin on minicells led to binding and endocytosis into human endothelial cells (HUVECs) and tumor cells lines that express 51 integrin. Despite significant internalization, invasin-expressing minicells were not toxic to mammalian cells at doses of 10,000 minicells per cell. Inclusion of LLO or PFO and DT led to targeted killing of HUVECs and tumor cells (melanoma, colorectal, pancreatic, lung and hepatocellular carcinoma) with IC50s in the range of 50-500 minicells per mammalian cell. In vivo evaluation of minicell toxicity, immunogenicity, tissue distribution and efficacy is in progress. In summary, our minicell-based targeted delivery platform for macromolecular therapeutics reduces manufacturing time and complexity, significantly increases payload capacity, protects payload from blood-based catabolism, and provides a critically enabling endosomal escape mechanism.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' An enhancer is a short stretch of DNA that can be targeted by specific proteins to activate gene transcription, and recent evidence suggests that enhancers can act as key regulators of oncogenes in cancer. Recently, the FANTOM5 project comprehensively characterized enhancer activities in various cell types. Interestingly, several enhancers coding for lncRNAs were commonly up-regulated in multiple cancer types, suggesting that these enhancers may play an important oncogenic role through enhancer-promoter-lncRNA interaction, and may help mediate chemoresistance. However, specific lncRNAs with oncogenic enhancer function and their clinical significance in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unexplored.Aims', ' We analyzed genome-wide cancer-specific enhancer activation in multiple cancers to identify potential oncogenic lncRNAs, and assessed their clinical significance in two independent patient cohorts with CRC. We thereafter evaluated the functional role of candidate enhancer lncRNAs in CRC.Methods', ' Using the FANTOM5 enhancer database, cancer-specific enhancer activity was analyzed in cancers of the colon, stomach, lung, prostate and melanoma. LncRNA candidates that encode these cancer-specific enhancers were identified. We then screened these lncRNAs in two independent CRC cohorts, as well as the APC(Min/+) mouse model. The functional role of target lncRNAs was assessed in parental and chemoresistant CRC cell lines. The oncogenic enhancer activity was confirmed using the chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay.Results', ' We identified ten lncRNA candidates with consistent enhancer activities in all five cancer types. In particular, PVT1 appeared to have one of the highest enhancer activities. Using two independent CRC cohorts, we confirmed upregulation of PVT1 in cancer tissues. Patients with high-PVT1 expression had shorter overall survival in Stage II and III CRCs, suggesting that the PVT1 expression could discriminate high-risk patients, and identify those who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Intriguingly, we discovered that PVT1 was also upregulated in human colorectal adenomas as well as adenomas isolated from APC(Min/+) mice, indicating that PVT1 may be involved in the early stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The expression level of PVT1 significantly correlated with c-MYC expression in CRC specimens and the 3C assay showed that the enhancer region in PVT1 can target c-MYC. Finally, we demonstrated that PVT1 and c-MYC were co-overexpressed in several chemoresistant CRC cell lines, and that suppression of PVT1 led to a significant reduction in proliferation of chemoresistant cells, further suggesting that PVT1 may play a key role in chemoresistance.Conclusion', ' PVT1 acts as an oncogenic enhancer of c-MYC in CRC. High expression of PVT1 served as a predictive marker for identifying high-risk Stage II and III CRC patients. PVT1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in chemoresistant CRCs.']",

PD-1 serves as a negative costimulatory receptor on various cell types, including T and B cells as well as myeloid-derived cells. Its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) is not expressed by normal epithelial tissues, but it is aberrantly expressed on a wide array of human cancers including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc. Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells associated with poorer prognosis by disabling the host antitumor response.

        "Background":"['BackgroundThe NAD+-requiring enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) diverts glycolytic flux into serine production and folate metabolism by catalyzing the oxidization of 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphohydroxypyruvate. The PHGDH gene is located on chromosome 1(1p12), a region frequently amplified in melanoma and certain breast cancer forms. PHGDH knockdown in cells with amplified PHGDH or overexpressing PHGDH at the protein level resulted in cell growth inhibition. In addition ectopic overexpression of PHGDH in a non-tumorigenic cell line induced morphological changes characteristic of transformation. Therefore, inhibitors of PHGDH may be therapeutically valuable.No PHGDH inhibitors have been reported to date, our aim is to develop PHGDH inhibitors targeting the cofactor (and substrate) binding site.MethodsFull length PHGDH and the catalytic subunit (sPHGDH) were expressed in, and isolated from E. coli. PHGDH was found to co-purify with its cofactor, making it necessary to abolish the cofactor-protein interaction to investigate inhibitor binding at the co-factor site. To accomplish this, site-directed sPHGDH mutants were constructed and purified. To characterize the mutants, their enzymatic activity and ability to bind to NADH (assessed by thermal stability and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)) were measured, and their structures were characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and on-going x-ray crystallographic studies.Results sPHGDH retained 60% of the enzymatic activity of the full length protein whereas introduction of single or double point mutations around the cofactor or substrate binding site resulted in complete abolition of enzymatic activity. The binding of NADH (1mM) to PHGDH and sPHGDH resulted in increases in melting temperature (Tm) of 8.4  0.2 C and 9.3  0.5 C respectively. Mutation of the cofactor binding site resulted in reduced ability to bind NADH (Tm = 0.8  0.2 C, 2.3  0.1 C) whereas mutation at the substrate binding site, directly adjacent to the cofactor binding site, had no significant effect on the ability to bind NADH. Congruent findings were obtained via ITC determining a binding affinity (Kd) of 0.66 M for wt sPHGDH and a reduced binding affinity of 3-30 fold for the mutated proteins. CD measurements showed that the proteins mutated at the co-factor binding site had undergone minor changes in the secondary structure compared to the wt sPHGDH whereas mutation at the substrate binding site had no effect on the secondary structure elements.Conclusion Although the mutations carried out were single or double point mutations only, cofactor binding could be reduced substantially, giving rise to markedly lower catalytic activity. These investigations illustrate a promising way of making proteins with large, tight binding ligands accessible to structure-based drug-design.']",

Methods', ' Adnab-9 immunohistochemistry or ELISA was used to define significant p87 Adenoma-associated antigen field effects (FE) in 10 patients with >1cm large high grade dysplastic adenomas (LHiGDA) and 3 with smaller high grade dysplastic adenomas (SHiGDA). We postulated that SHiGDA are not immunologically recognized by host defenses leading to negative outcomes. We used Ion Torrent™ sequencing (ITS) to find mutations in DNA (QiaAmp kit) extracted from 4 normal-appearing colonic segments taken from 1 patient in each group. Novel mutations found on ITS would then be sought using PCR with appropriate primers and subsequent sequencing of the PCR product circulating DNA extracted from available serum samples. These samples were taken from the Large- and SHiGDA groups described above and from 17 patients undergoing colonoscopy for diverse indications.

Other Jak3 mutations were found in 1 of 8 LHiGDA, 1 (the selected patient) of 3 SHiGDA, 1 of 7 patients with FAP and 1 of 10 colonoscopy patients with a family history of colorectal cancer with a FE and an untoward outcome. The selected SHiGDA patient subsequently contracted and died of NSCLC adenocarcinoma. The positive LHiGDA and FAP patients had a severely dysplastic anal condyloma and severe pancreatitis, respectively. Overall, the non-synonymous mutation occurring in the non-FAP SHiGDA patient occurred in the absence of p87 FE. Conclusions', ' In this pilot study we demonstrate the presence of Jak3 mutations likely associated with the lack of p87 expression in patients with high grade dysplastic adenomas and 1 FAP patient. Most of these patients had a clinical course which may have differed from their group members suggesting an altered immune system milieu.

However, their efficacy remains unsatisfactory in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Breast cancer is not highly mutagenic and immune checkpoints blockade therapies for TNBC is not as effective as for melanoma or lung cancer with high mutation rates. Combination of different modalities offers an opportunity to enhance their effect. We studied the synergistic effect of cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy in TNBC mouse model. Here we report that the combination of Doxisome (liposomal encapsulated formulation of Doxorubicin) and anti-PD-1 antibody suppresses tumor growth, reduces lung metastasis and improves survival of mice bearing 4T1-triple negative breast cancer. Moreover, the combination of Doxisome and anti-PD-1 was able to overcome low dose Doxisome resistance in mouse models of TNBC. The success of anticancer chemotherapy is linked to a durable immune response of targeting tumor. We present evidence that the synergistic therapeutic activity of Doxisome with anti-PD1 blockade results in enhanced T cell anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, the synergetic effect is due to increased dendritic cells (DCs) infiltration in tumor microenvironment, which internalize tumor antigens and subsequently activate tumor-reactive T cells. In TNBC mouse model, by combining anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade while shifting the immune response towards CD4+ Th1 with Doxisome, immune tolerance to TNBC tumor can be overcome. Enhancing antigen presenting cells (APCs, e.g. DCs) infiltration by immunogenic chemotherapy and T cell activation by anti-PD1 blockade increase therapy response in TNBC.

High TMB tumors including melanoma, lung cancer and those with microsatellite instability (MSI-H) are associated with susceptibility to immune blockade using checkpoint inhibitors. TMB data in BTC is limited and its association with actionable somatic mutation (mut) profiles in BTC is unknown. Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of 309 FFPE tissue blocks of BTC pts with a hybrid capture of all coding exons of 236 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes rearranged in cancer was done using FoundationOne. Base substitutions, indels, gene fusion/rearrangements, TMB, and MSI status were assessed. TMB was calculated by counting mutations across a 1.25Mb region and classified into high (TMBH20 mut/Mb), intermediate (TMBI; 6 - 19mut/Mb) and low (TMBL< 6mut/Mb). MSI high (MSIH) and Stable (MSS) status was assigned by a computational algorithm examining 114 intronic homopolymer loci. Patients with TMB 6 mut/Mb (N = 60) were included in the clinical correlative portion of this study. Results', ' Sixty patients with TMB 6 mut were identified out of 309 pts of which 9 (15%) were TMBH and 51 (85%) were TMBI. These included 3 (5%) MSIH and 18 (30 %) MSS.

        "Background":"['Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D, CD100) and its receptor plexin-B1 are broadly expressed in cancer; increased expression correlates with poor prognosis. SEMA4D normally functions to regulate the motility and differentiation of multiple cell types, including those of the immune, vascular, and nervous systems. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), SEMA4D is expressed strongly at the invasive margin and modulates the infiltration and spatial distribution of leukocytes, suppressing anti-tumor activity. Neutralization of SEMA4D was evaluated for effects on immune activity and tumor growth in preclinical models, incorporating single agent and combination treatments with other immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors. The safety and tolerability of humanized anti-SEMA4D antibody VX15/2503 was assessed in a Phase I clinical trial.RESULTS', 'SEMA4D restricts migration of myeloid cells expressing cognate PLXNB1/2 receptors, determined using trans-well migration assays and IHC of in vivo tumors. Antibody neutralization disrupted the SEMA4D gradient at the invasive margin, which correlated with recruitment of activated APCs and T lymphocytes into the TME, and significant shift toward increased Th1 cytokines (IFNg, TNFa) and CTL-recruiting CXCL9 chemokine, with concurrent reduction in Treg- and M2-macrophage promoting chemokines (CCL2, CXCL1, CCL17). Accordingly, an increase in Teff', 'Treg ratio (3x, p<0.005) and CTL activity (4x, p<0.0001) was observed. This orchestrated change in the tumoral immune context was associated with durable tumor rejection and immunologic memory in preclinical colon, breast, and melanoma models. Importantly, the immunomodulatory activity of anti-SEMA4D antibody can be further enhanced by combination with other immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy. Strikingly, the combination with antibody to CTLA-4 acts synergistically, with maximal increase in survival (110% tumor growth delay, p<0.01) and complete tumor regression in 100% of mice, as compared to 22% with monotherapy (p<0.01).SEMA4D antibody treatment was well tolerated in nonclinical and clinical studies; including a Phase I multiple ascending dose trial in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. Patients with the longest duration of treatment, 48-55 weeks, included colorectal, breast, and a papillary thyroid patient, who had a partial response by RECIST. Progression free survival strongly correlated with elevated baseline lymphocyte counts (r = 0.6133), supporting an immune mediated mechanism of action for VX15/2503.CONCLUSION', 'Inhibition of SEMA4D represents a novel mechanism and therapeutic strategy to promote functional immune infiltration into the tumor and inhibit tumor progression. A phase 1b/2 trial of combination therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is planned.']",

        "Background":"['Today with the privilege of being able to synthesize extremely small particles in the nano-range and make use of nanoscience and nanotechnology, we can reach superior properties than the bulk scale. Nanoparticles have their own physicochemical properties that make them promising in the field of cancer immunotherapy in form of drug delivery, diagnostic and theranostic modalities. Manipulation of the immune response by therapeutic intervention is becoming of great interest owing to the significant role of immunity in the general health and disease control. APCs like Dendritic cells and macrophages are important targets for the particulate delivery system due to their ability to trigger cascade of events on both levels cellular and humoral immune response specially DCs. Successful targeting of DCs and macrophages will have a great impact on T-cell activation and priming. The design of successful particulate system that can elicit preferential targeting towards specific immune cell in the tumor microenvironment is becoming crucial. This might represent a novel avenue for enhancing the antitumor immunity. Liposomes are made of phospholipid bilayer with a composite nature. Their properties are highly linked to their physicochemical characteristics such as size, surface charge and composition. These physicochemical properties can trigger certain immune response.The hypothesis here whether passive targeting via particulate system can offer a platform for preferential targeting for critical immune cells residing in spleen and tumor. Moreover, test whether there will be differences in uptake according to certain preference towards surface charge in specific time frame. In the current study, three sets of fluorescently labelled nano-liposomes were engineered as a model for different surface charges, the cationic DOTAP NP, anionic DOPG NP and near neutral DOPC NP with mean diameter of ~ 200 nm. Physical stability of the NPs was evaluated by monitoring the changes in size and zeta potential. B16 melanoma cancer model was induced subcutaneously in C57BL/6 black mice, divided into four groups each of five mice. CD11c Dendritic Cells (DCs), CD11b macrophages, CD90.2 T-cells and CD49b Natural Killer (NK) cells were isolated from the tumors and spleens of each group. The three sets of NPs were tested against the isolated cell lines. The cellular uptake (internalization) was assessed by normalizing the fluorescence of the cells against their protein concentration, then all samples were acquired to flow cytometry, and shifts in fluorescence histograms on horizontal axis were monitored against PE channel on the vertical axis. Results reveal the presence of preferential internalization of specific surface charge over others in some cell lines in different time frames. For the first time differences in the internalization pattern are reported in the same immune cell line isolated from two different contexts tumor and spleen.']",
