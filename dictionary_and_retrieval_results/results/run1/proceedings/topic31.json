We aimed to identify whether CDKN2A copy number loss was associated with poor survival in HNSCCs stratified by HPV status. Methods', ' We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck cancer data, integrating genomic measurements with clinical metadata. Patients 85 years old or younger with a primary tumor in the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were included. Defining CDKN2A copy number loss as a relative log2 copy number ratio <0.6, CDKN2A mRNA and p16 protein expression levels were compared to confirm significant differences in gene transcription and translation between the copy number loss and non-copy number loss patient groups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated to characterize prognostic differences between genomic groups. Results', ' 397 patients negative for HPV (HPV) and 91 patients positive for HPV (HPV+) HNSCC were identified. 139 HPV patients and 9 HPV+ patients demonstrated CDKN2A copy number loss. The CDKN2A copy number loss group expressed significantly lower levels of CDKN2A mRNA and p16 protein than did the non-copy number loss group in both HPV+ and HPV disease. Median OS for HPV patients with and without CDKN2A copy number loss was 21.8 months and 46.0 months (P = 0.02). Median DFS was 12.0 and 19.4 months respectively (P < 0.05).

We investigated a cohort of 134 OTSCC patients treated between 2002 to 2008 with combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, who have been comprehensively annotated for patient/tumour characteristics and outcome. 134 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks representative of primary tumours prior to treatment were collected. DNA was extracted from 115 patient blocks and a tissue microarray was made representing 123 patient samples. We assessed p16/CDKN2A expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and correlated each of these with patient outcome.Results. The majority of OTSCC demonstrated loss of p16 expression (107/118, 90.7%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A inactivating mutations was 20.3% (21/103), homozygous CDKN2A loss was 4.1% (7/98), hemizygous CDKN2A loss 30.6% (30/98), and CDKN2A promoter methylation >10% was 17.7% (20/113). 34/107(31.8%) p16 IHC negative tumours had no evidence of CDKN2A mutation, copy number variation or promoter methylation identified. Of eleven p16 IHC positive patients, only two demonstrated evidence of HPV type 16 and 33 on PCR. No correlation was identified between any of the mechanisms of CDKN2A inactivation and clinicopathological features. Smoking status and age did not influence the frequency of any mechanism of CDKN2A inactivation or patient outcome. There was a non-significant trend for worse outcome for p16 IHC negative patients versus IHC positive patients (HR=0.65, 95% CI=0.23-1.79, p=0.40). No significant relationship between mechanisms of p16 inactivation and patient outcome were found.Conclusion.

        "Background":"['Concurrent inactivation of the p16Ink4a and p53 tumor suppressors, often through mutation of CDKN2A and TP53, is frequent in early development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers. The role of this early combined inactivation, and the oncogenic drivers that subsequently lead to tumor development, are poorly defined. To characterize the precancerous role of concurrently mutated CDKN2A and TP53, we combined a number of recent advances to disrupt both loci in primary cells. First, we grew primary keratinocytes in medium conditioned by irradiated J2-3T3 cells and containing an inhibitor of ROCK kinases, conditions that greatly extend their normally limited proliferative potential. Second, we transfected primary keratinocytes with plasmid vectors expressing both Cas9 and sets of guide RNAs targeting specific regions of CDKN2A and TP53. We targeted either or both of the p14Arf and p16Ink4a protein products of CDKN2A for knockout (KO), together with either TP53 KO or a TP53 point mutation (R248Q protein product), two major categories of genetic alterations of p53 in HNSCC. Third, we evaluated use of nutlin-3, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, to try to select against cells that still contained wild-type p53. We assessed KO efficiency by PCR of genomic DNA; the TP53 point mutation introduced a SauA3i site into TP53. Two weeks of nutlin-3 treatment led to a 3 fold increase in p53 KO efficiency versus untreated cells (50% versus 14%). p16Ink4a KO efficiencies were enhanced 2 to 14 fold after nutlin-3 treatment, depending on the specific Cas9/guide-RNA constructs used. In cells transfected to produce p53 R248Q, 14% of PCR products amplifying the mutated region after nutlin-3 exposure showed Sau3Ai digestion, whereas no Sau3Ai digestion was detected in untreated cells. This result suggests that up to 14% of nutlin-3 treated keratinocytes had integrated the mutated donor oligo sequence. We similarly enrich for mutated keratinocytes having p14Arf-specific or combined CDKN2A KO along with TP53 KO or mutation. Combined transfection to generate concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations under conditions that allow extended proliferation in culture, followed by selection for successful TP53 mutation with nutlin-3, will facilitate identification of keratinocyte clones with bi-allelic knockout genotypes. This panel of keratinocytes with concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations will help delineate the roles of these genes in early cancer development and will allow screening for the oncogenic drivers required for tumor development and metastasis, with emphasis on discovering more effective and specific druggable targets for improving treatment.']",

To better utilize this valuable resource, we performed its first genome-wide characterization by investigating 12 canine HNSCC cases, of which 9 are oral, via high density array comparative genomic hybridization and RNA-seq. The analyses reveal that these canine cancers faithfully recapitulate many key molecular features of human HNSCC.

Recent reports have indicated an increase in incidence of SCCOT in the young and in nonsmokers. Among HNSCC, SCCOT appears to be more aggressive with respect to its clinical and biological behavior. Molecular genetic studies on SCCOT are scarce and most studies have been conducted on a small cohort of patients and/or restricted to a single/few molecular marker(s). We have conducted a multipronged molecular genetic study of SCCOT and analyzed the status of known tumorigenesis pathways including TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), microsatellite instability (MSI), CDKN2A, FHIT and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in surgically resected primary tumor samples and correlated with clinocopathological variables. 67% (67/100) of SCCOT samples exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization whereas a greater proportion (87/100; 87%) exhibited elevated EGFR expression, in accordance with existing literature. Interestingly, p53 nuclear stabilization was found to be more common in young (31/39; 79.5%) than in older (35/59; 59.3%) patients (p = 0.0481). As expected, patients with p53 nuclear stabilization exhibited poorer survival. Further, PCR based mutation screening of exons 5-8 of TP53 (encoding the DNA binding domain) revealed mutations in 50% of samples exhibiting nuclear stabilization. HPV infection was observed in 11/82 (13.4%) tumors while the frequencies of MSI (12/86; 14%) and loss of heterozygosity (LoH) in CDKN2A (32.6%) and FHIT (28.4%) loci were significantly higher than previous studies. In addition, LoH at FHIT locus was significantly associated with p53 nuclear stabilization (p=0.047). Analysis of genome-wide DNA copy number alterations (CNA) using array based comparative genomic hybridization revealed unique copy number alterations validated by quantitative PCR.

For HNSCC, cSCC, and aSCC (collectively termed HCA SCC), 395 (30%), 215 (68%), and 211 (83%) were HPV positive, respectively. For HCA SCC, the most common GA were in TP53 (45%), CDKN2A (29%), PIK3CA (24%), TERT (21%), and FAT1 (14%). The most frequent GA differentially associated with HPV status were in PIK3CA (34.9% versus 16.0%), CYLD (11.4% versus 1.4%) and PTEN (14.8% versus 6.1%) for HPV+ cases, and TP53 (3.8% versus 76.5%), CDKN2A ()1.4% versus 49.8%), and TERT (4.3% versus 33.0%) for HPV- cases. Mean TMB for HPV+ and HPV- cases were 6.6 (STDEV 7.3) and 13.7 (STDEV 29.7), respectively. TMB of all SCC cases was significantly different (p < 10-12) when stratified by HPV status. For lSCC and eSCC, the most common GA were found in TP53 (86%) CDKN2A (40%), and PIK3CA (26%) and mean TMB was 11.6 with HPV found in 3.1% of cases. In sSCC, the most common GA were in TP53 (85.5%), CDKN2A (54.3%), and TERT(44.0%), and mean TMB was 59.5 with HPV in 3.1% of cases. Subsets of SCC cases had defining and targetable GA including bi-allelic deletion of SMARCB1 ( < 0.3%), amplification of PD-L1 (~2%), and various kinase fusions. Cases demonstrating radiologic response to immunotherapy and matched targeted therapies, as well as subsequent development of multiple mechanisms of acquired resistance, will be presented. Conclusions', ' HPV driven SCC have similar genomic profiles regardless of of site origin, and have a significantly lower median TMB than HPV negative SCC. Early consistency of responses of SCC to matched therapies may strengthen the case for site independent genomic predictors of therapy response.']",

        "Background":"['Squamous cell carcinoma of tongue (SCCT) is a common form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in developing countries, mainly in India. In the last few decades, a steady increase in incidence rate of SCCT has been reported across the world. More importantly, though SCCT is considered to be a tobacco-related late-onset cancer, recent reports indicate an increase in incidence of SCCT in the young and in non-smokers. We analyzed the status of known tumorigenic pathways/genes including TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), microsatellite instability (MSI), CDKN2A, FHIT and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in 120 surgically resected primary oral SCCT (SCCOT) samples and correlated with clinico-pathological variables and disease specific survival. 78 of 121 (65%) samples exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization confirming earlier reports. Interestingly, p53 nuclear stabilization was more common in young (36/46; 78%) than in older (44/75; 56%) patients (p = 0.0184). Further, PCR based mutation screening of exons 5-8 (encoding the DNA binding domain of p53) revealed mutations in ten of nineteen samples (52.6%) that exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization and in three of fifteen tumors (20%) that did not. We identified a novel 33bp deletion, c.616-648del33, located in exon 5 in a p53 positive tumor from a chronic tobacco chewer. Case control analysis revealed that Proline at TP53 codon 72 increased the risk of SCCOT. Majority of samples (97/121; 80%) exhibited significant EGFR expression though HPV infection was rare (14/106; 13%). MSI was observed in 14/106 (13%) samples, a frequency higher than reported for other populations. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) was more frequently observed in CDKN2A (28%) and FHIT (26%). In addition, LOH at FHIT locus was significantly associated with p53 nuclear stabilization (p = 0.0508), especially in non-smokers. A significant difference in survival rate between p53 positive and negative group (p = 0.0056) (Hazard ratio 2.5595) was observed. Though associated with p53 stabilization, FHIT loss did not exhibit significant effect on patient survival. Interestingly, patients exhibiting p53 nuclear stabilization as well as FHIT loss exhibited worse survival. We performed genome-wide DNA copy number and transcript profiling in several SCCOT samples. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in extent and profile of chromosomal instability in p53 positive and negative tumors. Amplifications were detected at chromosomal regions 3q26.1 (PIK3CA), 5p, 8q22 (MYC, RUNX1T1), 11q13 (CCND1) and 20q13 (HNF). Genome-wide transcript profiling identified novel pathways that appear to drive tumorigenesis in tumors not exhibiting p53 inactivation. Our comprehensive analysis has therefore revealed important insights into the molecular basis for SCCOT and identified prognostic indicators in patients not associated with tobacco use.']",

Whole-exome sequencing showed 29 recurrently mutated genes. Potential therapeutic targets include altered PIK3CA, ERBB2, FGFR3, TSC1, and ERBB3, plus mutated chromatin-regulating genes MLL, MLL2, MLL3, CREBBP, CHD7, SRCAP, ARID1A, KDM6A (UTX), and EP300. There were 22 arm-level CNVs and 27 focally amplified or deleted regions. CDKN2A was deleted in 47%. Low-pass whole genome sequencing identified FGFR3-TACC3 fusions.

FGFR3 is activated by mutation, gene fusion, and overexpression, suggesting clinical trials of FGFR3 inhibitors. PI3-kinase/mTOR/AKT/TSC1 pathway alterations are frequent, and mutation in TSC1 has been associated with response to mTOR inhibitors. ERBB2 amplifications and activating mutations may be targetable with agents such as trastuzumab, trastuzumab-DM1, lapatinib, and neratinib.

Both tumor types exhibit frequent SCNAs in chromosomes 3q, 9p, and 11q. Although CDKN2A is the putative target of 9p deletions, numerous targets have been proposed in the 3q amplicon, including SOX2, PIK3CA, and TP63. Because expression levels are affected by underlying genomic events, we hypothesized that an integrated analysis of multiple genomic data types would provide increased ability to identify target genes in SCNA regions when compared to methods based on copy number alone while providing insight into mechanisms regulating expression. Findings may be subsequently validated by examining multiple tumor types or performing training/testing analyses.Techniques', ' Gene expression (GE), DNA copy number (CN), DNA methylation (ME), and microRNA expression (miR) data were obtained from the TCGA studies of HNSCC and LUSC. Linear models were constructed for each gene to investigate the effect of changes in CN, ME, and miR on GE. Analysis of model output provided an approach to identify target genes in SCNA regions and assess the effect of genomic alterations on expression.Results', ' Genome-wide GE, CN, ME, and miR data were available for n = 279 (HNSCC) and n = 159 (LUSC) tumor samples. Univariate modeling detected a strong overall association between GE and CN, as measured by the coefficient of determination (model R2). Although some genes found in SCNA studies produced large model R2 e.g. SOX2 a number of genes with large model R2 are relatively unknown. Notable examples include DVL3, and SENP2, which were implicated as driver genes in the 3q amplicon by a recent study of LUSC but not identified in the TCGA report. Remarkably, the model R2 for DVL3 and SENP2 was also high in HNSCC, and such a finding in a distinct tumor type provides validation and merits additional study. Output from models additionally including ME and miR as covariates contributes insight into the diversity of regulation of gene expression, but the strength of the association between GE and CN could mask other effects. Thus we constructed linear models in which the response variable was the residuals from the GE/CN model and the covariates were ME or miR. The TCGA study of glioblastoma noted frequent methylation of MGMT. When modeling MGMT we detected a highly significant association between ME and the GE/CN residuals in both HNSCC and LUSC. These results illustrate a pronounced effect of ME on GE conditional on CN.Conclusion', ' Linear modeling techniques provide a flexible and powerful basis for performing integrated analysis of genomic data. Our approach produces predicted results when analyzing known cancer genes, highlights lesser known genes for future study, provides insight into gene regulation, and draws attention to genes relevant in multiple tumor types.']",

Unlike for advanced disease, effective molecularly-driven interventions and risk assessment are not available for clinically normal tissues that may be have been exposed to carcinogens or for precancerous lesions. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) comprises 15-20% of all skin cancers and has the most accessible and clinically well-characterized progression sequence of any human cancer, from a distinct precancerous lesion, the actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive carcinoma. Thus, it is an ideal model for establishing a paradigm of molecularly targeted cancer chemoprevention.METHODS', ' Here, we performed next-generation sequencing of total RNA and miRNA (Illumina HiSeq) on matched isogenic samples of human cuSCC, surrounding normal (chronically irradiated) skin (NS), and AK. In parallel, we profiled matched samples from a UV-driven Hairless mouse model of cuSCC for cross-species analysis, to identify the most important drivers of progression from NS to AK to cuSCC.RESULTS', ' Unsupervised clustering of both mRNA and miRNA expression changes showed that preneoplastic AKs span a continuum indistinguishable from cuSCC or surrounding NS, whereas cuSCC and NS were easily distinguished. Through cross-species computational analysis of mRNA-miRNA functional pairs, we identified miR-21, miR-205, miR-31, let-7B, and miR-497 and their mRNA targets as core drivers of cuSCC development through the AK intermediate. We show that several of these miRNAs are modulated by UV exposure, regulate susceptibility to apoptosis, and regulate cell motility. Several miRNAs are being inhibited in our mouse model to validate them as chemoprevention targets. TRANSFAC analysis identified E2F, SP1, AP1, and TCF3 as key transcriptional regulators of SCC development. We tested the global mRNA and miRNA expression similarities to other tumor types profiled by the NIH TCGA effort, showing that cuSCC is most closely related to head & neck SCC, lung SCC, and basal subtype of breast cancer. Exome analysis confirmed a high frequency of TP53, NOTCH1/2, and CDKN2A mutations in cuSCC, with mutational loads of >30/Mb that are strongly dominated by UVB signature lesions. Surprisingly, NS contains evidence of numerous mutations reflecting UV-induced somatic mosaicism.CONCLUSIONS', ' We report the first integrated transcriptomic characterization of the development of cuSCC through the preneoplastic AK. AKs are indistinguishable from cuSCC, suggesting that chemoprevention efforts should be directed at UV-exposed skin prior to the emergence of lesions. Key transcriptional responses in miRNAs and transcription factor networks were identified in our cross-species analysis, which have been functionally validated. Finally, SCCs of diverse anatomic sites share deep genomic commonalities suggesting that there may be common chemoprevention strategies applicable to multiple SCC types.']",

CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 692X for 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. All classes of genomic alterations (GA) were identified. Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials.  Results', '  There were 20 male patients with a mean age of 60 years (range 46-87). Three cases (15%) were grade III and 17 (85%) were grade IV. CGP revealed 109 GA (5.45 per tumor), 44 of which were CRGA (2.2 per tumor). TP53 was mutated in 13 (65%) of cases and was the most common GA. At least one CRGA was detected in 19 (95%) cases and the most common CRGA were CDKN2A (40%), NOTCH1 (25%), PIK3CA (25%), and CCND1 (20%). HPV-16 was detected in 2 cases, HPV-6 in 1 case and HPV18 was not detected in any cases. Of the three HPV+ cases, only the HPV6+ case harbored TP53 alterations.  Conclusions', '  The low frequency of HPV 16/18 positivity was unexpected in this PSCC series given the high frequency of HPV 16/18 positivity in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (66%) and anal squamous cell carcinoma (87%) as identified by CGP on the same platform. The low frequency of HPV positivity precluded definitively identifying mutual exclusivity of HPV positivity and TP53 alterations as observed in oral pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma however, these data suggest that penile SCC may be evolving via HPV non-16/non-18 infection and these cases may harbor TP53 alterations. CGP identified CRGA that may lead to routes of benefit from targeted therapy for these patients.']",

        "Background":"['In cancer patients, a larger fraction of cell-free DNA is of tumor origin, released in circulating blood as a consequence of cell death and tissue trauma, ctDNA carries information on tumor-related genetic and epigenetic changes. Given the utility as a noninvasive marker ctDNA is commonly referred to as liquid biopsy. Some studies have correlated the abundance of ctDNA with tumor size and stage, with as much as 10% of ctDNA in advanced-stage cancers but as low as 0.1-1% in premalignant or early stage disease. Only one published study has explored the detection of ctDNA in Head and neck tumors in advanced cancers detecting mutations in 60% of the cases.Our primary goal was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the presence of ctDNA in circulating blood fractions from a series of HNSCC cases at early and late stages. We also evaluated the extent to which measures of ctDNA in blood samples correlate with similar findings from paired tumor tissue and correlate with outcome. 48 cases (including plasma, tumor and germline samples) diagnosed as head and neck SCC were selected from a multi center case- control study (ARCAGE), conducted between 2002-2005 involving 10 countries across Europe. Stage distribution was as following', ' 40% stage IV, 23% stage II, 19% stage III, 15% stage I, 3% no Info. Additionally, 65 controls matched by center, age, sex, smoking and alcohol status were included to assess a threshold of the background noise after sequencing.Targeted sequencing was performed independently on both germline DNA and the tumor material using the Ion Proton System at an average depth of 250X. Sequencing included the entire coding region of 14 of the most frequently mutated genes in HNSCC', ' TP53, NOTCH1, CDKN2A, CASP8, PIK3CA, HRAS, FAT1, MLL2, NSD1, FBXW7, RB1, TP63, IRF6 and PTEN. Plasma samples were sequenced using an amplicon based approach. All 65 controls were also sequenced for all mutations detected. Plasma samples were sequenced at an average depth of 10000X. Mutation calls were based on a poisson distribution to distinguish true variants from background noise. Indels were manually inspected using IGV. Statistical tests were carried out in R statistical programming environment. 80% of tumor samples sequenced harboured a somatic mutation in at least one of the 14 genes, for a total 54 somatic mutations. 50% of these mutations including 2 indels were also detected in the corresponding plasma samples, allelic frequencies ranged from 0.005 to 0.30; cases were mostly stage IV although mutations were also detected in four early stage cases. Overall survival was lower for cases harboring TP53 mutations in both tumor and plasma.It is feasible to detect frequent mutations in circulating free DNA in both early and late stage HNSCC. Mutations detected in both tumor and plasma correlated with poor survival especially in oropharyngeal cases demonstrating that ctDNA might be included as a potential biomarker for patient monitoring and outcome prediction.']",

Mutations using targeted NGS (AmpliSeq cancer panel on Ion Torrent / PGM (Life)), and CNV using Cytoscan HD (Affymetrix) were assessed on a mandatory biopsy from a metastatic site with 30% of tumor cell content. Sequencing data were processed in order to detect actionable somatic mutations. Detected variants were filtered according to their frequency (4% for SNVs and 5% for indels), strand ratio (0.2), and reads coverage (30X for SNVs and 100X for indels). Non polymorphic deleterious mutations were reported. Copy number and allele difference profiles were processed taking into account% of tumor cells and ploidy of the sample. Homozygous and heterozygous deletions and focal amplifications were reported for tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Between October 2012 and July 2014, 741 patients with any type of solid cancer were enrolled in the SHIVA trial. Among these, 507 and 496 patients had high quality NGS and CNV profiling, respectively.ResultsMajor cancer types for which molecular analyses were possible on a metastatic biopsy were', ' breast (14%), colorectal (11%), lung (11%), ovarian (11%), pancreatic (8%), sarcoma (6%), head and neck (4%), cervical (4%), urothelial (4%), endometrial (3%), oesogastric (3%) cancers, adenoid cystic carcinoma (3%) and others (18%). TP53 mutations were present in 44% of metastatic patients. Major mutated oncogenes were KRAS (20%), PIK3CA (12%), MET (6%), FGFR3 (5%), EGFR (2%) and BRAF (2%). Tumor suppressor genes PTEN, FBXW7 and CDKN2A were mutated in 3% of patients. Alternatively, homozygous and heterozygous deletions of PTEN, FBXW7 and CDKN2A were observed in around half of the patients analyzed (40%, 40% and 54%, respectively).ConclusionsMutations and CNV analyses on metastatic tumors from patients enrolled in the SHIVA trial showed similar results in terms of frequency of previously reported genetic alterations1,3. The frequency of KRAS mutations (20%) was however higher than the frequency (7%) reported in the pan cancer cohort of the tumors portal3. This result needs to be interpreted in accordance with tumor types before suggesting potential resistance mechanisms in heavily pretreated patients.

        "Background":"['Cancers arise due to accumulation of mutations in genes critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Direct interaction with cell cycle regulators characterizes growth suppression by several tumor suppressor genes. Mutation or polymorphisms that occur in the promoter or coding regions may affect gene expression and may thus have the potential to be of phenotypic or even of pathological significance. In our previous studies, we showed the differential gene expression patterns and gene interactions/ association of of BCCIP and/or CDKN2A gene1, TNF and/or CCR52 with respect to genotypes, melanoma types and family history. We reported a significant interaction between BCCIP and CDKN2A genotypes among melanoma cases and a significant difference between cases and controls for the BCCIP/CDKN2A haplotype, when adjusted with age and sex, possibly confering different levels of susceptibility to melanoma. In the same report we also had a finding of CDKN2A mutant genotype showing significant association with Melanoma type 1 followed by type 2 suggesting this gene to be critical only in cases with family history and /or with other malignancy. Previous reports have shown that BCCIP as an important component in maintaining the tumor suppression function of wild type p53.Without BCCIP, p53 fails to form tetramers, cannot bind with its target promoter sequences, and is defective in transactivation activity. The p53 pathway responds to cellular stresses that threaten the fidelity of DNA replication, genome stability, chromosome separation and cell division. Many of the cellular stresses can be oncogenic in nature and in skin, the most damaging stresses in carcinogenesis is UV radiation. In this follow up study we show a strong association of p53 codon72 polymorphism (p<0.003) with melanoma (N=126) as compared to controls (N=172). Positive correlations of p53 gene with BCCIP polymorphism (p<.013), BCCIP(p<0.010) & CDKN2A(p<0.032) gene expressions from tumor tissues from melanoma patients suggest the possible functional role of these reported gene interactions in causation or in disease progression.

This pathway is deregulated in 90% of melanomas, through amplification or increased expression of CDK4 or Cyclin D1 (CCND1), or reduced expression of the CDK inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2A).To explore if CDK4 may be a viable target for the treatment of human melanoma we screened a panel of melanoma cell lines with the highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991). A majority of cell lines were found to be sensitive to PD-991, although there was a distinct population of resistant cell lines. In sensitive melanoma cell lines, treatment with PD-991 resulted in loss of hyperphosphorylated RB and a concomitant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Treated cells displayed an enlarged flattened morphology and an increase in SA--galactosidase staining compared to vehicle controls, indicative of cellular senescence. RB-null cell lines were resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition, and did not display cell cycle arrest or senescence. Expression and mutational analysis was performed to identify additional genomic predictors of sensitivity and resistance. Loss of CDKN2A/p16 correlated with sensitivity to PD-991 (p<0.02), and this was confirmed at the level of protein expression. Mutation of p53 and the corresponding low expression of p53 targets p21 and MDM2 correlated with resistance (p<0.0001). There was no increase in p53 transcriptional targets or evidence of apoptosis in response to PD-991 treatment of sensitive cells, and senescence occurs in both p53 WT and mutant cells, indicating that this response does not require functional p53. However, in p53 WT cells, combination treatment with PD-991 and the p53 pathway activator Nutlin3a results in increased sensitivity to PD-991 compared to treatment with PD-991 alone. This additive effect is not observed in p53 mutant cells, suggesting there is a functional role for WT p53 in the response to PD-991.Conclusions', ' These preliminary data identify RB, p16 and p53 as predictors of response to PD-991, and support further evaluation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma.']",

Deletion of CDKN2A/B and amplification of E2F3 were the most common alterations in cell cycle regulatory genes (13 cases each, 14%), followed by amplification of CCND1 (11 cases, 11%). There was no co-amplification of CCND1 and CCNE1 in any sample. Rb1 deletion was present in five cases. CNA in E2F3 and Rb1 were mutually exclusive in 14 of 16 cases (88%) and were both present in two cases only. Mutations in TP53 were noted in 13 cases and deletions in nine. Amplification of MDM2 was noted in four cases, none of which overlapped with TP53 deletions or mutations.

Field cancerization phenomenon establishes that normal appearing tissues surrounding a tumor will exhibit a field effect -- particularly in smokers -- with the tissues proximal to the tumor showing more, and even sharing, alterations with the tumor. Previous studies in NSCLC provide evidence for both complex progression trajectories, yet, precise mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate the field cancerization phenomenon, we conducted a genome-wide survey of acquired DNA alterations in normal-appearing tissues including small airways adjacent to NSCLC, mainstem bronchi (large airways), nasal epithelium, distant normal lung and blood, along with multiple samples from their surgically resected paired tumors, for a total of 500 samples from 48 patients with early-stage NSCLC (11 squamous cell carcinomas and 37 adenocarcinomas). Since we expect low mutation burdens and mutant cell fractions in pathologically normal tissues, we assessed somatic point mutations via deep targeted sequencing of 409 genes and paired these data with our recent study of acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) inferred from high-density whole-genome SNP microarrays, thus offering a deep and wide survey of somatic DNA alterations. After aggregating results from multiple mutation callers, we observed somatic mutations (exonic, splicing and UTRs) in 257 samples of which 65 (in 35 patients) were from normal-appearing field (non-tumor, non-blood) samples. Tumor and field samples in smokers showed a higher mutation burden and large proportion of C', 'G>A', 'T changes. We also observed concordance of mutations in the airway and corresponding tumor profiles. Further, a statistically significant field effect was established with mutational burden (measured by the variant allele frequency) increasing with proximity to the tumor. Among the 35 NSCLC cases with field mutations, the small adjacent (to tumor) airways in six patients exhibited mutations in lung cancer drivers such as KRAS, STK11, TP53 and KEAP1. We also identified mutations in the large airway (TP53, SETD2, CDKN2A), distant normal lung parenchyma (RB1, RET) and nasal epithelium (AKT1). We then correlated point mutation and CNA mutation profiles. Of eight cases showing a nonsynonymous or stopgain variants in established lung cancer drivers in the airways, four exhibited putative “two-hit” progression models, e.g. both KEAP1 and STK11 mutations with 19p loss, overlapping TP53 mutation/17p loss, or KRAS mutation/12p gain. Our findings in normal-appearing tissues of the respiratory epithelium offer insights into the earliest mutational events in their progression to NSCLC and, possibly, in tumor relapse and that may represent suitable targets for early detection and chemoprevention.']",

It is known that individuals with a personal history of colon adenomas or cancer are at increased risk for metachronous colon neoplasms. To examine the genetic alternations involving in a polyp-to-cancer progression sequence, whole-transcriptome expression profiling of resected normal tissues (N1 and N3), adenoma (A1 and A2), and colorectal cancer (C1) obtained from individuals was performed. Differentially expressed genes among groups were identified using Subio platform. GATK and haplotypecaller was used to compare the somatic mutations among three different tissues. Tophat, Cufflink, Mev, R was used for determining the expression levels. Splicegrapher and Genomon-fusion was used for identifying the fusion genes. Ordinal regression analysis was performed to characterize site-dependent expression profiles. Gene interaction was examined using String (Open database). All statistical tests were two-sided, except where noted. Expression profile showed that highly expressed genes associated with inflammation were detected in adenoma. Our results indicated that highly expressed genes associated with inflammation were initially found in adenoma tissues and its levels were consistent in carcinoma tissues. Number of somatic mutation was extremely increased in carcinoma tissues when compared to adenoma tissues. The same mutations in KRAS, CDKN2A(p16) and TP53 that were observed in carcinoma tissues.

Genomic copy number was derived from calculating the intensity ratio between the OSCC and a set of normal DNAs from HapMap project. Segmented copy numbers for each tumor were inferred with the hidden markov model using the Partek GS software and circular binary segmentation using GenePattern pipeline. Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) analysis was used to identify significant copy number alterations (CNAs) using a Q-value cutoff of 0.25. With this approach, 41 (2 gain and 39 loss) and 32 (4 gain and 28 loss) significant regions were distinguished from 500K and SNP 6.0 platform, respectively.

Two gain regions contained the well known oncogene EGFR (7p11.2) and CCND1 (11q13.3) and 10 deletion regions resides several known cancer suppressor genes such as FHIT (3p14.2-p12.1), FAT1 (4q35.1), CDKN2A (9p21.3) and ATM (11q22.3-q24.3). Among them, gain of 11q13.3 was correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis and loss of 4q35.2 was significantly associated with lymph node extracapsular spread (LNECS) and poor disease-free survival. Copy number gains of EGFR and CCND1 were further confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and TaqMan CN assay (Hs01818912_cn and Hs02353610_cn), respectively. We found that the concordance rate was 74.63% for EGFR and 77.78% for CCND1. To further explore the clinical value of copy number gains of EGFR and CCND1 in OSCC, 257 OSCC cases were analyzed. Preliminary results indicated that gains of CCND1 were significantly associated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and LNECS; while amplification of EGFR gene was significantly associated with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis but not LNECS. Furthermore, gains of CCND1 were significantly associated with poor disease-free and overall survival. On the other hand, amplification of EGFR was not associated with either disease-free or overall survival. Taken together, we have revealed the significant CNAs of OSCCs in Taiwan and confirmed the amplification of two important genes (CCND1 and EGFR) in 257 OSCCs.

An additional paired cancer/non-caner samples from 32 patients was analyzed by targeted sequencing (TS). All samples were analyzed for copy number alterations (CNAs) using SNP array- and/or digital sequencing-based karyotyping.ResultsIn WES, clonal evolution in esophageal epithelia, as determined by the presence of somatic mutations, was detected in 21 of 21 cancer, 12 of 12 dysplastic, and 63 of 67 non-dysplastic samples, where the mean number of mutation per sample showed a significant trend to increase in cancer (65) and dysplastic samples (50) compared to non-dysplastic samples (13) (P = 2.110-11). CNAs, especially those involving CDKN2A, CCND1, YAP1, and EGFR, were frequently affected in cancer samples, but rarely so in non-dysplastic samples. Non-dysplastic samples tended to have smaller allelic burden and therefore, clone size, compared to dysplastic and cancer samples (P = 2.210-16). Mutations had a predominant age-related signature in non-dysplastic samples but increasing APOBEC3A/3B patterns was observed in cancer and dysplastic samples. Shared mutations were found only within cancer tissues but never among dysplastic or non-dysplastic samples, suggesting the latter lesions are clonally independent from each other. In accordance with previous reports, TP53 mutations were found in 21/21 cancer samples and also found in dysplastic (11/12) and non-dysplastic samples at a lower frequency (26/67). Strikingly, non-dysplastic samples harbored a very high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations (51/67), which were also found in cancer (3/21) and non-dysplastic (8/12) samples but at much lower frequencies (P = 6.610-7). TS of validation samples confirmed the trend of higher NOTCH1 (84% vs. 25%) and lower TP53 mutation rates (38% vs. 100%) in non-dysplastic samples compared to cancer samples. The number of mutations in non-dysplastic samples was higher in drinkers than non-drinkers. Multiple NOTCH1 mutations were more common in cancer patients and drinkers than non-drinkers.ConclusionClonal proliferation in non-cancer esophageal epithelia is common even in non-ESCC cases and extensive in ESCC cases. NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations play major roles in clonal evolution in common but may have differential impacts on esophageal carcinogenesis, which is likely to be shaped by APOBEC-induced mutations and CNAs.']",

Homozygous deletion of both miR-31 and CDKN2A locus was confirmed in 2 tumor lines. In the 4 tumor lines with intact miR-31, hypermethylation of 5CpG islands was detected by bisulfate sequencing and MSP analysis. Re-expression of miR-31 was demonstrated in the EBV-positive NPC cell line C666-1 treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. The findings suggested that homozygous deletion and promoter methylation are the major mechanisms for transcriptional silencing of miR-31 in NPC. By microarray and bioinformatic analysis, we have identified a number of putative targets of miR-31. Among these candidates, we have proven that miR-31 targeted FIH1 and MCM2 expression in NPC. Ectopic expression of miR-31 in NPC cells resulted in repression of FIH1 and MCM2 protein. Finally, we have demonstrated that restoration of miR-31 or knockdown of FIH1 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation of C666-1. Our findings indicated that miR-31 is a NPC-associated microRNA which negatively regulates cell growth by repressing FIH1 expression.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  The Retinoblastoma pathway is targeted for mutational or epigenetic inactivation in more than 70% of NSCLC.  The most common event is loss of CDKN2A expression (p16 protein), usually by hypermethylation, resulting in deregulated CDK4/6 activity and cell cycle progression. Palbociclib is a highly specific CDK4/6 inhibitor and has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression and promote cellular senescence.  Methods', '  We conducted a phase II, single arm trial of palbociclib in 19 previously-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. Only patients whose tumors were negative for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry were eligible. The primary endpoint was response rate. A Simons 2-stage design was employed, with 2 or more responses required to proceed to the second stage. Palbociclib at 125 mg daily was given orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Tumors were assessed by RECIST every 2 cycles. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, toxicity and biomarker analysis.  Results', '  Of the 16 evaluable patients who received at least one month of therapy, there were no responses, and the trial was closed to accrual. However, 8 patients with previously progressive NSCLC had stable disease (SD) lasting 16, 17, 20, 24, 35, 38, 41 and 42 weeks. The remaining 8 patients had progressive disease within 8 weeks. The median PFS was 12.5 weeks. There was no correlation between SD and histology or EGFR mutation status. One patient experienced grade 3 and 4 toxicities as a result of transaminitis and rhabdomyolysis (generalized muscle weakness and increased CPK) thought to be due to concomitant use of high-dose (80 mg) simvastatin. Three patients developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and one patient developed  grade 3 thrombocytopenia. All other toxicities were grade 1 or 2.  Conclusions', '  Palbociclib therapy alone was well-tolerated, and stable disease (SD) was achieved in 50% of evaluable patients, suggesting the induction of cellular senescence.

In complex diseases such as cancer where patterns are heterogeneous, highly complex interaction of pathways are involved, and continuous multi-level genomic changes occur, this is a challenging task. Using genomics data, analyzed by un-supervised and supervised machine learning tools, we demonstrate the ability to quantitatively and accurately describe a patient's tumor.Design\", ' We used Level III RNASeq gene expression data from 20531 genes in 889 tumor samples of RCC across three subtypes - clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), chromophobe carcinoma (ChRCC) and 129 normal samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We developed a computational framework for feature (gene/transcript) selection and subtype predictive model construction. This framework relies on a well-known random forest (RF) method with iterative feature selection and 10-fold cross-validation. We performed a series of (1) tumor vs normal tissue experiments for each subtype; (2) pairwise subtype comparison, and finally (3) all three subtypes comparison and predictive genes identification.Results', ' In each computational run our method detected 2054 (10%) top varying genes, and estimated the predictive power of each of the selected genes using RF. On average this method demonstrated 93-97% accuracy. We identified genes known to play a role in renal cell carcinoma for example, CA9, LOX, SFRP1, SLC4A1, CDKN2A, KISS1R, EGF and others. In addition, our analysis uncovered genes that may represent characteristic patterns for subtyping and differentiation from normal renal tissue cells, for example TCF21, IRX1, STC2, UMOD, AQP2, ANGPTL4, BSND and FABP7, genes not previously associated with renal cell carcinoma.In three different experiments we differentiated each of the three subtypes from normal tissue, and performed enrichment analysis for the top most significant genes in each case. We observed that both CCRCC and PRCC have genes involved in the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis - heparan sulfate (HS6ST2, HS6ST3) and riboflavin metabolism (ACPP) pathways. Whereas ChRCC is more strongly associated with the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lacto and neolacto series pathway (B3GNT3, FUT6) and have five genes (B3GNT3, CYP2B6, CYP2J2, FUT6, UGT2A3) involved in other metabolic pathways. Changes in glycosaminoglycan and glycolipid were also previously reported for associations with RCC.Conclusions', ' We demonstrate the effectiveness of a computational framework and predictive power of gene expression data for tumor subtyping in RCC.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of radiomic analysis to successfully identify specific doxorubicin chemoresistant genes on CT images of treatment-nave hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods', ' We identified 27 treatment-nave patients with a single HCC tumor from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whom had gene expression profiles.

Following tumor segmentation, texture analysis was performed on MATLAB environment.

There was a mean of 4.2 Known Likely Variant (KLV) genomic alterations per case, range 1-11. Adding Variants of Undetermined Significance (VUS) mean was 12.9, range 5-27. The most common KLV-GA were p53 (66%), BRAF (34%), TERT (32%), CDKN2A (32%), NRAS (26%), CDKN2B (20%), NF2 (14.4%), PTEN (13.3%), PIK3CA (12.2%). There were 2 EGFR; 5 JAK2 and 29 GAin the promoter region of TERT. BRAF V600E and NRAS/HRAS alteration were entirely mutually exclusive, and one case demonstrated both BRAF V600E and KRAS. Co-occuring mutations were CDKN2A with p53 (p=0.04). Some GA were more frequent in patients greater than 70 yrs of age such as BRAF, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, JAK2; while others were more common in 50 yrs patients like PTEN, NRAS. VUS of possible interest were MLL2 (n=15), ARID1A (11), TSC2 (5), ALK(2).

We present a comprehensive genetic, genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of 203 HCCs in The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) on behalf of the TCGA Liver analysis working group to provide a deeper understanding of the molecular features of HCCs, to classify them in a clinically-relevant manner, and to provide a public resource that identifies potential targets for emerging therapies.Results', ' Mutation analyses confirmed the presence of TERT promoter mutations in 40% of HCCs. The analysis also revealed the first reported germline mutation in the TERT promoter in a 30 year old male, possibly reflecting an inherited predisposition to HCC. TERT promoter mutations were enriched in hepatitis C virus infected subjects. Analyses of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced HCCs demonstrated recurrent integrations of HBV in the TERT locus. Thus, HBV integration may substitute for TERT promoter mutations as an alternate mechanism of telomerase activation. Other tumor suppressor genes inactivated by mutation included the cell cycle genes TP53 (32% of cases), RB1 (8%), and PTEN (3%), the Wnt/beta catenin pathway gene AXIN1 (4%), and the chromatin remodeling genes ARID1A (9%), BAP1 (6%), ARID1B (4%), ARID2 (4%), and PBRM1 (3%). The oncogene CTNNB1 was mutated in 27% of HCCs. Mutations were also found in the MTOR pathway genes, MTOR (4%), TSC2 (4%) and TSC1 (3%). The patterns of mutational signatures observed included signatures characteristic of the known carcinogens aristolochic acid and aflatoxin B1. Clustering of mRNA, miRNA, or protein expression, DNA hypermethylation and DNA copy number profiles identified five, four, two, five and three clusters, respectively. Analysis of mRNA expression data identified five groups. In particular, Group 1 was associated with Asian race, higher histologic grade, and micro- and macrovascular invasion. Integrated clustering showed a grouping of HCCs into three superclusters', ' iCluster 1 had a low frequency of CDKN2A silencing, lack of CTNNB1 mutation, a normal-like methylation pattern, and overexpression of proliferation marker genes; iClusters 2 and 3 had a high frequency of CDKN2A silencing, CTNNB1 mutation, and overexpression of oxidative response genes; iCluster 3 tumors had a higher degree of chromosomal instability, high frequency of 17p loss, and a highly altered methylation profile. Copy number aberrations included gains in the MYC, VEGFA, CCND1, TERT, and MET loci and losses in the TP53, RB1, ERFFI1, CDKN2A, ARID1A and PTEN loci. Discussion', ' Based on integrated analysis of genome, transcriptome, methylome and proteome we showed that HCCs naturally separate into three to five distinct groups with associated molecular and clinical characteristics.

However, a mechanistic understanding of the complicated biological interplay between the stromal framework (hypoxia context) and malignant regions of the same tumor remains an unmet need. In this study, we examined the molecular networks of interplay between hypoxia and miRNA deregulation. Study methods and results', ' In this study, we profiled the expression of miRNAs in ovarian cancer cells upon exposure to hypoxia (1% O2) using microRNA microarray (Agilent v14). We found that significant numbers of miRNAs are dysregulated. In A2780 and Skov3 ovarian cancer cells, using a statistical cutoff (p<0.05 and fold change >1.5), normoxia v/s short term (48hrs) and long term (6 days) hypoxia exposure, we found that 23 MicroRNAs were down regulated whereas 11 were upregulated. Among these, miR-134 validated to be overexpressed under hypoxia by 3 - 4 fold in A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells consistently across the short and long term time points. Upon bioinformatics analyses for target sites of commonly up regulated miRNAs, we found that miR-134 was predicted to target CDKN2A (Miranda, microT, PITA, RNA22, TargetScan). CDKN2A is a protein involved in cell cycle control, precisely regulating cell cycle G1 control through complexing with CDK4. Considering the fact that CDKN2A expression is lost in several cancer types and its correlation with the aggressive tumor growth, we checked expression of CDKN2A under hypoxic conditions. CDKN2A was down-regulated under hypoxia by 55% and was inversely correlated with miR-134 expression in cell lines tested. Upon transfection of A2780 ovarian cancer cells with miR-134 microRNA mimics, we observed consistent down regulation of CDKN2A by >40%, compared to scrambled control transfected cells. This further proves the role of miR-134 in deregulating CDKN2A expression in ovarian cancer.

        "Background":"[\"BackgroundSoft tissue sarcomas are rare malignant tumors that account for approximately 1% of all malignancies. Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is one of the most common sarcomas in elderly patients. Because of their highly complex Karyotypes with extensive intratumoral heterogeneity, no specific recurrent aberration has emerged. In our Precision Cancer Medicine Program, we enroll patients with rare malignancies, metastatic or treatment-resistant disease in order to analyze the individual patient's disease and identify druggable targets. We sequenced two macroscopically different appearing tumor areas from a patient with a primary high-grade MFS using a Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) clinical test called EXaCT-1.DesignThe patient was enrolled prospectively through our Precision Medicine Clinic under an IRB approved protocol. Genomic DNA from fresh OCT (TissueTek) - frozen tissue from a myxoid hypocellular tumor area, from a more pleomorphic hypercellular tumor area and from benign tissue were extracted using the Promega Maxwell 16 MDx. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2100bp). A total of 21,522 genes were analyzed using Agilent HaloPlex Exome. Reads were aligned to GRC37/hg19 reference using BWA and processed accordingly to IPM-Exome-pipeline v0.9. Sequencing results were confirmed and further analyzed using CLONET (CLONality Estimate in Tumors) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CDK4/6 inhibitors (PD0332991, LY2835219) were tested in a MFS monolayer cell line (OH931) and an engineered 3D mini-MFS system.ResultsWhole exome sequencing and CLONET analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion in the myxoid hypocellular tumor area and a homozygous deletion in the pleomorphic hypercellular tumor area of the tumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A (p16/Ink4a). Looking through the genomic data published by Barretina et al. (Nat Genet. 2010), we recognized a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in 15% of the MFS analyzed. Screening full sections of 30 MFS with FISH for CDKN2A deletion shows intratumoral heterogeneity with hemizygous deletion, homozygous deletion and amplification of CDKN2A. CDKN2A loss may be associated with increased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Treatment of CDKN2A null MFS cell line OH931 (kindly provided by Dr. Julia Bridge) with CDK4/6 inhibitors (PD0332991, LY2835219) showed decreased cell proliferation compared to a CDKN2A wild-type sarcoma cell line RD (ATCC CCL-136) in monolayer culture and in our newly developed 3D system.ConclusionTumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A (p16/Ink4a) deletion or methylation has been reported in multiple cancer types and is correlated with worse patient outcome. Patients suffering from a CDKN2A (p16/Ink4a) null high-grade MFS may benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition as shown in a monolayer and 3D cell culture model of a MFS cell line.

Pathway analysis of cis-acting genes in the amplification and deletion peaks suggests the alterations of core cancer pathways, including cell cycle, p53, PI3K, MAPK, Wnt and TGF signaling, in large proportions of HCC patients. We further credentialed two candidate driver genes, BCL9 and MTDH, from the recurrent focal amplification peaks and showed that they play a significant role in HCC growth and survival.

        "Background":"['Epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) represent a unique treatment challenge as over 50% of patients are diagnosed with advanced stage disease when surgical and chemotherapeutic interventions prove futile. Approximately 90% of EOC are folate receptor (FR)  positive and FR levels correlate with stage and grade. FR-targeted therapies represent a rational treatment option for patients with advanced EOC whose treatments fail. There are three primary mechanisms of folate transport in mammalian cells, the reduced folate carrier (RFC), the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) and FRs. RFC is the major transporter for folates and is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and tumors. Hence, developing novel antifolates that bypass cellular accumulation by RFC should reduce dose-limiting toxicities. PCFT is expressed in many solid tumors including ovarian cancer and is active at acidic pH. Previous studies established that a novel 2-amino-4-oxo-6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolate with an isosteric thienoyl substitution and a three carbon bridge (AG94) showed selective cellular uptake by FR and PCFT over RFC. [1,3]Thienoyl regioisomers (AG150 and AG154) of AG94 showed subnanomolar potencies toward both KB nasopharyngeal carcinoma (IC50s = 0.1 and 0.09 nM, respectively) and IGROV1 ovarian carcinoma (IC50s of 0.64 and 0.1nM, respectively). While AG150 and AG154 were substrates for both PCFT and FRs, like AG94, their inhibitory effects at low drug concentrations were mediated primarily via FR, as indicated by their capacities to bind with high affinities to FR and protection by excess folic acid. Nucleoside protection assays with adenosine and 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide established that the first folate-dependent enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) formyltransferase (GARFT), was the primary intracellular target for AG150 and AG154. GARFT targeting was confirmed by in situ metabolic labeling with [14C]glycine and measurement of accumulated [14C]formyl GAR in KB cells, for which IC50s were 1.35 and 1.46 nM, respectively. The purine salvage enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is frequently co-deleted with CDKN2a in solid tumors including ovarian cancer. Growth inhibitory effects of AG150 and AG154 were reversed in the presence of methylthioadenosine in MTAP-deficient IGROV1 cells transfected with MTAP cDNA. Our results demonstrate potent anti-tumor activities of the 6-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine thienoyl regioisomers of AG94, AG150 and AG154, associated with their FR-mediated cellular uptake and inhibition of GARFT in de novo purine biosynthesis. Preservation of purine salvage including MTAP is likely an important cellular determinant of antitumor efficacy for this class of novel tumor-targeted agents.']",

        "Background":"['Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) is a rare biphasic proliferative breast lesion, which may resemble salivary gland epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas (EMCs). Most AMEs have an indolent clinical course, but malignant transformation and local and distant recurrences have been reported. We sought to define the mutational landscape of AMEs and investigate the functional impact of recurrent likely pathogenic mutations identified in these tumors. Nineteen AMEs were subjected to whole-exome massively parallel sequencing (MPS, n=7) or targeted capture MPS using MSK-IMPACT assay (n=12). Somatic genetic alterations and the cancer cell fraction of mutations were defined using state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms. Selected genes (i.e. HRAS and PIK3CA) were subjected to Sanger sequencing in a series of 17 additional AMEs (total n=36). Non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (i.e. MCF10A, MCF10A with the PIK3CAH1047R mutation and MCF12A), which are estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, were utilized for 2D and 3D functional studies. Of 36 cases, 22 were ER-positive and 14 were ER-negative. MPS analysis revealed a low mutation burden and HRASQ61 and PIK3CA hotspot mutations in 6/19 (32%) and 11/19 (58%) AMEs, respectively. All HRASQ61 and all but one PIK3CA mutations were clonal. ER-positive and ER-negative AMEs were fundamentally histologically and genetically distinct. Whilst ER-positive AMEs displayed recurrent PIK3CA mutations (50%, 11/22) but lacked HRAS mutations, ER-negative AMEs displayed, in addition to PIK3CA mutations (57%, 8/14), recurrent HRASQ61 mutations (57%, 8/14). HRASQ61 mutations co-occurred with PIK3CA mutations (50%, 4/8), PIK3R1 deletions (12.5%, 1/8) and/or CDKN2A homozygous deletions (25%, 2/8). HRASQ61 mutations, but not PIK3CA mutations, were significantly associated with ER-negativity (100% vs 21%), concurrent carcinoma (50% vs 7%), axillary metastases (38% vs 0%), high proliferation (63% vs 4%), necrosis (63% vs 11%) and nuclear pleomorphism (75% vs 29%). In vitro forced HRASQ61R expression in MCF10A and MCF12A cells resulted in increased proliferation and transformation. In 3D organotypic cell cultures, forced HRASQ61R resulted in a highly disorganized growth pattern, a partial loss of epithelial phenotype and acquisition of aberrant myoepithelial differentiation, which was more overt in PIK3CA-mutant MCF10A cells. In conclusion, AMEs are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Whilst PIK3CA hotspot mutations occur across the spectrum of lesions, HRASQ61 hotspot mutations are restricted to ER-negative AMEs, which should arguably be classified as breast EMCs. Our genomic and functional analyses are consistent with the notion that HRASQ61 mutations are driver events in the pathogenesis of ER-negative AMEs and may be sufficient for the acquisition of myoepithelial differentiation in breast cells.']",

In addition, we screened a panel of melanoma cells with a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991) and performed gene expression and mutation analysis on these cells to explore possible genomic predictors of sensitivity.Genomic analysis revealed that 75% of primary melanomas had at least one CNV in the CDK4 pathway, with 55% showing a loss of CDKN2A. 28% of melanomas had two or more CNVs and melanomas with two or more CNVs involving CCND1 had worse overall survival (HR 5.56, P=0.02). From the cell line studies low CDKN2A mRNA expression, mutation or loss predicted sensitivity to PD-991 with 23 out of 27 mutant/loss cell lines being sensitive compared to only 3/7 wild type lines (p<0.03). Expression of CDK4, CCND1 or other cyclins or CDK-inhibitors did not predict sensitivity to PD-991. PD-991 induced an increase in both cell size and SA--galactosidase activity that is indicative of a senescent phenotype, and this was associated with cells having wild type p53. In summary, genomic alterations in the CDK4 pathway are frequent in melanoma and are associated with worse survival, particularly when melanomas harbor two or more CNVs involving CCND1. CDK4 inhibition induces a senescent phenotype in melanoma cells that is associated with loss of CDKN2A and wild type TP53.

Melanoma has been the tumor of choice for the evaluation of a wide variety of therapeutic approaches that rely on stimulation of the immune system to combat cancer. The striking responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors noted in some melanoma patients have now been observed in several other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. These findings are very encouraging, however the specific mechanisms of response and reasons why only a subset of patients respond to therapy are not known. The extraordinary potential of immune therapies in cancer suggests that human-relevant mouse models of cancer are required to understand mechanisms of response and to optimize therapy so that a larger proportion of patients respond.We have generated and evaluated a series of genetically engineered mouse models driven by alterations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, beta catenin, p53, and Nras that reflect the genetic diversity of the vast majority of human melanoma. We have backcrossed 6 of these models to C57Bl/6, generated tumors, and isolated a series of over 20 congenic mouse melanoma cell lines. Several independent lines have been isolated for each melanoma genotype generated. Injection of these lines into C57Bl/6J mice results in reproducible tumor formation in the absence of co-injection of Matrigel. We are in the process of characterizing the tumor microenvironment in each of the models using flow cytometry and a novel quantitative imaging approach of histological sections, which produces flow cytometry-like data, but retains spatial and morphologic information that can be utilized to characterize much smaller tumors.

The aim of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of detecting clinically relevant genomic alterations in mUC by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cfDNA. Methods', ' Peripheral blood (20ml) was collected from 15 patients with mUC before chemotherapy. Plasma cfDNA was isolated using the QIAAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit.

The low 5-year survival rate of the highly aggressive LNETs (SCLC and LCNEC) combined with the lack of an effective treatment, suggest that understanding how these tumors arise and identifying therapeutic targets are unmet needs. We performed genome/exome, and transcriptome sequencing of 29 SCLC (Ref.1), 60 LCNEC, and 45 PCA to better understand their molecular origin and identify altered genes that may offer therapeutic opportunities.In contrast to SCLC and LCNEC, we found that RB1 and TP53 mutations were rare events in PCA suggesting that PCA are not early progenitor lesions of SCLC or LCNEC, but arise through independent mechanisms. Moreover, GSEA analysis showed that genes of the RB1 pathway were downregulated in SCLC but not in PCA. Our data also show that inactivation of chromatin-remodeling genes, specifically genes involved in histone methylation and subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, is sufficient to drive transformation in PCA.In a preliminary analysis of 15 LCNEC (Ref.2) we observed a predominance of mutations typical of SCLC, such as RB1, TP53, and CREBBP/EP300. In this larger series, we additionally found samples with mutations frequent in adenocarcinoma (AD) or squamous (SQ) lung cancer. We could then distinguish two well-defined groups of LCNEC', ' a SCLC-like group, carrying MYCL1 amplifications and mutations in both RB1 and TP53 genes; and an AD/SQ-like group, harbouring CDKN2A deletions, TTF1 amplifications, and frequent mutations in KEAP1 and STK11. Interestingly, RB1, STK11, and KEAP1 mutations happened in an almost mutually exclusive way. These data suggest that LCNEC might represent an evolutionary trunk that can branch to SCLC or AD/SQ, and also that LNETs and non-LNETs are not completely different entities. This is already suggested by the fact that one of the resistance mechanisms of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is through trans-differentiation to SCLC (Ref.3).Finally, we also identified new targetable driver genes in SCLC and LCNEC', ' FGFR1 amplifications were observed in 6% and 18% of the cases respectively; PTEN mutations were identified in 10% of the SCLC cases; and interestingly, one of the LCNEC samples (belonging to the SCLC-like group) harboured an activating RFWD2-NTRK1 fusion gene suggesting that fusions affecting NTRK1 may not only be a targetable opportunity for AD (Ref.4) but also for LCNEC and, based on the molecular similarities, also SCLC.(1) Peifer and Fernandez-Cuesta et al.

Currently, the only available biomarker for early detection is serum alpha-fetoprotein which can identify only 40-60% of cases. We aim to improve the poor disease prognosis by developing a screening test capable of detecting liver cancer in its earlier stages. Since cancer is a disease of the genome and epigenome, if we can detect these underlying genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications in the periphery, we should be able to effectively detect cancer early. We have previously shown that urine contains fragmented, cell-free, cancer related DNA, both mutated and methylated, derived from the circulation of cancer patients. We have also demonstrated that the concentration of tumor-derived DNA in plasma and in urine is similar in patients with tumors. Hence, we propose the use of a panel of HCC-associated genetic and epigenetic methylation DNA biomarkers to develop a sensitive, noninvasive urine screening test for HCC. In order to detect these markers in the circulation derived urine DNA, we developed short amplicon (50 bp) PCR based assays targeting HCC-associated mutations in TP53, CTNNB1, hTERT genes and HCC associated methylation in GSTP1, RASSF1A and CDKN2A. Urine DNA isolated from hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC patients were tested in each of the assays and analyzed. Panel performance parameters such as sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve were calculated for individual markers and then as a group in order to evaluate their ability to distinguish HCC patients from hepatitis and cirrhosis subjects. The potential of this urine test in the early detection of HCC is discussed.']",

It consists of small hepatocytes with little cellular atypia but with structural atypia. This type of very well-differentiated cancerous tissue is usually characterized by indistinct margins and many portal tracts within the tumor, and develops into classical HCC. To identify sequential genomic changes in stepwise hepatocarcinogenesis, we analyzed fusion genes and mutations using next generation sequencer about 43 early and 105 advanced HCCs. First, exome sequence showed that base sequence aberrations (non-silent) were more frequent in advanced HCC than early HCC (70.9  29.0 vs 53.7  23.8 genes per tumor, P = 0.0002). Mutations in p53/RB pathway including TP53, ATM, RB1, CDKN2A, and CDKN1A were observed in 27.9% and 38.1% in early and advanced HCCs, respectively (P = 0.161) and those of WNT/b-catenin pathways consisting of CTNNB1, AXIN1, and APC were recurrently observed in both early and advanced HCCs (27.9% vs 41.0%, P = 0.095). On the other hand, mutations in SWI/SNF complex genes were more frequently observed in advanced HCC (35.2%) than early HCC (16.3%, P = 0.016). Especially, inactivating mutation of ARID was found in 16 advanced HCCs (15.2%) while only 1 case in early HCC (2.3%, P = 0.018). Consistent with our previous report homozygous deletions near CSMD1 and CDKN2A were also found in 8 and 5 cases, respectively, only in advanced HCC. Next, we detected 4 types of fusion gene, including interchromosomal (translocation), intrachromosomal (deletion), intrachromosomal (translocation), and inversion by RNA sequencing. We also found that every HCC harbored 2 to 5 fusion genes, which were more frequent in advanced than earlyHCC, although there were no recurrent rearrangements in neither advanced nor early HCCs. Especially chromathripsis, in which 10 to 100 rearrangements were localized in the specific genomic regions and genomic features imply chromosome breaks occur in one-off crisis, was the event observed only in advanced HCC. Taken together, genomic changes were more frequent in advanced HCC, and inactivating mutations of p53/RB and WNT/b-catenin signaling pathways are the driver mutation in the initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis and that of ARID2 may play pivotal roles in the progression from early to advanced HCC.']",

As EOC risk factors are histology specific, as are the site of precursor lesions, accurate subtyping is critical to understanding EOC prognostic factors and etiology. Our aim was to compare two currently employed histology assignment strategies using gene expression, DNA methylation, and clinical outcome data Methods', ' Histology assignment based on', \" a) pathologist, and b) an integrated pathologist and IHC prediction algorithm (pathIHC) (using ARID1A, CDKN2A, DKK1, HNF1B, MDM2, PGR, TP53, TFF3, VIM, and WT1 staining patterns), was compared for tumors of all histologies at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester. The 500 most variable probes from Illumina Methylation450 BeadChips (N = 259) and Agilent 444K expression arrays (N = 245) were used to perform unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Fisher's Exact test was used to test the association of clusters with histology. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to test the association of clusters and histology with time to progression (TTP) and time to death (TTD).Results\", ' Eighty-two percent of tumors were concordant between histology assignment strategies. Clustering based on methylation data produced two distinct clusters. PathIHC produced more homogenous clusters (p-value = 2.810-16) than pathology alone (p = 1.310-9). Cluster M1, characterized by high levels of methylation across almost all probes, was enriched for the rarer EOC subtypes; cluster M2, characterized by moderate levels of methylation across 50%-75% of probes, was predominantly HGSC. These patterns were observed irrespective of histology assignment strategy; however, when using histology by pathologist, cluster M2 had more endometrioid and LGSC tumors interspersed with HGSC tumors. Clustering based on expression data also produced two clusters. PathIHC produced slightly more homogenous clusters (p = 9.010-11, pathology alone, p = 2.310-10). Cluster E1 was enriched for the rarer EOC subtypes; cluster E2 was primarily serous lineage tumours (HGSC and LGSC), particularly when using histology by pathIHC. Considering only clinical outcomes, histologies by pathology were more significantly different in terms of TTP (p = 1.110-6) and TTD (p = 1.710-3) than histologies by pathIHC (TTP, p = 5.410-6; TTD, p = 5.710-3).Conclusions', ' Histology by pathIHC produced more homogeneous clusters in both the methylation and expression data; thus, molecular data supports this strategy.

        "Background":"['The CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two tumor suppressors', ' the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a and the MDM2 regulator p14ARF. Homozygous deletion of this locus is among the most common genetic events in human cancer across tissues, with the resultant selective advantage to cancer cells generally attributed to the loss of CDKN2A proteins, which help maintain functional Rb and p53. However, in greater than 90% of cancer tissues harboring CDKN2A deletion, the adjacent CDKN2B gene encoding the p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is also deleted. The degree to which CDKN2B-encoded p15 loss contributes to human tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that CDKN2B is highly upregulated in common, benign melanocytic nevi (moles) expressing the constitutively active BRAF(V600E) oncogene. A large percentage of melanomas develop in continuity with these pre-existing nevi, suggesting that nevus melanocytes are not permanently senescent, and can serve as tumor-initiating cells upon acquisition of additional genetic changes. By examining primary melanocytes isolated directly from freshly excised benign human nevi, as well as normal primary melanocytes engineered to inducibly express BRAF(V600E), we link BRAF activation to a TGF-dependent p15 induction that arrests nevi in their pre-malignant state. We also use the primary nevus cells to establish a new genetically-defined, human in vivo melanoma xenograft model, which maximizes medical relevance by utilizing the naturally occurring melanoma precursor cells in a native 3-dimensional environment. With this approach, we show that p15 depletion in benign nevi promotes progression to melanoma, establishing the reversibility of nevus melanocyte growth arrest, and the functional importance of CDKN2B loss in human cancer.']",

The checkpoint kinases 1 (CHK1) and 2 (CHK2) are serine-threonine kinases involved in the DNA damage response pathway. CHK inhibition enhances the efficacy of DNA damaging agents in a variety of tumors, including p53 deficient cells, that rely on the G2/M checkpoint, having a dysfunctional G1 checkpoint. DLBCL with dysfunctional p53 axis (harboring p53 mutations and/or CDKN2A loss) have been recently shown to have a dismal outcome. In this study we report the activity profile of the CHK1/2 inhibitor PF-0477736 (Pfizer) in a panel of B cell lymphoma cell lines and primary cells, and explore its mechanisms of action.

P53 mutations were detected in the following cell lines', ' HBL-1, U2932, SUDHL-6, BJAB, Mino, SP-53. TMD8 was p53 wild-type but with an homozygous deletion of CDKN2A. Of note SUDHL-4 and KM-H2 were p53 wild type, with no deletion of CDKN2A. To assess the effect of PF-0477736 on cell proliferation, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PF-0477736 (from 5 to 2000 nM) for 24, 48 and 72 hours (hrs), and cell viability assessed by WST-1 assay (Roche). A significant growth inhibition was evident after 48 hrs, in all cell lines, excluding SUDHL-4 and KM-H2 that were resistant (IC50 8300 and 6800 nM at 48 hrs, respectively). The BJAB cell line showed the highest sensitivity (IC50 10 nM at 24 hrs). The IC50 ranged from 140 to 230 nM at 48 hrs in the other sensitive cell lines. Using Annexin V- propidium iodide staining, we found that PF-0477736 25-500 nM induced cell death by apoptosis in a time and dose dependent manner. Of note PF-0477736 100-1000 nM demonstrated activity also in primary DLBCL cells. We found no correlations between baseline levels of CHK1/2 activation and outcome. In the sensitive cell lines inhibition of the downstream target CDC25c ser216 phosphorylation coupled with a marked increase in levels of the DNA damage marker H2AX was observed by western blot as soon as after 24 hrs of incubation with concentrations equal to the IC50 (25 - 250 nM). PF-0477736 at the dose of 50-100 nM synergistically enhanced the efficacy of Doxorubicin (0.1 to 1 M) at 24 hrs. These data suggest that PF-0477736 has single agent activity and synergizes with chemotherapy in DLBCL. The drug shows high single agent activity in the subset of DLBCL with genomic lesions of the p53 pathway, that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and associated with dismal outcome, providing the rationale for further clinical investigation of PF-0477736 in DLBCL alone or in combination with chemotherapy.
