        "Background":"['Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancer among people of European ancestry. Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling plays a pivotal role in BCC carcinogenesis. Besides mutations in genes encoding HH pathway components, mutations in the p53 gene frequently are found in human BCCs. Consistently, our previous studies have found that the loss of p53 can dramatically accelerate BCC formation in ionizing radiation (IR)-treated Ptch1+/- mice. It remains elusive how p53 is activated in BCC development. DNA damage response (DDR) and oncogenic induced stress (OIS) are two essentially independent pathways leading to p53 activation although limited evidence suggests crosstalk between these pathways. In response to OIS, ARF is activated and leads to p53 activation, functioning as a tumor suppressor, in many cancers. However, the loss of ARF, unlike loss of p53, failed to affect the development of medulloblastoma in Ptch1+/- mice (Wetmore C., et al, 2001). In the present study, we investigated whether ARF affects BCC development in the same mice.To address this, we bred ARFGFP/GFP mice, in which ARF function is disabled and GFP is expressed under the control of the endogenous ARF promoter, with our Ptch1+/- mice to generate Ptch1+/- ARFGFP/GFP (designated as ARF mice) for comparison with Ptch1+/- K14CreER2 p53fl/fl (PF) mice. Following our standard protocol of tamoxifen injection at age 7.5 weeks to delete p53 specifically in K14-expressing keratinocytes (for PF mice) and treating both ARF and PF mice with ionizing radiation at age 8 weeks, we compared BCC development between the above 2 lines.We find that at age 5 months, ARF mice formed numbers of microscopic BCCs comparable to those in PF mice though the latter exhibited greater mouse-to-mouse variation. More importantly, both mouse lines developed initial visible BCCs at age 5 to 7 months, which is dramatically earlier than the age 9 to 18 months for the Ptch1+/- mice (ARF+/+ and p53+/+). In addition, ARFGFP/GFP mice responded to IR-induced DNA damage in a pattern essentially similar to ARF+/+ mice, indicating an intact DDR pathway as reported in the literature.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ARF is involved in BCC carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor, probably playing the major, perhaps the exclusive, role in activating p53 in this process.']",

        "Background":"[\"Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the United States with the number of incidences persistently rising due to the depletion of the ozone layer and lack of adequate solar protection. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), composed of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), encompasses the vast majority of skin cancers with over 2 million new cases each year. Silibinin, an active bioflavanone was previously shown to have major protective effect against ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-induced SCC through promoting DNA damage repair as well as inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis. To date, however, the efficacy of silibinin has not been tested against BCC, which alone accounts for about 80% of NMSC incidences. BCC mostly causes disfigurement, pain and morbidity, and warrants greater attention for its prevention and treatment. The hallmark of BCC has been the constitutive activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, mostly through the loss of function mutations in the patched (PTCH) gene. In the present study, we utilized ASZ001 cell line, derived from a mouse BCC tumor induced by UV-radiation in a PTCH1 heterozygous mouse, to evaluate the anti-cancer efficacy of silibinin against BCC. ASZ001 cells lack both copies of the PTCH1 gene and closely resembles the PTCH1 status in human BCC. We treated ASZ001 cells with either DMSO (control) or various doses of silibinin (25-100 M), and performed trypan blue exclusion, clonogenic, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution assays. Results showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) decreases the total cell number by 38-51% (p<0.001), 67-84% (p<0.001) and 40-95% (p<0.05-p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment. Clonogenic assay further confirmed the decrease in cell viability by silibinin, and we observed 18% (p<0.05), 92% (p<0.001) and 100% (p<0.001) decrease in colony formation with 25, 50 and 100 M doses of silibinin, respectively, in ASZ001 cells. Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that silibinin treatment (25-100 M) also increased the cell death by 2 folds (p<0.05), 3 folds (p<0.001), and 4 folds (p<0.001) after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment while annexin/PI staining confirmed that silibinin-induced cell death in ASZ001 cells is mainly apoptotic in nature. FACS analyses revealed that silibinin treatment significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution in ASZ001 cells, and we observed an S-phase arrest at 50 M silibinin dose and a G2M arrest at 100 M silibinin dose after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Molecular studies showed that silibinin treatment strongly decreases the expression of hedgehog signaling transcriptional factor Gli1, which is typically overexpressed in BCC and is known to regulate the expression of several oncogenes. Together, these results provide the first evidence of silibinin's efficacy against BCC cells, and suggest that silibinin could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of both types of NMSCs.\"]",

        "Background":"['OBJECTIVE. The HH signal transduction pathway plays crucial roles in organ morphogenesis and is active during embryonic development but quiescent in terminally differentiated cells. Binding of HH ligands to PTCH1 relieves its inhibitory activity on the pathway activator SMO leading to pathway activation and upregulation of target gene expression including the transcription factor Gli1 that serves as marker of pathway activation. It is reactivated in many solid cancers including NSCLC as we have previously demonstrated and proven to be the key oncogenic driver in tumors such as skin basal cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to determine if HH pathway regulates cell growth and survival of MPM cells and to evaluate the efficacy of pathway blockade using SMO antagonists (SMO inhibitor GDC0449 - GDC or the antifungal drug itraconazole -ITRA) or Gli inhibitors (GANT61 or the anti-leukemia drug arsenic trioxide - ATO) in suppressing the viability of not only NSCLC but also MPM cells.METHODS. Expression of main components of HH pathway in 8 MPM cells was assessed by qRT-PCR. Suppression of HH/SMO-mediated signaling by these pathway antagonists was determined by LightII cells. Selective knockdown of SMO to inhibit HH signaling was achieved by siRNA in 3 MPM cells H2373, Gardner and H2452. Cell viability following treatments with GDC, ITRA, GANT61or ATO were evaluated in a panel of 8 MPM cells and 8 NSCLC cells using MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexinV/PE staining and flow cytometry.RESULTS. All MPM cells, similar to previously demonstrated in NSCLC cells, express varying levels of HH ligands, PTCH1, SMO with readily detectable Gli1 observed in 7/8 of MPM cells by qRT-PCR. SMO siRNA mediate 2- to 3-fold reduction of SMO and also of Gli1 gene expression by qRT-PCR, indicating significant HH pathway blockade. This was associated with 406% to 708% reduction of cell viability (p<0.01 versus non-target siRNA controls). All 4 pathway antagonists completely blocked HH activation in LightII reporter cells. Treating MPM or NSCLC cells with HH inhibitors resulted in 1.5- to 4-fold reduction of Gli1 expression. GANT61, ATO, ITRA and to a lesser degree GDC significantly suppressed viability of all cancer cells at low microM concentrations. More importantly, ITRA, ATO, GANT61 induce significant apoptosis (ranging from 30% to 60%) in representative MPM or NSCLC cells.CONCLUSIONS. HH signaling is active in MPM and regulates cell viability. ATO and ITRA are as effective as the prototypic SMO inhibitor GDC and the Gli inhibitor GANT61 in suppressing HH signaling in MPM and NSCLC cells. Pharmaceuticals that are FDA-approved for other indications but recently found to have anti-HH activity such as ATO or ITRA may be repurposed to treat HH-dependent MPM or NSCLC cells.']",

The cells were harvested and mRNA was extracted. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the gene expression levels of the Hh (GLI1, PTCH1, SMO) and Wnt (AXIN2, FGF9) signaling mediators during the treatment. Results', ' SKOV3 and IGROV showed a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation during the treatment, whereas OVCAR5 cells merely slowed down, however not significantly. In SKOV3 the Hh genes remained unchanged with both compounds during the first 48 hours, while the Wnt genes were stable under cyclopamine and moderately suppressed by FN. Both compounds however induced a sharp upregulation of GLI1 on day 3 followed by a significant increase in PTCH1 and SMO on day 4. Cyclopamine additionally induced a significant upregulation of the Wnt genes on day 4. Looking at IGROV, the Cyclopamine treated cells showed an over time significant increasing expression of GLI1 as well as of the Wnt genes. FN did not alter the expression of the Hh genes at all which remained at the level of untreated IGROV cells. The Wnt gene expression of IGROV however surged over time impressively under FN treatment. The experiment with OVCAR5 a cell line that has a downregulated Hh pathway and an upregulated Wnt pathway showed unaltered gene expression levels compared to untreated OVCAR5 cells for both compounds throughout the experiment. Conclusions', ' Besides demonstrating the significant effects of the two Hh Inhibitors on the proliferation rate of two of the three studied ovarian cancer cell lines, we could demonstrate the evolution of drug resistance by either upregulation of the Hedgehog pathway itself or by using the upregulation of the Wnt pathway as escape route.

However, a role for the HH signal transduction pathway is incompletely defined in RMS. Co-regulation of GLI1 and Patched1 (PTCH1) in ERMS and fusion-negative ARMS have suggested that the HH pathway is functionally intact in these subtypes. However, HH pathway activity has not been directly tested in RMS. Our aim was to demonstrate that some RMS cells have intact HH signaling pathways and are responsive to HH pathway activation or inhibition. We demonstrated expression of Indian HH, Desert HH, PTCH1, SMO and GLI1 by qRT PCR in Rh18 ERMS cells and Rh41 ARMS cells; Desert HH, PTCH1, SMO, and GLI1 in Rh 30 ARMS cells; and Indian HH, Desert HH, PTCH1, and SMO in RD ERMS cells. We confirmed high GLI1 protein expression by Western blot in Rh41 and Rh18 cells. Since HH signaling is believed to occur in primary cilia, we used immunofluorescence to demonstrate primary cilia in RMS-13 cells. Based on their differing levels of GLI1 expression (high in Rh41 and Rh18 cells and low/absent in Rh28 and RD cells), these RMS cell lines provided an opportunity to up- and down-regulate the HH pathway and measure effects on gene expression and cell function. Exposure of Rh41 cells to Sonic HH-containing conditioned media caused a 12-fold increase in PTCH1 expression and exposure of Rh28 cells to Sonic HH peptide increased GLI1 expression 1.5-fold, suggesting intact HH signal transduction in some RMS cell lines. We down-regulated HH pathway activity with the GLI1 inhibitor GANT61 and assessed Rh41 and RD cell viability by MTT assays. RMS cell viability decreased following exposure to increasing concentrations of GANT61. The reduced cell viability appeared to result at least in part from down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic GLI1 target gene, BCL2. These results suggest a role for HH signaling in RMS cell survival.

Knockdown of Dicer, a Type III RNAase, which is required for microRNA synthesis, increased the cellular toxicity to TMZ, thus revealing the importance of microRNA in GBM chemoresistance. We have indentified and characterized PTCH as a functional target of microRNA-9 (miR-9) in both non-neural cell lines as well as GBM cell lines. Overexpression of miR-9 in GBM cells results in downstream pathway activation and resistance to TMZ treatment. We also explored a number of mir-9/PTCH1-dependent mechanisms of chemoresistance and uncovered downstream upregulation of ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporters, MDR1 and ABCG2. Taken together, our data indicate a role for miRNA9 in the acquisition of chemoresistance in GBMs and may serve as novel therapeutic targets.']",

        "Background":"['RMS is the most common sarcoma of childhood. Approximately 60% of embryonal RMS (ERMS) and more rarely alveolar RMS (ARMS) express HH pathway components. However, roles for the HH signal transduction pathway in RMS biology and as a therapeutic target in RMS have been incompletely characterized. Therefore, we determined if RMS cells lines have HH signaling pathways that are responsive to pathway activation or inhibition in vitro. We demonstrated expression of HH pathway genes (Indian HH, Desert HH, PTCH1, SMO, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3) by qRT PCR in ERMS (Rh18, Ruch2, SMS-CTR, and RD) and ARMS (Rh 30 and Rh41) cells. We showed high GLI1 protein expression, the downstream mediator of HH signaling, by Western blot in Rh18, Rh30, and Rh41 cells but not in RD or Rh28 cells. Exposure of Rh41 cells to Sonic HH-containing conditioned media caused a 12-fold increase in PTCH1 expression and exposure of Rh28 cells to Sonic HH peptide increased GLI1 expression 1.5-fold, suggesting intact HH signal transduction in some RMS cell lines. Down-regulation of HH pathway activity with the GLI1 inhibitor GANT61 reduced Rh41 and RD cell viability by MTT assays in a dose dependent manner. Reduced cell viability appeared to result at least in part from down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic GLI1 target gene, BCL2. These results suggest a role for HH signaling in RMS cell survival. Next, we used subcutaneous xenografts (with either Rh30 cells, n = 4; Rh41cells, n = 3; or RD cells, n = 3) to assess whether the HH pathway represents a potentially important therapeutic target in RMS in vivo. Mice were treated with either cyclopamine (subcutaneous SMO inhibitor), GANT61 (subcutaneous GLI1 inhibitor), or Vismodegib (oral SMO inhibitor) for 16 days once the tumor volume was 250 mm3. The study endpoints were HH pathway inhibition (qRT PCR), tumor volume (mm3), proliferation (BrdU immunostain), and apoptosis (Caspase immunostain) on day 17 of treatment. Cyclopamine and GANT61 reduced GLI1, PTCH1, and BCL2 expression in 7/10 and 4/10 mice, respectively. We observed partial responses to cyclopamine and GANT61 in Rh41 xenograft mice; GANT61 caused significant regression in tumor volume from baseline (p = 0.03). We did not detect changes in proliferation or apoptosis post-therapy by immunohistochemistry. Our results suggest that targeted inhibition of the HH signaling pathway with small-molecule inhibitors sometimes inhibits RMS xenograft tumor growth in vivo and support further RMS xenograft studies, assessing HH pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.']",

While initially responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, SCLC is characterized by eventual progression and resistance to traditional therapy. We retrospectively analyzed a molecular profiling (MP) database to identify potentially actionable alterations using a multi-platform approach which includes massively parallel sequencing. Experimental Procedures', ' SCLC patient samples were referred to a central CLIA laboratory (Caris Life Sciences, AZ) for MP (immunohistochemistry [IHC] and next generation sequencing [NGS]). Expression of PD1 (MRQ-22, 1+) on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PDL1 (130021, SP142, 2+5%) in tumor cells was performed by IHC. Additional IHC (ERCC1, TOPO1) and NGS on 591 genes was performed on FFPE samples using the Illumina NextSeq platform in a subset of patient samples. All variants were detected with > 99% confidence. Variants are described as follows', ' pathogenic, presumed pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and unclassified variants (excluding SNPs). Results', ' 203 SCLC samples were identified, 48% were females (97) and 52% were males (106). Median age was 65 [range', ' 29-88]. Cancer cells expressed PDL1 in 2.5% of cases (5/203) and PD1+ TILs were detected in 38% (75/197). For comparison, internal PDL1+ in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) was 31% (339/1098). Notable findings from IHC included ERCC1 negative status in 93% (14/15) and TOPO1 + in 70% (14/20). CNV and mutational analysis (NGS) was available for 10 and 22 patients, respectively. Amplifications were found in the following genes', ' CCND3, CRKL, FGF4, FGFR1 and NFKB1A (n = 1, respectively), and CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A and FGF3 (n = 2, respectively). As previously reported, the most frequently altered genes were TP53 (73%) and RB1 (68%). Clinically relevant pathogenic or presumed pathogenic variants included', ' EGFR (exon 19 deletion), BRAF (G469A), APC (T1556fs), NF1 (A1610fs, D699fs), NOTCH1 (E473fs, C332Y, G546X) and PTCH1 (N1351fs).

Variants with unknown significance or unclassified variants detected in genes with clinical relevance and of potential interest for targeted therapy in SCLC include', ' DDR2, cMET, RET, FGFR1/3, BRCA2, IGF1R, RICTOR and NTRK1. Conclusion', ' Genomic and molecular characterization of SCLC samples reveals a heterogeneous population. Several potentially actionable targets are identified by NGS. Early reported trial data suggests susceptibility of SCLC to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We observed higher levels of PD1+ TILs, however differences in antibody clones, thresholds or staining localization (tumor cells vs. stromal lymphocytes), may account for the observed overall low PD-L1 expression.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a pathogenic role in many human cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and several pathway antagonists have begun clinical testing. All of these novel agents target Smoothened (Smo), a key regulator of Hh signaling, but reported emergence of resistance mutations questions the durability of this approach. Oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, can modulate Hh signaling either through direct interaction with Smo or via cross-talk with liver X receptors (LXR) that serve as their natural receptors. Thus, oxysterols may represent mechanistically novel Hh inhibitors, especially if they involve LXRs. Methods', ' We examined the effects of LXR activation on the in vivo growth of pancreatic cancer. Nude mice bearing pancreatic cancer xenografts derived from primary clinical specimens were treated with a vehicle control, gemcitabine, the non-steroidal LXR agonist TO901317, or the combination of gemcitabine and TO901317 for 4-6 weeks. The LXR agonist TO901317 was used since it lacks the ability to directly bind to Smo. Tumor volumes were measured to assess response, and LXR and Hh pathway activities were quantified by real-time RT-PCR for Hh (GLI1, PTCH1) and LXR (ABCA1) target gene expression. Human specific primers were used to detect changes in tumor cells, whereas mouse-specific primers were used to study stroma. Intratumoral levels of gemcitabine triphosphate were quantified by LC-MS-MS. Results', ' Administration of TO901317 alone did not impact tumor growth compared to control treated animals similar to previous findings with Smo antagonists. Treatment with gemcitabine alone decreased tumor growth, However the addition of TO901317 to gemcitabine significantly enhanced this effect to promote tumor regression. In vivo treatment with TO901317 successfully activated LXR in both human tumor cells and murine stromal cells as evidenced by increased expression of ABCA1. Moreover, TO901317 inhibited expression of the Hh targets GLI1 and PTCH1 5- and 2-fold, respectively, in stromal cells and 5-fold in tumor cells. Previous studies (Olive et al, Science, 2009) demonstrated that Hh pathway inhibition improves drug delivery in vivo. Therefore, we quantified intratumoral levels of gemcitabine triphosphate, the active metabolite of gemcitabine, and found that it was significantly elevated in tumors exposed to TO901317 (P<0.03). Conclusions', ' The LXR agonist TO901317 enhances the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine to promote tumor regression in a human xenograft model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Therefore, LXR agonists, such as TO901317 and oxysterols, may represent a novel strategy to target pathologic Hh signaling within both tumor cells as well as the surrounding stroma.']",

The expression of lung stem cell markers EpCAM, CD166, E-cadherin, CD90, CD44, CD34, CD133 and ABCG2 was assessed by flow cytometry. The tumor-initiating cell capacity of selected lung-spheres was tested in vivo to confirm tumorigenicity.Results', \" Lung-tumorspheres had increased expression of EPCAM, CD44 and ALDH1A1 (p = 0.028, p = 0.021 and p = 0.043, respectively) when compared to cells grown in adherence. Likewise, NANOG, KLF4 and OCT4 tended to be more expressed in tumorspheres. Relative gene expression of NOTCH1 was also higher in spheroids than in monolayer cells (p = 0.028), in concordance with the same tendency observed in NOTCH3. Similarly, RTqPCR analysis revealed a possible activation of the canonical Wnt pathway in tumorspheres, with high expression levels of the downstream effector gene CCND1 (p = 0.05), along with a repression of DKK1 inhibitor. Regarding to the non-canonical Wnt pathway, its activator WNT5A showed lower expression levels in spheroids compared to monolayer-culture cells. Concerning the expression levels of Hedgehog pathway's genes, we found that SMO and PTCH1 were underexpressed in lung-tumorspheres compared with their paired adherent-cultured cells (p = 0.028 andp = 0.069). Flow cytometry revealed that EpCAM and CD44 were highly expressed in lungspheres obtained from cell lines and primary tumors. The expression of CD166 differed among the cell lines.

Copy number (CN) alterations or mutations in RB, RAS-MAPK, and PI3K-AKT pathway genes occur in 35%, 20%, and 35% of the tumors, respectively. Activation of these pathways may confer sensitivity to drugs that target them (e.g., PI3K or AKT inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, CDK inhibitors) as well as resistance to drugs (e.g., HER2 or EGFR inhibitors) that have failed in ovarian cancer clinical trials. A comprehensive evaluation of the genetic aberrations in targetable pathways can therefore inform the selection of appropriate drugs and combinations for each patient in the context of clinical trials.As part of molecular profiling analyses performed for recurrent ovarian cancer patients to inform selection of their next treatment, the presence of mutations or alterations (e.g., CN changes) in 182 genes that encode proteins that are key mediators in oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways were determined using a validated exon-capture sequencing platform provided in a CLIA-certified laboratory setting. 20 serous (4 primary/16 recurrent) and 4 recurrent mixed or pure clear cell ovarian tumor samples were analyzed. A median of 2.5 (range 0-7) alterations were detected in the serous histology specimens; frequencies of p53 mutations (16; 80%) and amplifications in CCND1 (1; 5%), CCND2 (1; 5%), CCNE1 (2; 10%) are consistent with those observed in the TCGA tumors. In contrast, more frequent RAS pathway aberrations (45% vs. 20%) corresponding to KRAS amplification (3;15%) and mutations/truncations in NF1 (5; 20%) or NF2 (1; 5%) were observed, possibly reflecting the recurrent nature of these samples (TCGA used primary tumors). Only one PIK3CA amplification was detected (i.e.,5%) in contrast to the 18% observed in the TCGA dataset. Amplifications of IGF1R (3; 15%) and ERBB2 (1;5%) were also detected in the serous histology tumors, while PIK3CA and KRAS mutations were only detected in the tumors with mixed cc and endometrioid histologies. Interestingly, a predicted protein-truncating rearrangement in PTCH1 and a kinase-activating exon duplication in FLT3 were detected in tumors from single patients suggesting drugs targeting the HH pathway and FLT3 as options for ovarian cancer patients.While it is important to increase the number of samples analyzed, these data suggest that selection of patients for clinical trials should be informed by comprehensive molecular characterization of recurrent tumor specimens.']",

        "Background":"['Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is a highly conserved inter- and intracellular communication mechanism that governs organogenesis and is dysregulated in cancers of numerous tissues, including prostate. Up-regulated expression of the Hh ligands, Sonic (Shh) and Desert (Dhh), has been reported in androgen-deprived and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In a cohort of therapy naive, short- and long-term neoadjuvant hormone therapy-treated (NHT), and CRPC specimens, we observed elevated Dhh expression predominantly in long-term NHT specimens and elevated Shh expression predominantly in CRPC specimens. Together with previously demonstrated reciprocal signaling between Shh-producing prostate cancer (PCa) cells and urogenital mesenchymal fibroblasts, these results suggest that castration-induced Hh expression promotes CRPC progression through reciprocal paracrine signaling within the tumor microenvironment. We tested whether the orally available Smoothened (Smo) antagonist, TAK-441, could impair castration-resistant progression of LNCaP PCa xenografts by disrupting paracrine Hh signaling. While TAK-441 or cyclopamine did not affect androgen withdrawal-induced Shh up-regulation or viability of LNCaP cells, castration-resistant progression of LNCaP xenografts was significantly delayed in animals treated with TAK-441. In TAK-441-treated xenografts, expression of murine orthologues of the Hh-activated genes, Gli1, Gli2, and Ptch1, was substantially suppressed, while expression of the corresponding human orthologues was unaffected. Since androgen-deprived LNCaP cells up-regulate Shh expression, but are not sensitive to Smo antagonists, these studies indicate that TAK-441 leads to delayed castration-resistant progression of LNCaP xenografts by disrupting paracrine Hh signaling with the tumor stroma.

Little is known about the factors that influence these tumors biology. Identification of new molecular markers can help in the differential diagnosis between ULM from low grade ULMS. It was demonstrated that activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is related to the development of several tumors, through its activity in the cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we investigated the protein expression profile of SHH, PTCH1, SMO and GLI1 both ULM (including non-typical leiomyomas) and ULMS.

The cancer stem cells (CSC) model proposes the existence of a subpopulation within the tumor with stem-like cell properties', ' a significant proliferation capacity, a unique self-renewal capacity, and therefore, a higher ability to form new tumors.We enriched the stem-like cell population content of two commercial neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNDZ and SIMA) by the use of conditioned cell culture media for neurospheres, and compared genome expression and genomic gains and losses appearing in neurospheres versus the alterations appearing in standard tumor cells, by microarray analysis and array-CGH, respectively.Array-CGH did not show any significant differences between standard and neurosphere-forming cell lines, both in SKNDZ and in SIMA. The microarray expression analysis highlighted some of the most relevant biological processes and molecular functions that might be responsible for the stem-cell like phenotype. As expected, some signalling pathways detected were involved in self-renewal of normal tissues (Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog and TGF-) and seem to contribute to CSC phenotype when deregulated. Among them, we focused on the aberrant activation of Hedgehog and TGF- signalling pathways. We confirmed the inhibition of repressors of TGF- pathway, as SMAD6 and SMAD7 by quantitative PCR. The analysis of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway showed overexpression of PTCH1, GLI1 and SMO. We analyzed two CSC surface markers, and found overexpression of CD133 and CD15 in SIMA neurospheres, confirming that this cell line was particularly enriched in stem-like cells.This work shows a cross-talk of different pathways in neuroblastoma, and the importance of it in stem-like cells, as confirmed by the overexpression observed in JAG1, one of the targets of TGF- and also the main activator of Notch signalling pathway.Further analysis based on this work could identify possible new targets for molecular CSC therapies against neuroblastoma, highlighting the importance of redirecting current cancer treatments towards CSC to achieve total elimination of tumor cell population and improve treatment effectiveness.']",

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in PanIN and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, especially implicating as an early and late mediator of pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis. In this study, we focused on Hh pathway to regulate self-renewal of CD133high pancreatic CSCs.Materials and Methods', 'Cells', ' We established endogenous CD133high (over 90%) pancreatic cancer cells derived from Capan-1 cells. Consequently, CD133knock-down cells were established by the lentiviral transduction method. Reagents', ' 1) Cyclopamine inhibits the Hh pathway by interaction with the Hh signaling protein smoothened (SMO). 2) GANT61 blocks the GLI function which constitutes the final step in the Hh pathway and interferes with GLI-1 DNA binding in living cells. To analyze the Hh pathway', ' Stemness-related genes were analyzed by DNA microarray. Self-renewal signal activation was confirmed by fluorescent immunohistochemistry. To analyze Hh pathway, sphere assay and MTT assay were performed on sphere-forming abilities and cytostatic effects by Hh signal inhibitors, respectively. The migration assay was used to evaluate cell migratory ability. Results', ' 1) Sphere-forming cells in CD133high cells showed upregulation of BMP3, SOX2, GLI1, ALDH1A, et al. and downregulation of PTCH1, SMO, WNT3A, et al. by DNA microarray but the monolayer cells did not. 2) Cyclopamine could suppress cell growth and sphere formation of CD133high and CD133knock-down cells. GANT61 showed more suppressive effect than Cyclopamine. In addition, GANT61 treatment showed smaller spheroid than the cyclopamine treatment. These results suggest that Hh signal participates in proliferation and self-renewal of the pancreatic CSCs. 3) CD133high cells showed higher migratory ability than CD133knock-down cells. Because the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcription factors, such as Slug and snail, in CD133high cells are upregulated but not in CD133knock-down cells. Interestingly, Hh signal inhibitors suppressed the migratory ability of CD133high cells by the migration assay.Conclusion', ' GLI-1 acts more effectively on self-renewal of pancreatic CSCs through Hh pathway than Cyclopamine.

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND Cancer genomes harbor mutational spectra that document exposures to external factors and endogenous events underlying tumor development. Information on candidate cancer driver alterations is accessible from public compendia of somatic mutations, yet much of this knowledge remains descriptive and of limited mechanistic insight. Simple, robust and rapid systems are thus needed for well-controlled experimental investigations of functional impact of carcinogenic exposures on the genome and on cancer cell growth.METHODS We use barrier bypass-clonal expansion (BBCE) assays based on primary human and murine cell cultures, in which mutations are introduced by mutagenic carcinogens and examined by deep sequencing, after the exposed cells have bypassed a selective pressure barrier and have clonally immortalized. A customized deep sequencing data analysis pipeline is used to decipher both the mutational signatures and the putative functional driver events selected and enriched for during the clonal outgrowth phase.RESULTS Using the BBCE assays, we tested the global mutagenic effects of a number of known human carcinogens. We obtained 25 independently arising clones, altogether harboring 15,200 acquired mutations, with varying numbers per clone, of which 7,600 were non-synonymous. These affected 250 genes currently listed in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census. Eighty-four genes were recurrently mutated across the BBCE clone panel, including well-established oncogenes (HRAS, ABL1, EGFR, MYC, PIK3CG) and tumor suppressors (APC, ATM, BRCA2, PTCH1, TP53). A number of epigenetic and chromatin regulators also acquired recurrent mutations, among them ASH1L, BAZ1A, BAZ1B, EP400, HDAC6, and members of histone lysine demethylase and methyltransferase families. Collectively, the recurrent alterations affected pathways regulating DNA damage response, DNA repair, cell cycle, cell death, transcription and chromatin structure, and developmental pathways of TGF-beta, Notch, WNT and ERBB signaling. Thus, as in human cancers, mutations driving critical steps of cellular stress bypass and clonal immortalization arise and become selected for when these processes are modeled in vitro.CONCLUSIONS The BBCE assays constitute a unique resource amenable to follow-up functional studies of particular mutations in cancer genes. Data will be presented describing systematic genome editing and pharmacological manipulation of select mutated genes, followed by assessment of resulting phenotypic and molecular traits. In summary, our BBCE approach may yield new mechanistic insights into driver-like events underlying cancer development.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Funding from International Agency for Research on Cancer; ITMO CANCER-INSERM Plan Cancer 2015 grant to J.Z.']",

However in a recent randomized phase II trial of chemotherapy with or without the small molecule HH inhibitor vismodegib for advanced gastric cancers, the addition of vismodegib did not increase progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). In this study, we examine the role of HH signaling in gastric CSC maintenance and chemotherapy resistance.Methods and Results', ' Gastric cancer cell lines AGS, MKN-45, and NCI-N87 were grown as spheroids to enrich for CSCs. Spheroid cells were found to have upregulation of the putative gastric CSC marker CD44 along with HH pathway proteins Shh, Ptch1, Smo, and Gli1. Inhibition of the HH signaling using Smo shRNA or vismodegib decreased spheroid formation by 70.3-78.4% or 66.9-70.8%, respectively, and attentuated another CSC phenotype, single cell colony formation, by 66.9-78.4%. Transformation phenotypes such as migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent colony formation were also inhibited in gastric CSCs by 50.2-65.6%, 57.4-66.3%, and 3.8-4.6 fold, respectively. CD44(+) gastric CSCs from all 3 cell lines were resistant to 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin chemotherapy, and this resistance was reversed with the addition of Smo shRNA or vismodegib. The combination of Smo shRNA and cisplatin synergistically blocked the growth of MKN-45 xenografts, and treated tumors demonstrated a 1.8-2.6 fold increase in tumor cell apoptosis compared to tumors treated with cisplatin alone. Clinical tumor samples from the phase II vismodegib trial were analyzed for CD44 expression (as a surrogate to levels of CSCs). In the chemotherapy alone group, high CD44 expression was associated with worse PFS and OS. However in the chemotherapy with vismodegib group, high CD44 expression was associated with improved PFS and OS. For two patients in the vismodegib arm of the study who had a complete response, CD44 levels were 6.1-fold higher than the other patients in the group (p=0.001).Conclusions', ' HH signaling is required to maintain gastric CSC phenotypes such as spheroid formation and colony formation from single cells as well malignant transformation phenotypes such as migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Gastric CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy compared to unselected cells, and HH inhibition can reverse this resistance.

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the adult central nervous system. The highly lethal nature of this tumor partly derives from the acquisition of an invasive phenotype, which allows the tumor cells to infiltrate the surrounding brain tissues. In fact the tumor cells, leading to the recurrence of the primary neoplasm highly contribute to the lack of success in eradicating this disease. Recent evidences suggested that a rare population of stem-like cells (or tumor initiating cells) present in brain tumors may be responsible for development of highly invasive and chemoresistant recurrent tumors. It was suggested that not all the cells from a given brain tumor show the same ability to proliferate and sustain the growth. Only a relatively small fraction of those cells, termed Brain Tumor Stem-like Cells (BTSCs), possess the ability to proliferate, self-renew extensively and adapt to very different micro-environments. Further investigations have demonstrated that BTSCs also more closely mirror the phenotype and genotype of the primary tumors, in fact when used in animal models they are able to generate a tumor that recapitulates the features of the human GBMs. The absence of stem cell specific markers has posed challenges to the identification and isolation of BTSCs from the bulk tumor cells in a definitive manner. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that the Hedgehog (HH) pathway is involved in BTSCs population maintaining in GBM. We report that in a commercially available human recurrent GBM line (DBTRG-05MG) and in different patients derived GBM cells; the key components required for an active HH pathway, such as PTCH1, SMO and SHH, are present and differently expressed according to culture conditions. Cells cultured in serum containing media, have a switched-off HH pathway, while cells kept in serum free containing media supplemented with EGF and bFGF to promote the formation of floating growing neurospheres, show a functional HH signaling pathway. These GBM cells respond to the same mitogens that activate normal adult neural stem cells showing multipotent differentiation properties and expressing markers of the normal stem cells lineage, such as Nestin, SOX2, Bmi1 and Musashi1. Proliferation assays performed using GBM patient-derived neurospheres clearly showed higher sensitivity to the different SMO antagonists tested when compared to the adherent counterpart cultured in serum containing media. The effect of small molecules SMO antagonists in self-renewal assays, confirmed the implication of the HH pathway in the growth of these stem-like cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of an operational HH pathway in human GBM derived neurospheres, and the ability of those cells to be applied in a drug discovery setting as a reliable SMO antagonists phenotypic testing tool.']",

It is one of the most common leukemias in the Western world, and currently, there is no cure for CLL due to the heterogeneous ways in which it can proliferate. Due to the dynamics of how CLL can develop, it is very critical to investigate the oncogenic mechanisms that allow particular clinical CLL subtypes to expand, as well as discovering potential underlying mechanisms that are common among all CLL patients. With this comprehensive goal in mind, we investigated the gene expression landscape in CLL by performing whole transcriptome analysis via RNA sequencing in 47 CLL patients and 5 normal CD19+ B-cell donors to determine differential expression and isoform patterns in CLL. Between CLL and normal CD19+ B-cells, there were 725 differentially expressed genes (FDR p<.01), with 217 of these genes being upregulated in CLL. Several of these upregulated genes include CTLA4, CD276, CLNK, and PDCD1, all of which are involved in T-cell interactions. We also discovered significant upregulation in the kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (KSR2) gene, an event previously not reported in CLL. We also see clear clinical separation of IGHV unmutated vs. IGHV mutated CLL patients based solely on the expression signature created by hierarchical clustering. Examples of prognostic genes that correspond to IGHV status include previously identified genes LPL, LDOC1, PTCH1, and CRY1, as well as potentially novel prognostic expression markers SPG20, ARSD, KLK2, and MTSS1. We also utilized the SpliceSeq algorithm software and investigated the differential isoform patterns that take place between CLL patients and normal B-cell donors. Based on the results, we discovered 300 alternative promoter, 135 alternative terminator, 287 exon skipping, and 30 premature stop events that differ between CLL and normal B-cells. From these results, we validated two isoform switching events that take place in the splicing machinery genes SF3B1 and SNRNP70. For SF3B1, a short transcript devoid of the critical protein domains is overexpressed in CLL compared to the normal B-cell counterpart. For SNRNP70, a particular transcript transcribed by an alternative promoter is overexpressed in CLL patients compared to normal CD19+ B-cells. This overexpressed SNRNP70 isoform does not contain the RNA recognition motif crucial for 5 RNA binding and splicing initiation, thus theoretically rendering its canonical action nonfunctional. Overall, transcriptome profiling of CLL patients using RNA sequencing allowed for discovery of differential expression changes previously not reported in CLL, as well as discovering novel splicing events that provide insight into potentially new oncogenic mechanisms in CLL proliferation.']",

LCM and RNA sequencing were performed on a subset of cases selecting nuclear  catenin accumulating clusters, and paired non-cluster tumour tissue (palisading epithelium). Mouse ACP models indicate that these clusters initiate tumorigenesis in a non-cell autonomous manner.Consensus clustering analysis revealed two subgroups of human ACP, one associated with a high CTNNB1 mutational frequency (>30%), a relatively high tumour content and fibrous reactive tissue (Group H) and another with a lower mutation frequency (<30%) and glial reactive tissue (Group L).The meta-gene signature of Group H defined by non-negative matrix factorization included secreted factors, such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) 3, 4 and 19, Keratins and Matrix Metalloproteinases and was enriched for genes related to odontogenesis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis independently showed correlation of expression of such genes with mutational frequency. Glial markers and neural differentiation genes were up-regulated in Group L tumors. Differential expression showed up-regulation in ACPs of potential therapeutic targets including SHH (32x), EGFR (8.9x) and TNF (10x).Similarly, differential expression analysis of LCM dissected nuclear  catenin accumulating clusters identified up-regulation of SHH, FGFs and other secreted factors including as WNTs and BMPs.Analysis of the SHH pathway found that SHH is over expressed in clusters (9x) whilst its downstream targets Ptch1 (1.7x), Gli1 (2.1x), Gli3 (2.9x) are over expressed in palisading epithelium, indicating the presence of paracrine signaling. These findings were independently confirmed by in situ hybridisation in human samples and the mouse model.Clustering of murine expression data with those genes differentially expressed in the human clusters revealed murine and human clusters group together, suggesting they are similar structures functionally and biologically.Together, these results suggest that a subset of cells, carrying CTNNB1 mutations and showing nuclear -catenin accumulation, express secreted pro-oncogenic factors and the response may be observed in neighboring cell types. Targeting such signalling offers an attractive therapeutic opportunity, for which the results suggest the mouse model is wellplaced for testing.

        "Background":"['The iperactivation of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, which controls the refuel of the tumor clone, might be critical to Multiple Myeloma (MM) recurrence. In order to dissect the role played by Hh pathway in different MM cells compartments, and to evaluate its clinical impact on patient outcomes, here we explore the transcriptomic and genomic profiles in both CD138+ plasma cells and CD138-19+ B progenitors cells obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients (pts),The study included a cohort of 126 pts, homogenously treated with bortezomib-based regimens and ASCT. DNA and RNA were obtained from both CD138+ plasma cell fraction and CD19+ B cells. Gene expression profiling (GEP) (HG U133 Plus 2.0) and genomic analysis (SNP 6.0) were performed on Affymetrix platform. Data were analysed by employing several software', ' dChip (GEP clustering), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (GEP Enrichment) and Nexus (Copy number).By unsupervised hierarchical clustering, an Hh signature of 10 genes - SHH, IHH, DHH, SMO, PTCH1, PTCH2, SUFU, GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 - was identified, and it was able to significantly cluster pts in two subgroups', ' cluster 1 (70 pts) and cluster 2 (56 pts. An overall significant activation of Hh pathway was shown in cluster 2, as compared to cluster 1. Of note, the Hh pathway was down regulated in CD19+ B cells obtained from pts included in cluster 2, while it was overexpressed in cluster 1 pts. Western blots on both cell fractions confirmed this opposite Hh genes behavior. A higher genomic instability (e.g. higher frequencies of both t(4;14) and del(17p)) was demonstrated in CD138+ cells from cluster 2 pts and, at least 5 known tumor suppressor genes, such as RB1, BRCA2, PDX1, FOXO1 and TP53 were affected. Conversely, cluster 1 pts were mainly characterized by hyperdiploid karyotypes. The more aggressive phenotype of cluster 2 pts was confirmed by an overall deregulation of cell adhesion processes (CD44, LIMS1, COL4A2, CTGF, COL1A1, FN1), increased proliferation (MYCBP, IL22, SDPR, SOX2, SOX6) and DNA repair mechanisms (SP1, SMARCD3, FOXA3). Hh pathway activation significantly influenced pts outcome, since those included in cluster 2 had a shorter PFS and OS compared to cluster 1. In fact, the 5-year PFS estimates were 31% vs 56% (p = 0.0062), whereas the OS probabilities were 66% and 83%, respectively (p = 0.0071). Of note, both hazard ratios for PFS and OS were doubled in pts included in cluster 2, as compared to pts included in cluster 1. Finally, multivariate analyses confirmed that being part of cluster 2 was an independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS, along with del(17p) and ISS 3.Two alternate Hh-driven subtypes of MM might be identified at diagnosis, which correlated with pts outcomes. Stratification of pts according to their molecular background might help the fine-tuning of future clinical studies.Acknowledgements', ' FP7 NGS-PTL project, Progetto Regione-Universit 2010/2012 L.

Following IRB approval, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of pts who underwent NGS at MSKCC. Results', ' From 20122016, 5635 pts worldwide with 56 histologies were tested. Median age of 52 yrs ( < 1-88), 52% females and sarcoma NOS (n = 858) was most frequent. Tumors were sequenced to a mean coverage of 634X; 1165 fusions and > 60,000 mut were found. Mut suspicious for germline defects were seen in 542 pts (9.6%) in known and novel genes (BRCA, ARID1, FANC). Tumor mutational burden was 2.5/Mb (0329) and glomus tumors and EHE had the highest and lowest mut, respectively. 16% and 7% of pts had treatment-linked alterations (TLA) known to respond to an FDA approved or study drug, respectively. 42% of pts had TLA eligible for NCI-MATCH, ASCO-TAPUR or other studies. Novel TLA include AKT, ESR1, BRCA, NTRK, PTCH1, SMARCB1 and others. Of the 107 MSKCC pts with clinical data, 60/107 (57%) had at least one TLA, of which 31 (30%) enrolled on a matched trial and 26 pts were ineligible or lacked access to trials. Partial/complete responses were seen with inhibitors to NTRK, IDH1, BRAF, PI3K/mTOR, MDM2, SMARCB1 and others. NGS changed the initial pathology diagnosis and treatments in 5% pts (e.g. LMS to liposarcoma, clear cell to melanoma). Resistance mutations averted futile therapies in 5% pts (e.g. Rb loss and palbociclib in liposarcoma).

        "Background":"['Medulloblastoma is a pediatric brain tumor with poor overall survival and adverse long-term effects from current surgical and radiation treatments. Our group has recently used expression and copy number analysis to define six medulloblastoma subtypes, c1-c6. To assess whether these subgroups contain somatic mutations that encode potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets, we performed whole exome hybrid capture and Illumina sequencing of 94 tumor/normal pairs. For each sample, we sequenced 193,094 exons from 18,863 genes to 126X average coverage. Tumors contained a median 5 silent and 11 non-silent candidate mutations, corresponding to 0.34 non-silent mutations per megabase, a low mutation rate consistent with other pediatric tumors. Overall, 16 genes were mutated at statistically significant frequency and several clustered within subtypes. Eleven tumors harbored mutually-exclusive, likely loss-of-function missense mutations within the helicase domains of candidate oncogene DDX3X (n=7) or SMARCA4 (n=4). These mutations were found in five of seven c6 tumors (3 DDX3X, 2 SMARCA4) of which four had known beta-catenin mutations. Two SMARCA4 mutations were identical and two affected adjacent residues. None of the DDX3X mutations were recurrent, however several are proximal when mapped to a tertiary protein model. To confirm these variants, we are performing deep sequencing of these genes using multiplex PCR (Fluidigm) followed by single-molecule real-time sequencing (PacBio). We are also characterizing the functional effect of DDX3X and SMARCA4 mutations alone and in combination with beta-catenin mutations in medulloblastoma cell lines. Other genes with subtype-associated, loss-of-function mutations include DULLARD in 2 of 9 c1 tumors, PTCH1 in 5 of 16 c3 tumors, and MLL2 in 2 of 3 tumors without any copy number alterations as well as a c1 tumor and two c3 tumors. Several genes are mutated across subtypes, notably tumor suppressors TP53 (n=3), GPS2 (n=3) and SOCS4 (n=2). 19 chromatin remodeling genes including cancer genes BRCA2, KDM5/6A, CREBBP, EP300, BRD4, and MLL3/4 are mutated across 17 tumors from all subtypes. While we have uncovered several subtype-associated mutations, 88% of mutated genes are only altered in a single tumor. This analysis demonstrates the diversity of somatic mutation in medulloblastoma, even within copy number subtypes. To better understand infrequently mutated genes, we will attempt to assemble them into commonly altered gene sets and pathways. We also intend to investigate potentially pathogenic germline variations in each case.']",

Despite these advances, few genomic studies have profiled sufficient cases to identify recurrent genetic events, including those restricted to a particular molecular subgroup, making it difficult to discriminate driver genes from passengers. To specifically address these issues we have performed a comprehensive genome-wide copy number analysis of 1,250 frozen primary medulloblastomas and summarized their genomes by medulloblastoma subgroup using Affymetrix SNP6 arrays and a custom nanoString expression assay. Significant regions of interest were verified and validated both within the MAGIC cohort and in non-overlapping samples using a combination of FISH and a custom nanoString copy number assay. The most prevalent oncogenic events observed in medulloblastoma included those targeting known oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as members of the MYC family (MYCN, MYC, and MYCL1), cell cycle regulators (CCND2 and CDK6), genes involved in RTK/PI3K/mTOR signaling (PDGFRA, IRS2, PTEN, and TSC1), and components of the SHH pathway (GLI2 and PTCH1). Integration of our copy number data with nanoString results allowed for subgroup-specific genomic analyses and the identification of multiple novel candidates that appear to be targeted in a subgroup-restricted manner. Significant focal copy number aberrations affecting the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and candidate breast cancer oncogenes LMO4 and BCAS3 were revealed in SHH medulloblastoma, providing insight into novel pathways that likely cooperate with canonical SHH signaling in this subgroup. Similarly, we identified novel genetic events restricted to the poor prognosis Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas, including recurrent high-level amplification of members of the TGF pathway (ACVR2A and ACVR2B) in Group 3 and apparent deregulation of the RB pathway (RB1, CCND2, and CDK6) in Group 4. Definitive elucidation of the genetic events contributing to the initiation, maintenance, and progression of medulloblastoma will be an essential prerequisite for the future development of rationally designed targeted therapies. Our current study of >1,200 medulloblastoma genomes has shown that medulloblastoma subgroups exhibit distinct genomics, and implicated novel actionable genes within the subgroups that may serve as attractive targets for future therapy. Prospective functional validation of our findings and the development of appropriate preclinical models faithfully recapitulating the genetics we have observed in subgroups of the human disease will be necessary for advances in the treatment of medulloblastoma.']",
