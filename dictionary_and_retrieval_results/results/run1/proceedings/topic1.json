        "Background":"['BRAF V600E mutation happens in 60% of all melanomas cases and this mutation is responsible to poor prognosis of the disease. BRAF is part of the MAPK signaling pathway and the V600E mutation of BRAF confers full activation of this survival pathway. Several clinical trials are being conducted using mutated BRAF as a target but so far, all this trials works during a certain moment but soon, melanoma cells becomes resistant to treatment by activating some survival pathways that can continues the signal initialized in the MAPK pathway. Our objective is to evaluate if the combination of BRAF inhibitors and CDKs inhibitors can suppress the acquired resistance of V600E melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors. Two melanoma cell lines were used in this study. The SKMel 28 cell line, which has BRAF V600E mutation, and the SKMel 02, which is wild type to BRAF. Olomoucine and Roscovitine were the CDKs inhibitors used in this study, while PLX-4720 was BRAF inhibitor. Western blot and Real time PCR were used to verify some survival pathways, like the MAP3K8 and the PRKD3 pathway, that are overexpressed after BRAF inhibition and MTT assay was used to verify cell viability with both treatments combined. The combination of Olomoucine and PLX-4720 or Roscovitine and PLX-4720 could sensitize the BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell line SKMel 28, but not the BRAF wild type melanoma cell line SKMel 02. Two survival pathways (MAP3K8 and PRKD3) which are activated after BRAF inhibition by PLX-4720 were downregulated in the presence of the CDKs inhibitors in the SKMel 28 melanoma cell line. Also, the retinoblastoma protein was not phosphorylated when the SKMel28 melanoma cell line was treated with the BRAF inhibitor together with the CDKs. The treatment with the BRAF inhibitor and the CDKs inhibitors can sensitize BRAF V600E melanoma cells by decreasing cell viability, downregulation of survival pathways induced by the BRAF inhibitor and preventing Rb phosphorylation. This strategy may overcome the acquired resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma after treatment with its inhibitors.']",

Methods', ' Pts with exhausted treatment options included in the Copenhagen Prospective Personalized Oncology (CoPPO) research program were selected for targeted therapy against actionable driver mutations identified in freshly obtained tumor biopsies by whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500). In pts with non-melanoma cancers harboring mutant BRAF V600E, plasma samples were collected at baseline and during targeted treatment. fcDNA was isolated and allele frequency of BRAF V600E mutations were quantified using droplet digital PCR. Results', ' Among 300+ patients included in the CoPPO research program, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in six patients with non-melanoma cancers who received targeted therapy (NSCLC, n = 1; bile duct cancer, n = 3; colon cancer, n = 2). Treatments included BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) alone or in combination with MEK (trametinib) or EGFR inhibitors (panitumumab or cetuximab, colon cancer pts only). All pts but one had reductions in the size of target tumors. Two pts had partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The allele frequency of BRAF V600E increased within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation and subsequently decreased substantially. Dynamics of allele frequency correlated closely to treatment response. In all cases, timing of changes in allele frequency preceded documented radiological treatment response and/or progression. Analyses of tumor biopsies obtained post-treatment are ongoing.

        "Background":"['Mutations in the B-raf oncogene constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

IHC analysis to determine BRAF mutation status has been made possible by the development of monoclonal antibodies directed at mutant BRAF protein expression, which may be of use as an alternative to molecular testing. Methods', ' We identified 132 patients with metastatic melanoma between 2011 and 2014 at our institution that had tumour tested for BRAF mutation using PCR. Of these, 122 cases were suitable for IHC. Tissue samples were obtained and tested with the BRAF V600E antibody. IHC was assessed as 0 (negative), 1, 2 or 3 based on intensity of cytoplasmic staining. We assessed the incidence of BRAF mutation, investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the BRAF V600E antibody in detecting the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation. Clinical response to BRAF inhibitor therapy as per RECIST was correlated to BRAF mutation status by PCR and to IHC expression. Results', ' The incidence of BRAF mutation as assessed by PCR was 28.8% (38/132). The antibody showed a sensitivity of 86.1% with a specificity of 96.9%. The positive predictive value was 96.9%; the negative predictive value was 94.4%. The concordance rate between PCR and IHC was 95.1% (116/122).

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and the leading cause of death from skin disease. The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 60% of melanomas. It causes constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in these tumors leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) induces apoptosis in melanoma cells which has been used as the basis for molecular targeted therapy of melanoma. Small-molecule compounds such as Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and other selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors specifically bind BRAF(V600E), and have been shown to cause dramatic, but transient, tumor regression in vivo. The precise mechanisms of cell death following BRAF inhibition remain obscure; the literature posits a diversity of ways in which apoptosis is induced. However, it is unclear whether a single but complex network is involved or whether mechanisms differ from one cell type to the next. This is an important issue because use of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma is seriously challenged by the absence of durable responses; even in initially responsive patients tumors usually re-emerge within months and are observed to be drug resistant. An important challenge is thus to understand determinants of initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition beyond V600E mutation and to determine which of these are involved in resistance.Using high throughput measurement of the abundance and state of modification of multiple proteins representing diverse signaling pathways at the basal level and over time in multiple melanoma cell lines exposed to different doses of BRAF inhibitors and data-driven mathematical modeling, we determine how the complex dynamics of signaling pathways are controlled in different cell lines and how drugs targeting BRAF(V600E) alter this signaling. Our analysis shows that the basal level of some proteins such as PTEN, pERK, pS6, pAkt, and -catenin vary up to 100-fold among different lines prior drug treatment. Further, these cell lines show different degrees of oncogene addiction and remarkable diversity with respect to the level of ERK inhibition and apoptosis as well as activation or inhibition of other signaling cascades following BRAF inhibition. We use mathematical modeling to relate basal levels of signaling proteins and their dynamics following BRAF inhibition to pharmacological descriptors of sensitivity to multiple BRAF drugs. Thus, we identify key signaling nodes within the signaling networks of the melanoma cells which determine the differential phenotypic consequences of BRAF inhibition. This approach will be critical for predicting and ultimately improving drug sensitivity in resistant tumors (e.g. via co-treatment strategies).']",

In this study, we evaluated the ability of HGF / MET signaling to attenuate the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the context of V600E BRAF and NRAS mutant cell lines.

Detailed analysis of G361 and SKMEL5 cells revealed that HGF was also capable of rescuing the cells from the effects of PD0325901. This HGF-mediated rescue was attenuated by treatment with combinations of vemurafenib + compound A or PD0325901 + compound A. Mechanistic cell cycle analysis of the HGF-mediated rescue of vemurafenib in G361 cells revealed an increase in proliferating cells and a reduction in growth arrested cells, whereas rescue of PD0325901 treatment occurred through a reduction in the percentage of dead or dying cells.

All patients were commercially genotyped for BRAF V600E.  SNaPshot assays were used to identify NRAS Q61 mutations in BRAF-WT tumors.  Each patient had at least 3 serially collected plasma samples including one drawn prior to treatment, one or more after treatment began and one upon signs of disease progression. ddPCR was used to measure mutant copies/ml of BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/L/R DNA in plasma samples.  Results', '  Among 45 patients, 28 patients had BRAF and 8 patients had NRAS tumor mutations. We extracted DNA from 151 plasma samples. Our preliminary results include analysis of 50 plasma samples from 10 BRAF-mutant and 5 NRAS-mutant patients.  All BRAF V600E patients received BRAF inhibitor therapy and had partial responses followed by disease progression.  Levels of circulating V600E DNA decreased with clinical response and/or increased with disease progression in 8/10 patients.  In 3 patients with progressing disease, plasma samples drawn in-between imaging visits showed increasing BRAF mutant copies/ml up to 2 months prior to clinical scans.  Among NRAS mutant patients, all were treated with Ipilimumab', ' 3 patients progressed, 1 had a near complete response, and 1 progressed and was then treated with Nivolumab.  Levels of circulating Q61 DNA rose with disease progression and/or fell with clinical response in 5/5 immunotherapy treated patients.    Conclusions', '  Our results indicate that ddPCR is able to measure clinically meaningful changes in the levels of BRAF and NRAS mutant copies/ml in the plasma of stage IV melanoma patients.  This analytical platform has the potential for monitoring disease progression and patient response to both targeted and immune-based therapies, and may be a useful adjunct to imaging studies.']",

This oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway and results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. BRAF V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). However, it is challenging to identify patients with this mutation. Currently, the gold standard is sequencing of the tumor DNA, but this method is not practical for routine practice. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a relatively easy diagnostic tool to detect proteins in paraffin-embedded tissues. The major goal of this study was to compare detection of BRAF V600E by sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody. This clone is mutation specific and can distinguish the V600E mutation in BRAF from the wild type BRAF protein.Methods', \" Tissues from sixty-nine patients with colon cancer (N=40) and thyroid cancer (N=29) were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation. Genomic DNA was extracted from 20 m tissue sections and analyzed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing. Primers were designed to cover the BRAF coding sequences at mutation site and a few nucleotides in the intron on both ends (BRAF-ex15F-TGCTTGCTCTGATAGGAAAATG; BRAF-ex15R-AGCATCTCAGGGCCAAAAAT). Both forward and reverse strands were sequenced on an Applied Biosystem's 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Immunohistochemical staining using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody was done on VENTANA BenchMark XT platform with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit.Results\", ' All cases (22/22, 100%) that were negative for BRAF V600E mutation by IHC were confirmed to be BRAF V600E negative by sequencing. Out of 47 cases staining positive for BRAF V600E (VE1) 43 cases were confirmed by sequencing. Of the four discordant cases, one case was weakly positive by IHC (score 1), two cases that were negative by sequencing showed stronger BRAF V600E (VE1) staining (score 2) and one case contained a different mutation at codon 600 (V600K). Overall, there was high concordance between IHC and DNA sequencing. Using the sequencing as the reference standard, negative predictive value was 100%, positive predictive value was 91% with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85%. Overall percentage agreement across all cases was 94% (65/69 cases). Next-generation sequencing will be used to evaluate discordant cases for BRAF V600 mutation status.Conclusion', ' Detection of the BRAF V600E mutation is emerging as an important biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive potential.

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutations occur in 50% of melanoma, 45% of papillary thyroid cancer and 10% of colon cancer. BRAF inhibitors have elicited significant clinical response in melanomas but acquired resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Therefore, consideration of new treatment strategies to block activity of mutant BRAF and deter therapeutic resistance is warranted. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability of hundreds of client proteins, including the RAF family of kinases, and has emerged as a highly relevant anticancer target. Ganetespib is a second generation, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. To investigate the potential for ganetespib in the treatment of melanoma we evaluated its preclinical activity as monotherapy, and in combination with targeted agents, in cells sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Ganetespib displayed potent anticancer activity in a large panel of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma, thyroid and colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 between 4 and 40 nM. Further analysis showed that ganetespib disrupted oncogenic signaling by inducing the destabilization of mutant BRAF and subsequent inactivation of MEK and ERK. Levels of wild-type BRAF were only slightly reduced in response to ganetespib treatment, implying that the stability of activated BRAF is more reliant on HSP90 and that ganetespib may selectively deplete oncogenic forms of BRAF. Notably, ganetespib treatment also led to depletion of CRAF, which is implicated in driving therapeutic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In an effort to maximize antitumor activity, we combined low levels of ganetespib with BRAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and observed increased cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatment. Both the BRAF and MEK inhibitors were cytostatic on their own, which may be due to continued PI3K/mTOR signaling. We subsequently assayed the combination of ganetespib with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and observed synergistic increases in cell death. Importantly, ganetespib was capable of blocking the feedback activation on MAPKK induced by a MEK inhibitor as well as the activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. To determine if these results translated in vivo, similar combinations were performed in BRAF mutant human melanoma xenografts. Co-administration of ganetespib with either a BRAF or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent compared to monotherapy. Finally, we show that ganetespib effectively blocked MAPK signaling and killed RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (IC50 = 4 nM), which are resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the overexpression of COT. In conclusion, targeting HSP90 with ganetespib represents a promising approach for the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven cancers and may be especially relevant in the context of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.']",

We present a comprehensive comparison of three detection methods including immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a mutation specific monoclonal antibody (VE1), Sanger sequencing and a probe-based high resolution melting assay, in melanoma and colorectal cancer specimens. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from fresh frozen tissue from 389 liver metastases and 6 primary tumors from 141 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients as well as gDNA from 125 tumors from 75 malignant melanoma (MM) patients was available. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue from 285 of the CRC metastases from 123 patients were made. BRAF, exon 15 was amplified using the DyNazyme EXT polymerase system and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. IHC staining with the BRAF-VE1 antibody was performed on a Ventana BenchMark XT immunostainer. The intensity of staining was graded as 0 (no visible staining), grade 1 (weak diffuse background staining), 2 (moderate diffuse and granular) and 3 (strong granular staining). Grade 2 or 3 was regarded as positive. For high resolution melting analysis of V600-status, we used the LigthMix Kit BRAF V600E/K on a LightCycler 480 instrument.To establish the detection limits for the DNA-based methods used in this comparison, we analyzed a dilution series containing a ratio of 1', '1- 1', '107 BRAF V600E mutated DNA in BRAF wild-type DNA. We found the detection limit for the LightMix assay to be 1', '1000 mutated alleles while it was 1', '10 for Sanger sequencing. Among 125 samples from 75 MM patients, we found 60 samples from 31 patients to be positive for BRAF mutations by Sanger sequencing. By the LigthMix assay, we found 75 mutated samples from 37 patients. Among 395 samples form 141 mCRC patients, we found 22 samples from 7 patients to be BRAF V600E mutated by Sanger sequencing. 127 tumors from 42 of these patients were analyzed by the LigthMix assay and the BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 24 samples from the same 7 patients. IHC was performed on TMAs including tissue from 285 metastases from 123 of the mCRC patients. By this method 25 samples from 15 patients were found to be BRAF V600E mutated. These 15 patients included 5 of the 7 patients identified by DNA-based mutation analyses. Thus 8 patients revealing no mutation by either of the DNA-based methods showed positive immunostaining. Two patients found to carry the mutation by sequencing and melting point analysis were not identified by IHC.Our data show differences in sensitivity and specificity between the three methods. Compared to the LigthMix, assay Sanger sequencing showed inferior sensitivity. Further, we observed a large discrepancy between IHC and the two DNA-based methods, indicating IHC with the current antibody not to be recommendable for clinical tests alone.']",

Methods', ' BRAF V600 mutant mm patients (pts) treated with MAPKi (BRAFi +/- MEKi) between July/2009 and July/2013 were selected. Demographics, clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes were examined. Pre-treatment FFPE tumors underwent RNA expression profiling (795-gene nanostring panel) and DNA sequencing (239 gene NGS panel). Molecular results were validated using an independent cohort from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results', ' 95 mm pts were included (78 V600E, 17 V600K/R), with median (med) follow-up of 18.4 months (mo). 74 (78%) had BRAFi, 21 (22%) had BRAF/MEKi. At MAPKi start, there were no differences between subgroups regarding age, gender, ECOG, AJCC stage or LDH level. V600K/R pts had a trend to less tumour regression by RECIST (med 30% vs 51%, p = 0.08) and shorter PFS (med 5.1 vs 7.1mo, p = 0.08) than V600E, with no difference in OS (20.8mo vs 17.9mo, p = 0.64). V600K/R had lower expression of the MAPK-pathway feedback regulator DUSP6 and glycosyltransferase GCNT1, compared to V600E (p < 0.05).

V600K/R had a higher proportion of mutations in PIK3CA and several tumour suppressor genes (FBXW7, NF2, RB1 and SMAD4), with only FBXW7 confirmed using TCGA data. Conclusions', ' V600K/R mm has inferior response and shorter survival with MAPKi than V600E, potentially due to less reliance on MAPK pathway activation (lower DUSP6 expression) and greater use of alternative drivers of oncogenesis (higher mutational load, particularly in tumor suppressor genes).

        "Background":"['Inherent and acquired resistance of melanomas carrying active mutations in BRAF to mutant BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) remains a major obstacle for curative treatment of the disease. Since both BRAFi and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) kill sensitive melanoma cells by activating the BH3-only protein Bim, we examined whether they cooperate in killing of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. We show here that co-treatment with the HDACi SAHA and the BRAFi PLX4720 synergistically kills BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells in vitro, and that the combination of SAHA and the clinically available BRAFi vemurafenib cooperatively inhibits melanoma growth in vivo. Although SAHA plus PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, the latter did not appear to be indispensable for induction of cell death. Likewise, PLX4720 alone kills sensitive melanoma cells in a caspase-independent manner. Similar to caspases, Bim seemed dispensable for synergistic killing by SAHA and PLX4720. The mechanism by which co-treatment with HDACi and BRAFi kills BRAFV600E melanoma cells remains to be elucidated, but we have found that this is not mediated by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which is essential for induction of programmed necrosis. Regardless, our results suggest that combinations of HDACi and BRAFi may have therapeutic advantages, in that the conventional caspase-dependent, mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic machinery is often suppressed in melanoma cells.']",

The V600E BRAF mutant does not depend on RAS-dependent dimerization and is not susceptible to feedback inhibition of RAS. In V600E BRAF melanomas, ERK pathway output and the expression of ERK genes such as DUSP6 and members of the SPROUTY family are markedly elevated. In these tumors, RTK signaling and RAS activation are actively suppressed. In the context of elevated DUSP6, RAF inhibitors rapidly inhibit ERK phosphorylation and output. This relieves the feedback inhibition of various RTKs and induces RAS activity and the formation of activated wild type RAF dimers that are insensitive to RAF-inhibitors. This results in a rebound in ERK phosphorylation and output that is sensitive to MEK, but not RAF inhibitors and suggests that the latter cannot maximally inhibit ERK signaling in these tumors. In support of this idea, combined treatment with MEK and RAF inhibitors reduces ERK output and the growth of V600E BRAF melanoma xenografts to a greater degree than either alone.']",

The discovery of constitutive activation of the BRAF kinase caused by activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutation in most melanoma patients led to the discovery of the first potent BRAF(V600E) signaling inhibitor, vemurafenib. Vemurafenib was effective in treating advanced melanoma patients and was proposed for the treatment of other BRAF(V600E) mutant cancers as well. Unfortunately, the success of vemurafenib was hampered by the rapid development of acquired resistance in different types of BRAF(V600E) mutant cancer cells. It becomes important to identify and evaluate all of the potential mechanisms of cellular resistance to vemurafenib. In this study, we characterized the interactions of vemurafenib with three major ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2. We found that vemurafenib stimulated the ATPase activity and potently inhibited drug efflux mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2. Vemurafenib also restored drug sensitivity in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Moreover, we revealed that in the presence of functional ABCG2, BRAF kinase inhibition by vemurafenib is reduced in BRAF(V600E) mutant A375 cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that ABCG2 confers resistance to vemurafenib in A375 cells, suggesting involvement of this transporter in acquired resistance to vemurafenib.

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND.- Oncogenic BRAF(V600E) mutations, found in >50 % of melanomas, promote melanoma cell proliferation by constitutively activating mitogen-activated Mek1/2 kinases and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2). This pathway can further activate downstream the p90- ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK). OBJECTIVES.- Since BRAF mutations increase melanoma progression which could lead to metabolic stress when oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients are limiting within poorly vascularized regions, we investigated whether hypoxia and metabolic stress can differentially influence the survival of human melanoma cells harbouring either wt or oncogenic BRAF. EXPERIMENTAL. human melanoma cells with unequal BRAF status were exposed to glucose and/or glutamine limitations under normoxia or hypoxia. Relative metabolic activity was fluorometrically quantitated by the cellular conversion of resazurin to resorufin. Differential cell survival was assesed by crystal violet staining. Mechanisms influencing the response to metabolic stress were studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. the metabolic activity and survival of melanoma cells harbouring oncogenic BRAF was preferentially decreased under hypoxia at sub-physiological glucose, compared to wt BRAF melanoma cells. Addition of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine or pyruvate enhanced the metabolic activity and survival of wt BRAF cells, but these were much less effective when added to BRAF (V600E) mutant cells, implying a greater oxidative stress induced by low oxygen and glucose in them. Susceptibility to metabolic stress under hypoxia and low glucose in BRAF (V600E) mutant cells, correlated with persistent (p90RSK) activation but lower GLUT-1 and MnSOD expression. In contrast, wt BRAF melanoma cells resistant to metabolic stress reciprocally showed higher GLUT-1 and MnSOD expression, but negligible p90RSK activation. CONCLUSION.- Although mutations in BRAF can drive acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors, our results suggest that restricting glucose consumption in hypoxic melanomas harbouring mutant BRAF with persistent phosphorylation of the p90-ribosomal S6 kinase, may contribute to their preferential killing.']",

        "Background":"['Epigenetic changes in cancer are thought to contribute to regulation of invasion and metastasis. To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma with the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enriched by LM-PCR) assay and compared it to melanocyte controls. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, is in clinical trials for breast and other cancers, and these data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.']",

Frequent mutations on BRAF gene have been detected in various types of human cancer, including malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, ovarian cancer and hairy cell leukemia. Among all, a single point 1799T>A (V600E) transversion, the most common mutation on BRAF, results in increased kinase activity. It serves as a driver mutation in several types of cancer and confers increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, detecting the BRAF V600E mutation may offer valuable information for cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Here we report a rapid, highly sensitive method for the detection of BRAF V600 mutation using a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) clamp technology associated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Due to the feature of enhanced affinity for hybridization template, BNA clamp is able to selectively block PCR reactions on the perfect match DNA sequence, while leaves the mismatch template unaffected. In this study several BNA clamps that bind to BRAF V600 wild-type (WT) template was designed, synthesized, and characterized. As compared to DNA clamp counterparts, these BNA clamps increased Tm values for the BRAF V600 WT by greater than 30C. In addition, BNA clamps efficiently distinguished BRAF WT (perfect match) from V600E (mismatch) templates (deltaTm >12C). In qPCR assays BNA clamps could suppress amplification of WT by >1,000-fold, while had little or no effects on the V600E mutant. Such BNA clamps allowed us to detect 1.0% or lower levels for the BRAF V600E mutant in a wild-type background. These results indicate that BNA clamp-based qPCR technology offers a new tool for rapid, sensitive detection of BRAF V600E mutation.

Intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF V600E targeted therapies (BRAFi) in metastatic melanoma patients further underscores the need for global profiling of melanoma circuitry at the functional level. Therefore, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomics was carried out to decipher steady state differences in global signaling mechanisms in nave and BRAFi resistant melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations.Four cell lines (A375, 1205Lu, WM164 and WM793) were selected to evaluate different molecular backgrounds of BRAF mutation based on their PTEN status (either WT or null). For each cell type, both the nave and BRAFi resistant lines were analyzed via ABPP as well as chemical labeling with tandem mass tags (TMT) prior to discovery phosphoproteomics. While the ABPP approach mined for kinases, phosphoproteomics identified STY phosphorylated peptides providing information on signaling via kinase substrates. LC-MS/MS discovery proteomics (RSLC and Q Exactive, Thermo) identified and relatively quantified all peptides observed in ABPP and TMT phosphoproteomics experiments. MaxQuant was used for data evaluation; preliminary statistical analyses were performed in Perseus to select significant differences for pathway mapping (GeneGO, Metacore) and follow up experiments using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition. Adaptive responses to combination treatment were also explored using the SysQuant workflow for quantitative expression analysis and phosphoproteomics. These experiments served as a basis for comparison for a pilot project of 12 metastatic tumors from BRAF mutant melanoma patients selected for comparison of good and poor survival outcomes.ABPP measurements on different cell line models (A375, 1205Lu, WM793 and WM164) reveal significant differences in ATP uptake of proteins in the resistant cell line model compared to its nave counterpart. For example, in the 1205Lu cell line several proteins including EGFR, p38alpha, DNA-PK formed an interconnected pathway. Overall we identified between 2,000-2,800 proteins in each cell line with 150 kinases. Isobaric labeling coupled to phosphoproteomics identified 1,600 quantifiable proteins with 4,000 phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomics revealed concomitant increase in phosphorylation levels of the substrates acted upon by kinases showing higher ATP uptake in ABPP measurements. For example, in 1205Lu BRAFi resistant cells, CDK1, CDK2 and DNA-PK showed higher ATP uptake and their substrates SSK1, DPYSL3, and vimentin showed higher phosphorylation levels.The complementary nature of the two functional proteomics approaches provided holistic overview of signalling network in melanoma and enabled selection of targets for follow-up studies.']",

Combination treatment with MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 results in a highly significant enhancement of efficacy across all twenty lines tested.

Interestingly, we find that vemurafenib induced increased FDG uptake in cells harboring RAS mutations, as well as in tumors that have acquired vemurafenib drug resistance. Hexokinase II, CRAF, KSR and p-MEK protein levels in sensitive and drug resistant tumors were all associated with decreased measurements of FDG uptake in vivo.

        "Background":"['Autophagy is a homeostatic process of cellular self-digestion and is an adaptive therapy resistance mechanism in cancer. Emerging studies indicate that autophagy is involved in secretion through non-classical mechanisms. It is not well understood, however, how this secretory function modifies the molecular composition of the tumor secretome, which plays an important role in tumor growth and tumor immune responses. In this work, we focused on the role of both basal and BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-induced autophagy in melanoma cells harboring BRAF V600E, a missense mutation observed in 60% of melanoma tumors. Using quantitative proteomics we previously showed that a small number of proteins were differentially secreted by low and high autophagy melanoma cells grown in three-dimensional culture. Secreted proteins associated with high autophagy included IL-1, IL-8, LIF, FAM3C, and DKK3, which have known roles in tumorigenesis. Further, serum collected from untreated metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from low autophagy patients. In the current study, melanoma cells with high autophagy and the BRAF V600E mutation (1205Lu) were treated with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), PLX4720+HCQ, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The increase in autophagic flux upon the addition of PLX4720 or rapamycin was confirmed by western blotting and tandem fluorescently tagged LC3 (mCherry-eGFP-LC3). Secretomes were compared using quantitative proteomics, which resulted in identification of 1154 proteins with a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis showed that secretomes from cells treated with the autophagy inducers rapamycin or PLX4720 correlated more closely with each other than those treated with HCQ either alone or in combination. A panel of proteins involved in extracellular matrix modification, cell-cell adhesion, and inflammation (including FAM3C and LIF) significantly increased in the supernatants of cells treated with PLX4720 or rapamycin and decreased in supernatants from cells treated with HCQ or HCQ+PLX4720. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an active role in modifying the molecular composition of the tumor secretome. Proteins specifically shed in response to BRAF inhibitors and/or autophagy inhibition may have utility in the clinic for diagnostic and pharmacodynamic applications.']",

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples.

Up-regulation of growth factor receptor such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that up-regulation of PDGFR, a growth factor receptor which markedly differs in its functional properties from its family member PDGFR, causes BRAF-I resistance in vitro and in vivo. PDGFR inhibition by PDGFR-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNAs) and by clinically available PDGFR inhibitors (sunitinib, imatinib and crenolanib) restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFR up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFR inhibition, Shh inhibition by the novel small molecule LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. These effects are mediated by PDGFR down-regulation and by inhibition of ERK and AKT activation. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFR up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression.

While the response rate is high, resistance is inevitable. The response to salvage therapy is poor. While the MEK inhibitor may be able to enhance anti-tumor efficacy of vemurafenib, but patients eventually relapse. Hence, there is an urgent need for second line treatment for melanoma patients who fail vemurafenib treatment.In this study, we discovered that BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to arginine deprivation. Arginine deprivation was achieved using arginine degrading enzyme (pegylated arginine deiminase, ADI-PEG20, kindly provided by Polaris). ADI-PEG20 has been shown to induce autophagy in primary melanoma culture derived from patients whose tumors do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). Apoptosis does occur when these cells are exposed longer (5-7 days) and at higher doses. Inducible ASS expression upon arginine deprivation also impedes the antitumor effect of ADI-PEG20. We have found that BR cells from MEL-1220 (derived from patient with V600E and ASS (-)), A375, and A2058 cells (inducible ASS) cultured in the presence of vemurafenib at IC50 over 20 weeks had non-inducible ASS expression. MTT and Annexin V/PI analyses showed that ADI-PEG20 induced 3-6 fold increase in apoptosis and growth inhibition in BR cells compared to parental cells following 3-day incubation. These results were further confirmed by increased active (cleaved) form of caspase-3 as detected by western blotting after the addition of ADI-PEG20. The mouse xenograft model also verified that ADI-PEG20 abolished tumor growth of A2058BR cells while only retardation of growth seen in A2058 cells (the reduction rate of tumor volume is 92% vs. 63%). We found that two vital autophagic proteins (Beclin1 and ATG5) decreased in resistant cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20, which might explain the inability to undergo autophagy upon arginine deprivation as a survival mechanism and re-directing the cells toward apoptosis. The other mechanism leading to non-inducible ASS expression is c-Myc degradation. It has been proven that c-myc is a positive regulator in ASS transcription, and c-Myc stability is governed by ubiquitination. By immunoprecipitation assay, we found that BR cells had lower levels of deubiquitinating enzyme USP28, and hence cannot prevent c-Myc from ubiquitin-dependent prosteasomal degradation. Therefore, our results demonstrated that BRAF inhibitor resistance suppresses c-Myc-mediated ASS transcription and in turn increases sensitivity to ADI-PEG20.In conclusion, ADI-PEG20 appears to be a good candidate for targeted therapy for melanoma patients who have tumor recurrence or disease progression after vemurafenib treatment.

Longitudinal analysis in 25 (74%) patients (treated with', ' BRAFi, n = 23; MEKi, n = 1; none, n = 1) showed that changes in BRAF V600E cfDNA amounts correlated with percent changes in target lesions on imaging (r = 0.68, p < 0.001). Patients with decreased BRAF V600E cfDNA (n = 16) compared to others (n = 8) had a trend to a longer median time-to-treatment failure (8.8 months, 95% CI 8.1-9.5 vs. 2.2 months, 95% CI 0.0-5.1; p = 0.07) on BRAF or MEK therapy. Moreover, 22 (65%) patients had a low frequency KRAS G12/13 mutation (median 3.4 copies/105 genome equivalents) in urine cfDNA that was previously undetected in tumor by CLIA, except in one case. 9 of 9 patients with urine examined at the time of progression had detectable cfDNA KRAS G12/13. Re-analysis of the retrieved archival tumor tissues from 8 patients found a previously undetected low frequency (1.3%) KRASmutation in one sample by ddPCR.  Conclusions', '  Our results suggest that 65% of patients with advanced cancers and BRAF mutation in tumor tissue have low frequency KRAS G12/13 mutations in urine cfDNA undetected in tumor samples by standard CLIA technologies.

Methods', '  Samples (6 ml) of peripheral blood were drawn from patients with colorectal (CRC, n= 19) and thyroid (n= 1) cancers and melanoma (n= 8). CRC tumors were KRAS wild-type (n= 3) or carried the BRAF V600E (n= 6), KRAS G12D (n= 9) and G12V (n= 4) mutations. All melanomas and the thyroid cancer carried the BRAF V600E mutation. DNA was extracted from plasma with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit to recover DNA fragments of 1000 bp. PCR amplification was carried out with a QX100 ddPCR System (Bio-Rad) on 20 L-samples containing cftDNA and TaqMan probes for BRAF V600E (1799T>A), KRAS G12D (35G>A) and G12V (35G>T) labeled with FAM/VIC.

An activating mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine protein kinase, BRAF V600E occurs in a proportion of malignant melanomas, and colorectal, thyroid, and other cancers. In hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), BRAF V600E is nearly always present, suggesting oncogene dependence. Methods', ' Here, we present a patient with HCL who was refractory to three lines of purine analogue-based treatment. The BRAF V600E mutation was demonstrated. After intensive counseling, the patient and his family provided written consent for vemurafenib (mutant BRAF-specific inhibitor) treatment. Results', ' Before vemurafenib treatment, the patient had subtotal bone marrow infiltration and massive splenomegaly (24.8 x 8.3 cm) leading to severe cytopenia (leukocytes 680/l, hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl, platelets 36.000/l). Treatment with vemurafenib was started with 240 mg twice daily and was slowly escalated to 1920 mg/d.  Within two days of treatment, the spleen softened and decreased in size. Serum CD25 (sCD25) level fell rapidly from 24.800 U/ml to normal levels (<900), and platelets, hemoglobin, and leukocyte counts rose. After 16 days of vemurafenib treatment, the spleen size had shrunk to 14 x 5 cm. By day 28 of treatment (on 720 mg/d), platelet counts and sCD25 levels had normalized. Bone marrow infiltration by HCL had decreased from 70% to 20% on day 16 and complete remission was achieved on day 35. We terminated treatment on day 57 when there was no evidence of any circulating hairy cells by immunophenotyping. Conclusions', ' The striking therapeutic activity of vemurafenib in our patient provides the first in vivo evidence to substantiate the BRAF V600E allele as a driver and validates mutant BRAF as a therapeutic target in HCL. Proof of principle for a molecularly targeted therapy of HCL adds to the recent success of targeting oncogenic kinases in oncogene addicted malignancies. Given the rarity of HCL, introducing new therapeutic modalities may be challenging.

        "Background":"['BRAF mutations, particularly the somatic hot spot BRAF V600E mutation, were discovered as major oncogenic mutations in many cancer types. It was shown that BRAF V600E is a potent oncogene that activates the MAPK pathway and functions as a BRaf monomer. BRaf selective inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which are effective in inhibiting the kinase activity of BRaf monomer, have demonstrated robust anti-tumor activities in BRAF mutant xenograft models and significant clinical benefit among BRAF mutant melanoma patients. In this study, we have identified and characterized novel BRaf aberrant variants, which have in-frame deletions within or adjacent to the L485-P490 region in patient samples and/or cell lines of lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. Tumor cells with these endogenous BRaf deletions are resistant to BRaf monomer inhibitor vemurafenib based on inhibition of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression. However, these cells are sensitive to LY3009120, a pan Raf and Raf dimer inhibitor. Further analysis using siRNA showed that the MEK-ERK activity in these cells is mainly dependent on BRaf, not CRaf or ARaf. Ectopical expression of the L485-P490 deleted BRaf in mouse NIH3T3 cells is able to transform the cells and form colonies comparable to BRaf V600E mutation in three-dimensional soft agar growth. More importantly, the Raf dimer disrupting mutation BRafR509H abolished the transforming activity of the L485-P490 deleted BRaf, suggesting that this BRaf deletion functions as a dimer. Further, ectopical expression of the L485-P490 deleted BRaf promotes primarily BRaf homodimerization as revealed by proximity ligation assays (PLA). It was also confirmed by PLA that BRaf homodimer is the dominant form of Raf dimers in tumor cells harboring these BRaf deletions. In lung and pancreatic tumor xenograft models developed with tumor cells with these BRaf deletions, LY3009120 treatment demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition and regression, whereas vemurafenib treatment showed no in vivo activity.

        "Background":"['BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) have shown remarkable clinical activity in advanced metastatic melanomas with mutant BRAF(V600E). However, there is considerable variability in both the extent and the duration of patient responses, and acquired resistance invariably emerges. To date, a number of mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been identified, most of which reactivate ERK signaling while simultaneously engaging parallel survival pathways. However, these mechanisms account for only a fraction of progressed melanoma and do not explain the large variability of initial response rates and time to progression of melanoma patients subjected to these therapies. We hypothesize that in addition to genetic events, non-genetic alterations such as microRNA changes are critical in mediating time to progression in melanoma tumors treated with BRAF inhibitors. In order to identify microRNAs involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance we performed a functional screen approach utilizing a novel lentiviral-based library of microRNA decoys. These constructs are better able to stably suppress endogenous microRNA activity than the hairpin RNAs traditionally used. This pooled parallel loss-of-microRNA function analysis in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells showed enrichment and loss of specific decoys after drug treatment, corresponding to microRNAs that may enhance or compromise the response, respectively. MicroRNA decoys that are positively or negatively selected during drug treatment are being validated using single decoy constructs for their ability to modulate BRAFi response. MicroRNA target genes will be determined by a combination of microarray analysis, in silico predictive algorithms, and 3UTR-luciferase reporter assay. MicroRNAs and target genes are being validated on human samples from treated patients. Those potentially involved in processes/pathways known to influence drug resistance (i.e. survival genes) will be examined for their ability to mimic or counteract microRNA effects in BRAFi resistance when silenced or overexpressed, respectively. Identification of novel modulators of drug resistance provides the opportunity to design rational combinatorial approaches that will enhance and prolong the effect of these therapies, with the ultimate goal of achieving cures.']",

To deliver on the promise shown by the new generation of drugs it will be necessary to detect specific mutations in patients so they can be matched with the right drug. To this end, we have used an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine to sequence the six most commonly mutated codons in melanoma (BRAF 600, NRAS 12 and 13, NRAS 61, KIT 576, and KIT 642) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue of late stage melanoma patients.

To facilitate further biomarker identification predictive of therapy response, CTCs isolated from stage IV patients undergoing immunotherapy were cultured to develop spheres and eventually primary cell lines, and further analyzed by deep RNA sequencing. This study developed a unique platform to analyze patient CTCs for melanoma biomarkers, and provides a potential platform to identify novel CTC-derived melanoma biomarkers indicative of multimodality treatment efficacy.']",

These cells display a reversible resistance phenotype. Upon initial treatment of the drug combination, upregulation of pSTAT3 is observed but the cells lose dependency on the pSTAT3 pathway upon prolonged drug treatment. A pharmacological synthetic lethal screen was performed and the FGFR inhibitor class re-sensitizes the cells to BRAF and MEK inhibition through inhibitions of pERK. The dual resistant cells also displayed hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Interrogation of patient samples confirmed these findings.

As the first personalized treatment for metastatic melanoma to show a survival benefit, vemurafenib is a major breakthrough in the field. Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months. Evaluation of the biomarker and phenotypic correlates of response are difficult to determine as paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies generally only represent one on-treatment time point when available. A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre recombinase is under control of the tyrosinase promoter, ensuring that recombination is limited to melanocytes. The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse. The use of this mouse model allows for more thorough evaluation of the time course and phenotype of BRAF-inhibitor response in melanoma in an immunocompetent host. Specific studies include evaluation of the effect of PLX4720 on the expression, localization, and activation of proteins involved with growth arrest, apoptosis, and glucose uptake.']",

        "Background":"['Solid tumor trials with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) have been largely disappointing. We recently characterized a romidepsin-resistant T-cell lymphoma cell line that was found to have activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, leading to subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, suggesting that activation of this pathway may also confer resistance to romidepsin and other HDIs. The V600E BRAF mutation has been found in approximately 60% of melanomas and approximately 15% of colon cancers and leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. We thus hypothesized that combined treatment with romidepsin and BRAF or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors may be effective in cancers that harbor the V600E BRAF mutation. To more closely simulate clinical administration of romidepsin, 11 V600E BRAF mutant cell lines (8 melanomas and 3 colorectal cancers) were exposed to 25 ng/ml romidepsin for 6 h after which romidepsin was removed, cells were incubated in fresh medium for an additional 42 h and subsequently apoptosis was measured by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Of the 11 cell lines, 10 exhibited significantly higher annexin staining after short-term romidepsin treatment (control 7.1%  3.8% vs. treated 34.7%  17.8%, p<0.001). Cells were subsequently treated with medium containing 25 ng/ml romidepsin with 250 nM of the MEK inhibitors AZD6244 (selumetinib) and PD0325901 or 1 M of the mutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib) for 6 h, after which the cells were incubated an additional 42 h in medium containing the inhibitors alone. Combined treatment with romidepsin and AZD6244 resulted in a significantly higher percent of annexin positive cells (p<0.05) in 9 of the 11 BRAF mutant cell lines examined. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the MAPK pathway at the concentrations used and that apoptosis was associated with increased expression of Bim, as well as increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage.

In more than 90% of the cases, these mutations are located in the BRAF V600 codon (V600E and V600K). Targeted therapies like vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown objective response rates in up to half of metastatic melanomas harboring these BRAF V600 mutations. Tumor mutation status is usually assessed starting from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue shavings. Typically, the test involves shipment of the paraffin block from the local pathology lab to a specialized molecular lab, where several steps need to be performed.MethodsThe Biocartis molecular diagnostics (MDx) prototype platform is a novel, random access, sample-in result-out automated qPCR system. It uses a disposable cartridge which can simultaneously detect and quantify up to 30 molecular markers from a wide range of solid and liquid sample types, including blood, feces, and sputum. For FFPE-based assays, a single curl or shaving is directly placed into the cartridge. The complete process time for sample preparation, PCR and reporting is less than 90 min, with <2 minutes hands-on time. We hereby present a concordance study of the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay (which detects BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R, V600E2, V600D and V600M) with the Roche cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Cobas). Sixty-four FFPE samples from melanoma and other tumors, with varying amounts of melanin, % tumor, and % BRAF V600 mutated tumor cells were randomly selected and tested. Both the Biocartis MDx prototype platform and the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay were used for research use only purposes. Deep sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina) with over 5,000-fold coverage and sensitivity of 1% of minority species for each sample.ResultsOne sample was not eligible for Cobas testing because of low tumor content. Three other samples failed on both platforms. For the remaining 60 samples, results on the Biocartis MDx platform and Cobas were concordant in 58 (96.7%) samples (44 BRAF V600 WT and 14 BRAF V600 mutant samples, of which 36 samples were randomly selected and confirmed by deep sequencing). In 2 (3.3%) samples, no BRAF V600 mutation was detected by Cobas, while a BRAF V600 mutation was detected by both the Biocartis MDx platform and by deep sequencing. Both were melanoma samples (one of which was highly pigmented), excised in 1993 and 2005, and contained 4.6% V600E and 5.6% V600K (as determined by deep sequencing), respectively.ConclusionsThe new MDx platform is a fast and reliable method for BRAF V600 mutation testing directly on FFPE tumor shavings with superior analytical sensitivity, ease of use, and turnaround time compared to existing diagnostic tests. The BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay provided excellent concordance with both Cobas (96.7%) and deep sequencing (100%).']",

This substitution, seen in ninety percent of the BRAF cases, leads to constitutive activation of the kinase, and the downstream MEK-ERK pathway. Appropriately, several drugs have been designed to inhibit BRAF, with a broad range of outcomes in clinical trials. Unfortunately, all patients, including those showing complete responses, develop resistance to single agent therapy. Our goal is to come up with effective drug combinations that would delay, or even prevent, the cancer from becoming resistant to treatment.We used a panel of 43 melanoma lines, comprising of 28 BRAF mutants, 12 NRAS mutants and 3 lines that were wild type for these two genes. Besides BRAF and NRAS, we have the mutational status of 65 other commonly mutated cancer genes for all the lines. We assembled a set of 25 drugs targeting a wide range of proteins, including PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, the apoptosis machinery, as well as some epigenetic modulators.

In particular, one of the three isoforms of RAF, BRAF, presents activating somatic mutations in 60% of melanomas, 50% of thyroid cancers, 10% of colon and 20% ovarian carcinomas. The most common BRAF mutation, substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 600 within the activation segment of the kinase domain, accounts for 90% of mutated BRAF cases, and results in elevated kinase activity with consequent enhanced promotion of cell survival and proliferation. BRAF selective inhibitors as vemurafenib and dabrafenib have recently shown excellent results in patients with advanced melanoma expressing BRAF V600E mutant form. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo properties of a novel potent and selective BRAF inhibitor belonging to the arylthiazole class of compounds. This, NMS-P285, is a potent inhibitor of both wild-type and mutated BRAF, with no cross-reactivity in a panel of 61 kinases.

        "Background":"['Epigenetic changes in cancer are thought to contribute to regulation of invasion and metastasis. To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions showed demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by IHC on primary tumors and by qPCR and Western blotting in BRAF mutant and WT cell lines. CSF1R can be aberrantly expressed via an upstream LTR element in Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After analyzing our patient samples and the cell lines, we have found this aberrant transcript may be the dominant form in melanoma as well. Expression of one of its ligands IL34 was also shown in the cell lines by both ELISA and qPCR pointing to a potential autocrine regulatory loop. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in 2D and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma. Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and the rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. We are suggesting a role for CSF1R in this process. In Western experiments, the rebound of phospho-ERK after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of CSF1R ligands, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing shRNA against CSF1R recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the receptor, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression in resistant tumors. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397 is currently in clinical trials for glioblastoma, prostate, breast cancers and other cancers.

A retrospective series of 179 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600 mutations were analyzed and early first line treatment response was compared between patients with or without MASI.Results', 'Our results showed that heterozygous BRAF V600 mutated melanoma cell lines proliferate less rapidly than homozygous cell lines in vitro (cell proliferation counts after 7 days range from 3.6 x106 to 7.7x106 cells for homozygote cells, and from 4.8x104 to 5.5x105 for heterozygous cell lines) and in vivo (palpable tumors appeared on average 7 days after inoculation for homozygous cells but after 39 days for heterozygous cells). Heterozygous cell lines are more resistant to BRAF inhibitors either in vitro or in vivo (IC50 of vemurafenib ranged from 0,1 to 0,198 M for homozygous cells and from 8,62 to 22,65 M for heterozygous cell lines). We have also shown that patients with BRAF V600 mutated tumors with MASI may have initially a poorer prognosis (median overall survival 733 days IC95% [381; 1762] versus 1011 days IC95%[879;2969] p=0.236) but tend to have better responses to systemic drugs than patients without MASI (percentage of primary resistance 23% versus 34%; p=0.56).In conclusion', 'This translational study shows that a MASI of BRAF in melanoma is associated with a higher cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vitro and in vivo. This mutational status is also associated with a better response to BRAF inhibitor in vitro and in mice xenografts. Clinical relevance of these data should be more thoroughly evaluated on larger and more homogeneous series of patients however our preliminary data show a trend toward a clinical-experimental correlation with similar yet still statistically insignificant results. If confirmed, our data suggest that study of the MASI of BRAF mutation could serve as a predictive marker of patient response to vemurafenib. The role of paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in cells without MASI of BRAF needs to be further explored.']",

        "Background":"['Low grade gliomas (LGG) are the most common tumors of the central nervous system in children, accounting for about 50% of all brain tumors. They represent a heterogeneous group of grade I and II tumors according to the WHO classification. Pediatric LGG, is associated with activation of BRAF through a tandem duplication that results in the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or through an activating point mutation of BRAF (predominantly V600E). More recent findings suggest that the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion is restricted to Grade 1 tumors (70-90%) whereas BRAF(V600E) occurs more frequently in Grade 2-4 tumors (~23%). Findings for BRAF mutation, similar to other tumors with activated BRAF (e.g. melanoma), and the phase I activity of MEK inhibitor in the PBTC-029 protocol, suggest that activated BRAF may provide a validated drug target. Previous studies from our lab indicate that, in the context of mutant BRAF, inhibition of MEK inhibits TORC1 signaling and may induce a ‘BRCA-like’ phenotype, through depletion of FANCD2. Potentially suppression of TORC1 could have effects on other DNA damage response pathways that could compensate for loss of FANCD2. To understand the consequences of MEK inhibition in the context of BRAF abreation in LGG we surveyed DNA repair genes that may be regulated via the MEK/TORC1 pathway in BRAF mutant cells. The objective of this particular study was to examine the mechanism and significance of MEK inhibition to the repair of DNA damage by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. For this study, we have used glioma cell lines having BRAF(V600E) mutation; the BT40 cell line was developed from patient-derived astrocytoma xenograft (PDX) model in mice in our lab and AM38c1 and DBTRG-05MG cells were generously provided by T. Nicolades. Annexin binding assay demonstrated that MEKi treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptosis and necrosis of glioma cells. Human DNA repair PCR Array analysis identified MEKi induced down regulation of genes involved in Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair pathways. DSB repair genes were further validated by real time qPCR analysis. Immunoblot analysis of glioma cell lines indicate that MEKi treatment enhanced the gamma-H2AX levels. To elucidate the mechanism of DSB repair pathway in presence of MEKi, clonogenic assay, nuclear foci formation assay, and GFP reporter assay for homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) are ongoing. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time a previously unknown role for MEKi in treatment of glioma cells that involves inhibition of DNA double-strand break repair pathways. Further, we will examine the mechanism and significance of MEK/ERK and TORC1 signaling axis in regulation of DNA repair genes and its effect on LGG. Understanding how MEK plays a role in DNA repair pathways will be useful in maximizing treatment opportunities for childhood glioma.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant melanomas account for a substantial proportion of cancers worldwide and are largely resistant to conventional therapy. The heterogeneity and the invasiveness of melanomas present notable challenges for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, several mutations in RAF, RAS, and PTEN were identified that allow for prognosis of cancer development and progression. Therefore, inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway form attractive candidates for molecular-based targeted treatment of melanoma cancer. Here, we present the molecular characterization and chemosensitivity profiling of 18 human melanoma cell lines. Eight of these were established by Oncotest from human tumor xenografts originally derived from primary patient material. The molecular profiling included mutational analysis for BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and PTEN by sequencing. The chemosensitivity profiles were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and included commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of melanoma, targeted agents (sorafenib and bortezomib) and various BRAF (PLX-4032, PLX-4720, GDC-0879) and MEK (CI-1040, PD0325901) inhibitors. The clinically relevant BRAF V600E substitution was the most prevalent mutation and was found in more than 50% of the melanoma cell lines. The chemosensitivity profiling revealed diverse patterns of selectivity and potency with mean IC50 values between 0.4 nM (vinblastine) and 8.3 M (carboplatin). Each of the BRAF inhibitors tested was clearly more active in melanoma cell lines carrying a BRAF mutation. On average, IC50 values of BRAF inhibitors were more than 20-fold lower for the BRAF V600E mutated cell lines compared to the wild type cell lines. However, the BRAF mutated cell line MEXF 462NL was resistant towards BRAF inhibitors and it is warranted to compare its gene expression profile and mutational status with BRAF mutated cell lines responding to BRAF inhibitors. By using an ex vivo clonogenic assay, similar activity patterns for BRAF inhibitors were found, with mutated BRAF tumor xenografts showing markedly higher sensitivity. Potential synergistic activity of BRAF inhibitors with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or with standard chemotherapeutic agents will be presented. The mutational status of selected cancer related genes, as well as responsiveness towards many cytotoxic and targeted agents was analyzed for 18 melanoma cell lines. This extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization makes this melanoma cell line panel a valuable tool for in vitro profiling of novel compounds, in particular inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF(V600E) is the most common oncogenic mutation in melanoma and leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, which results in uncontrolled cell growth. Selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been observed to neutralize oncogenic the signaling, inhibit cellular growth, and improve patient outcome. Although these mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance have been reported, few studies focused on how to overcome the resistance. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, was confirmed to involve in multiple anticancer effects. Our previous study also showed propranolol inhibited melanoma by suppressing MAPK and AKT pathways in vitro an in vivo. But its efficacy and mechanism of overcoming vemurafenib still remain unknown in melanoma. Here, we explored the effect of propranolol on the A375, P-8 (patient-derived melanoma cell line) vemurafenib resistance cell line and resistance mice xenografts. Cell viability assay demonstrated that 2μM -20μM vemurafenib couldn’t decrease the proliferation but 24h-120h of incubation of 2μM-200μM propranolol inhibited viability with a concentration and time dependent manner in the two resistance cell line. TUNEL staining showed 24h incubation of 20μM propranolol alone or plus 4μM vemurafeinb obviously increased cell apoptosis. Mice received daily ig. administration of propranolol at the dose of 2 mg/kg alone or plus 10 mg/kg for 21days. The mean tumor volume at day 21 in resistance A375 xenografts was 221.13 ± 7.65mm3vs. 904.12 ± 70.57mm3 vs. 2021 ± 316.24mm3for the propranolol plus vemurafenib, propranolol alone, vemurafenib alone, respectively. Propranolol improved mice survival, 28.6% animal dead in plus group, 57.1% mice dead in the propranolol group, and 71.5% animal dead in vemurafenib at end of treatment. IHC showed propranolol also reduced Ki67 index both in propranolol and plus group when compared with vemurafenib treated mice. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed to explore the mechanism of propranolol overcoming the resistance, the data showed propranolol largely reduced mRNA levels of IGF family (IGFBP3, IGFLR1, IGFBP6, IGF2, IGF1R.etc.) but elevated the expressions of innate immune related genes (NKG7, TLR9, NCR3.etc.) in A375-vemr cell line.

In these rare BRAF mutants, the effects of vemurafenib (Vem) and other MAPK pathway inhibitors on signaling, growth rate and clinical course are not well understood. In cell lines with rare BRAF mutations, we investigated the effect of Vem, inhibitors of Pan-RAF (Amgen 2112819), MEK (trametinib), ERK (MERK SCH772984), Pan-RAFi+ MEKi and ERKi+Vem on growth and signaling. These results were compared to the clinical responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with the original tumors. Regardless of the mutation, no paradoxical activation of MAPK pathway by Vem was observed and the Pan-Rafi decreased levels of pMEK in all the cell lines. A heterozygous V600K mutated cell line was sensitive to Vem and more sensitive to the other drugs. Clinically, the duration of response to Vem in the patient the cell line was derived from was 7 months, and an additional 3 months to the combination of Vem and MEKi upon progression on Vem. In contrast, a homozygous V600K mutated cell line was resistant to Vem but sensitive to other MAPK inhibitors. The patient the cell line was derived from had a 5 month response to Vem followed by a 2 month response to the addition of a MEKi. BRAF L597S cell line was only sensitive to ERKi and G466K and V600R mutated cell lines were resistant to all the drugs. In general, Vem was the least effective followed by Pan-RAFi with ERKi stronger than both in most cell lines. The combination of Vem and ERKi showed similar or slightly higher growth inhibition than ERKi alone. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors are not as effective in melanoma cell lines with rare BRAF mutations. However, more growth inhibition can be achieved by MEKi-Pan-RAFi combination.

Homozygous deletion of this locus is among the most common genetic events in human cancer across tissues, with the resultant selective advantage to cancer cells generally attributed to the loss of CDKN2A proteins, which help maintain functional Rb and p53. However, in greater than 90% of cancer tissues harboring CDKN2A deletion, the adjacent CDKN2B gene encoding the p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is also deleted. The degree to which CDKN2B-encoded p15 loss contributes to human tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that CDKN2B is highly upregulated in common, benign melanocytic nevi (moles) expressing the constitutively active BRAF(V600E) oncogene. A large percentage of melanomas develop in continuity with these pre-existing nevi, suggesting that nevus melanocytes are not permanently senescent, and can serve as tumor-initiating cells upon acquisition of additional genetic changes. By examining primary melanocytes isolated directly from freshly excised benign human nevi, as well as normal primary melanocytes engineered to inducibly express BRAF(V600E), we link BRAF activation to a TGF-dependent p15 induction that arrests nevi in their pre-malignant state. We also use the primary nevus cells to establish a new genetically-defined, human in vivo melanoma xenograft model, which maximizes medical relevance by utilizing the naturally occurring melanoma precursor cells in a native 3-dimensional environment.

Aberrant signalling via the MAPK pathway is commonly seen in cancer. RAF inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib have been approved for the treatment of unresectable and metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma, but these agents lack efficacy in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), partly because of EGFR-mediated feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF. Furthermore, RAF inhibitor treatment of RAS-mutant, BRAF wildtype melanomas has been associated with other skin cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to MAPK pathway paradoxical activation mediated by CRAF. There is therefore a clinical need for novel agents targeting the MAPK pathway that do not have these undesirable properties. Here we present, REDX05358 that demonstrates subnanomolar binding affinity for BRAF and CRAF with high selectivity profile against a panel of 468 kinases that exhibits negligible paradoxical activation due to inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers. As a result, REDX05358 not only inhibits MAPK signalling in BRAF V600E mutant tumor cells, but also in those harbouring NRAS and KRAS mutations. Furthermore, REDX05358 does not induce feedback reactivation of the pathway through its ability to sustain inhibition of MAPK signalling in CRC cell lines.

The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08). Patients with NRAS copy number gain receiving CPS had significantly improved overall survival compared to patients receiving CP alone (HR=0.35, P=0.03) in multivariable Cox model. We had previously found a trend suggesting an improved clinical response and PFS in patients with NRAS mutant melanoma treated with CPS as compared to CP. Our present study demonstrates an association between CNVs and treatment response to CP or CPS, as well as an association with somatic mutations. In addition, distinct cooperating genomic events identified in somatic mutation cohorts, such as MET and BRAF V600K gain, may contribute to the pathogenesis of melanoma tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Once melanoma has metastasized to distant sites it has proved difficult to treat by a variety of chemotherapeutic and biological agents. Significant advances have been made in identifying subgroups of patients with activating mutations in signalling pathway proteins. In particular, the finding that approximately 50% of melanoma have V600E mutations in the BRAF serine/threonine kinase has resulted in the generation of a number of new drugs which target the mutated active form of BRAF. One of these drugs, Vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG704) has shown significant promise in prolonging survival compared to standard chemotherapy, however reports of patient relapse has prompted investigation into means of overcoming acquired resistance to the agent. We report here that efficacy of the PLX4032 analogue, PLX4720, is greatly enhanced by co-treatment with the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. Treatment with either agent is able to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, however the kinetics are typically slow, with cell death occurring 48 or 72 hours post treatment. In this study, while either agent was largely ineffective as a single treatment 24 hours following treatment, addition of the combination of drugs rapidly induced significant killing. We show that apoptosis was caspase-dependent, in that inhibition of caspase activation almost totally blocked induction of cell death by the combination of agents. Apoptosis was also associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, with reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9. Exposure of melanoma cells to PLX4720 rapidly decreased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, resulting in strong upregulation as early as 6 hours after addition of the compound. Strong upregulation of Bim was shown by RNAi knockdown to play an important role in sensitizing cells to co-treatment with ABT-737, by assisting in the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Further, the combination of agents induced significant levels of apoptosis in melanoma cells derived from patients harbouring the BRAFV600E mutation. Collectively, these results show that the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 in a Bim- and caspase-dependent manner. Additionally, these studies identify a potential clinical application for BH3 mimetics in overcoming resistance of melanoma to treatment with BRAF inhibitors, increasing efficacy of this class of agent and improving patient outcomes.']",

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

Patients with a RAS mutated melanoma also represent a current unmet need. CCT3833 is a potent inhibitor of mutant BRAF, CRAF and SRC kinases. Preclinical data using CCT3833 in a range of mutant RAF or RAS cell lines in vitro and human tumour xenograft models in vivo demonstrated activity, including melanoma patient-derived xenografts with intrinsic or acquired resistance to selective BRAF inhibitors.

Furthermore, approximately 20-40% of V600E mutant tumors are intrinsically resistant to BRAFi. Suitable models for studying mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic resistance to BRAFi are therefore necessary. In the present study, we applied deep sequencing techniques to identify possible mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance in our collection of melanoma patient-derived xenograft models (MEXFs) treated with BRAFi.Mutational and expression profiles in MEXFs were characterized by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix chips and correlated with BRAFi efficacy data from 3D Tumor Clonogenic Assays (TCA). In addition, four resistant cell lines were created by continuously treating 2D monolayer cultures of tumor cells with Vemurafenib, all of which were initially sensitive to BRAFi and carry the BRAF V600E mutation. Expression profiles and mutations of these cell lines were analyzed from RNA-seq data. Potential gene candidates responsible for conferring resistance were further investigated by Q-PCR and Western-blot experiments.WES data revealed that the number of mutations per model was highly variable. Some MEXFs showed a hyper-mutated profile (>2000 mutations) and were characterized by specific mutational signatures in agreement with those found in melanoma (Alexandrov et al, Nature, 2013). Mutation frequencies of genes typically mutated in melanoma are very similar to those found in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We observed a high correlation of mutations between our MEXFs and their respective cell lines. Among the models with a V600E mutation, only one (MEXF 462) showed resistance to BRAFi-treatment as identified by 3D TCA analyses. In this model, we identified gene point mutations and a high over-expression of EGFR, MEK1, PDGFRA and NF1 in contrast to the other models, suggesting a specific regulation of the RTK signaling pathways. In 2D assays, synergistic interaction of Vemurafenib and Erlotinib was shown. RNA-seq analysis of the cell line established from MEXF 276, in which resistance to Vemurafenib was induced, revealed around 20% of genes being differentially expressed (FC>2) between sensitive and resistant cell lines. An up-regulation of EGFR was also found in this resistant cell line and was confirmed by Western-blot. In addition, an overexpression of PLAU, a biomarker of invasiveness, was identified. We currently perform expression profiling of three other models resistant to BRAFi. Preliminary results suggest different patterns of gene regulation involved in acquisition of resistance. A precise map of transcriptomic and mutational profiles of the four cell lines will be generated and we are investigating if invasiveness is increased upon acquisition of resistance.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFi, has been applied to treat melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. While the response rate is high, resistance is inevitable. Despite combination with MEK inhibitor which enhances the antitumor efficacy as well as increases duration of response, patients ultimately relapse. Therefore, there is an urgent need for second line treatment for melanoma patients who are resistant to BRAFi treatment.In this study, we found that BRAFi-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are susceptible to arginine deprivation due to their inability to turn on argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), a key enzyme for arginine synthesis as well as their inability to undergo autophagy. Thus, arginine deprivation using pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20, supplied by Polaris Inc.) which degrades arginine to citrulline results in cell death. We established 6 BR cell lines from BRAF mutant (V600E) cell lines including ASS-negative cell lines such as A375 and MEL-1220 (derived from a patient) and ASS-positive and/or inducible cell lines include UACC-62, SK-MEL28, A2058, and MEL-GP (derived from a patient) by continuous exposure to vemurafenib at IC50 over 30 weeks. MTT, caspase activity, and Annexin V/PI analyses showed that treatment with ADI-PEG20 (100ng/ml) for 72 hr induced 2-3 fold increase in growth inhibition and 10-30% increase in apoptosis in BR cells compared to their parental cells counterpart. The xenograft mouse model also confirmed that ADI-PEG20 abrogated tumor growth of A2058BR cells but only retarded growth seen in A2058 cells (tumor growth inhibition (T/C ratio) in A2058 and A2058BR is 38.7% vs. 8.3%; T/C<42% indicates significant inhibition). The results observed by cyto-ID staining combined with fluorescent microscope and electron microscope also exhibited 40-80% decrease in autophagosome formation in BR cells compared to parental cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20.We further found that BRAFi-resistance attenuated autophagy and ASS re-expression due to loss of Atg5 and c-Myc. Atg5-overexpressed plasmid rescued 12-35% apoptosis in MEL-1220BR and A2058BR cells through autophagic process as evidenced by more autophagosome formation following treatment with ADI-PEG20. The other mechanism leading to attenuated ASS re-expression is decreased c-Myc (positive regulator of ASS transcription). It is known that c-Myc stability is governed by ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation. Using immunoprecipitation assay, our results showed that the levels of deubiquitinating enzyme, USP28, were too low to prevent c-Myc from ubiquitination. Overall, our data suggest that attenuated Atg5 which halted autophagy and decreased c-Myc which prevented re-expression of ASS made the BR cells vulnerable to cell death upon arginine deprivation. Thus, ADI-PEG20 is a potential candidate for salvage therapy in BR patients (Supported by R01CA152197).']",

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF mutations, in particular V600E, occurs in approximately 50% of cutaneous melanomas. PLX4032 (vemurafenib), an ATP-competitive BRAF inhibitor, displays remarkable activity, leading to an increase in progression-free and overall survival in patients with BRAF V600E mutated melanoma, pointing to a strong dependence of this tumor on the MAP kinase pathway. However, patients treated with this drug almost invariably recur, and several resistance mechanisms have already been described. In this work, we have investigated the effects of long-term treatment (5 weeks - 5 months) with PLX4032 in the human melanoma cell line MEL-XY3. The sensitivity of the heterozygous, BRAF mutated (V600E) parental MEL-XY3 cells (XY3 wt) to PLX4032 was investigated, and the IC50 was <0.25 M. When XY3 wt cells were grown in the presence of 10 M PLX4032 for periods up to five months, most of the cells died. However, some clusters of flattened, quiescent cells remained viable; we named such cells MEL-XY3 SUR. After removing PLX4032 from the culture medium, MEL-XY3 SUR were able to resume growth and their sensitivity to the drug was equal to XY3 wt. We sought to investigate if such quiescent cells presented stem cell-like characteristics. We found that the expression of the stem cell marker CD271 (NGFR) increased 100 - 1.000 fold as determined by RT-qPCR, and the increase in CD271 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western blot. Expression of the putative stem cell marker ABCB5 also increased around 25-fold as measured by RT-qPCR, but expression of CD133 was reduced 50-300 fold. Coincidently, in some plates maintained with 10 M PLX4032, sparsed colonies with outgrowth of cellular masses appeared. When such colonies were isolated, they grew rapidly and were 200-fold more resistant to PLX4032 than XY3 wt, with an IC50 around 50 M. Consequently, such cells, that we named MEL-XY3 RES, display more conventional resistance mechanisms. Therefore, at least two resistance mechanisms may appear after long term exposure to PLX4032', ' one which probably involves a shift to non-growing, surviving cells with stem cell-like characteristics and which retain the parental cell line sensitivity to the drug, and another which may involve acquisition of resistance mechanisms that bypass the PLX4032 inhibition of BRAF. We hypothesize that the stem cell-like surviving mechanism would be relevant to allow regrowth after discontinuation of PLX4032 treatment, whereas the conventional resistance mechanism would explain tumor escape during treatment. It does not escape notice that long-term culture in the presence of PLX4032 could be a method to select stem-like cells from BRAF-mutated tumor cells.']",

        "Background":"[\"More than 50% of melanoma's harbor the V600E activating mutation in BRAF, which constitutively activates the Mek/Erk signaling cascade leading to tumor cell proliferation. The BRAF(V600E) mutation predicts responsiveness to RAF inhibitors, which led to FDA approval of the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) in 2011. Although several mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibition have been described, no resistance-associated point mutations involving the RAF genes themselves have been detected in the clinical setting thus far. This is in contrast to well described resistance mechanisms to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which frequently involve secondary mutations within the target kinase. To gain additional insights in this regard, we created randomly mutagenized cDNA library of BRAF (V600E) and it's homolog C-RAF and expressed individually in A375(V600E B-RAF) cells in the presence of PLX4720, an analogue of PLX4032. The resistance clones emerged from the screen were characterized by massive parallel sequencing and the mutant alleles were further recreated via site directed mutageneis in the respective cDNA's. However, no candidate mutations occuring in BRAF (V600E) could be validated as bona fide resistance alleles. In contrast, we identified 11 alleles that engendered sustained Mek phosphorylation in the setting of PLX4720 exposure. Upon ectopic expression, three of these alleles conferred profound pharmacologic resistance to PLX4720. Two of these resistance alleles clustered within the 14-3-3 consensus binding site of C-RAF, and the third occurred in the kinase domain (ATP binding domain, activation segment). 14-3-3 proteins are known to stabilize and activate C-RAF through phosphorylation of key serine and tyrosine residues. Toward this end, some C-RAF resistance alleles promoted increased BRAF heterodimerization and increased kinase activity. Each of these alleles remained sensitive to the Mek inhibitor AZD6244. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that mutations in C-RAF that alter 14-3-3 binding, promoted dimerization, and/or enhance intrinsic kinase activity may conceivably mediate resistance to RAF inhibition - particularly as more potent inhibitors become utilized. Ongoing work involves investigating the clinical relevance of this phenomenon.\"]",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is increasing in incidence by up to 3% annually, and metastatic melanoma, which is resistant to most conventional therapies, has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Immunotherapy is able to yield durable response in melanoma; however, the response rate is limited (20-30%). It has been shown that tumor immunogenicity is highly correlated to the response to immunotherapy. The mutational load and the characteristics of the neoantigens displayed by the tumor cells are theorized to play an important role in the immunogenicity of the tumor. We used genetically engineered preclinical mouse models to study the role of these neoantigens in melanoma response to immune therapy. Three syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse melanoma models were developed', ' UV induced melanoma in albino BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- mice (1), DMBA induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) mice (2), and UV induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg mice. These three models were found to have varying degrees of tumor immunogenicity based on vaccination studies. The UV induced BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- model displayed poor immunogenicity, while the DMBA induced HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) model exhibited moderate immunogenicity and the UV induced HGF-tg model showed the highest immunogenicity. Exome sequencing results showed that high immunogenicity is associated with mutations of genes in DNA damage responses and frameshift mutations. To test the role of neoantigens, RNA from each of the melanoma models was sequenced and analyzed for mutational and expression profiles. We will be comparing the response of these three mouse models to correlate immunogenicity with response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We plan to analyze the pathways in which mutated genes were enriched, allowing the identification of druggable targets to enhance therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CRISPR/Cas9-based screening approaches will be used to identify specific neoantigens able to influence response to immune therapy. In conclusion, our preclinical mouse models show that tumor immunogenicity may be correlated to the carcinogenic mechanisms, and RNA sequence has provided further insight into the role of mutational load and neo-epitopes on immune-based therapeutic response.(1) Provided by Marcus Bosenberg (Yale School of Medicine, New Heaven, CT), Martin McMahon (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT).(2) Provided by Thomas Tueting (University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany).']",

Methods', '    We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 8 pairs of metastatic tumor and germline DNA from 3 superficial spreading (SSM), 3 nodular (NM) and 2 acral lentiginous (ALM) melanoma patients.

Tumor DNA was isolated from FFPE samples in quantities that facilitated an average coverage of 100X for 95% of the exon regions; on average, 60M reads per sample were obtained, without applying whole genome amplification. We performed variant calling using paired samples with Somatic Sniper, SAM tools and MuTect. We annotated all the variants and applied functional filters to come up with a candidate list of mutations.  Results', '    Our analysis confirmed known mutations that occur predominantly in each subtype (BRAF V600E more prevalent in SSM than in NM and absent in ALM, ALM being NF1 mutant but not BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61 mutant) and further revealed subtype-restricted somatic mutations in genes not previously reported as associated with melanoma. In particular, matrix-remodeling associated 5 was found to be frequently mutated in the SSM samples tested but not in the ALM or NM samples, and PFN1P2 (profilin 1 pseudogene) in NM samples but not in the ALM or SSM samples.

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of ERK signaling is a common event in malignancy. Receptor activation of RAS leads to dimerization and activation of RAF kinase, which in turn activates ERK. Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",

Vemurafenib (Vmf) is a potent inhibitor of BRAF mutated at V600E with response rates of up to 80% in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, drug resistance develops in most of patients leading to response durations of only several months. We previously showed that the combined approach of BRAF inhibition with adoptive cell immunotherapy leads to an improved outcome in vivo. Here we show that Vmf also directly and independently affects T lymphocytes, resulting in favorable anti-tumoral phenotypic changes. We had created a transplantable murine melanoma cell-line driven by V600E BRAF oncogene (SM1) derived from a spontaneously arising melanoma in transgenic mice harboring the V600E BRAF mutation under the control of tyrosinase promoter. SM1 cells stably expressing the ovalbumin (OVA) model antigen were implanted in C57BL6 mice. Daily i.p. Vmf combined with ACT of OVA-specific TCR transgenic cells generated by retroviral transduction demonstrated superior tumor control of the combined treatment in comparison to each treatment alone. We also confirmed better outcomes with this combination in the pmel-1 model, which is based on the ACT of TCR transgenic cells against the endogenously expressed and relevant melanoma antigen, gp100. We then cultured primary T cells in the presence of Vmf with a broad range of concentration (0.1 to up to 100 uM). There was no evidence of cytotoxicity, but interestingly, T cells differentiated into a phenotype resembling T central memory (CM) cells (CD44+, CD62L+) in a dose dependent manner as assessed by flow-cytometry. CM T cells were shown to induce superior anti-tumoral responses in comparison to ACT of Effector T cells in murine models. As expected for CM T cells, further analysis of 24 h collection supernatants from in vitro cognate peptide stimulated T cells showed dose-dependent lower interferon-gamma secretion with Vmf as analyzed by ELISA. Pmel-1 T cells were then analyzed by Immunoblotting for phosphorylation status (activation) of protein kinases at 1, 5, 15, 30 min and at 24h after Vmf treatment (concentrations from 1 to 15 uM). Vmf induced increased levels of pERK and pMEK. Co-immunoprecipitation studies and kinase assays further demonstrated a role of C-Raf in this paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in T cells induced by Vmf. Furthermore, in vivo studies in C57BL6 mice treated with Vmf daily or vehicle control for 3 weeks demonstrated skewing of CD3+ cells towards a phenotype resembling central memory T cells (CD44+, CD62L+, LY-6C+).

We have developed quantitative assays using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM) to assess a diverse panel of >70 proteins involved in signaling pathways, including apoptosis, receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K/Akt/MTOR, and MAP kinases. Assays quantify changes in response to targeted therapeutic agents and examine subsequent resistance mechanisms in cell lines, xenografts, and biopsies from patients.Experimental procedures', ' Nave and BRAF V600E inhibitor-resistant melanoma cell lines were treated with vehicle control, BRAF V600E inhibitor (PLX4720), HSP90 inhibitor (XL-888, Exelixis), or MEK inhibitor (AZD6244). Immunoblotting and LC-MRM were used to evaluate protein expression levels. Heat shock proteins can be measured directly from whole cell lysates or tumor homogenates using a few micrograms of protein. For expression of cancer signaling proteins (many of which are HSP90 clients), 50 micrograms of total protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE prior to digestion and LC-MRM quantification. Similar experiments were conducted with mouse xenograft tumors from treated and control mice; these measurements have also been applied to fine needle aspirates (FNAs) and core biopsies from patients in the context of a clinical trial.Data summary', ' LC-MRM quantification is effective in quantifying these proteins in cell lines, xenografts, and biopsies or FNAs.

As an example, both LC-MRM data and Westerns showed consistent responses to HSP90 inhibition, including increased expression of HSP71 and reduction of HSP90 client levels. Proteins were also modulated in response and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.Conclusion', ' LC-MRM quantifies biomarker panels and provides an assessment tool that can translated in a straightforward way from cell line models to patient specimens. This emerging technique holds great promise for biopsy-mandated clinical trials, particularly in diseases like melanoma that can be readily sampled. Measurements using this LC-MRM platform can be used to assess drug performance and patient response to evaluate treatment, detect drug resistance, and suggest rational combination therapies.']",

BRAF alterations in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) are rare and BRAF is not currently considered a target for the disease. Methods', ' DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from a series of 10,428 cases of metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of > 550X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results', ' 135 (1.2%) of the mBC featured alterations in BRAF. The median age of the 135 female patients was 66 years (range 27 to 83 years). The primary tumor was used for CGP in 50 (37%) and from metastatic sites including lymph nodes, liver, bone, lung, brain, adrenal and soft tissue in 85 (67%). Using CDH1 mutation as the definition of lobular mBC, 126 (93%) were ductal and 9 (7%) were lobular histology. Activating BRAF alterations included amplifications (48%), SV mutations (39%) and rearrangements (13%). No (0%) mBC had multiple BRAF GA in the same case. 34% of BRAF SV were V600E and 66% were a wide variety of non-V600E GA. 10 (7.4%) of 135 BRAF mutated mBC featured ERBB2 amplification with 1 (1%) having an ERBB2 SV mutation and 1 (1%) having both ERBB2 amplification and SV GA. Of the 115 BRAF GA cases with known hormone receptor status 71 (62%) were ER negative, 44 (38%) were ER positive and 63 (55%) were triple negative (TNBC). Other targetable genes enriched in mBC with BRAF GA included CDK6 (p = 0.001), HGF (p < 0.001) and MET(p < 0.001). The median TMB was 4.5 with 17 (13%) of cases with TMB > 10 mut/Mb and 7 (5%) of cases with > 20 mut/Mb. Conclusions', 'BRAF alterations, although uncommon in mBC representing only 1.2% of cases, are enriched in TNBC and feature both targetable base substitutions and rare fusions. BRAF GA may be a rare cause of anti-HER2 therapy resistance in a subset of ERBB2 driven mBC. Targetable genes co-altered with BRAF in mBC include CDK6, HGF and MET. The TMB in BRAF altered mBC is significantly higher than that for mBC in general and indicates potential role for immunotherapy for these patients.']",

        "Background":"['Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounts for approximately 2% of diagnosed malignancies in canines. The majority of canine TCCs are invasive, intermediate to high grade tumors sharing similarities with human muscle invasive TCCs in risk factors, histology, sites of metastasis, and therapeutic response to single agents. Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",

This led us to examine the combination of romidepsin with MAPK pathway inhibitors in cell lines harboring the V600E BRAF mutation that leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. To more closely simulate clinical administration of romidepsin, 11 V600E BRAF positive cell lines (8 melanomas and 3 colorectal cancers) were exposed to 25 ng/ml romidepsin in the presence or absence of the MAPK pathway inhibitors AZD6244 (selumetinib, 250 nM), PD0325901 (250 nM) or PLX4032 (vemurafenib, 1 M) for 6 h, after which the cells were placed in romidepsin-free medium containing the inhibitors and incubated for an additional 42 h. Apoptosis was subsequently measured by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Of the 11 cell lines, 10 exhibited significantly higher annexin staining after short-term romidepsin treatment alone (control, median annexin value 7.1%3.8% vs. treated, median annexin value 34.7%17.8%, p<0.001). Combined treatment with romidepsin and selumetinib, PD0325901 or vemurafenib resulted in a significantly higher percent of annexin positive cells (p<0.05) in 9 to 11 of the 11 BRAF mutant cell lines examined compared to treatment with romidepsin alone; expression of dephosphorylated Bim was observed. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the MAPK pathway at the concentrations used; apoptosis was associated with increased PARP cleavage. Using mitochondrial separation techniques, we also observed increased levels of Bim in the mitochondrial membrane fraction and reduced expression of mitochondrial hexokinase 2 in cells treated with combined romidepsin/MEK inhibitor compared to either compound alone. Our results suggest a critical role for apoptotic pathways in cell death due to romidepsin, that MAPK signaling promotes resistance via Bim degradation, and that combined treatment with romidpesin and BRAF or MEK inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of cancers harboring BRAF mutations.']",

The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of these cases and is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor that demonstrates selective anti-tumor activity against BRAFV600E mutated cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. CEP-32496 is orally bioavailable and demonstrates in vivo pharmacodynamic inhibition of pMEK and pERK signaling and tumor stasis and regressions in BRaf V600E cell line tumor xenograft models. In the current study Champions primary human TumorGraft models of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma possessing the B-Raf V600E genotype were utilized to determine the oral anti-tumor efficacy of CEP-32496 in more clinically relevant models in order to support the clinical development of CEP-32496. Champions Oncology has developed an innovative platform for oncology research that utilizes the implantation of primary human tumors in immune-deficient mice in a manner that preserves the biological properties of the original human tumor. Previous reports have demonstrated the correlation between the responses observed in Champions TumorGraft models and clinical responses from the patients from which the models were derived. CEP-32496 was evaluated in a panel of nine Champions TumorGraft models and compared to the recently FDA-approved B-RAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (Roche/Genentech/Daiichi) in order to determine the potential clinical activity of the compound. Mice bearing established Champions TumorGrafts were treated orally with 35 mg/kg bid of CEP-32496 or vemurafenib for 25 to 35 days and anti-tumor efficacy and tolerability were evaluated. Results demonstrated that in 5/9 (56% of the Tumorgraft models) CEP-32496 showed significantly superior in vivo efficacy compared to vemurafenib. Equivalent anti-tumor efficacy was observed in 3/9 (33%) TumorGraft models with both CEP-32496 and vemurafenib. Both inhibitors demonstrated comparable tolerability profiles. Additional TumorGraft models are currently under evaluation and retrospective bioinformatics analyses are planned to determine potential signatures of response and resistance for CEP-32496 to facilitate both its clinical development and potential differentiation from vemurafenib. Overall, these results demonstrate that CEP-32496 shows comparable to superior efficacy in this panel of Champions primary TumorGraft models when compared to vemurafenib.']",

Methods', ' In this phase I study, we treated an extension cohort of mCRC pts whose tumors were positive for mutant BRAF with PLX4032 at the previously determined maximum tolerated dose of 960 mg BID.

Results', ' 21 mCRC pts were enrolled, with a median age of 65 and ECOG performance status of 0 (35%) or 1 (65%). All but one had received prior therapy for metastatic disease. PLX4032 PK values were ~20% lower than than those previously observed for melanoma. 19 pts were evaluable for response, with 1 confirmed partial response and 4 minor responses ( 10% shrinkage). 5 pts showed a mixed response pattern (i.e., with both regressing and progressing lesions). 2 of the 3 pts who underwent repeat FDG-PET imaging achieved a metabolic response, which was concordant with RECIST changes. Median progression-free survival was 3.7 months, with 2 pts still on study. PLX4032 was generally well tolerated. Three pts had dose limiting toxicities of G3 rash and G3 nausea. Other G3 or G4 drug-attributable adverse events in all cycles were seen in 6 pts, and included fatigue, diarrhea, neutropenia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Five pts developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas consistent with keratoacanthomas, which were managed by local excision. Conclusions', ' The clinical activity seen with PLX4032 in previously treated mCRC pts with V600E BRAF mutations is more modest than had been seen in melanoma, but this activity does confirm mutant BRAF as a therapeutic target in this disease. The biology of BRAF activation in pts with CRC is clearly more heterogenous than in melanoma, especially as evidenced in those pts with a mixed response.

        "Background":"['The combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) has been FDA approved to treat melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. Although most BRAF mutant melanomas are highly responsive to these treatments, they all relapse ultimately. In this study, we found a unique mechanism which can be used to treat BRAFi resistant patients. Five BRAFi resistant (BR) cells were established from known BRAF mutant cell lines A375, MEL-1220, A2058, UACC-62, and SK-MEL28 by long-term exposure to BRAFi. These BR cells are hypersensitive to ADI-PEG20, an enzyme which degrades arginine to citrulline. ADI-PEG20 treatment resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in BR cell viability (MTT assay) and 10-30% increase in apoptosis (Annexin V/PI) in BR cells compared to their paternal cells. The mechanisms involved are as follows', ' All BR cells express very low levels or do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, a key enzyme to generate arginine from citrulline). Thus, these BR cells rely primarily on exogenous arginine. Furthermore, these BR cells also have attenuation of glucose uptake which makes them rely mainly on amino acids. Importantly, their ability to undergo autophagy upon nutritional stress is also impaired. The underlying mechanism for low levels of ASS is due to diminished c-Myc expression which is a positive regulator for ASS. Additionally, AMPK-1, which possesses phosphorylation site at Thr172 governing autophagy and glucose uptake, was attenuated in BR cells. Overexpression of AMPK-1 using plasmid transfection in A2058BR and MEL-1220BR cells rescued 8-28% ADI-PEG20-induced apoptosis and enhanced autophagosome formation (detected by LysoTacker). Conversely, knockdown of AMPK-1 using siRNA significantly enhanced ADI-PEG20-reduced cell viability (compared to non-targeting siRNA) in A2058 and MEL-1220 cells through attenuation of autophagy and glucose uptake. This is evidenced by decreased GLUT1 and LC3-II expression, and low activity of 2-NBDG uptake, which also can be seen in most BR cells. The xenograft model also showed that ADI-PEG20 aborted tumor growth of A2058BR and A375BR cells but retarded growth of A2058 and A375 cells. Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed lower levels of ASS and AMPK-1 in A2058BR xenograft and in tumor tissues from 10 BR patients relative to their parental counterparts (average H-scores of ASS and AMPK in parental tissues vs. BR tissues are 58.2 vs. 7.8, and 146 vs. 78.3, respectively, p <0.03). Importantly, these findings also apply to cell lines and tumor samples from patients who failed both BRAF and MEK inhibitor. In summary, our data suggest that attenuated AMPK-1 mediated autophagy and glucose uptake and decreased c-Myc mediated ASS re-expression sensitize BR cells to arginine deprivation. Thus, ADI-PEG20 is a potential salvage therapy for BR patients (Supported by R01CA152197).']",
