These translocations, activating a proto-oncogene with a tyrosine kinase domain, are also targeted by the MET and ALK crizotinib. ROS1 rearrangements are found in only 1.2-1.7% NSCLCs, but seemingly only in triple negative (EGFR and KRAS non-mutated and ALK non-rearranged) adenocarcinomas and preferentially in non- or light smokers.  Methods', '  60 triple negative non- or light-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma were screened for ROS1 rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Two commercially available break-apart FISH probe kits containing a mixture of two probes hybridizing on each side of the ROS1 locus, one located in a centromeric (3) position, and the other one in a telomeric (5) position relative to the ROS1 gene were used. ROS1 fusions were therefore detected without any preconception on the fusion partner, as multiple fusion partners have been described. At least 100 nuclei were screened, and a tumor was considered positive if it contained more than 15% rearranged nuclei.  Results', '  Forty-nine of the 60 tumors were interpretable. Four (8.2%) of theses 49 tumors were ROS1 rearranged by FISH. Only one of the positive cases showed a classical split rearrangement pattern (one fusion, one green and one red signal in more than 15% of nuclei), whereas the three other tumors showed a variant pattern, with a deletion of the telomeric probe, located in a 5 position relative to the ROS1 gene locus, indicating the presence of a fusion partner upstream of the ROS1 gene. The four positive cases were all at an advanced stage (3 or 4), but did not display any common architectural feature.  Conclusions', '  The prevalence of ROS1 positivity in our selected population was far superior (8.2%) to that of a non-selected NSCLC population, suggesting that this type of screening may be more effective (faster and more cost-worthy) to detect ROS1 positive tumors.']",

Methods', ' Medical records were reviewed and data extracted. Repeat biopsies were performed as part of routine clinical care or under institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols. Specimens underwent Sanger-based sequencing of the ROS1 kinase domain or targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS).

The resulting fusion proteins often drive proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and thus represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. One such kinase that has been demonstrated to be involved in various genomic rearrangement events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and cholangiocarcinoma is the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as c-ROS and ROS). To date, three different 5 fusion partners for ROS1 have been identified. In this study, we examined the frequency of ROS1 gene rearrangement in a panel of 428 patient-derived NSCLC tumor samples using a break-apart FISH assay. We found that approximately 1.2% of samples were positive. In positive samples, the expression of the fusion gene and the identity of the fusion partner were examined. HCC78 is a NSCLC cell line that has been demonstrated by us and others to express the SLC34A2-ROS1 gene fusion. In order to assess the cellular consequences of ROS1 inhibition, we treated HCC78 cells with two distinct small molecule kinase inhibitors that have activity against ROS1 (crizotinib and TAE684). We found that both drugs inhibited proliferation of HCC78 cells, down-regulated signaling pathways known to control cellular growth and survival, and disrupted normal cell-cycle progression. Finally, we report clinical data from a NSCLC patient with a ROS1 gene rearrangement, as detected by the FISH break-apart assay, who demonstrated tumor shrinkage when treated with crizotinib. This patient's tumor exhibited a novel ROS1 gene fusion partner. In conclusion, genomic rearrangements involving the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase are present in a small subset of NSCLC patients, and drugs that target ROS1 may be an effective treatment strategy for these patients.\"]",

Promising clinical responses have been observed in patients bearing tumors with ROS1 fusions treated with Xalkori, an ALK/MET kinase inhibitor that also inhibits Ros1. However, resistance has been observed and a ROS1 kinase domain mutation, G2032R, was identified in a ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC patient who developed resistance to Xalkori treatment. Clinical experience with other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggests that additional resistance mutations are likely to arise, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents that can overcome this type of resistance.We identified a novel chemical series of potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFG-out binding mode. The structure of human Ros1 in a complex with a ligand from this chemical class was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Here we describe the structure-activity relationships and synthesis route for this chemical series. A representative compound from this series inhibited isolated recombinant Ros1 kinase activity with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM. This compound inhibited less than 6% of kinases in a panel of 400 at 1 M concentration. Growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express Ros1 autophosphorylation in HCC78 NSCLC cells that harbor a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion were inhibited at similar concentrations as the isolated protein. This activity translated into potent Ba/F3-Ros1 tumor growth inhibition in mice. This compound was also active on Ba/F3 cells containing Ros1 with a mutation in the gatekeeper residue, L2026M, in cell growth assays in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, this unique binding mode provides scope for activity on additional Ros1 mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori, such as the clinically relevant G2032R mutation.

NSCLC are subdivided in clinically relevant molecular subsets according to a classification based on specific so-called oncogenic driver mutations.Recently, ROS1 gene rearrangement was identified in 1-2% of NSCLC resulting in the formation of fusion proteins in which the kinase domain of ROS1 is constitutively active. Targeting ROS1 proteins with crizotinib is showing promise as an effective therapy in ROS1-positive patients. The diagnostic test for ROS1 rearrangement is currently done on tumor biopsies or fine-needle aspirations. We evaluated whether ROS1 rearrangement could be detected and monitored using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in ROS1-positive patients treated by crizotinib. Patients and Methods', 'Blood samples were drawn in four ROS1-positive patients at baseline and different time-points under crizotinib treatment as well as in four ROS1-negative (ALK-positive) patients. CTC enrichment was performed by filtration (ISET, isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells). ROS1 gene alterations were examined in CTCs by combining four-color immunofluorescent staining and FA-FISH (filter-adapted fluorescent in situ hybridization) according to a method we recently reported (Pailler et al, J Clin Oncol. 2013) and compared with those present in tumor biopsies. Chromosomal instability (CIN) present in CTCs was characterized using multi color FA-FISH and DNA image cytometry.Results', 'All ROS1-positive patients had high levels (>20 CTCs/3ml) of ROS1-rearranged CTCs. ROS1-rearranged CTCs consistently harbored high numbers of native ROS1 copies and a 35 split contrasting with ROS1 gene patterns present within the corresponding tumors. A high level of cell-to-cell variability in ROS1 pattern abnormalities gene was observed in CTCs of ROS1-positive patients. Experiments are ongoing to characterize the CIN status of CTCs using both FA-FISH and DNA image cytometry in ROS1-positive patients. Changes in the levels of ROS1-rearranged CTCs were observed during crizotinib treatment.ConclusionROS1 rearrangement can be detected in CTCs of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC by using a filtration technique and FA-FISH combined with immunofluorescence staining, enabling both diagnostic testing and monitoring of crizotinib treatment. The high rate of cell-to-cell variability in ROS1 pattern abnormalities and tumor heterogeneity observed in ROS1-rearranged CTCs suggests that aneuploidy and genetic instability might have an important role in tumorigenesis of ROS1-positive NSCLC.']",

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, the emergence of mutations in the targeted oncogenes was identified as one of the mechanisms that confer drug resistance. In particular, a group of mutations known as solvent front mutations, such as ALKG1202R and ROS1G2032R, render common resistance to ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. Similar solvent front mutations, such as TRKAG595R and TRKCG623R, have also been identified in cancer patients with rearrangement of NTRK family genes who developed resistance to TRK-targeted therapies. TPX-0005, a compact three-dimensional macrocyclic molecule, was designed to completely locate at the adenine binding site of ATP in order to efficiently target the active kinase conformation and systematically circumvent the steric interference from various clinical resistant mutations, especially the solvent front mutations. TPX-0005 is an orally available and potent ATP-competitive inhibitor against ALK, ROS1, TRKA, TRKB and TRKC recombinant kinases and their corresponding clinical resistant mutants. TPX-0005 demonstrated potent anti-proliferative activity in the range of sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar in a number of human cancer cell lines and engineered stable cell lines expressing the targeted oncogenes or their solvent front mutants, accompanied by inhibition of target phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of downstream effectors such as ERK, AKT and STAT3. In patient derived xenograft tumor models, TPX-0005 treatment resulted in significant regression of tumors harboring the oncogenic ALK, ROS1 and TRKC fusions. Moreover, in a series of mouse xenograft tumor models, TPX-0005 exhibited marked anti-tumor activity not only in tumors harboring the wildtype oncogenic targets but also in tumors harboring the oncogenes with the solvent front mutations via inhibition of the target phosphorylation. Taken together, these pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the potent activities of TPX-0005 against not only wild type oncogenic ALK, ROS1, TRK fusions but also their corresponding solvent front mutations, which will bring in a new therapy for cancer patients resistant to currently available ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors in clinic.']",

Current methods for detection of ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements involve fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) or RT-PCR, each test offering its own advantages and disadvantages, and making it difficult for screening large numbers of patient samples for all three targetable fusions.To explore screening modalities for the simultaneous detection of ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions from a single analyte, we designed a multiplexed, transcript-based assay to detect for presence or absence of fusions. Utilizing a combined 3 over-expression and fusion-specific detection strategy, we developed a single-tube multiplex assay with a quantitative scoring modality that is highly sensitive, reproducible and capable of detecting low abundant ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion transcripts. We successfully validated the assay in 273 NSCLC specimens. For ALK, our results were highly concordant (97.4%) to prior results obtained by IHC (n=189). We confirmed ROS1 (n=7) and RET (n=11) fusion-positive tumors by RT-PCR plus sequencing.

More recently, through the application of advanced genomic approaches a series of new chromosomal rearrangements involving ROS1 gene have been identified in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) tumors. The fusion genes that have been characterized to date, such as for example SCL34A2-ROS1, result in expression of chimeric proteins endowed with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. As already observed for ALK, the ROS positive patient population (ca 1% of NSCLC) is characterized by specific features', ' all tumors are adenocarcinoma and patients tend to be non-smokers and younger that the median age of NSCLC patients.NMS-E628 is an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of ALK kinase activity that is currently being evaluated in phase I/II clinical study. In preclinical models, NMS-E628 potently and selectively inhibits the in vitro and in vivo growth of ALK-driven tumors, with confirmed mechanism of action. Since NMS-E628 is able to pass the blood-brain barrier, the compound was also tested for efficacy in an intracranial xenograft model with ALK positive NSCLC tumors. MRI imaging demonstrated that NMS-E628 was able to effectively and dose-dependently control the growth of these intracranial tumors, leading to increased survival.Due to the structural similarity between ALK and ROS1 kinases, the activity of NMS-E628 on ROS1 was evaluated in biochemical and cellular assays. The compound was found to be a potent, ATP competitive inhibitor of ROS1 (IC50 7 nM). This biochemical potency translates into inhibition of the proliferation of HCC-78, a NSCLC cell line characterized by ROS1-driven activated signaling, due to the presence of the SCL34A2-ROS1 fusion gene. To further characterize the compound in cells, an activated form of ROS1 was expressed in Ba/F3 cells generating an IL3-independent, ROS1-driven tumor model. NMS-E628 strongly inhibits the proliferation of Ba/F3-ROS1 cells in vitro with confirmed dose-dependent decrease of ROS1 phosphorylation. When tested in vivo, the compound was found to induce complete tumor regression after 10-day continuous treatment in nude mice bearing established Ba/F3-ROS1 tumors.Taken together, these data indicate that NMS-E628 might represent a valid therapeutic opportunity for patients bearing ROS1-dependent tumors.']",

Crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was approved by the FDA in 2011 to treat NSCLC in patients harboring ALK translocations as detected by an FDA-approved assay. However, the FDA-approved ALK FISH assay is technically challenging, with failures due to pre-analytic variables. Another approach, intragenic differential expression (IDE), detects translocations by comparing expression levels of the 5 end with the 3 end of target gene transcripts. In this study we developed and evaluated a rapid IDE assay to screen for ALK, ROS1, and RET translocations, independent of the fusion partner.METHODS', ' A total of 419 samples (408 randomly-selected NSCLC clinical samples, ALK positive and ROS1 positive cell lines (2 each), and 7 previously-tested RET-positive clinical samples) were used to develop and evaluate performance characteristics of the IDE assays. To determine IDE scores, levels of ALK, ROS1, and RET expression were first determined by quantitative RT-PCR measurement of the 5- and 3- ends of the respective transcripts. The differences in expression levels were calculated as Ct (Ct5 - Ct3). High Ct values indicate presumptive presence of gene translocations. 212/408 NSCLC samples were analyzed by ALK FISH and EML4-ALK RT-PCR, and 196/408 samples were analyzed by EML4-ALK RT-PCR.RESULTS', ' Thirty-one of the 408 (7.6%) clinical samples tested positive for ALK rearrangements by IDE.

One of 10 ALK FISH positive samples tested negative by both ALK IDE and EML4-ALK RT-PCR analysis (false negative), while one of 202 FISH-negative sample tested positive by both EML4-ALK and ALK IDE. ALK IDE exhibited 94.5% (189/200) concordance with ALK FISH and 96.0% (356/371) concordance with the EML4-ALK assay. For ROS1, both ROS1-positive cell lines and 4/408 (1.0%) NSCLC samples tested positive for ROS1 by IDE. Among the 4 IDE-positive NSCLC samples, 1 was confirmed by ROS1 FISH.

Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib's activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.\"]",

NCCN guideline lists multiple drugs which are particularly effective in the subgroup of patients with specific gene mutation variants, including the fusion transcripts of ALK, ROS1 and RET, and the mutations of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Multiple techniques have been developed to detect fusion transcripts in tumor samples, such as FISH, IHC and PCR assays. FISH is the most accurate method for fusion detection currently. The split probe FISH assay, which does not require the pre-knowledge of what is the fusion partner with ALK for example, can detect unknown ALK fusion products as well. However, it fails to identify which gene is fused with ALK (or other oncogene) in the chimera products, therefore is not informative for the mechanism or drug resistance study. In addition, due to the limitation on the fluoresce dye, it is quite difficult to multiplex fusion FISH probes for different genes into one assay.We describe here a next generation sequencing assay to detect a panel of fusion transcripts and mutations in one single assay. Our single assay can detect the fusion products of ALK, ROS1 and RET with any known or unknown fusion partners, together with the hotspot mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Our assay can identify not only the exact sequence of the unknown fusion partners, but also any mutations within the full coding regions of ALK, ROS1 and RET. This information is critical for the resistance mechanism study and the next generation inhibitor drug development, since about half of the ALK inhibitor resistance was caused by the mutations in ALK gene itself. We have identified a novel ALK fusion gene with a never-reported fusion partner in a lung cancer patient. The xenograft model derived from this patient responds to crizotinib well in the in vivo study (published on Journal of Thoracic Oncology). We have demonstrated that our assay can reliably detect both the novel fusion and the well known EML4-ALK fusion from only 1-2 5um FFPE slides of the lung tumor tissues, together with other possible fusions and mutations as well.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Methods', '  Patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ROS1 rearrangement, as determined using a break-apart FISH assay, were recruited into an expansion cohort of a phase 1 study of crizotinib.

The disease control rate (DCR; stable disease [SD] + partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) was evaluated at 8 weeks.  Results', '  Thirteen patients within the ROS expansion cohort received crizotinib and all were evaluable for response. The median age was 47 yrs (range 3172), and all but one of the patients were never-smokers.

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies. Entrectinib is currently the subject of an ongoing global Phase 2 basket study enrolling patients across multiple tumor histologies containing TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.']",

Although a relatively rare disease in the United States and Europe, the incidence of intrahepatic CCA is on the rise with unknown causes. CCA incidence is higher in Asia and the etiology is associated with infections such as liver fluke and hepatitis B/C. Prognosis at diagnosis is poor with median survival time of < 1 year, and only 10-20% of patients are eligible for tumor resection at diagnosis. This study examined the prevalence of MET over-expression, activating single point mutations of KRAS and IDH1/2, and ROS1 gene fusions in 100 intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA FFPE tumor tissues obtained from non-Asian (n=40) and Asian (n=60) patients. Immunohistochemistry performed with an anti-MET-specific antibody (A2) demonstrated that MET is expressed in the majority of all intrahepatic CCA samples analyzed, with 50% of samples reported with membranocytoplasmic scores of 2+ (moderate intensity) or 3+ (strong intensity) on a 0-3+ scale. Interestingly, most non-malignant bile ducts and much vascular endothelia also stained lightly positive for MET. To determine mutation frequencies of KRAS and IDH1/2, competitive allele-specific Taqman PCR (castPCR) was performed on DNA extracted from FFPE CCA tissue (limit of mutation detection 0.1%). Fourteen KRAS activating mutations (G12S, G12R, G12A, G13C, G13S, G13R, G12D, G13D, G12V, G12C, Q61R, Q61L, Q61H (c.183A>C and c.183A>T for Q61H), 5 IDH1 mutations (R132G, R132S, R132H, R132C, R132L), and 5 IDH2 mutations (R172G, R172M, R172K, R172W, R172S) were analyzed. Overall, 25% of analyzed samples were positive for KRAS mutation, and G12D was the predominant mutation (60%). One-third of Asian samples were positive for KRAS mutation, whereas less than one-fifth of non-Asian samples contained KRAS mutations. For IDH1, the frequency of mutation was less than 10% overall, and the majority of patients with IDH1 mutations were non-Asian. The R132C mutation was the predominant IDH1 mutation, and all tissues that were positive for IDH1 mutations were of intrahepatic origin. Interestingly, 2 out of the 7 samples positive for IDH1 mutations (R132C) were also positive for G12D KRAS mutation. There is no trend of MET expression correlating with either KRAS or IDH1 mutations. IDH2 analyses by castPCR and FISH studies examining ROS1 gene fusion are ongoing. Based on these data, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases and their signaling pathways such as MET and ROS1 may merit clinical evaluation in CCA patients.

We discuss the development of an assay for GI samples and immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening efficiency rates in a clinical cohort of 157 GI samples. Methods', ' The occurrence of NTRK, ROS1, and ALK gene fusions in GI tumors was studied from Ignyta internal and partner collaborations. We developed a 2-step diagnostic test to identify fusions in FFPE clinical specimens. IHC screening using a pan-receptor tyrosine kinase cocktail of antibodies precedes an RNA-based anchored multiplex PCR next generation sequencing (NGS) assay. Results', ' IHC positivity rates ranged from 0 to 24 percent depending on histology and averaging 8% positivity rate across 15 tumor locations. The screen is particularly effective in cholangiocarcinoma, colon, esophagus, gastric, peritoneum, rectum and small bowel. It was highest in pancreas (24%). Out of 157 GI samples, no instances were detected where the IHC was screened negative and gene fusions were observed by NGS. The IHC cocktail enriches detection of the patient population for gene fusions over 11-fold and has a 100% negative predictive value. Conclusions', ' This 2-step assay is an efficient method for detection of gene rearrangements in both high-volume clinical testing and studies of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens.

        "Background":"['The enormous success of kinase inhibitors in the treatment of cancer is being rapidly overshadowed by the emergence of drug resistance. Drug-resistant mutations increase the kinases binding affinity with ATP, shifting them to the active conformation, and/or introduce new steric hindrance that interferes with the inhibitor structural motifs outside the highly conserved ATP binding boundary. Most kinase inhibitors are oversized, and often have motifs close to or across the gatekeeper to the hydrophobic back pocket to gain high potency, rendering them vulnerable to the clinical gatekeeper mutations, such as ALK L1196M, EGFR T790M, and ABL T315I. Another common vulnerability of kinase inhibitors is interaction with the conserved glycine residue at the hinge C-terminal that forms a hydrophobic sandwich with the kinase 1 sheet. Kinase inhibitors often use an aromatic ring or a flat motif to go through this narrow sandwich to the solvent exposure area. Alterations at the conserved glycine commonly referred to as solvent-front mutations clash with the inhibitor motif inside the sandwich, underlying clinical resistance. For example, ALK G1202R confers a common resistance to crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors, ROS1 G2032R and TRKA G595R render resistances to crizotinib and entrectinib, respectively. Overall, the traditionally designed, oversized kinase inhibitors are destined to develop many different resistance profiles in the clinic. Continuously introducing new inhibitors to overcome new evolving mutations is becoming increasingly hard to sustain. Here, we propose targeting resistance-driven kinase active conformation with a compact molecule that is completely located inside the ATP binding boundary as a novel strategy to tackle the ever evolving mutation resistances. We designed TPX-0005, a novel three-dimensional macrocycle with a much smaller size (MW <370) than current ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors in the clinic. Efficiently targeting the center of the ATP binding site avoids the steric interference with mutations outside the ATP binding boundary. As expected, TPX-0005 potently inhibited WT ALK (IC50 1.01 nM) and mutant ALKs including ALKG1202R (1.26 nM) and ALKL1196M (1.08 nM). TPX-0005 demonstrated even stronger potency against the closely related kinases ROS1 (ROS1 WT 0.07 nM and ROS1 G2032R 0.456 nM), and TRK family (TRKA 0.826 nM, TRKB 0.052 nM, and TRKC 0.096 nM). TPX-0005 potently inhibited the phosphorylation of LMNA-TRKA G595R (IC50 < 1 nM) in NIH3T3 LMNA-TRKA G595R cells. Taken together, TPX-0005 is a novel ALK/ROS1/TRK inhibitor and can effectively overcome a broad spectrum of acquired resistance mutations, especially the solvent front mutants ALK G1202R, ROS1 G2032R and TRKA G595R.']",

Additionally, the test may be of utility for those patients who need mutation results quickly or for whom tissue may be unavailable or insufficient for molecular testing. This is especially true for patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this report we will update on new test concepts created using the recently available design software engine for ddPCR assays. Specifically, we will describe studies on the development of single-reaction, multiplexed assays for the respective detection of ROS1 (up to 11 variants), RET (up to 8 variants) and EML4-ALK (v1 - v3). Design considerations, specificity and sensitivity, as well as reproducibility and robustness studies for these complex assays will be reviewed. Similar studies were conducted for the development of the commercially available test for the EML4-ALK fusion variants. EML4-ALK concordance studies compared the fusions found in blood with known positives and negatives found using FISH and PCR based methods (n=24 evaluable matched pair samples). Clinical sensitivity, specificity and concordance were 85%, 100% and 92% respectively. In this study we also report on test performance of the ALK RNA fusion test over 3 consecutive months of testing. Of note, we have delivered greater than 95% of tests (n = 272 samples) with an observed positive sample frequency of 2%. The robust detection of rare variant, RNA fusions from plasma within 72 hours represents a molecular testing option of value to patients with NSCLC and their physicians.']",

However, despite crizotinib has shown remarkable initial responses, cancers eventually develop resistance to crizotinib. In a recent report of a clinical resistance to crizotinib, G2032R mutation in ROS1 kinase domain was identified, which is analogous to the G1202R mutation found in crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung cancers. To further identify the mechanism of resistance to crizotinib in ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC, we established a model of acquired resistance by ENU mutagenesis screening using CD74-ROS1 addicted Ba/F3 cell line models. As the results, we identified several novel crizotinib resistance mutations including G2032R mutation. To overcome the resistance, we performed the drug screening with small molecular inhibitors, and identified several inhibitors including Foretinib, cMET/VEGFR inhibitor, effectively inhibit the survival of CD74-ROS1 expressing cells.

Crizotinib, ALK/ROS1/cMET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), showed high effect against ROS1-rearranged NSCLC in the clinical trials and is approved in US and EU. However, the cancers inevitably relapse due to the acquired resistance such as ROS1-G2032R mutation. We previously reported that cabozantinib could overcome those secondary mutations mediated crizotinib-resistance. Based on this finding, we tried to establish cabozantinib-resistant ROS1 mutant cells by ENU mutagenesis screening. Surprisingly, we found out a few CD74-ROS1 mutant clones that only grew in the presence of low-dose cabozantinib. Namely, these mutant clones were “addicted” to cabozantinib. When the fluorescent labeled cabozantinib addicted ROS1 mutant cells were co-cultured with non-addicted CD74-ROS1-WT-BaF3 cell in the presence or absence of low-dose cabozantinib, the drug-addicted cells became dominant in the low-dose cabozantinib, and CD74-ROS1-WT cells became dominant in the absence of it. To analyze the molecular mechanism of “drug-addiction” in the addicted CD74-ROS1 mutant cells, we performed comprehensive analysis such as inhibitor screening, cDNA microarray, and phosphoproteome analysis. As the result, we observed that the expression and phosphorylation of CD74-ROS1 in the addicted cells were excessively upregulated within 24 hours after removal of cabozantinib or other ROS1 inhibitors, such as crizotinib or lorlatinib. We also observed that the apoptosis was induced in these cells upon ROS1 inhibitor removal, whereas ROS1 mediated growth signaling were simultaneously activated. Consistent with this, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of both cell survival and cell death related genes were changed by ROS1 inhibitor removal. Furthermore, we identified that several proteins were highly phosphorylated by excessive ROS1 activation originated from ROS1 inhibitor removal. These observations suggest that these drug-addicted cells were died by excessive oncogenic signaling, and the appropriate oncogene signaling by low-dose TKI made them survive and grow without inducing apoptosis. Thus, the excessive oncogene signaling has “double-edged sword” characteristics for cancer cell viability and those characteristics could be a new therapeutic target.']",

While most biomarker-selected pts derive some clinical benefit from initial treatment with a TKI, most will eventually develop resistance. PF-06463922 is a selective TKI of ALK and ROS1 that preclinically demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of mutations that confer resistance to treatment with other TKIs.

While tumors harboring ALK fusions are highly sensitive to crizotinib, emerging data have demonstrated that individuals with ROS1 or RET fusions may also benefit from inhibitors targeting these two kinases. A new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors has been recently described. The two main methods to identify translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) are labor intensive and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for lung cancer analysis are biopsies making the study of more than one fusion gene rather difficult. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a workflow based on AmpliSeq technology to comprehensively profile ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 chromosomal translocations in lung tumors. Two hundred lung cancer retrospective samples, including tumor biopsy, were collected from 12 laboratories - the OncoNetwork Consortium. All the samples were previously characterized by orthologous techniques (FISH, IHC, RT-PCR and/or MassArray). More than 30 ALK positive samples were selected. The panel targets over 70 fusion transcripts associated with ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 genes. The panel also includes 5 and 3 gene expression assays for each gene as indicators of a translocation event and assays for 5 internal control genes. The workflow is compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, requiring only 10ng of total RNA and able to multiplex up to 16 libraries on a single Ion 318 chip. A dedicated data analysis pipeline using the Ion Reporter software 4.2 was evaluated. Serial dilutions of cell lines RNA harboring known fusion events, in normal RNA showed that the methodology had 1% mutant RNA limit of detection. A second dilution experiment using RNA extracted from FFPE lung fusion positive samples diluted in a negative FFPE sample showed a detection limit of 15%. The use of a common control fusion positive RNA samples among all the consortia laboratories showed 100% reproducibility. Concordance study was performed using 200 FFPE samples previously characterized with standard method. A concordance of >98% was obtained between the methodologies. The discordant results are currently under study. A negative FFPE samples was run as single test on an Ion 318 chip on to evaluate the possibility of false positive results due to high number of reads. No false positive was detected in this experiment. In this study we present a workflow that provides a robust, reproducible and accurate comprehensive genetic screening tool well suited for FFPE lung tumor biopsies, in a fast and cost-efficient manner.

        "Background":"['The use of kinase inhibitors directed at dominant oncogenes has proven a successful treatment strategy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK gene fusions, but intrinsic or acquired drug resistance limits clinical benefit. We recently identified a novel class of oncogenes generated by translocations of the NTRK1 gene, which encodes the TRKA receptor tyrosine kinase. ROS1 and RET gene fusions represent additional oncogene targets in lung cancer and gene fusion positive tumors currently comprise 10% of lung adenocarcinomas. Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that EGFR signaling can mediate both intrinsic and acquired resistance in a ROS1+ NSCLC cell line. We asked whether EGFR might play a common role in other NSCLC cell lines harboring gene fusions with the aim of developing combination therapies that may delay drug resistance to oncogene-targeted kinase inhibitors in these tumors. We have observed high protein expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in NSCLC cell lines positive for ALK (H3122, H2228, and STE-1), ROS1 (HCC78 and CUTO-2), RET (LC-2/Ad), and NTRK1 gene fusions (CUTO-3), and in a NTRK1 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. We observed increased inhibition of downstream signaling and in vitro cellular proliferation with the addition of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in these gene fusion positive cell lines. Furthermore, stimulation of EGFR with EGF rescues targeted inhibition with oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors in the critical downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK. Inhibition of cellular proliferation of these cell lines using oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors was also rescued by stimulation of EGFR. Interestingly, we observed transactivation of the TRKA and RET kinase domains by EGFR stimulation in the CUTO-3 and LC-2/Ad cell lines, respectively, despite treatment with a TRKA or RET kinase inhibitor. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that EGFR and the chimeric protein RIP-TRKA (encoded by the fusion gene MPRIP-NTRK1) associate in the CUTO-3 cells or when ectopically expressed in 293T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate a critical role for EGFR in gene fusion positive lung cancer and suggest that signaling via this receptor may provide a survival mechanism for cancer cells treated with an oncogene-specific kinase inhibitor. Further investigation of EGFR inhibition in addition to oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors may be warranted.']",

        "Background":"['ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors have achieved marked efficacy in treating cancer patients expressing abnormal ALK, ROS1 or NTRK genes. However, the initial success of these therapies is rapidly overshadowed with the development of acquired resistance. In addition, approximately 30-40% of ALK + or ROS1+ NSCLC patients fail to respond to initial crizotinib treatment, representing intrinsic resistance. Target gene amplification, acquired resistance mutations, bypass signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis are the common resistance mechanisms. None of the current ALK, ROS1 or TRK inhibitors can overcome bypass or EMT-based resistance when applied as a single agent therapy. TPX-0005 is a potent kinase inhibitor against WT and mutated ALK, ROS1 and TRK family kinases, especially the clinically significant solvent front mutations. At clinically relevant concentrations, TPX-0005 also inhibits JAK2, SRC and FAK that are important targets in modulating multiple resistance mechanisms. H2228 lung cancer cell line endogenously expresses EML4-ALK v3 and was reported to be resistant to ALK inhibitor TAE684. Upregulation of the bypass signaling kinase EGFR, EMT marker vimentin, and cancer stem-like marker CD44 was reported in H2228 cells, likely leading to intrinsic resistance to ALK inhibitors. In the anti-proliferation assay, both crizotinib and ceritinib were resistant in H2228 cells with IC50 values around 1000 nM, however, TPX-0005 was able to overcome the intrinsic resistance with an IC50 of 100 nM. In H2228 cells, TPX-0005 suppressed the phosphorylation of SRC, FAK and paxillin with IC50 values in a range of 80-100 nM, and downregulated the expression of EGFR, CD44, and vimentin with IC50 values around 100 nM. In addition, TPX-0005 inhibited the phosphorylation of the oncogenic transcription/translation factor YB-1 with an IC50 value around 100 nM in H2228 cells. YB-1 is involved in many aspects of gene expression control that lead to tumor cell growth and drug resistance, including modulation of EGFR upregulation, EMT, and cancer stemness. Therefore, it was postulated that inhibition of SRC/FAK by TPX-0005 suppressed the phosphorylation of YB-1, leading to the downregulation of EGFR, CD44 and vimentin, and eventually to anti-proliferation effect on H2228 cells. TPX-0005 demonstrated an in vitro anti-metastatic activity by inhibiting cell migration in both H2228 cells and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells.

Different from non-small cell lung cancer, SCLC is characterized by a high proliferation rate and early metastasis. Only about 25% of patients with limited stage disease will be cured after first-line standard treatment and majority of the patients will relapse after initial sensitivity to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The highly complex genetic landscape of SCLC may be the reason for its resistance to conventional therapy but the details are still unclear. Methods', ' Nine patients with SCLC received platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were included in this study. According to the prognosis, patients were classified into two groups', ' poor prognosis group (PP group, PFS < 6 months, n = 5) and better prognosis group (BP group, PFS > 24 months, n = 4). Tumor DNA was isolated from pre-treatment paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and subjected to enrichment for a 1.15M size panel cover exon regions from 1,086 genes. Followed by next generation sequencing on an Illumina X10 platform, the captured sequencing data was further processed using bioinformatics analysis to identify somatic mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), short insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variation (CNV). Changes in tumor DNA were compared with clinical efficiency. Results', ' We show that the tumor mutation burden in PP group is higher than the BP group (p = 0.06).

In addition, TP53 loss is more frequently appeared in the PP group. Conclusions', ' Our results suggest that high mutation burden status of 12 genes (PTEN, TP53, JAK2, BCL2, CCNE1, EGFR, ROS1, NTRK3, MYC, FGFR1, RANBP2, and CREBBP) might correlate with poor prognosis of small cell lung cancer.']",

Life Technologies and OncoNetwork consortium collaborated for the development of a lung fusion panel based on Ion AmpliSeq RNA chemistry. The OncoNetwork consortium is comprised of twelve -translational cancer research institutes with many years of experience in adopting the latest molecular techniques for lung therapy research. Material and Methods', \" Consortia's requirements for the panel development \", \" 1) detect all variants of ALK, ROS1, or RET fusion transcripts described in COSMIC in a single reaction using 10 ng of total RNA 2) Include 5 and 3 ALK, ROS1, RET gene expression assays as an indicator of a translocation at this gene. 3) Include endogenous RNA assay controls to determine if the quality of the results could be affected by RNA quality. 4) Provide similar results on archived FFPE samples tested by FISH. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H2228 (EML4-ALK positive), HCC78 (SLC4A2-ROS1 positive ) ,LC-2/ad (CCDC6-RET positive) and Ambion FirstChoice Human Brain Reference (HBR) RNA was used as positive and negative control for the study. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue was isolated using different extraction methods. After amplification using Ion AmpliSeq RNA chemistry samples were sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer using the Ion PGM 200 Sequencing Kit. The presence of the fusions was confirmed by custom TaqMan gene expression assays when possible. Preliminary results of the panel on ALK or ROS1 or RET positive cell lines and FFPE archived cancer research samples gave good concordance with FISH results. Expected negative samples were confirmed negative. We found a KIF5B-RET fusion positive sample in a sample not previously tested for RET fusions. Two of the expected positive samples by FISH were found negative due to limited amount to tumor cells present in the sample. Cell line RNA dilutions were performed to determine the panel's limit of detection. We demonstrate a limit of detection of 1 % tumor RNA in the presence of 99 % normal RNA using the panel with 10 ng of RNA extracted by cell lines. Gene expression controls work well as an indicator of the RNA quality and of the translocation presence. The Ion AmpliSeq RNA lung cancer fusion panel workflow is easier and faster to perform in comparison to the FISH method.

Methods', ' To identify targetable co-dependencies or cooperating pathways for RET fusion-positive lung cancers, we performed high-throughput chemical and genetic screens to find FDA-approved drugs or genes that when inhibited, would synergize with cabozantinib in RET fusion-positive lung cancer cell lines. In addition we performed NGS of a pair of pre-treatment and post-cabozantinib progression samples. Results', ' We identified EGFR siRNAs and anti-EGFR drugs as synergistic with cabozantinib. Combinations of drugs that target EGFR (cetuximab, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) and RET (cabozantinib, CEP-32496, lenvatinib, vandetanib) were more effective at reducing growth of RET cell lines than any single agent in vitro and in xenograft models. Cabozantinib treatment of RET fusion-positive cell lines inhibited EGFR and RET phosphorylation, an observation not seen in RET wild-type cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that RET and EGFR interact. Ectopic expression of CCDC6-RET in NIH-3T3 or human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in upregulation of multiple ERBB receptors and ligands (not seen in a ROS1 fusion-positive cell line) and a concomitant increase in EGFR stability. Treatment with ERBB pathway ligands or overexpression of EGFR decreased sensitivity to cabozantinib in two RET fusion-positive cell lines. Finally, sequencing of a pair of pre-treatment and post-progression samples from a lung cancer patient treated with cabozantinib revealed acquired amplification of EGFR in the latter sample. Conclusions', ' Taken together, these results suggest that the tumorigenic potential of RET fusion oncogenes is dependent on deregulation of ERBB-activated pathways and that a combination of RET and EGFR drugs could be more effective in treating RET fusion-positive tumors.

Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib.

However, for NGS to achieve its full utility in the clinic, robust analytical validation and performance comparisons against established detection methodologies are required for each class of targetable genomic alteration.Methods', ' Previously, we reported on the development and validation of an NGS-based diagnostic test for accurate detection of clinically-relevant genomic alterations across all exons of 287 cancer genes in routine FFPE specimens (Frampton, et. al, Nat. Biotech. Oct 2013). Here, we present systematic validation of fusion gene detection in the test, enabled by hybrid-selection and deep sequencing of commonly rearranged introns in 19 (or, in an alternative version, 31) genes. We created reference samples reflecting key determinants of detection accuracy for gene fusions, including extent of stromal admixture and variety of partner genes', ' We obtained 5 solid tumor fusion-bearing cell-lines (2 ALK, 1 RET, 1 ROS1, 1 TMPRSS2) and mixed these into 23 variably sized pools, such that each fusion was represented at 100%, 50%, 33%, 25%, and 20% simulated cellular fraction at least once. Gene fusions were called if a well-mapped cluster of 5 chimeric reads or greater was observed in a targeted intron. We then verified that the observed performance translated to FFPE clinical samples by examining test concordance in 43 tumors (20+/23-) characterized for ALK rearrangement by FISH. Finally, we evaluated the test broadly by assessing detection prevalence of the three most common gene fusions (ALK, ROS1, RET) in 724 lung adenocarcinoma FFPE patient samples, including needle biopsies.Results', ' Of 32 tested gene fusion instances in the 28 cell-lines samples, all were successfully detected (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 89%-100%), with no false positive calls. Robust performance translated to FFPE', ' of the 20 ALK FISH+ specimens, 18 were unequivocally (+) by NGS, with remaining 2 specimens showing sub-threshold evidence of the events. 22/23 FISH- specimens were NGS-, with the remaining specimen an apparent false (-) by FISH. Clinical lung adenocarcinoma samples showed 5% ALK, 3% RET, and 2% ROS1 rearrangement rate respectively, in line with published data.Conclusions', ' We present rigorous validation and performance benchmarks for efficient targeted fusion gene detection for solid tumors in an NGS-based test for use in clinical oncology. Given the ability of NGS to detect a much broader range of genomic alterations than currently available technologies, particularly on limited tissue, this type of testing can be a direct component of patient care and potentially expand targeted treatment options.']",

Lung cancers were prevented by reintroducing epithelial-cell IKK, depleting macrophages or depleting lymphocytes. This study not only provides a novel model for studying the pathogenesis, treatment, early detection, and prevention of human lung SCCs, but also demonstrates how a single mutation in IKK elicits malignancy through the combined epithelial-cell-autonomous and immune mechanisms.']",

        "Background":"['Under normal conditions MET receptor activation, internalization, and degradation is a highly controlled process regulated by the binding of its ligand, HGF. In many cancers however, MET becomes highly dysregulated, and MET overexpression, with or without gene amplification, is associated with a poorer prognosis. Aberrant activation of MET can also occur through mutation, or increased autocrine or paracrine HGF production. MET activation leads to increased oncogenic activities including cell migration, proliferation, invasion, survival, tumor neovascularization and decreased apoptosis. Several inhibitors of MET, including type I and type II kinase inhibitors, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. LY2801653 is a type II MET kinase inhibitor being investigated in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037). In addition to MET, LY2801653 also inhibits ROS1 kinase, and the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2, with cell-based IC50 of 23nM and 7nM respectively. ROS1 is an orphan receptor that can be constitutively activated as a fusion protein either by genomic microdeletion or translocation. ROS1 fusion proteins are found in glioblastoma, NSCLC and cholangiocarcinoma. MKNK1/2 are kinases downstream of ERK and p38 and are capable of regulating translation through the direct phosphorylation of eIF4E. Increased MKNK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF4E is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is correlated with a poor prognosis. This study evaluated the relative inhibitory effects of LY2801653, Crizotinib, XL184, XL880, and PF4217903 in a variety of cell lines against MET, ROS1, MKNK1/2, ERK, and other downstream molecules. In HCC78, a ROS1-fusion protein bearing cell line, and in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the FIG-ROS(s) fusion, LY2801653, XL184 and XL880 were more potent inhibitors of ROS1 compared with Crizotinib. Moreover, LY2801653 and Crizotinib were both efficacious in NIH3T3 FIG-ROS(s) xenografts, although LY2801653 was more potent in reducing p-ROS1 in these tumors than Crizotinib. In NCI-H2122 and Hs746T cells (mutated MET), A2780 cells (MET-negative), KP-4 cells (MET autocrine), H441 cells (HGF-independent; MET positive), HCT116 (mutated KRAS), and the cholangiocarcinoma cell lines EGI-1 and TFK-1, LY2801653 demonstrated more potent inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 versus treatment with XL184 and XL880, while Crizotinib had no observed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2. LY2801653 also showed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 in MET-amplified MKN45 cells. These findings suggests there may be clinical merits to testing LY2801653 in tumor types associated with increased MKNK1/2 activity or ROS1 fusion proteins alone, or in conjunction with aberrant MET activity, such as colorectal carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma.']",

Among 17 recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 14 skipping in the proto-oncogene MET as highly likely to be a cancer driver. The number of somatic mutations and expression outliers varied markedly between individual cancers and was strongly correlated with smoking history of patients. We identified genomic blocks within which gene expression levels were consistently increased or decreased that could be explained by copy number alterations in samples.

We performed ultra-deep NGS on extracted cfDNA using a customized Illumina library preparation, hybrid capture panel covering 37 lung cancer related genes (complete exons and partial introns), and ultra-deep sequencing (HiSeq4000). Mean sequencing depth was 50,000X (150 million, 150bp reads per sample). After specialized consensus-based error correction for low allele frequency (AF) genomic alterations, the median unique DNA molecules per position were 3,500. The mean sequence error rate was reduced by 20-fold to 0.002%, enabling the confident call of a driver mutation as low as 0.03%. In a subset of cases, paired plasma droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed for common EGFR and KRAS mutations using a validated assay.Blinded to tumor genotype, plasma NGS detected SNVs (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF), indels (EGFR, ERBB2), and fusions (ALK, ROS1) as well as significant copy number gains (CNG) (ERBB2, MET).

Crizotinib achieved robust objective response rates of approximately 60% in ALK+ NSCLC and significantly improved progression free survival compared to chemotherapy. The emergence of secondary mutations within the ALK kinase domain or the activation of compensatory signaling pathways in crizotinib and other ALKi refractory tumors prompted searches for next generation of ALKi active against resistance mutations as single agents or in combination with other treatments. Such effort led to our recent discovery of PF-06463922, an ALK/ROS1 inhibitor with greatly improved ALK potency, brain penetration, and broad spectrum activity against all known clinical ALKi-resistant mutations. PF-06463922 is being tested in a Phase I clinical trial in both ALK+ and ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC in treatment naive or ALKi relapsed patients.In our current preclinical study, we explored rational combination strategies to further improve the efficacy of PF-06463922 in ALKi resistant cells or tumors. Our results show that compared to PF-06463922 alone, the combination of this compound with PI3K pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384 (PI3K/mTOR), GDC0941 (pan-PI3K) or GDC0032 (beta-sparing) leads to more robust anti-proliferative activity in vitro and greater duration of efficacy in vivo in the ALKi resistant models.

Here, we report rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) amplification as a novel genetic abnormality in a young patient with non-small cell lung cancer. This male patient was a never smoker and was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinorma at the age of 18. He initially presented with refractory cough and persistent left lung lesions. Pathology was consistent with lung adenocarcinorma, poorly differentiated. Extensive molecular testing was negative for common genetic alterations in K-RAS, EGFR, ALK, HER2, RET, AKT, PIK3CA, BRAF and ROS1. His tumor was subsequently subjected to next generation DNA sequencing (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) targeting a cohort of more than 180 cancer-related genes. This analysis identified rictor amplification of at least 6 copies as the sole DNA abnormality. Immunohistochemistry further documented rictor overexpression in the patient's lung tumor. The neoplastic lung tissue exhibited diffuse and strong cytoplasmic staining for rictor, compared to surrounding non-neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, the tumor tissue showed diffuse overexpression of phospho-S473 Akt, an essential downstream target of rictor.Rictor is a key component of mTORC2 complex, where it modifies actin cytoskeleton organization, cell proliferation and survival. Activation of rictor signaling has been suggested to play critical roles in regulating cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers and gliomas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rictor amplification in lung cancer. Moreover, we found that blockade of the rictor-mTORC2 pathway by siRNA-mediated rictor knockdown or with pharmacological inhibitors led to decreased phosphorylation of S473-AKT and growth inhibition in lung cancer cell lines. Thus, rictor amplification may represent a potential novel target in lung cancer. We will perform further studies to determine whether rictor amplification is a unique molecular subtype of lung cancer. Further, we hope to identify which targeted drugs are active against tumors with rictor amplification and overexpression.\"]",

Many of these alleles appear more relevant to a particularly histological type of lung cancer.With the aim of identifying novel lung cancer susceptibility loci, The Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL), the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3) have undertaken a very large collaborative GWAS across 29 lung cancer studies, including analysis of the predominant lung cancer histological subtypes.MethodsIn collaboration with the Center for Disease Research (CIDR), TRICL, ILCCO and LC3 have genotyped 18,000 case-control pairs on the GAME-On Oncoarray. SNP imputation was undertaken using the 1,000 Genomes v3 reference panel, followed by logistic regression of each genetic variant with lung cancer and considering ancestry inferred by genetic profile to correct for cryptic population structure. The OncoArray and our previous GWAS results were combined using meta-analysis. This allowed for a GWAS of 10,155,682 SNPs for 25,655 lung cancer cases and 52,451 controls, as well as histology specific analysis of 6,629 squamous cell and 9,817 adenocarcinomas. Alternate genotyping techniques (Affymetrix, Taqman) were used to confirm the fidelity of the genotyping for variants of interest.ResultsWe have identified common genetic variants exceeding genome wide significance (p<510-8) at eleven novel susceptibility loci. This included two associated with overall lung cancer (1p31, 19q13), eight with lung adenocarcinomas (3q28, 6p25, 8p12, 9p21, 10q25, 11q23, 15q21, 20q13) and one with squamous-cell lung carcinomas (10q24). These genetic variants are located near several intriguing candidate genes, such as telomere function genes (OBFC1, RTEL1), nicotine metabolism genes (CYP2A6), genes somatically mutated in lung cancer (NRG1) and genetic susceptibility loci linked to other cancers (IRF4, CDNK2A). In additional, we noted several borderline (p<10-6) associations with common variants located near nicotine addiction genes (CHRNB2, CHRNA2, CHRNA4, DBH) and other genes somatically translocated in lung cancer (ROS1). Integration of eQTL databases suggests that many of the associated genetic variants influence gene expression levels of these candidate genes.ConclusionWe have identified eleven novel lung cancer susceptibility loci, doubling the number implicated by GWAS. These genetic variants were common (MAF 0.05-0.49) with modest to small genetic effects (OR's 1.10-1.17). Further expansion of GWAS efforts, particularly within histological subtypes of lung cancer, is likely to identify additional susceptibility loci and further increase our understanding of lung cancer aetiology.\"]",

Methods', ' The performance of a custom 23 gene multiplex amplification hot spot panel, based on Ion AmpliSeq Technology, was evaluated for the analysis of tumor DNA extracted from FFPE (Formalin Fixed Parraffin Embedded) tissue. Furthermore the Ion AmpliSeq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel was used for fusion RNA transcript analysis. Tumors mutation spectrum was determined in a cohort of 502 patients with NSCLC using the aforementioned targeted gene panels. Results', ' The panel used for tumor DNA analysis in this study exhibit high rates (100%) of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility at a mutation frequency of 3%. At least one DNA mutation was detected in 374 patients (74.5%) and an RNA fusion was identified in 16 patients, (3.2%). In total, alterations in a cancer driver gene were identified (including point mutations, gene rearrangements and MET amplifications) in 77.6% of the tumors tested. Among the NSCLC patients, 13.5% (68/502) presented a mutation in a gene with approved targeted therapy (EGFR, ALK ROS1) and 9.4% had an alteration in a gene related to emerging targeted therapies according the NCCN guidelines. These alterations include ERBB2, BRAF and MET mutations, MET amplification and RET rearrangements. The remaining 51.6% of the patients had a mutation in a gene that could be related to an off label therapy or give them access to a clinical trial.

This is of particular importance in lung cancer, where a third of patients may have insufficient biopsies for molecular analyses and may be ineligible for approved targeted therapies. However, the fraction of ctDNA obtained from a blood sample is often low ( < 1.0%) and can be difficult to detect with current approaches. Additionally, most methods to detect ctDNA interrogate single hot spot mutations or a few genetic alterations.   Methods', '   To overcome these issues, we developed comprehensive ctDNA approaches to detect somatic sequence mutations, translocations, and amplifications at low allele frequencies in the circulation of cancer patients. These analyses span 63 well-established cancer genes, including BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, PI3KCA,FGFR,KRAS and NRAS, translocations in ALK, EGFR, NTRK1,RET and ROS1, and amplification of MET and ERBB2. This comprehensive panel covers many recognized resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies and provides a method to understand patterns of intrinsic and acquired resistance in oncogene defined lung cancer. To evaluate this approach, we performed dilution series using tumor-derived DNA, containing well-characterized somatic mutations, in the presence of wild-type DNA in 3-5ml of plasma from 90 patients with late-stage lung cancer.   Results', '   We were able to detect sequence alterations at levels of > 0.01% with a specificity of > 99.9%. Further analyses demonstrated high concordance between the somatic sequence mutations and translocations identified in the tumor sample and those identified in the plasma, including alterations in driver genes as well as those related to acquired resistance to targeted therapies. 70 patients had serial samples, and within this cohort, we demonstrated evolution of resistance clones that predict radiographic increases in tumor burden.

        "Background":"['The discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 kinase rearrangement serve as predictive biomarkers for clinical response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Unfortunately, resistance to TKIs inevitably occurs within years of treatment. The emergence of resistance mutations and bypass receptor tyrosine kinase tracks have been implicated in targeted therapy resistance, however, a large proportion of patients who relapsed on TKIs do not harbor resistance mutations or additional receptor tyrosine kinase tracks. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is generally recognized as a transcriptional factor which encodes metabolic enzymes and mediates biochemical response to environmental xenobiotic pollutants. However, the association of AhR and sensitivity to targeted therapy has not been reported and the molecular mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy remains to be elucidated. By analyzing TCGA database and immunohistochemistry staining of relapsed biopsy samples, we identified that dysregulation of AhR conferred resistance to TKIs. qPCR and Western blot screening of a panel of NSCLC cell lines suggested that the AhRlow cells were sensitive to EGFR TKIs, whereas the AhRhigh cells did not. Simultaneously inhibition of AhR and EGFR signaling restored the sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in the AhRhigh cells. Moreover, overexpression of AhR also led to resistance to ALK and ROS1 TKIs by restoring phosphorylation of Akt and Erk. Measurement of endogenous AhR ligand content by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the patients had more kynurenine (Kyn) in their serum after disease relapse and progression. The AhR-associated targeted therapy resistance did not require its transcriptional activity because the AhRΔNLS truncated mutant also drives resistance. By using large scale shRNAs screening, we showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylated Akt and Erk and mediates AhR-associated targeted therapy resistance. Bioinformatics analysis and immunoprecipitation assay showed that Src immediately underwent phosphorylation upon AhR ligands treatment through interacting with the SH2 domain of AhR. The phospho-protein kinase array and in vitro kinase assay revealed that Jak2 kinase directly phosphorylated Src, in which the liganded AhR provided docking sites for Jak2 and Src interaction. Collectively, our study revealed an uncovered, transcription-independent function of AhR. The liganded AhR recruits Src and provides docking sites for Jak2-Src interaction, in which the phosphorylated Src acts as a resistance bypass track. Kyn content might be a biomarker to predict resistance to targeted therapy and targeting AhR helps to overcome resistance.']",

Additional oncogene aberrations, including RET, ROS1, and NRG1 fusions, skipping of exon 14 of MET, and mutations in BRAF, HER2, NF1, and MEK1, were recently added to the list of such “druggable” driver oncogene aberrations, and their responses to targeted therapies are currently being evaluated in several clinical trials. On the other hand, about 30% and 50% of LADCs in patients in Japan and Europe/USA, respectively, lack the driver oncogene aberrations listed above. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies, such as those that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells with non-oncogene aberrations, are urgently required. In this presentation, we show gene mutation profiles according to driver oncogenes and summarize the frequencies of those aberrations.

Methods', '  We identified patients treated at MSKCC from 2009-2013 whose lung adenocarcinomas harbored two oncogenic drivers. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed via an institutional algorithm involving 1 of the following', ' mutational hotspot testing (91 mutations in EGFR, HER2, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, PIK3CA and AKT1), multiplex sizing assays (insertions/deletions in EGFR and HER2), and break apart FISH tests (fusions involving ALK, ROS1 and RET). Overall survival (OS) and duration of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (EGFR-mutant subgroup) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Outcomes were compared between double-driver and single-driver stage-matched control groups from the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium study (log-rank test).  Results', '  49 patients (55% KRAS-mutant, 39% EGFR-mutant, 2% BRAF-mutant, 2% MAP2K1-mutant, 2% ALK fusion-positive) were found to have a driver in a second gene (PIK3CA 94% or AKT1 6%). In patients with advanced disease (stage IIIB/IV), the median OS was worse if their tumors harbored a concurrent PIK3CA or AKT1 mutation (n=31, 11 mo, 95%CI 8.9-23.1) vs a single-driver (n=87, 24 mo, 95%CI 16.2-31.1, p=0.017).

They are a solid target of therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as represented by a high response rate of RET-fusion positive LADC to vandetanib (LURET study, Yoh et al., Lancet Resp Med, 2016). Our genome-wide sequencing study revealed that oncogene aberration positive LADCs carry less numbers of mutations in cancer-related genes than negative ones (Saito, Cancer Res, 2015), indicating a small mutation burden in the development of the formers. Consistently, a clinical trial of anti-PD-1 therapy indicated that EGFR-mutation positive cases do not benefit well from the therapy (Borghaei et al., N Engl J Med. 2015). LADC driven by somatic EGFR mutations is more prevalent in East Asians (30-50%) than in European/Americans (10-20%). We recently revealed that variations in HLA-class II loci underlie the risk of the disease, by conducting a genome-wide association study of 3,173 patients and 15,158 controls, combined with imputation of HLA alleles using a Japanese-specific panel (Shiraishi et al., Nature Comm, 2016). The result indicates that LADC develops in vivo through interaction between somatic mutations and germline variations that modulate immune reaction. Therefore, efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade targeting therapy might also be influenced by such germline variations. On the other hand, oncogene-negative LADCs show a high mutation burden associated with nonsynonymous mutations in chromatin remodeling and other cancer-related genes. Thus, these cases would respond well to immune checkpoint blockade targeting therapies.
