        "Background":"['Background', '    Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) accounts for approximately 4% of all thyroid cancers. It typically presents late and does not respond to TSH inhibition or radio-iodine. Approximately 20% of MTCs are associated with one of three inherited syndromes (multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B and familial medullary thyroid cancer) caused by germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, and all patients with MTC should be screened for RET mutations. Unaffected individuals who carry a germline RET mutation should undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy. We investigated referral rate for germline RET testing in an Irish MTC population.  Methods', '    The total number and type of thyroid cancers diagnosed in Ireland from 1998-2012 was obtained from the National Cancer Registry. The majority of germline genetic testing data in Ireland is completed through the National Centre of Medical Genetics (NCMG) and data on all RET tests ordered was extracted from NCMG records. These two databases were compared to determine the number of RET tests ordered on MTC cases during this time period.  Results', '  A total of 80 cases of MTC were diagnosed in Ireland during a 14 year period. Thirty-five RET full sequencing tests were requested during this time period. Additional RET mutation tests may have been ordered independent of NCMG. Eighteen cases of MTC were diagnosed in those under the age of 40, of these six had RET mutation testing performed.  Conclusions', '    Optimal prevention of MTC requires routine RET mutation testing of all affected individuals. This study suggests that not all Irish patients with MTC were offered RET mutation testing. A protocol of reflex referral of all cases for genetic testing should be implemented.']",

The common somatic mutation of codon 918 is associated with a less favorable clinical outcome. The catalytic component of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been found to be reactivated in most human tumors. Objective', ' In this study, we aimed to investigate telomerase involvement in relation the RET mutational status in MTC. Design', ' Our study includes 43 cases of MTC from the Karolinska University Hospital. RET mutations were identified by sequencing of the hot spots in exons 10,_11-,_15-, and 16. Expression of the TERT gene, telomerase activity and telomere length were quantified. Result', ' Among the 43 cases, 18 carried a RET point mutation in exon15 or exon16 (Group I), 5/43 had a point mutation in exon 10 or 11 (Group II), and 20 were wild-type (Group III). Telomerase activity and TERT expression were closely associated. The TERT gene was expressed in 13/18 cases in Group I, in 0/5 in Group II and in 10/20 of Group III. The median telomerase activity was higher in Group I as compared to Groups II and III. Group I tumors showed the shortest relative telomere length. With regard to follow-up, cases with high telomerase activity and TERT gene expression in Group I had less favorable outcome. Conclusion', ' The findings suggest that TERT/telomerase activity may contribute to aggressive MTC in addition to, or as a consequence of, RET codon 918 mutations. The very low telomerase activity and TERT expression revealed in several of the MTC cases suggest the involvement of alternative mechanisms for telomere stabilization in the MTC entity.']",

Activating mutations of RET play an important role in thyroid cancers including both papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). More broadly, recent studies have also shown that RET may be active in other tumour types such as pancreatic and breast cancers, and that the overexpression and activation of RET may be linked to more aggressive disease. In order to explore this link, we have investigated the expression of RET in a large cohort of over 400 thyroid tumour samples of multiple histologies, ranging from benign lesions through to aggressive, metastatic disease by immunhistochemistry using a thyroid tissue microarray. Our data suggest that RET expression may correlate with more aggressive phenotype across a broader spectrum of tumours than previously predicted. We are currently investigating this association further; first by examining the expression of two major RET protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, in this panel of tumours, and second, by investigating the coexpression of RET with another group of proteins associated with tumour progression, the integrin family. In preliminary studies, we have evaluated RET coexpression with two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3. Our data suggest correlation between tumour aggressiveness and coexpression of RET with these integrin subunits.

Interestingly, we found that a natural product berberine inhibits the RET gene transcription by specifically targeting the promoter region of this gene, thereby reducing the RET protein expression in MTC TT cells. The down-regulation of RET with berberine also results in the suppression of cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells.

        "Background":"['RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed mainly in neural crest-derived tissues, plays a role in cell growth and differentiation and its physiological activation depends upon binding to the GDNF family. Genetic aberrations leading to constitutive RET activation are well-established as oncogenic events. Activating point mutations of RET, for example, are present in ca. 70% of medullary thyroid carcinoma patients including all hereditary cases, while RET gene rearrangements resulting in production of activated RET fusion proteins occur in approximately 10% of sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas. More recently, recurring RET gene rearrangements have also been found in 1-2 % of lung adenocarcinomas and subsets of other solid tumors including colorectal and salivary gland carcinomas. Thus RET kinase represents an actionable therapeutic target in multiple clinical settings with high medical need. Consequently several small-molecule inhibitors targeting this kinase have been explored in clinical settings. A common feature of most advanced agents is their lack of selectivity and in particular their potent cross-reactivity against VEGFR2, an RTK whose inhibition is associated with serious, dose-limiting cardiovascular toxicity. Indeed, the high homology between the two kinases renders identification of ATP competitive compounds that selectively inhibit RET over VEGFR2 a highly challenging task. Here we describe the preclinical activity of NMS-E668, a potent and selective ATP-competitive RET inhibitor characterized by favorable activity, selectivity and ADME profiles. Biochemically, NMS-E668 has an excellent selectivity profile against a panel of >50 kinases, notably including >10-fold selectivity over VEGFR2. Selectivity of NMS-E668 for RET vs. VEGFR2 was confirmed in NIH-3T3 cells engineered to express activated forms of these kinases. NMS-E668 potently (IC50 circa 50 nM) and selectively inhibited proliferation of RET-dependent tumor cells, including TT medullary carcinoma cells harboring a RET C634W activating point mutation and LC2/ad lung carcinoma cells bearing the oncogenic fusion protein CCDC6-RET. NMS-E668 also potently inhibited IL3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing KIF5B-RET, the RET rearrangement that is most commonly found in lung adenocarcinomas. Cellular mechanism studies confirmed that NMS-E668 inhibits RET autophosphorylation and downstream signaling at doses consistent with antiproliferative activity. Tested in vivo against KIF5B-RET-driven Ba/F3 tumors, NMS-E668 displayed >90% tumor growth inhibition accompanied by target modulation following oral administration at 10 and 20 mg/kg, with prolonged tumor regressions observed at the higher dose. Thus NMS-E668, a potent and VEGFR2-sparing RET inhibitor is an innovative and highly promising candidate for further development.']",

        "Meeting_name":" RET and integrin crosstalk provides functional plasticity",
        "Background":"['The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. RET becomes activated upon formation of a complex with the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand and GDNF-family receptor (GFRa), which leads to activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, STAT3, and SRC. Constitutive activation of RET, through translocations or missense mutations, leads to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), respectively. Also, RET expression has been detected in pancreatic and breast cancers, and has been linked to increased metastatic potential. In order to clarify the underlying role of RET in tumour progression, we examined the relationship between RET and two integrin subunits, 1 (ITGB1) and 3 (ITGB3). Integrin proteins are important for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion (FA) formation. Functionally, integrins are important for cell-adhesion and migration as they provide traction and leverage for cell movement. Previously, we have shown that RET is able to increase cell-migration and adhesion, and that both ITGB1 and ITGB3 are important for these processes. Here, we show that RET-mediated cell-migration is persistent over 24 hours, and that patterns of cell-adhesion fluctuate over this time, predictably representing different forces needed to move across the microenvironment. Cell-adhesion is increased upon 1 hour of GDNF treatment, but is lost between 3-12 hours of GDNF treatment. Interestingly, we observed that ITGB1 activation downstream of RET, detected by co-immunoprecipitation with paxillin, is transient, and lasts for 1 hour. Conversely, ITGB3 activation downstream of RET, detected using an active heterodimer-specific antibody, is sustained between 1-12 hours of GDNF treatment. These results demonstrate unique functional roles for ITGB1 and ITGB3 downstream of RET. We also examined the importance of signalling pathways downstream of RET for integrin activation, and found that, in a 2D collagen environment, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK are important for RET-mediated FA formation. However, in a 3D collagen environment where cells formed spheroids, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 are important for cell-outgrowth, downstream of RET activation. This likely represents different cellular responses needed to overcome environment-specific obstacles. Finally, we showed evidence for a relationship between RET, ITGB1 and ITGB3 in tumour progression using a cohort of various clinically annotated thyroid cancer samples. Ultimately, we have shown a role for in activation of two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3, downstream of RET and how each of these proteins may contribute to metastatic events, particularly those involved in thyroid cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is derived from the calcitonin-producing C-cells of the thyroid gland. Oncogenic mutations of the RET proto-oncogene are found in all hereditary MTC and 45% of the sporadic cases. However, it is clear that additional genetic lesions contribute to the development of both RET-dependent and RET independent MTC. We analyzed 30 primary medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) tumors by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays (Agilent 244K) and a subset of those tumors by ultra-high-resolution SNP arrays (Affymetrix SNP6.0). A consistent finding with both arrays was a loss localized to 22q13.1 in 40% of tumors. This region contains the ATF4 gene and loss of this gene was validated by real time PCR.ATF4 is a central mediator of integrated stress response pathway and activates expression of a cohort of downstream target genes known to be involved in cell survival, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence. We hypothesize that the loss of ATF4 expression contributes to MTC progression through mechanisms involving aberrant proliferation and escape from apoptosis. We present several findings to support this. First, ATF4 protein levels were found downregulated in 50% MTC tumor tissues (n = 43) and low ATF4 expression was associated with poor overall survival in MTC patients (HR = 5.015, 95% CI', ' 1.38-10.64), P = 0.013). A negative correlation was observed between RET and ATF4 protein expression in MTC tumors (r = -0.89, R square = 0.799, p<0.0001). Second, we showed that targeted heterozygote and homozygous deletion of Atf4 in mice causes C cell hyperplasia, a precancerous lesion preceding MTC. Third, ATF4 overexpression inhibits proliferation and survival of MTC derived cell lines. ATF4 decreases RET protein levels by inducing ubiquitination and degradation of activated RET. In contrast, ATF4 depletion upregulates RET protein levels as well as RET autophosphorylation. Finally, combination treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sunitinib) and eeyarestatin that stimulates ATF4 transcription, induces apoptosis of the MTC cells in a synergistic manner through activation of ATF4 and its target genes NOXA and PUMA as well. These results suggest ATF4 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in MTC. We postulate that inactivation of ATF4 is a central impediment to induction of apoptosis in MTC tumors. Therefore, strategies to upregulate ATF4 during TKI therapy would render tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to stress induced apoptosis, offering a novel synergistic treatment.']",

C634R and M918T occur in the cysteine-rich and kinase domain, respectively, and therefore activate RET by differing mechanisms. V804L, a mutation at the putative RET gatekeeper residue, has demonstrated resistance to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro. Notably, with other tyrosine kinases, mutations in the kinase domains or gatekeeper residues alter drug sensitivity. We evaluated the effect of these RET mutations on the response to TKIs in a cell based system. Methods', ' CHO cells expressing WT and mutant RET proteins were treated with a panel of TKIs consisting of compounds in preclinical development (DP-2490 and DP-3636) and drugs being studied for treatment of MTC in clinical trials (axitinib, motesanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib). Drug sensitivity was determined by inhibition of RET kinase phosphorylation and IC50s were calculated using photodensitometry. Results', ' The IC50s of each TKI against the different RET mutants are presented in the Table. WT RET was most sensitive to all of the TKIs. DP-2490 and DP-3636 had IC50s < 1 nM against WT RET, and demonstrated superior potency against all of the RET mutants tested. All drugs tested were at least 5-fold more potent against C634R than M918T.

Conclusions', ' RET kinase is a therapeutic target for the treatment of MTC. Here, we demonstrate that RET kinase inhibition differs by RET genotype and kinase inhibitor.

In the past 3 years, oncogenic RET fusions have been identified in additional cancer types, most notably NSCLC and colon carcinomas. Activating germline RET mutations are also well established drivers of multiple endocrine neoplasia while somatic RET mutations are the most prevalent alterations in sporadic medullary thyroid cancers. In light of these findings, a number of approved multi-kinase inhibitors (mKIs) with in vitro activity against wild-type (WT) RET, such as cabozantinib, vandetanib, and lenvatinib, have been repurposed for treating RET-driven diseases. We have designed a next-generation inhibitor specifically tailored to target RET, while sparing other closely-related kinases, such as KDR/VEGFR2. Given that secondary mutations are a common resistance mechanism to kinase inhibitors, we prospectively identified resistance mutations that abrogate mKI activity and crafted our RET-selective inhibitors to also target these mutations.The structures of several mKIs bound to RET were analyzed and amino acid substitutions that would disrupt the protein-inhibitor interactions were predicted. In vitro resistance screens with cabozantinib, ponatinib, and vandetanib in a Ba/F3 KIF5B-RET cell line were conducted and confirmed these predictions. The proprietary Blueprint Medicines kinase inhibitor library was used to identify inhibitors of WT and resistance mutant RET as starting points for lead optimization.Results', ' Both structural analysis and in vitro screening revealed that only a handful of positions within the RET kinase domain enable resistance mutations to mKIs, suggesting a narrow mutational spectrum. Using our library of kinase inhibitors, we identified potent, orally bioavailable inhibitors of RET that target both the WT and resistance mutants in KIF5B-RET-driven cell lines while sparing the majority of the kinome. These inhibitors also suppressed the proliferation of thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET fusions or activating RET mutations and demonstrated in vivo activity in xenograft models. Our analysis of the PK-PD-efficacy relationship revealed that over 70% target suppression is required for maximal efficacy. Finally, our RET-selective inhibitors induced dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a KIF5B-RET fusion positive lung adenocarcinoma PDX model at well-tolerated doses, further validating RET fusions as oncogenic drivers in NSCLC.Conclusion', ' This work describes the identification of potent inhibitors that specifically target WT RET and resistance mutations predicted to arise upon mKI treatment.

        "Background":"['The RET (REarranged in Transfection) receptor tyrosine kinase is crucial for the normal development of the kidneys and enteric nervous system, as well as the regulation of neural-crest cell behaviours, including migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. RET is also a potent contributor to clinically challenging cancers. Activating mutations in RET can lead to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, a cancer syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma. Increased activation of wildtype RET receptors has been linked to aggressive breast cancers, and enhanced invasion and perineural spread in pancreatic carcinoma. Two distinct isoforms of the growth factor receptor arise through alternative splicing of the 3 exons, and are termed RET9 and RET51 to denote the number of amino acids in each C-terminal tail. These isoforms induce unique transphosphorylation patterns on intracellular tyrosine residues, differentially bind downstream signalling proteins, and possess different intrinsic abilities to cause cellular transformation. Here, we explore the differential subcellular localization and trafficking of the two isoforms in human cell line models to better understand RET-mediated cancers. We have observed that RET51 is efficiently matured and localized to the cell membrane, while immature RET9 matures more slowly, leading to lower relative expression on the plasma membrane. Subsequent to RET activation, both isoforms at the cell surface are internalized through AP2-adaptor interactions and the clathrin coated-pit pathway into endosomes. Although RET51 is internalized more rapidly than RET9, a portion of RET51 molecules recycles back to the plasma membrane, maintaining high expression levels at the cell surface. We have shown that RET51 interacts with the sorting protein GGA3, which may allow the long isoform to travel back to the cell surface. Recycling prevents efficient degradation of RET51, allowing for prolonged downstream signaling relative to RET9. Since RET51 has a longer residency time in an endosomal compartment, where sustained Erk1/2 signaling promotes mitogenesis, this may in part explain the greater transforming potential of RET51. Together, our data suggest that differences in RET isoform subcellular localization and trafficking would lead to differences in signal transduction and may in part explain the functional differences observed between RET isoforms.']",

We describe a diagnostically challenging and rapidly fatal case of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurring in a young, morbidly obese man presenting with diffuse bone marrow involvement and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Whole-exome (WES) and shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) were carried out for the primary tumour, adjacent normal, bone marrow tissues, multiple metastases and blood samples derived from the patient. We identified three germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the RET proto-oncogene that remained undetected using routine hospital genetic testing procedures. One variant (L769L) has been previously reported to be associated with aggressive MTC presentation yet remains untested for in the routine diagnosis of MTC. Supported by findings from both WES and sWGS, we report for the first time in thyroid cancer on the occurrence of a “chromothripsis-like pattern”, which involved shattering of chromosome 4 leading to complete abrogation of normal chromosomal function, along with dramatic widespread copy number aberrations across both primary tumour and bone marrow samples. Based on the somatic variants identified, we describe the evolutionary pathway of the case, showing that bone marrow metastasis occurred separately to other metastatic sites. The presence of disease-associated SNPs within the RET proto-oncogene supports their inclusion as part of routine genetic testing for MTC cases. The copy number aberrations and chromothripsis-like pattern affected a much broader range of genes than single mutations and may have led to the widespread chromosomal instability evident, possibly contributing to the rapid fatal course of the case. These results provide a rationale for the application of comprehensive genomic analysis of cancers presenting with unusual and aggressive phenotypes to facilitate more appropriate therapeutic options and diagnoses.']",

Since these mutations are known to induce oncogenic activation of RET tyrosine kinase, various therapeutic strategies interfering with the oncogenic function of RET protein have been developed and tested for treating RET-associated cancers in several preclinical and clinical studies. Our previous study has demonstrated that the G-rich strand in the polypurine/polypyrimidine (pPu/pPy) region of the RET proximal promoter is capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex structures in vitro in the presence of K+, which can be further stabilized by a G-quadruplex interactive agents. Thus, the detailed mechanism by which G-quadruplex structures regulate RET transcription has been studied using mutation analysis and promoter reporter assays together with a detailed analysis of transcription factor binding to the RET promoter in vivo. To this end, we have explored the Flp-In cell system using homologous recombination, which allows integration of a single copy of a wild type or G-quadruplex-mutant RET promoterluciferase construct into a specific genomic recombination locus (FRT site) in a host Flp-In the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line. Thus, differences in reporter expression levels from isolated isogenic cell clones can be ascribed more confidently to promoter-specific effects, rather than enhancer/silencer artifacts due to variations in integration sites.

There are two distinct isoforms of RET, RET9 and RET51, with in vitro evidence indicating isoforms induce unique phosphorylation patterns on select tyrosine residues, possess different cell transforming and differentiation abilities, and bind/activate a unique set of substrates. However, these processes are challenging to dissect in complex organisms because both RET isoforms are ubiquitously co-expressed. We have generated a novel Caenorhabditis elegans model for RET expression to dissect the role of individual RET isoforms. C. elegans do not encompass a homologue of RET, thus we injected chimeric constructs in which human RET isoform sequences were fused to a N-terminal myristoylation signal for membrane targeting and expressed under the control of the C. elegans mechanosensory neuron-specific promoter, mec-4. The resultant transgenic animals were scored for phenotypes of RET-expressing neurons. We found that RET9 expressing animals have near WT phenotype, while RET51 expressing animals exhibited an axon termination phenotype where the PLM mechanosensory neuron of the tail fails to migrate to its correct location. This is indicative of early neuron terminal differentiation attributed to RET downstream signalling. Furthermore, strains harboring constitutively active oncogenic versions of RET9 or RET51 had severe PLM axon defects, with the RET51 phenotype being significantly more penetrant. Through generating strains with point mutations at select tyrosine residues and assessing the resulting phenotype, we have determined Y1062 and Y1096 to be main signalling hubs contributing to the RET-mediated phenotype in C. elegans. We are currently testing known kinase inhibitors, assessing efficacy and toxicity of potential RET inhibiting therapeutics. Using C. elegans as a platform to model RET is a quick and efficient system to gain insight on RET isoforms, delineate molecular events contributing to cancer progression, and investigate therapeutic agents that can be used to treat RET associated cancers.']",

To investigate the underlying mechanism of the resistance, we performed RNAseq analysis of CR2545, which revealed retaining of the ret-fusion, but also the introduction of a previously described gate-keeper mutation, V804M, at ret kinase domain. V804M, a mutation frequently found in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), introduces bulky amino acid at position 804 and found to resistant to vandetanib.

CDK inhibitors have already shown potent antitumoral activity. Recently, vandetanib (Astra Zeneca), a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC). The absence of complete tumor responses justifies the development of new therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to investigate the preclinical activity of CR8 alone and in combination with vandetanib in a MTC model. Materials and Methods', ' The human MTC TT cell line, bearing a RETC634W activating mutation, was cultured in the absence or the presence of CR8 (10-10 000 nM) and/or vandetanib over 6 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by WST-1 assay. Activation of RET, PP1 and oncogenic pathways (PI3K/AKT, MEK/p44-42) was analyzed by western-immunoblotting. Calcitonin secretion in cell culture media was measured by ELISA. Results', ' Both CR8 and vandetanib when used alone strongly inhibit TT cell proliferation at day 3 of treatment. Addition of CR8 (10 nM) enhances the antiproliferative activity of low vandetanib concentrations. As expected, vandetanib alone inhibits RET, MAPK and AKT phosphorylation and CR8 inhibits PP1. Interestingly, CR8 alone induces activation of RET, MAPK and AKT phosphorylation, and the addition of vandetanib (>100 nM) inhibits RET signalling pathways. At day 3 of treatment, vandetanib (>100 nM) and CR8 (100 nM) reduced and induced calcitonin secretion, respectively. Conclusion', ' CR8 displays an antiproliferative effect on TT cells and enhances the antiproliferative activity of vandetanib. CR8 acts by inhibiting PP1 and, surprisingly, induces an activation of RET and stimulates calcitonin production. These results suggest that the combination of vandetanib with CDKs inhibitors such as CR8 may be of value to improve therapeutic response.']",

This assay detected mutations in 14/19 malignant lesions including 4/7 FCs (NRAS, TP53), 4/4 FVPC (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, PTEN), 5/7 PCs (BRAF, NRAS), and 1/1 MC (RET). No mutations were detected in the non-neoplastic thyroid and 1/3 FAs contained a KRAS mutation. All three mutation-negative FCs were oncocytic variants and showed upregulation of ≥2 cancer-associated genes including FN-1, GAL-3, HMGA2, PLAB, and RAP2a. The two mutation-negative PCs showed upregulation of 4 cancer-associated genes including FN-1, CK-19, GAL-3, HMGA2, and PLAB. This upregulation was not seen in non-neoplastic thyroid and was seen in only 1 of the FAs (FN-1, GAL-3, and PLAB). This small study demonstrates that a combination of NGS and gene expression increases the assay sensitivity (100% versus 74% sensitivity) and negative predictive value (100% versus <45% for NGS or gene expression alone). The positive predictive value of the combined assay was 90% versus 93% for either assay alone. The addition of gene fusions will likely further improve the assay’s diagnostic capacity. In conclusion, the addition of a gene expression assay to this thyroid NGS assay allowed for identification of mutation-negative thyroid malignancies.

Furthermore the recent identification of RET fusions (CCDC6-RET and KIF5B-RET) present in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments.At present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been identified opportunistically through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other TKs. Such secondary RET inhibitors include the clinical agents Vandetanib and Cabozantinib, both approved for use in MTC, but additional pharmacological activities (most notably inhibition of KDR) lead to dose-limiting toxicity.Using a robust screening cascade developed in house, we have measured RET and KDR inhibitory activity in vitro and in relevant cell line models to assess compound potency and selectivity. Anti-proliferative activity and off-target toxicity of these agents have also been measured.

        "Background":"[\"One of the hallmarks of human cancers is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to apoptosis. Apoptosis resistance contributes to carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and treatment resistance. Patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have been shown to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy. Dominant activating mutations in the RET protooncogene are the cause of hereditary MTC and are found in more than 40% of sporadic cases. Despite an ever-growing wealth of information about RET's role in cell survival/proliferation, a detailed understanding of how this tyrosine kinase receptor acts to prevent cell death in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We hypothesized that activated RET prevents apoptosis by repressing the transcription of the proapoptotic gene Noxa in the nucleus in response to genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.Here we report that activated RET translocates to the nucleus in cultured MTC cells as well as MTC primary tumor tissues. RET is recruited to the Noxa promoter and is able to repress its transcription. The formation of the RET-Noxa promoter complex depends on RET expression and requires the tyrosine kinase activity of RET. Additionally, stable depletion of RET in MTC cells, using lentiviral shRNA, sensitizes MTC cells to genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum stress. We specifically show that RET is recruited to the Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) binding site on the Noxa promoter. RET physically interacts with ATF4 and phosphorylates ATF4 leading to the blockage of its transcriptional activity. Moreover, RET knockdown is associated with increased ATF4-dependent expression of Noxa. Inhibition of RET kinase activity by sunitinib results in ATF4 activation, induction of Noxa expression and apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of ATF4 in MTC cells decreased sunitinib-mediated Noxa induction and apoptosis. ATF4 protein levels markedly decreased and/or localized in the cytoplasm of 60% of primary MTC (n=40) and associated with poor overall survival.Our data suggest that RET activating mutations confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by preventing apoptosis through inhibition of ATF4 activity and repression of proapoptotic gene Noxa. These findings reveal the importance of nuclear localization of RET, as newly discovered modulator of nuclear gene expression. This newly identified interaction between RET kinase and ATF4 has important implication for MTC and other RET/ATF4-mediated cancer types. Since ATF4 transcription is induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of ATF4 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, the concept of promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors could be considered as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.\"]",

There is currently no treatment for refractory, metastatic PTC, which results in 1500 deaths in the US each year. A challenge in identifying targeted therapies for Ret fusion driven cancers has been the lack of predictive models. We created transgenic, over-expression Drosophila models of PTC1 and PTC3, and found that they cause cancer phenotypes such as delamination, cell migration, and EMT. We conducted a genetic screen of the Drosophila kinome (252 alleles) and a drug screen of FDA approved cancer therapeutics (62 compounds) against flies expressing either PTC1 or PTC3. We found that PTC1 and PTC3, despite containing identical Ret kinase domains, have a different signaling output and are sensitive to different kinase inhibitors. Of the 19 kinases that were identified as hits from the PTC3 kinome screen, only 5 overlap with PTC1 hits. PTC3 is most sensitive to Ponatinib, where as PTC1 is most sensitive to Cabozantinib.

        "Background":"['Background. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is associated with RET mutations and activation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) contributes to functional stabilization of PI3K/AKT signaling and is required for growth factor inducible activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. A recent study showed that HSP90 is a molecular target for HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir (NFV). Treatment with NFV is associated with growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines. Objectives. We hypothesized that NFV-inducible inhibition of HSP90 would lead to down-regulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways and induction of apoptosis in MTC cells. Methods. MTC-derived cells (TT cells) harboring the RET C634W mutation were treated with NFV at concentrations from 1M to 10M. Activation of MAPK/ERK and AKT/ mTOR/p70S6K/pS6 signaling was assessed by Western blot using specific phospho-antibodies. Apoptosis was determined by Western Blot with antibody against cleaved caspase 3. Cell growth and viability were determined by Vi-Cell analyzer and Alamar blue assay. HSP90 expression was examined in 12 human MTC tumor samples by immunostaining. HSP90 expression was correlated with pAKT and pERK level. Results. Treatment with NFV (1M to 10M for 48 hours) did not affect expression of HSP90 or levels of total AKT and ERK. In contrast, pAKT and pERK were inhibited in TT cells after treatment with NFV (5M and 10 M). Since both AKT and ERK pathways contribute to regulation of p70S6K/pS6 activity, we examined activation of this signaling axis. NFV (10M) decreased the level of p-p70S6K, p-pS6 and down-regulated Cyclin D1. Growth experiments demonstrated that the number of viable cells decreased by 30% and 85% after treatment with NFV at concentration 5M and 10M, respectively. Microscopy showed that exposure to NFV was associated with cell rounding and nuclear fragmentation, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that NFV induced caspase 3 cleavage in TT cells. In addition, treatment with NFV was associated with induction of H2AX, indicating DNA damage. Immunostaining of human MTC showed increased expression of HSP 90 in 5/12 of examined MTCs compared to corresponding normal thyroid tissue. The highest level of cytoplasmic HSP90 was detected in 3 cases of MTC harboring RET mutation, and co-localization staining showed that cells with high level of HSP90 expression also exhibited prominent pAKT and pERK. Conclusion. Treatment of MTC cell with clinically achievable concentrations of NFV results in down-regulation of AKT and ERK signaling and inhibition of MTC cell growth. Expression of HSP90 in human tumors suggests that it has a role in maintenance of anti-apoptotic signaling in MTC cells. Together these data support the potential utility of NFV for the treatment of patients with MTC.']",

        "Background":"['RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for the development of the kidney, and some neuroendocrine tissues. RET activation by its ligand, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), results in autophosphorylation of several key tyrosine kinase residues in the intracellular region, which allow binding of adaptor and signalling proteins, and consequently activation of various cellular processes, including survival, proliferation and migration. RET has two major protein isoforms, called RET9 and RET51 after the number of unique amino acids at the C-terminus, generated by alternative splicing. Although the RET isoforms are highly conserved across species, and both isoforms are normally co-expressed, they have major molecular and functional differences, including different transforming abilities, and trafficking properties. RET is implicated in several human diseases. Gain-of-function RET mutations result in the cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, that affects neuroendocrine tissues, somatic RET rearrangements are found in papillary thyroid carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, and aberrant wild-type RET activation occurs in many cancers, including breast and pancreatic cancer. Focal adhesion protein complexes are involved in interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix, and are crucial for controlling cancer-related processes, including cell migration and invasion. The contributions of RET isoforms to the processes of focal adhesion formation and dynamics have not yet been investigated. To explore the roles of RET isoforms in focal adhesion formation, we used total internal resonance fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to assess localization of various focal adhesion proteins, including paxillin, vinculin and zyxin in response to GDNF in a cell-based model system. Our results suggest that RET51 promotes more early (ie. paxillin) and late (ie. zyxin) stage focal adhesion formation than does RET9. Additionally, we demonstrate that the kinase dead form of RET51 results in a decrease of the number of focal adhesions compared to RET51 wild-type, suggesting that the increase in focal adhesion formation in the presence of RET51 is phosphorylation-dependent. Inhibition of SRC and FAK led to a reduction in focal adhesion formation, indicating that these pathways play roles in this process. Ongoing studies are investigating the focal adhesion dynamics of the RET isoforms and further characterizing the molecular differences underlying the ability of RET51 to induce greater focal adhesion formation than RET9.']",

There are two major forms of lung cancer, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) which accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancers and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers. Around 25% of these lung cancer patients are never smokers and these cancers tend to be the result of single somatic mutation events. Several somatic events have been reported in NSCLC, including mutations in EGFR and KRAS along with an EML4-ALK fusion gene, however more than 40% of these cancers are the result of unknown genetic events. Recently several papers have reported a novel fusion gene resulting from a 10.6 Mb inversion on chromosome 10 which leads to a fusion between the KIF5B and RET genes. The RET gene is a well-known tyrosine-kinase proto-oncogene which has been linked to papillary thyroid carcinomas and its expression is generally very low in lung. RET tyrosine kinase stimulates autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase unit which activates several pathways including STAT3, RAS/ERK, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and SRC. In the KIF5B-RET fusion KIF5B retains its coiled-coil domain necessary for homodimerization and the RET retains its kinase function leading to aberrant activation of several kinase pathways.

In order to modelling MEN2A malignant primitive stem cells, we have induced to pluripotency MEN2A peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients who developed medullary thyroid carcinoma harboring high risk or moderate risk RET mutation.MethodsPBMC from patients with germline RETC620R and RetC634Y mutations were reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells using Sendai-virus mediated Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc gene transfer. An isogenic IPSC line was generated by genome editing, using CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the high risk RETC634Y mutation. Hallmarks of pluripotency, genotype and phenotypes were characterized.ResultsPluripotency behaviour of each IPSC line was confirmed in vitro (EBs, and pluripotent markers) and in vivo (teratoma assay in immunodeficient mice). Genome edition of the RETC634Y iPSC led to the generation of the RETY634C isogenic control iPSC. Ret expression was confirmed on both RETC634Y and RETY634C. In order to determine the accuracy and absence of off-target effects, we have performed a whole exome sequencing of both RET-mutated and RET-corrected IPSCs. These experiments revealed some off target effects of the CRISPR-mediated gene edition. Gene-array datas revealed an increased expression of neuronal development-related set of genes in RETC634Y iPSC, as compared to RETY634C control, that may account for the development of certain MEN2A features. Treatment of IPSC with vandetanib, a Ret inhibitor, led to a decrease of iPSC colonies formation in RETC634Y mutated iPSC compared to RETY634C, suggesting that RET-iPSC could serve as a plateform drug screening model. The comprehensive pathological assessment of IPSC RET-mutated and corrected derived-teratoma did not reveal, at this point, any neuroendocrine tumor-reminiscent structure.ConclusionWe report here the first MEN2A-iPSC from high risk RETC634Y iPSC and its genome-edited isogenic normal IPSC, with their genomic profiling by whole exome sequencing. These well caracterized RET-IPSC will allow to develop cell-based assays in high throughput screening for drug discovery and to model MEN2A.']",

Methods', '  We studied 74 patients whose lung ADC lacked mutations in KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, HER2, and ALK fusions. A NanoString-based assay was designed to query the transcripts of 90 TKs at two points', ' 5 to the KD and within or 3 to the KD. Tumor RNAs were hybridized to the NanoString probes and analyzed for outlier 3 to 5 expression ratios. The assay was validated on samples with known ALK and ROS fusions. Presumed novel fusion events were followed up by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and confirmatory RT-PCR.  Results', '  The NanoString assay identified aberrant 5 to 3 ratios in ROS and RET in 2 cases, respectively, out of 74. RACE analysis isolated a novel GOPC-ROS fusion in the former and a novel KIF5B-RET fusion in the latter, both confirmed by RT-PCR. Further screening by RT-PCR for KIF5B-RET identified one more positive sample in the study set that had not been detected by NanoString.  At the RNA level, both fusions joined exon 15 of KIF5B to exon 12 of RET, thus retaining a portion of the dimerization domain of KIF5B and the entire KD of RET, analogous to RET fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma (TC). One KIF5B-RET patient was a 60 y.o. female never smoker, the other, a 73 y.o. male former smoker.  Conclusions', '  The novel KIF5B-RET fusion described here and also recently reported by Ju YS et al.

        "Background":"[\"The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is an important contributor to kidney and enteric nervous system development. In normal development, RET signaling regulates cell proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation, but RET is also implicated in growth and spread of several human cancers. Activating mutations of RET are drivers of inherited and sporadic thyroid cancers, while expression of wildtype RET receptors in breast and pancreatic cancers has been associated with enhanced tumor invasion, metastasis and poor disease prognosis. RET is expressed as two major isoforms, RET9 and RET51, that have unique 9 or 51 amino acid C-terminal tails, respectively. These isoforms induce unique phosphorylation patterns on intracellular tyrosine residues, differentially bind downstream signalling proteins, and possess different intrinsic abilities to cause cellular transformation. We have previously shown that RET isoforms are internalized from the cell surface into endosomal compartments in response to glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand stimulation, but the specific mechanisms of RET trafficking remain to be elucidated. Here, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that RET internalization occurs through clathrin coated pits (CCPs). Activated RET receptors colocalize with clathrin, but not caveolin, at sites of CCPs. The RET51 isoform is rapidly and robustly recruited to CCPs upon GDNF stimulation, while RET9 recruitment occurs more slowly and is less pronounced. We showed that the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) is important for RET internalization. Our data establish that interactions with the AP2 complex promote RET receptor internalization via clathrin-mediated pathways but that RET9 and RET51 have distinct internalization kinetics that may contribute to the functional differences between RET isoforms which are critical to regulating RET's contribution to tumorigenesis and normal development. These data may also have clinical importance, as they characterize key regulatory events for an important oncogene that may in future indicate biologically relevant targets for therapeutic interventions in RET-associated tumors.\"]",

The accurate classification of well-differentiated thyroid tumors remains a significant challenge that impacts prognosis and therapeutic choices for patients. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) are the most common and the best characterized types of thyroid cancer, being diagnosed in approximately 80% and 15% of patients, respectively. Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is, after classical PTC, the most commonly diagnosed subtype of PTC, accounting for 9% to 22% of PTC cases. FVPTC exhibits some nuclear features of PTC but has a follicular growth pattern. Diagnosis of FVPTC presents a great challenge to pathologists, as these tumors can have distinct prognoses with variable clinical implications. While the incidence/diagnosis of FVPTC is growing in the U.S., the genetic characteristics of the disease remain poorly understood, and there is a need for complementary molecular assays that can help discriminate between the more benign forms of FVPTC and those that will exhibit an aggressive clinical course.In this study, we performed molecular analysis of 101 FVPTC archival surgical specimens using the SNaPshot multiplexed targeted sequencing platform, to interrogate 90 genetic loci frequently mutated in 21 cancer genes, including the BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and CTNNB1 (-catenin) oncogenes commonly altered in thyroid cancer. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) of cDNA obtained from the same tumors was used to test for the presence of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements found in PTC, and for PAX8-PPAR gene fusions characteristic of FTC. We detected mutually exclusive genetic aberrations in 68 (67%) FVTPC.

Here we used patient-derived (PDX) tumor models to explore the potential involvement of RET fusions, and the efficacy of ponatinib, in other cancers.Results', ' To identify potential RET fusion-positive PDX tumor models, we examined RET mRNA levels in 273 PDX tumors (Crown Bioscience) from various cancer types, looking for models with outlier RET expression. To search for RET fusions, we performed RNAseq on 4 tumors that had the highest RET levels. Interestingly, RET fusions were detected in tumors from 2 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (pts) and not in tumors from 2 NSCLC pts that expressed similar levels of RET. The fusions detected in CRC pts, NCOA4-RET and CCDC6-RET, had previously been observed in NSCLC pts. Both CRC tumors were negative for other major hotspot mutations, including KRAS, BRAF and PI3K, suggesting that these RET-fusions might be primary oncogenic drivers in these tumors. To evaluate the cellular activity of ponatinib, we generated cell lines that were dependent on the activity of these fusions. Ponatinib potently inhibited the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing NCOA4-RET and CCD6-RET with IC50s of 6 and 22 nM, respectively. Consistent with these effects being due to inhibition of RET, ponatinib inhibited RET phosphorylation with similar potency. Other TKIs with RET activity, vandetanib (IC50s', ' 564-1000 nM), cabozantinib (60-386 nM), sunitinib (277-584 nM), sorafenib (105-494 nM), and lenvatinib (68-257 nM), also inhibited viability of the Ba/F3 lines, but with potencies substantially reduced compared to ponatinib. Finally, we examined the efficacy of ponatinib in the RET fusion positive PDX colorectal models, compared to 2 RET fusion negative colorectal models. In the RET-negative models, daily oral dosing of ponatinib (20 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth by 24-41%.

        "Background":"[\"Neuroendocrine (NE) cancers originate from secretory cells of the body's various endocrine structures. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for these tumors. However, the majority of NE cancers are metastatic at the time of detection and no effective adjuvant therapies exist for primary NE tumors or their metastases. Patients often develop two or more NE cancers, a syndrome termed multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). DNA sequencing has lead to breakthroughs in the identification of the causes of familial forms of the four types of MEN syndromes. Mutations in a protein of unknown function, menin, are associated with MEN1. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET are linked to MEN2 and MEN3. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, CDNK1B, is mutated in MEN4. Unfortunately, a large percentage of NE cancers are sporadic, resulting from somatic mutations, and a high percentage of these do not harbor menin, RET, or CDNK1B mutations. Due to the lack of development of successful adjuvant therapies there has been little improvement in survival rates of NE cancer patients in the past several decades. Thus, there is a great need for the elucidation of signaling molecules that promote NE tumorigenesis in order to guide the development of novel and effective treatments for this family of cancers.Our laboratory has found that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an important tumorigenic signaling molecule in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a type of NE cancer that originates from calcitonin-producing C cells in the thyroid. New data supports a role for Cdk5 in multiple types of NE cancer and provides a new prospective from which to explore their causes. Cdk5 is expressed in many NE cancers and inhibition of Cdk5 activity blocks growth of NE cancer cell lines. Phosphoproteomic analysis of growing versus arrested MTC tumors, induced by expression of the Cdk5 activator p25 in our transgenic mouse model of MTC, revealed elevation of over 200 phosphorylation sites. We have used short interfering peptides (SIPs) to selectively target a set of these phosphorylation sites and found that 15 of these SIPs blocked growth of NE cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation state specific antibodies were generated to several of these sites and phosphorylation levels were confirmed to be decreased in arrested MTC tumors. In conclusion, 1) multiple types of NE cancer cells are dependent on Cdk5 activity for growth, 2) phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins is elevated downstream of Cdk5, and 3) select inhibition of these pathways blocks growth of NE cancer cells.Future studies will focus on analysis of these phosphoproteins in human NE tumors to validate of them as biomarkers for targeted cancer therapies as well as exploration of these phosphoproteins as direct targets for developing new therapeutics that are effective against NE cancers.\"]",

RET is normally activated though binding of both a ligand from the Glial Cell-line Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) family, and a co-receptor of the GDNF Family Receptor alpha (GFR) proteins. Abnormal RET signalling caused by germline activating mutations of RET,or somatic gene rearrangements are known to play an important role in tumorigenesis and disease progression in thyroid cancers. However, expression of wildtype RET and its ligands have also been linked to other tumour types such as pancreatic cancer, where the expression and activation of RET may lead to more aggressive disease. RET is also expressed in 25-30% of invasive breast cancers, with relatively more frequent expression in hormone receptor-positive sub-types. RET has two major distinct protein isoforms, called RET9 and RET51, that share the first 1062 residues but differ in their C-terminal amino acids. RET9 and RET51 are highly conserved across species, and both isoforms are normally co-expressed in the kidneys and in neural crest-derived tissues during development. Previous studies have begun to elucidate certain isoform-specific differences including', ' differential phosphorylation patterns after activation, unique target gene expression patterns, and distinct trafficking properties. The functional differences between RET9 and RET51 in breast cancer, however, have not yet been explored. As such, our overarching research objective has been to investigate the roles of individual RET isoforms in breast cancer progression. We used quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR to assess expression of RET9, RET51, pan-RET (all isoforms of RET) and two GFR co-receptors, GFR1 and GFR3, in both estrogen receptor (ER) negative and ER positive breast cancer cell lines. RET9 and RET51 protein expression were verified by Western blotting. Our data suggest that RET9 is more highly expressed than RET51 in breast cancer cells. We are currently conducting proliferation, migration and invasion assays with tumour cell lines expressing single RET isoforms to explore individual roles of RET9 and RET51 in breast cancer. Further, using well-characterized isoform-specific antibodies, we have examined expression of RET9 and RET51 in two large cohort breast cancer TMAs(>150 samples/array). Analyses are currently ongoing to explore the expression of each individual isoform in tumours. This study may shed light to potential functional differences between RET9 and RET51 in breast cancer, furthering our understanding of RET isoform-specific differences.']",

        "Background":"['RET (REarranged during Transfection) tyrosine kinase receptor is a transmembrane protein required for the development of neural-crest-derived cells, the urogenital system, and the central and peripheral nervous systems, notably the enteric nervous system. The RET protein has an extracellular domain with a cysteine-rich region and four cadherin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, required for RET phosphorylation and downstream signaling. The structure of the RET kinase shares with other tyrosine kinases many conserved functional motifs and regulatory residues that are important for the kinase enzyme function. RET activation requires binding of a glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and a co-receptor of the GDNF family receptors . Germline mutations of RET, leading to uncontrolled activation, are associated with thyroid cancer, and recently with colorectal and lung cancers, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. RET mutations that result in decreased receptor function have been linked to developmental defects, such as Hirschsprung disease and kidney anomalies. The design of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors has traditionally targeted the enzymes highly conserved ATP binding pocket. This approach resulted in the discovery of potent small molecule inhibitors, but with relatively low selectivity. To date there are no RET-specific inhibitors available for therapy, although few small molecule inhibitors are undergoing clinical evaluations as potential RET inhibitors. Since there are important critical regions within the RET molecule (e.g., the substrate binding pocket and activation loop) that contain unique amino acids and structural features, we used the method of molecular docking to virtually screen a diverse library of compounds that potentially target non-ATP binding sites of RET. Known ligands of RET were used to test the success of docking before the library of compounds was screened, docking solutions were inspected and ranked, and best compounds selected for novel structural features and future testing. Multiple comparisons with other known structures of RTK-ligand complexes have been performed in order to identify molecular features that would characterize the discovery of potential RET-specific inhibitors.Citation Format', ' Adrian C.

There is practically no overlap between RET/PTC, RAS and BRAF mutations in PTC, the lack of concordance for these mutations provides compelling genetic evidence for the requirement of this signaling system for transformation to PTC. However, the effect of these genetic alterations in other signaling pathways remains unclear, which could, at least in part, cooperates in transformation. Recently, Notch signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis in other cancer types. In this study, we test the hypothesis that RET/PTC and BRAFT1799A oncogenes crosstalks and regulates Notch pathway. Methods', ' TPC-1 and BCPAP (human PTC cells harboring RET/PTC1 rearrangement and BRAFT1799A mutation, respectively) were treated with gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) and proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay and growth curve; cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. PCCL3 cells harboring Doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A (PC-BRAF) were used to analyze protein and gene expression by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Notch1 protein expression was analyzed in transgenic mice (Tg-BRAF) which harbor targeted expression of BRAFT1799A restricted to thyroid gland. Results', ' PTC cells treated with GSI decreased the percentage of viable cell in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the growth rate. Cell cycle analysis in PTC cells showed enhancement of DNA fragmentation and increased apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the GSI treatment in PTC cells modulates cell cycle related genes, increasing CDKN1A and CDKN1B gene expression and reducing CCND1, MCM6, CKS2, and MADL2 expression. Conditional activation of RET/PTC3 and BRAFT1799A in PTC3-5 and PC-BRAF cells, respectively, showed a sustained enhancement in pERK protein expression, increased Notch1 protein and gene expression and Hes1 gene expression, the target gene of Notch signaling. Furthermore, transgenic mice Tg-BRAF showed a stronger stain for Notch1 in follicular and stromal cells. Treating PTC cells with MEK inhibitors, U0126 or PD96059, reduces NOTCH1 and HES1 gene expression. The combination of GSI with MEK inhibitor enhances the growth suppression promote by MAPK signaling inhibition in PTC cell proliferation.

ATC is frequently resistant to conventional therapy and therefore it is essential to expand the number of treatment options for ATC. Proto-oncogenes RET, RAS and BRAF are some of the best targets described in thyroid cancer. Sorafenib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits RAF, MEK and ERK kinases among other targets and is therefore being evaluated in several phase II/III clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Quinacrine, a potent small molecule inhibitor of NFKB signaling, is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. We have previously shown the effectiveness of quinacrine in combination with cytotoxic drugs in hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cells acts by inhibiting NFKB, Mcl-1, and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines that are deficient in p53. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of quinacrine in combination with sorafenib on a panel of human ATC cells. Quinacrine as a single agent effectively inhibits growth and promote apoptosis of ATC cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by CellTiter-Glo and sub-G1 analysis respectively. Combinatorial dose-response modulation of quinacrine with sorafenib suggests a synergistic drug-drug interaction with respect to growth stasis of ATC cells in vitro, as defined by Chou-Talalay. Western blot analysis suggest that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, over-expressed in a number of solid tumors, is efficiently down-regulated in the ATC cell line 8505C by the combination of quinacrine and sorafenib. We also observe that the active form of transcription factor Stat3 is down-regulated by both quinacrine and sorafenib. In contrast to chloroquine that inhibits autophagy, our previous results have not shown that quinacrine's anti-tumor efficacy involves alterations in autophagy. Furthermore, sorafenib and quinacrine significantly improve survival in a mouse thyroid orthotopic in vivo xenograft model of ATC. We are currently exploring the detailed molecular mechanism of the quinacrine and sorafenib drug synergy and associated anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we are exploring the possibility of performing in vivo assays of the therapy combination with clinical samples.

Lenvatinib inhibits angiogenesis through the inhibition of VEGFR2 and FGFR1 and tumor proliferation through the inhibition of FGFR1 and RET in preclinical thyroid cancer models. Chemical probe-based binding protein isolation is a powerful tool to demonstrate the direct compound-protein interactions even in complicated biological materials such as intact cells and their robust protein extracts. The purpose of this study is to assess the interaction of lenvatinib with RTKs by using lenvatinib derivative probe as an analysis of mode of action in preclinical models.Methods', 'Lenvatinib chemical probe was designed based on a result of co-crystal structure of lenvatinib and VEGFR2. A linker moiety was introduced onto free space of quinoline core (position-7) and its inhibitory activities against RTKs were confirmed by cell-free enzyme assay system. Lenvatinib chemical probe was immobilized onto the monolithic affinity matrices and the binding proteins were isolated from the extracts of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), the human differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines, RO82-W-1 and TPC-1. SDS-PAGE and western blotting (WB) with drug competition assay were performed to assess the binding RTKs of lenvatinib.Results', 'The chemical probe showed acceptable inhibitory activities against RTKs for affinity isolation. In the isolated protein sample from HUVEC, VEGFR2 and FGFR1 were detected by WB and each protein band was clearly reduced by lenvatinib competition in a dose-dependent manner. It indicates lenvatinib specifically interacts with VEGFR2 and FGFR1 even in such complicated protein mixture. In the sample from RO82-W-1, WB analysis showed that lenvatinib chemical probe efficiently isolated PDGFR and FGFR1. Those protein bands were dramatically decreased by drug competition, similar to the experiment with HUVEC. The chemical probe-based approach was subjected to the protein extract from TPC-1, which expresses aberrant RET fusion kinase derived from CCDC6-RET gene rearrangement. WB analysis showed that CCDC6-RET was detected as binding protein of lenvatinib probe.Conclusions', 'The chemical probe-based approach proved the interaction of lenvatinib with VEGFR2, FGFR1, PDGFR and RET fusion kinase in the complicated biological materials from HUVEC and thyroid cancer cell lines. These results supported that lenvatinib is likely to possess a unique anti-tumor activity, in addition to the anti-angiogenic activity, through the interaction with these RTKs.']",

        "Background":"['Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and incidences are rising. MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in playing a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of thyroid cancer, as evidenced by the high incidence of non-overlapping mutations of the genes encoding RET and TRK, as well as of NRAS, HRAS, KRAS and BRAF. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is commonly associated with mutations of the RAS family of oncoproteins, while papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is often associated with mutations in BRAF. To determine whether mode of MAPK activation played a role in thyroid cancer development in mice, we generated HrasG12V and BrafV600E knock-in models. We report that a thyroid specific knock-in of HrasG12V and Pten inactivation leads to the development of FTCs and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTCs) by 47-52 weeks of age in HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre mice. In stark contrast, mice with a thyroid specific knock-in of BrafV600E and loss of Pten (BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre) rapidly develop PDTCs and anaplastic thyroid cancer with complete lethality by weaning, suggesting that Braf and Hras, in cooperation with PI3K signaling, likely play distinct roles in the development and progression of disease. We next sought to dissect the role of Hras versus Braf activation in FTC versus PTC development. We derived stable cell lines from HrasG12V/Ptenhom/TPO-cre and BrafV600E/Ptenhom/TPO-cre tumors in order to identify cellular and molecular consequences of Hras versus Braf activation and their potential impact on tumor phenotype. We have found significant differences in phosphorylation of kinases in response to Hras versus Braf activation. Hras activation leads to increased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors, while Braf activation increases CREB activation. Studies are ongoing to identify the molecular mechanism of these observed differences. We have also shown a significant decrease in the growth of HrasG12V/Ptenhom (p=0.0009) and BrafV600E/Ptenhom (p=0.0001) cells treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, suggesting that activated Hras or Braf-even in the context of Pten loss-partially relies on MAPK signaling to reach its full oncogenic potential. We have recently employed a PCR array approach to identify differences in the expression of genes related to the MAPK pathway in HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom cell lines. We noted an up-regulation of Myc, Cdkn1a, and Sfn in BrafV600E/Ptenhom cells in comparison to HrasG12V/Ptenhom cells, which may contribute to the different pathophysiology of HrasG12V/Ptenhom and BrafV600E/Ptenhom tumor sub-types. Because FTCs and PTCs have different responses to therapy, we seek to identify the cellular and physiological consequences of Ras versus Raf activation which will hopefully aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for thyroid cancer.']",

Current methods for detection of ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements involve fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) or RT-PCR, each test offering its own advantages and disadvantages, and making it difficult for screening large numbers of patient samples for all three targetable fusions.To explore screening modalities for the simultaneous detection of ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions from a single analyte, we designed a multiplexed, transcript-based assay to detect for presence or absence of fusions. Utilizing a combined 3 over-expression and fusion-specific detection strategy, we developed a single-tube multiplex assay with a quantitative scoring modality that is highly sensitive, reproducible and capable of detecting low abundant ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion transcripts. We successfully validated the assay in 273 NSCLC specimens. For ALK, our results were highly concordant (97.4%) to prior results obtained by IHC (n=189).

Immunohistochemical analysis of PTC specimens from 5 male and 15 female patients indicated that all expressed androgen receptors (AR). AR mRNA was detected in equivalent amounts in three thyroid cell lines, but the PTC cell lines, BCPAP and TPC-1 expressed significantly more AR protein (4.6 fold and 3.9 fold, respectively) than the normal T-antigen transformed thyrocyte cell line, Nthy-ori-1.

To reduce the number of false-positive predictions, we developed strict quality criteria on the basis of gene homology, transcript allele fraction (TAF), and partner gene variety. In addition, we used fusions detected in RNAseq data from 364 normal tissue samples to extract tumor-specific fusions. In total, 7,887 fusion transcripts with high confidence were detected across 13 tumor types. Our fusion prediction was validated by supporting evidence for a genomic rearrangement for 78 of 79 fusions in 48 glioma samples where whole genome sequencing data was available. Fusion transcript frequency was positively correlated with the levels of genomic instability in cancers, whereas tumor samples harboring fusions contained statistically significantly fewer driver gene mutations. We identified 221 fusion transcripts involving a tumor suppressor gene and these were wildtype in majority (98.2%), suggesting the fusion has a disruptive effect and a role in tumorigenesis. We identified at least one in-frame protein kinase fusion in 324 of 4,366 samples (7.4%). Potentially therapeutic targetable kinase fusions such as ALK, ROS, RET, NTRK, and FGFR gene families were detected in thyroid carcinoma (8.7%), glioblastoma (4.4%), bladder carcinoma (3.3%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (2.3%), lung adenocarcinoma (1.6%), lower grade glioma (1.5%), and head and neck cancer (1.0%), suggesting a potential for application of kinase inhibitors for multiple tumor types. In-frame fusion transcripts involving histone methyltransferase or histone demethylase genes, which may also be considered as therapeutic targets, were detected in 111 samples (2.5%).

Recently, lenvatinib showed a highly statistically significant improvement of progression free survival compared to placebo control in subjects with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in a Phase 3 trial. To elucidate the mechanism of action in anti-tumor effect by lenvatinib, we examined the antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib in the VEGF and FGF driven angiogenesis models both in vitro and in vivo.First, in in vitro angiogenesis model, lenvatinib inhibits both VEGF-driven and FGF-driven tube formation of HUVEC at almost similar dose (IC50 values are 2.1 nmol/L and 7.3 nmol/L, respectively). Next, the effects of lenvatinib on in vivo angiogenesis, which was enhanced by overexpressed VEGF or FGF in human pancreatic cancer KP-1 cells, were examined in the mouse dorsal air sac assay. In vivo angiogenesis induced by overexpressed VEGF (KP-1/VEGF transfectants) or FGF (KP-1/FGF4 transfectants) was significantly suppressed with oral treatments of lenvatinib at 10 and 30 mg/kg. In addtion, lenvatinib significantly inhibited bFGF-induced angiogenesis in matrigel plug assay, which is driven by recombinant human bFGF and stromal-derived mouse VEGF, at even 3 mg/kg. Increase of plasma FGF23 level is PD biomarker for an inhibition of FGFR1 signaling and it has been known that plasma FGF23 level is up-regulated by administration of FGFR inhibitors in mice. Lenvatinib at 10 mg/kg significantly elevated mice FGF23 levels 24 hours after lenvatinib treatment in a dose dependent manner.In conclusion, lenvatinib has potent both VEGF and FGF driven-antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of FGFR signaling pathway with lenvatinib was also supported by increase of plasma FGF23 levels at the same dose to show an inhibition in FGF-driven in vivo angiogenesis model.

Methods', ' Pts with MTC who had evidence of disease progression within the prior 6 months and were not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy were treated with sunitinib 50 mg at a 4/2 week schedule. Responses were monitored by RECIST and serum calcitonin measurements every 12 weeks. Results', ' 25 pts were enrolled from 11/2006 to 08/2009; one pt was deemed ineligible and never received drug. Median follow-up was 11 months (range, 1-34); median age was 51 years (23-74); 12 pts (50%) were male. 23 pts were evaluable for response. To date, RET activating mutations were found in 11 (85%) of 13 analyzed tumors (8 somatic and 3 germline). Partial response (PR) was achieved in 8 (35%) pts with a median duration of response of 37 weeks (22-106+). 13 (57%) had stable disease (SD) with a median duration of 32 weeks (12-147+). Among those who progressed, the median time-to-progression was 28 weeks. 13 pts remain on study. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, lymphopenia, neutropenia, nausea, diarrhea, mucositis and palmar-plantar erythema (PPE). Two pts died during the trial due to non-related toxicities. There was one case of grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3 events were', ' lymphopenia, 6 pts (25%); neutropenia, 5 pts (21%); PPE, 4 pts (17%); and mucositis, 3 pts (13%). One pt discontinued on day 15 due to grade 3 fatigue. 10 pts showed a decrease in calcitonin levels greater than 30%. Further genotyping for RET mutations is in progress and to date, in the pts with an activating RET mutation, the 1-year probability of progression free survival was 88% (95% CI, 43-98%). Evidence of PR or SD greater than 24 weeks was observed in 7 of 9 MTC pts with a M918T RET mutation. Conclusions', ' Sunitinib has activity in MTC, with an overall response rate of 35% and clinical benefit rate (PR + SD) of 91%. Evidence of clinical benefit has been observed in pts with and without RET mutations and the M918T RET mutation may be associated with a durable response.']",

The aim of this study is to elucidate the activity of the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus in preclinical human RCC xenograft models.We examined antitumor activity in two human RCC (A-498 and Caki-1) xenograft models orally treated with lenvatinib (10 mg/kg), everolimus (30 mg/kg), and the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus for 1 or 2 weeks. The antitumor proliferation and antiangiogenic effects were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti Ki67 antibody and anti CD31 antibody, respectively. The induction of apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. To analyze the gene expression profile of tumor samples, microarray analysis were also conducted.The antitumor activity of the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus was greater than that of either agent administered alone in A-498 and Caki-1 xenograft models. The combination caused tumor regression and had no remarkable body weight loss. IHC analysis revealed decrease of microvessel density in lenvatinib and combination groups, and also decrease in the proportion of proliferative cells in everolimus treated and combination-treated group in A-498 model.

However, quality control materials for these assays are lacking, and validation materials for rare fusions are frequently not available. We developed a novel FFPE Fusion RNA Reference Material to fill this unmet need.Methods', ' Highly multiplexed RNAs were designed which contain multiple fusion targets observed predominantly in solid tumors including ALK, RET, ROS1 FGFR3, and NTRK1 fusions as well as PAX-PPARG fusion and ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. These RNAs were transcribed in vitro and contained a 5 guanosine cap and a poly-adenosine tail to improve intracellular stability.

Digital PCR with TaqMan chemistry was used to determine the average number of synthetic RNA transcripts per cell. These transfected cells were then mixed with non-transfected GM24385 cells to achieve a consistent low positive, formulation. The cell mixture was embedded in a paraffin block and 10 micron sections were produced. Quality control was performed by extracting RNA and testing using the ArcherDx FusionPlex Lung Thyroid Panel and the Ion AmpliSeq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel.Results', ' All twelve (12) fusions present in the prototype were detected as high confidence calls on the ArcherDx Lung Thyroid panel.

Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often. These rearrangements include clinically actionable fusions which may identify tumors that are sensitive to selective FDA-approved targeted agents.\"]",

Identification of PPGV may have significant implications for the individual and family.   Methods', '  To estimate the burden of TR-PPGV identified in tumor-normal massively parallel sequencing, we analyzed 1,570 cases, unselected for cancer type or family history, that had undergone TS with matched normal DNA using a 341 gene panel employed at MSKCC (MSK-IMPACT). Subjects had provided IRB approved consent and anonymized analysis of the normal DNA samples was conducted under an IRB approved waiver.  Results', '  Tumor phenotype was assessed for known genotype-phenotype correlations in cases harboring sequence PPGV in cancer-related genes of accepted clinical utility (ACMG gene list). Of 100 PPGV (98 cases, 2 cases had 2 PPGV each), 43 cases had expected tumor phenotypes. While 94 PPGV were retained in the tumor in 93 cases, in 24 cases we observed LOH/aberrant sequence of the other allele, suggesting possible involvement in pathogenesis. Eight out of 24 such cases were in tumors that do not typically trigger genetic evaluation for each corresponding syndrome; BRCA1 (n = 2) in stomach adenocarcinomas; BRCA2 (n = 2) in a neuroendocrine tumor and a pleomorphic sarcoma, RET (n = 1) in a colon cancer, SDHC (n=1) in a breast cancerand MUTYH (n = 2) in a breast cancer and Hurthle cell thyroid cancer.   Conclusions', '  TR-PPGV can be estimated to occur in the matched normal DNA of up to 6% (93/1570) of unselected individuals undergoing TS. Correlation of the PPGV and tumor phenotype was seen in 44% (43/98) of cases, however 14% (8/56) of cases that had PPGV with non-conforming genotype-phenotypes showed evidence supportive of a role of the PPGV in tumorigenesis. These data indicate that phenotypes beyond those linked to known cancer syndromes may benefit from evaluation for TR-PPGV, which may also identify potentially aberrant pathways amenable to targeted therapeutic strategies.']",

Lenvatinib has been marketed for the treatment of advanced or differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine. Lenvatinib showed antitumor activity against various tumor types mainly through its potent inhibition of angiogenesis. In this study we evaluated the antitumor activities of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide against human pediatric osteosarcoma cell lines.Five human pediatric osteosarcoma cell lines (143B, G-292 clone A141B1, HOS, HuO9, and Saos-2) were used. Antiproliferative activity of lenvatinb and etoposide was evaluated in WST-8-based colorimetric proliferation assay or in soft agar colony formation assay. To evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity, lenvatinib alone, the combination of etoposide and ifosfamide, and the combination of these 3 drugs were administered to mice bearing the human osteosarcoma xenografts.Etoposide inhibited cell proliferation with IC50 values of a range within 0.31 - 4.1 mol/L. G-292 clone A141B1 (G-292) had the lowest sensitivity to etoposide. Four human osteosarcoma cell lines out of five were not sensitive to lenvatinib in proliferation assay (IC50 values >10 mol/L), and only G-292 was susceptible to lenvatinib with IC50 values of 1.3 and 0.059 mol/L in proliferation assay or soft agar colony formation assay, respectively. G-292 has been reported to have FGFR1 amplification and shows high transcript expression of FGFR1, suggesting that the antiproliferative activity of lenvatinib could be mediated by the FGFR1 blockade. In all xenograft models, tumor volumes with the triple combination treatment were significantly lower than that with vehicle treatment on Day 8. Antitumor effect of the triple combination was significantly more potent than that of lenvatinib alone and the ifosfamide-etoposide combination in 143B, G-292, and HOS, and more potent than that of lenvatinib alone in HuO9 and Saos-2 xenograft models.The triple combination of lenvatinib, ifosfamide, and etoposide was active against all examined human pediatric osteosarcoma xenografts in mice, and lenvatinib enhanced antitumor activity of the ifosfamide-etoposide combination in 3 out of 5 models. These results support further investigation of the combination of lenvatinib with ifosfamide and etoposide in osteosarcoma. In addition, direct antitumor activity of lenvatinib against the osteosarcoma cells harboring FGFR1 amplification warrants further investigation.']",

Of the 16 pts analyzed, 15 had a RET p.M918T germline mutation. The duration of vandetanib therapy was 5.6 years (0.1-9.2+) with treatment ongoing in 8 pts. Best response was partial response (PR) in 10, stable disease (SD) in 5, and progressive disease (PD) in 1 pt. Time to achieve PR (n = 10) was 0.6 years (0.4-2.4). Time to best response (n = 16) was 1.5 years (0.1-4.1). Duration of response was 5.1 years (1.3-8.6+) in pts with PR and 4.8 years (0.6-7.3+) in pts with SD. Seven of 8 pts with PD subsequently received sunitinib, sorafenib, and/or cabozantinib. Disease progression occurred as increase in target (n = 2), non-target/new lesions (n = 5), or CT/CEA (n = 1). Six pts died from disease 2.1 years (0.4-4.3) after stopping vandetanib. Progression free survival was 6.2 years (95% CI 3.0-na) and overall survival was 7.9 years (95% CI 5.9-na).Pts had no difference in enrollment age, baseline CT/CEA, or tumor size per response categories (n = 16). Rate of CEA/CT decrease during initial 4 months of treatment was not associated with PR/SD compared to PD (n = 16). While on vandetanib, 6 pts with PD had CEA or CT doubling time (DT) of < 2 years within 1 year prior to PD. All pts with ongoing PR/SD had CEA and CT DT > 2 years while on vandetanib. No pts came off treatment for toxicity. Dose reductions occurred in 8 pts for grade (gr) 2 weight loss (n = 2), palpitations (n = 1), arrhythmia (n = 1), elevated creatinine (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 2), and gr 3 constipation (n = 1). Conclusions', ' Many children with hereditary MTC sustained PR/SD on vandetanib. However, half ultimately developed PD and died from disease despite treatment with other targeted therapies. CEA/CT DT < 2 years within 1 year of progression on vandetanib may be associated with PD. *Median (range)']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  There are marked differences in responses to therapy among patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which makes the outcome difficult to predict. This study is aimed to define a new classification system that would elucidate distinctions between carcinomas in order to facilitate selection of the appropriate treatment. We mapped cell signaling pathways in individual renal cell carcinomas and identified different classes based on commonly shared phosphorylation-driven signaling networks.  Methods', '  Laser capture microdissection and reverse-phase protein arrays were used to profile 75 key nodes in 16 primary clear cell renal cancers. These nodes represent many signaling pathways known to be important in tumorigenesis and progression.  Results', '  Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p <0.05) in signaling levels between two groups of samples, group A (4 samples) and group B (12 samples), for 27 of the 75 endpoints tested. In group A, high activation levels of EGFR, RET, and RASGFR1 converged to activate AKT/mTOR. Group B, showed high phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and STAT transcription factors and samples significantly partitioned in two clusters of 7 and 5 cases designated C and D. Group C showed elevated expression of a regulator of autophagy, LC3B; group D showed activation of Src and STAT transcription factors, suggesting the presence of cytokine-mediated cell survival pathways. A DNA copy number analysis was performed on the same samples and the results showed that group B represents some paradigmatic cases of ccRCC, with VHL loss-of-function mutations.  Conclusions', '  The proteins identified appeared to be linked to pathways that are targeted by drugs typically used to treat clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Thus, this type of analysis could be useful for stratifying patients and selecting the best therapeutic approaches.']",

The proteins and pathways inhibited by sunitinib include', ' PDGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, FLT3, CSF-1R, and RET. Sunitinib is FDA-approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). It is currently being evaluated for clinical efficacy in other solid tumor types, such as breast. Because the reported clinical response rates of sunitinib are low to moderate, an integrated biomarker that aids in identifying patients likely to exhibit a positive response to the drug would be a useful clinical tool. The current study investigates the use of an in vitro biological response marker to predict the response of primary cultures of human breast tumors to sunitinib. Methods', ' In order to characterize the performance of sunitinib in vitro, initial development was performed using the immortalized ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3. Subsequently, thirty-nine (39) primary breast carcinoma cultures were studied. All primary specimens treated with sunitinib consisted of a majority of epithelial cells (>65%) as determined by immunocytochemistry. A 10 dose range of drug concentrations was used to treat the cells for 72 hours. After treatment, the cultures were fixed with ethanol, and stained with DAPI. Any cells remaining adherent after treatment were considered live, and the DAPI stained nuclei were counted. The resulting dose response curves were analyzed. Results', ' The cell line SKOV3 was found to exhibit a consistent response to sunitinib. Dose response curves of the 39 breast specimens revealed that 7.6% (3 of 39) were responsive to sunitinib, 20.5% (8 of 39) of specimens exhibited an intermediate response, and 71.7% (28 of 39) were non-responsive to the drug. Conclusions', ' The data collected from the primary breast carcinoma cultures and cell line were consistent with the reported clinical response rate of sunitinib in breast cancer. The described biological response marker may contribute to the current chemotherapy identification and selection process for oncologists and their patients.']",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (HGNEC), including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).Patients and Methods', 'Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. Especially, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20% of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggested that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC. These HGNECs which have strongly positive RTKs could be the targets of personalized therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Approximately 7% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) harbor oncogenic fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET. While tumors harboring ALK fusions are highly sensitive to crizotinib, emerging data have demonstrated that individuals with ROS1 or RET fusions may also benefit from inhibitors targeting these two kinases. A new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors has been recently described. The two main methods to identify translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) are labor intensive and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for lung cancer analysis are biopsies making the study of more than one fusion gene rather difficult. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a workflow based on AmpliSeq technology to comprehensively profile ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 chromosomal translocations in lung tumors. Two hundred lung cancer retrospective samples, including tumor biopsy, were collected from 12 laboratories - the OncoNetwork Consortium. All the samples were previously characterized by orthologous techniques (FISH, IHC, RT-PCR and/or MassArray). More than 30 ALK positive samples were selected. The panel targets over 70 fusion transcripts associated with ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 genes. The panel also includes 5 and 3 gene expression assays for each gene as indicators of a translocation event and assays for 5 internal control genes. The workflow is compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, requiring only 10ng of total RNA and able to multiplex up to 16 libraries on a single Ion 318 chip. A dedicated data analysis pipeline using the Ion Reporter software 4.2 was evaluated. Serial dilutions of cell lines RNA harboring known fusion events, in normal RNA showed that the methodology had 1% mutant RNA limit of detection. A second dilution experiment using RNA extracted from FFPE lung fusion positive samples diluted in a negative FFPE sample showed a detection limit of 15%. The use of a common control fusion positive RNA samples among all the consortia laboratories showed 100% reproducibility. Concordance study was performed using 200 FFPE samples previously characterized with standard method. A concordance of >98% was obtained between the methodologies. The discordant results are currently under study. A negative FFPE samples was run as single test on an Ion 318 chip on to evaluate the possibility of false positive results due to high number of reads. No false positive was detected in this experiment. In this study we present a workflow that provides a robust, reproducible and accurate comprehensive genetic screening tool well suited for FFPE lung tumor biopsies, in a fast and cost-efficient manner. This may provide a valuable tool for reducing turn-around-time and expense in lung cancer analysis.']",

Activated MET can promote tumor growth and metastasis, as well as tumor angiogenesis by upregulating VEGF, and may play a role in UC pathogenesis. The effects of MET inhibitor cabozantinib on MET-driven UC cell growth, invasion and tumorigenicity were previously analyzed in biochemical, cell-based and animal models. Current known cabozantinib targets (MET, KDR, FLT3, KIT, RET, AXL and ROS) and possible targets based on structural similarity (MERTK, TYRO3, RON, RYK, CSF1R, ROR1, ROR2, ALK and LTK) were characterized in 13 UC-derived cell lines by determining the frequency and absolute level of mRNA expression, and ultimately, for targets where mRNA was present, encoded protein abundance, ligand expression and cabozantinib sensitivity.Methods', ' The effects and the targets of cabozantinib on human UC-derived cell lines were studied in vitro. Cells at 80% confluence were serum deprived 16h, then left untreated or treated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and/or cabozantinib prior to analysis of MET, phospho- (p)MET, pAKT1, total AKT1, pMAPK1/2 and total MAPK1/2 by two-site immunoassay and/or immunoblotting. Cabozantinib effects on basal and HGF-induced UC cell invasion and proliferation were measured. Gene mRNA abundance (absolute copy number) of cabozantinib targets was measured using real time PCR from the extracted RNAs of 13 UC cell lines.Results', ' Basal pMET content was uniformly low, and was increased significantly by HGF; the latter was reversed by cabozantinib treatment. HGF-driven increases in pAKT1', 'AKT1 and pMAPK1/2', 'MAPK1/2 ratios in all cell lines were reversed by cabozantinib treatment, as were HGF-enhanced UC cell invasion, proliferation and tumorigenicity. UC cell lines displayed uniformly robust mRNA expression of MET, AXL, RYK, RON, CSF1R, ROR1 and ROR2, and frequent modest expression of RET and ROS, whereas KDR, ALK, KIT, LYK, TYRO3, MERTK and FLT3 showed little or no expression. MET mRNA and protein abundance were significantly positively correlated among these 13 UC cell lines.Conclusions', ' UC cell MET content was higher with higher UC grade. HGF was not expressed in any UC cell line tested, suggesting that this pathway is predominantly paracrine in vivo. Added HGF stimulated activation of MET and known effectors, and enhanced invasion, growth rate and anchorage-independent growth; cabozantinib effectively reversed these HGF-driven effects. Based on receptor expression, cabozantinib is most likely acting through MET, AXL and ROS, and potentially through RYK, ROR1, ROR2, and/or RET, in UC cells, all of which have been implicated in oncogenesis in other human malignancies.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",
