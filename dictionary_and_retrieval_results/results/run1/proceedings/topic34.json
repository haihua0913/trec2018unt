        "Background":"['Curative therapy for childhood sarcoma presents challenges when complete resection is not possible. Ionizing radiation (XRT) is used as a standard modality at diagnosis or recurrence for childhood sarcoma, however local recurrence is still problematic. Most childhood sarcomas are TP53 wild type at diagnosis, and approximately 5-10 per cent have MDM2 amplification or overexpression. Thus, reconstitution of a functional TP53 pathway, through inhibition of MDM2-mediated TP53 degradation, is an attractive anticancer strategy to enhance the activity of cytotoxic therapies that induce apoptosis through TP53-dependent pathways. RG7388, is a second generation MDM2 inhibitor. However, combining MDM2 inhibitors with myelosuppressive therapies may be problematic as the p53-MDM2 auto-regulatory loop in normal megakaryocytopoiesis suggests that thrombocytopenia may be an on-target toxicity. Here we have evaluated the antitumor activity of RG7388 alone or in combination with XRT in two rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts (Rh18 [embryonal], and Rh30 [alveolar]).RG7388 was administered at 80 mg/kg daily x 5 (schedule 1) or 100 mg/kg BID q7 days x 2 (schedule 2). XRT (2 Gy daily fractions) was given to a cumulative dose of 20 Gy (Rh18) or 30 Gy (Rh30). XRT (20 Gy) induced complete regressions of Rh18 xenografts followed by regrowth of all tumors with the median event time of 89.6 days compared 9.5 days for control or RG7388 treated tumors (P = 0.0287). The combination of XRT with RG7388 on either schedule induced complete regressions with no tumor regrowth (19 weeks observation). Thus, RG7388 given on either schedule significantly potentiated XRT (P<0.0003) for both schedules). RG7388 slightly potentiated XRT against Rh30 xenografts where the cumulative tumor volumes at the end of the period of observation (day 134) was significantly smaller for the combination group in Schedule 1 (P = 0.0005) and Schedule 2 (P = 0.0029) when compared with tumors receiving 30 Gy alone. Local XRT-induced skin toxicity was not enhanced by RG7388.Tumor samples were derived from untreated tumors, or tumors following 2, 4 or 6 Gy XRT and 24 and 48 Hr after the last XRT fraction with or without RG7388, or at the same time points from mice treated for 3 days with RG7388 alone (80 mg/kg). RG7388/XRT increased p21 levels over the 3 days of treatment, to a greater extent than XRT alone whereas p21 induction in tumors treated with RG7388 alone was lowest. Both XRT and combination treatments induced PARP cleavage over the first 48 hr.Although additional models should be examined to see whether the synergistic activity of XRT combined with RG7388 occurs frequently, these initial results suggest that the combination may provide more effective local control for pediatric soft tissue sarcoma.']",

        "Background":"['Advanced cancer cells infiltrate and colonize new organ microenvironments through transformation of the dynamic metastatic niche. In bone, tumor cells secrete soluble factors that distort and manipulate normal bone remodeling leading to osteolytic lesions and inflammation. Clinically, primary high-grade bone sarcomas and secondary metastatic cancers exhibit elevated levels of murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), the principal cellular antagonist and E3 ubiquitin ligase of tumor suppressor p53. We demonstrate a novel function of mdm2, independent of p53, to drive osteolytic disease influenced by the signaling cascade of RANKL, ICAM1, and RANTES. To elucidate the direct influence of Mdm2 in cancer cells on osteoclast differentiation, several cell lines were created to overexpress or silence Mdm2. We found that osteoblast-like osteosarcoma (MG63, Saos2) and metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA468, MDA231, TMD-231, T47D, and BT474) lead to significant increased osteoclast differentiation, proliferation, and bone resorption. Co-cultures of Mdm2 over-expressing cancers and normal monocytes resulted in increased numbers of osteoclasts. In cancer cell lines where Mdm2 is silenced, we observed lower number of osteoclasts. The presence of Mdm2 in cancer cells also increased osteoclast resorption in an in vitro organ model. To determine the effects of ICAM1, we used an ICAM antibody to block ICAM1 in the media and showed a decrease in osteoclastogenesis. Understanding the role of Mdm2 in osteoclastogenesis may be amendable to translational benefit in disease models of advanced bone resorption and bone metastases.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Increased MMPs activity in MDM2 overexpressing cancer cell lines.",
        "Background":"['The matrix metalloprotenases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidase and have proteolysis activity which found to impact several physiological and pathophysiological conditions including cancer. In cancer, over 20 types of MMPs promote invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation. For instance, MMP-9 is involved in many processes such as wound healing, tissue remodeling and regulation of inflammation. So far, several studies have also shown that MMP-9 is associated with poor clinical outcome. MMP-9 can facilitate angiogenesis and metastasis by releasing cytokines, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic factors. Conversely, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) is a well-known negative regulator of MMPs which can also modulate other biological functions independent of MMPs regulation. TIMP-1 dysregulation has been shown to impact ECM integrity and potentiate metastatic ability also. Similarly, MDM2 (Murine Double Minute) has been recognized as an important multi-domain protooncogene which is overexpressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis in different tumor types including sarcomas and carcinomas. Previously, our group reported that MDM2 overexpression is regulating MMP-9/TIMP-1 axis in LNCaP and LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) prostate cancer cells. In order to further analyze the status of MMP in MDM2 overexpressing cancers the fluorescence activity assay and the zymography assay were used for measuring the activity of MMPs including MMP-9. Immunoblotting analysis were also used to correlate the expression levels of MDM2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in MDM2 overexpressing cell lines with and without Nutlin-3 (20 uM) treatment. Our results indicated that MMP activity is elevated by 97.3 % in LNCaP-MST cells compared to LNCaP. This may be possibly due to the near knockdown levels of TIMP-1 that was observed in LNCaP-MST cells. However, the Nutlin 3 treatment was able to decrease the MMP-9 levels and activity only marginally, without elevating TIMP-1 levels. This suggests that, in addition to MDM2, the PTEN loss in LNCaP-MST cells may also play a role in regulating the levels of TIMP-1 and consequently the activity of MMP-9. Furthermore, in order to verify our original speculation, we analyzed the levels of TIMP-1 in SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines, which are known to overexpress MDM2 and impart aggressive metastatic abilities. Interestingly, the levels of TIMP-1 were found to be elevated in both SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines compared to LNCaP-MST cells. This finding indicates that TIMP-1 may paly dual role depending on cancer types and the gene expression status in the tumor microenvironment. Further studies are required to fully delineate the interplay between MDM2 and pro-metastatic mechanisms, including the expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-9.

        "Background":"['Hypoxia stimulates several pathways that are critical to cancer cell growth and survival, including activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription. Overexpression of VEGF and the extent of neo-angiogenesis are closely correlated with increase in tumor size and cancer metastases. The main regulator of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 which regulates the transcription of various target genes including VEGF. Stabilization of HIF-1 in cancer cells could enable tumor progression and results in poor survival. In this respect, the multifunctional mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) oncoprotein has been gaining significant amount of attention. The MDM2 oncoprotein has been shown to exert both p53-dependent and p53-independent roles in oncogenesis. It is also well established that MDM2 gene amplification can occur in diverse human malignancies that include soft tissue sarcomas, neuroblastoma, cancers of the brain, breast, ovary, cervix, lung, colon, prostate, and bone. Mechanisms underlying induction and stabilization of HIF-1 in normoxic conditions are less clearly understood. Our present data indicated that the normoxic expression level of HIF-1 was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in LNCaP-MST as compared with LNCaP cells. When we treated the cells with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3, the levels of HIF-1 was significantly down regulated. These results were further correlated with the differences in subcellular compartmentalization and degradation of HIF-1. Findings from our lab shows the degradation rate of HIF-1 protein in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of LNCaP (non-transfected) and LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) cells. In LNCaP cells, the degradation of HIF-1 protein occurs within 8 min in cytoplasmic (99%) and 10 min in nuclear compartments (75%). Whereas, in LNCaP-MST cells, the degradation rate of HIF-1 protein was slower even at 10 min of reoxygenation in both cytoplasmic (70%) and nuclear compartment (40%). Our results suggest that, MDM2 could play the role of master regulator in stabilizing HIF-1 even after reoxygenation. Further studies in this direction will shed more light on the in-depth mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIF-1 in MDM2 positive cancers.

Seventy percent (69/98) of patients had > 1 potentially actionable genomic aberration. The most common aberrations involved CDK4 amplification (n = 22; 22%), CDKN2A/B loss or mutation (n = 16; 16 %), and MDM2 amplification (n = 21; 21%, non-liposarcoma = 4),.

        "Background":"['The human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene has been well characterized as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53. It has been established that p53 regulates genes that are involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair and senescence. MDM2 interacts primarily with p53 in an autoregulatory negative feedback loop and targets it for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation there by attenuating p53 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis functions. Studies have shown that MDM2 also exerts its effects via p53 independent pathways. These p53-independent functions of MDM2 may have a role in cancer etiology and progression, yet the exact function and significance of these interactions are not fully understood. MDM2 is overexpressed in more than 40 different types of malignancies, including wide varieties of carcinomas and sarcomas, which is believed to be associated with worse clinical prognosis and increased likelihood of distant metastases. Hence, MDM2 is proving to be a key player in human cancer and thus an important target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of MDM2 overexpression on cell cycle pathways by using LNCaP prostate cancer cells and MDM2 transfected LNCaP-MST. The LNCaP-MST cells expressed at least 10-folds higher levels of MDM2 mRNA due to transfection. We used the Human Cell Cycle PCR array to compare the gene expression profiles of LNCaP and LNCaP-MST cells. Our experimental results clearly indicated that MDM2 modulates the expression of cell cycle related genes. The following genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in LNCaP-MST cells compared to LNCaP', ' CCND2, GADD45A, RB1, RBBP8, CDKN1A and TP53. Genes such as BIRC5, CDK1 were found to be significantly up-regulated. Heat map and scatter plot analysis further confirmed the alterations in the expression levels of these genes following the MDM2 overexpression. In addition, cluster analysis further denoted that the gene expression patterns positively correlated with cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our experimental results offer conclusive evidence that MDM2 can impact the cancer growth and metastatic potential by altering the gene expressions in the cell cycle pathway.

        "Background":"['ObjectiveExportin 1/Chromosomal Region Maintenance Protein 1 (XPO1/CRM1) transports proteins bearing nuclear export signals from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. SINE are a family of small-molecules that selectively inhibit nuclear export through covalent binding to Cysteine 528 (Cys528) in the cargo binding pocket of XPO1. This leads to forced nuclear retention of cargo proteins that include major tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, FOXO, pRB and IkB. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated selinexor activity in hematologic malignancies as well as in certain solid tumors, and it is currently in Phase I and II clinical trials for advanced cancers. In this study, we evaluated the effects of selinexor in several preclinical models of various sarcoma subtypes.Materials and MethodsThe efficacy of selinexor was tested in vitro and in vivo using 17 cell lines and 10 sarcoma xenograft models including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcomas, and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). Following exposure of cell lines to selinexor, effects on cell viability, cell cycle, and RNA and protein expression were determined. In sarcoma xenograft studies, selinexor was administered twice a week by oral gavage and changes in tumor size were recorded.ResultsMost sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to selinexor with IC50s ranging from 28.8 nM to 218.2 nM (median', ' 66.1 nM). The ASPS cell lines were exceptionally resistant to selinexor with IC50 greater than 2 M. Selinexor suppressed sarcoma tumor xenograft growth, including models of ASPS that were resistant in vitro. Cell lines from several sarcoma subtypes with defined molecular backgrounds, such as GIST with KIT mutations and dedifferentiated LPS with MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, were treated with selinexor to investigate its mechanism of action. Selinexor induced G1 arrest in GIST cells without attenuation of phosphorylation of KIT, AKT, or MAPK, in contrast to imatinib. In LPS cell lines selinexor induced G1-arrest and apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation status and induced G1-arrest irrespective of RB expression. Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not RNA levels, indicating a post-transcriptional effect.ConclusionsSelinexor has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of sarcoma models. Selinexor induced G1-arrest independent of known molecular mechanisms in GIST and LPS. These studies further justify the exploration of selinexor in clinical trials targeting various sarcoma subtypes.']",

        "Background":"['Sarcomas represent a heterogeneous set of malignant tumors originating from mesenchymal cells. Liposarcomas (LPS) and Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are two of the most common histotypes, accounting for approximately 25% and 30% of all soft tissue sarcomas, respectively. The most frequent form of LPS is represented by a spectrum of disease including well-differentiated LPS (WDLPS), a non-metastasizing but locally recurrent disease with adipocytic differentiation, and de-differentiated LPS (DDLPS), an aggressive, frequently metastasizing high grade sarcoma which can arise in conjunction with elements of WDLPS. Besides the known oncogenic KIT or PDGFRA driver mutations in GIST, somatic alterations in RB1, deletions in PTEN, MDM2 amplifications in LPS, and TP53 mutations in LMS are the most commonly reported genomic aberrancies identified in sarcomas. Both WDLPS and DDLPS share amplification of 12q13-15, a genomic region containing the MDM2 and CDK4 loci, yet little is understood about the other genetic processes that yield such different phenotypes. In LMS, recurrent mutations in TP53 have been identified, but a detailed analysis of primary and metastatic tumors has not previously been described.To evaluate genetic events in these transitions, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on trios comprising normal tissue, WDLPS, and DDLPS obtained from individual patients (n = 19), as well as on trios of normal tissue, primary and metastatic LMS tumors obtained from separate individual patients (n = 8). Consistent with prior reports of the molecular characterization of LPS, we observed arm-level amplifications in Chr 12 in all LPS samples, and Chr 17 amplification in many LMS cases. There were no shared somatic alterations across paired WDLPS and DLPS pairs from individual patients aside from the common Chr 12 amplification (MDM2 & CDK4). A higher mutation rate was observed in LMS, and there were many clonal somatic alterations shared between the primary and metastatic lesions of individuals.This study demonstrates the heterogeneity of evolution between different subtypes of sarcomas using whole exome sequencing of clinical specimens. This finding has implications for better understanding of the molecular drivers of these tumors and opportunities to identify subtype-specific therapeutic targets.']",

        "Background":"['Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common sarcoma of humans. There are no systemic therapeutic regimens known to improve survival when complete surgical resection is not feasible, underscoring the need for an improved molecular understanding of LPS to stimulate the development of effective targeted therapies. The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a prominent role in WDLPS pathogenesis, with the vast majority of human tumors harboring either MDM2 amplifications or p53 mutations. Nutlin-3, a small-molecular antagonist of MDM2, inhibits cell proliferation via blocking the interaction of MDM2-p53 in LPS with wild-type p53. We wonder whether MDM2 overexpression due to amplification or/and mutant p53 still plays a crucial oncogenic role in LPS containing p53 mutation. Herein, we developed isogenic liposarcoma lines in which the parental forms were MDM2 amplification and p53 wild-type, whereas sublines had mutation p53 expression, showed Nutlin-3 resistance. mRNA sequencing and immunoblotting showed that MDM2 and CDK4 were overexpression in the parental lines and sublines, whereas MDM2 and CDK4 expression was low in mesothelioma and GIST cell lines. HDAC inhibitor (HDACi, SAHA and LBH589) treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and degradation of MDM2 and p53, but little affected CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in LPS with MDM2 amplification, and in a mesothelioma cell line JMN1B with p53 mutation, but not two mesothelioma lines containing normal MDM2 level and wild-type p53. Our findings indicate that regulation of wild-type 53 degradation by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. HDAC inhibition by SAHA and LBH589 had a substantially effect on LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival associated with upregulation of the PTEN and p21, inhibition of cell proliferation marker cyclin A and PCNA expression, induction of G1 or G2 phase arrest; induction of apoptosis showing an increase of caspase 3/7 activity and expression, PARP cleavage, and the sub-G1 apoptotic population. Moreover, we characterize biological functions of MDM2-p53 axis in nutlin-3-sensitive and nutlin-3-resistant LPS, showing MDM2 knockdown in the four LPS lines and p53 knockdown in the three mutant-p53 LPS lines resulted in anti-proliferative effects. Additive effects were obtained through a coordinated attack on MDM2 and p53, as demonstrated by immunoblots, cell viability and cell cycle analyses, showing that MDM2 and p53 knockdown, in LPS cell lines containing the p53 mutation, induced greater cell apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, compared to either intervention alone, which is comparable to the effects seen after HDAC inhibition by SAHA and LBH589. These compelling pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative responses indicate that HDAC inhibition warrants clinical evaluation as a novel therapeutic strategy in LPS, including nutlin-3 resistant sublines with the p53 mutation.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Oncotarget 2016;7(4)]. In WD/DD LPS cell lines, phosphorylated (p) IGF1-R, MET and PDGFRb are strongly expressed. Selective siRNA knockdown of expression of 1 or more of these RTKs inhibited growth of WD/DD LPS cell lines. Sitravatinib (S) is a novel inhibitor of a broad panel of related RTKs. We showed that S abrogates expression of p-RTKs, including IGF1-R, MET and PDGFRb, at low nanomolar concentrations and potently inhibits proliferation of WD/DD LPS cell lines, where anti-proliferative effects of S were superior to other RTK inhibitors including imatinib, crizotinib and pazopanib. S suppressed tumor growth in vivo in WD/DD LPS. A phase 1 trial of S in solid tumors showed clinical activity in WD/DD LPS. Recommended phase 2 dose was 150 mg/day.
