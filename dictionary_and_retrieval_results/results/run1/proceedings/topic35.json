With the advent of multi-gene panels, individuals who may not have melanoma or pancreatic cancer are undergoing CDKN2A analysis. Previous studies in homogenous populations have suggested that breast cancer risks may also be increased in CDKN2A. This study aims to further evaluate a possible relationship of CDKN2A mutations with breast cancer through a series of case-control comparisons. Methods', ' Clinical histories and molecular results were retrospectively reviewed for patients undergoing CDKN2A analysis as part of two diagnostic pan-cancer panels at a single laboratory to ascertain CDKN2A mutation carriers (n = 104) and patients negative for all genes analyzed (n = 20,280). Patients with a personal and/or family history (1st and 2nd degree relatives) of pancreatic cancer and/or melanoma were excluded from case-control analysis. Results', ' The majority of CDKN2A mutation carriers (82.6%, n = 86/104) had a personal history of cancer documented on the test requisition form. The most common cancers were breast (n = 38, 52.8%), melanoma (n = 37, 43.0%) and pancreatic (n = 6, 7.1%). The average age of breast cancer diagnosis in this cohort was 49.3 years (range 25-84). Family history of breast, melanoma, and/or pancreatic cancer was reported for 54.9%, 46.1%, and 34.3% of CDKN2A mutation carriers, respectively. Females with breast cancer were not more likely to test positive for a CDKN2A mutation than females with cancer other than breast (OR = 0.84, p = 0.79) or unaffected females (OR = 1.02, p = 1). Conclusions', ' Although CDKN2A mutations were not significantly associated with breast cancer in this cohort, these findings do not necessarily rule out an association of CDKN2A mutations with breast cancer, particularly if risks are moderate or if genotype-phenotype correlations exist.

A single founder mutation, p.Arg112dup, accounts for the majority of CDKN2A mutations in Swedish carriers. This mutation alters the peptide sequences of tumor suppressors p16-INK4A and p14-ARF. The aim of this study was to assess cancer risks in CDKN2A p.Arg112dup carriers and their first (FDRs) and second degree relatives (SDRS).  Methods', '  In this prospective cohort study, cancer diagnoses in CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers (n=120), non-carriers (n=111), carriers FDRs (n=275) and SDRs (n=321) and controls (n=3976) were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Relative risks (RR) for cancers were calculated (number of cancers/person years). Due to the finding of high risks in mutation carriers of cancers that are normally associated with tobacco smoking, data was retrospectively collected on smoking history in carriers.  Odds ratios were calculated to compare smoking (ever-smoker/never-smoker) in carriers with or without a diagnosis of non-melanoma cancer. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all RRs.  Results', '  In carriers prospective RR for non-melanoma cancers was 5.0 (95% CI=3.7-7.3), for pancreatic cancer 43.8 (95% CI=13.8-139.0), for cancers in upper digestive tissues 17.1 (95% CI=6.3-46.5), and in respiratory tissues 15.6 (5.4-46.0). In FDRs and SDRs, RRs were significantly elevated for cancers in pancreas, respiratory and upper digestive tissues. In ever-smoking carriers compared with never-smoking carriers, the odds ratio of cancers in pancreas, respiratory or upper digestive tissues was 9.3 (95% CI= 1.9-44.7).   Conclusions', '  CDKN2A p.Arg112dup mutation carriers from melanoma-prone families and their FDRs and SDRs have elevated risk for pancreatic, lung, head and neck and gastro-esophageal carcinomas. These cancers were mainly seen in ever-smoking carriers. This is the first study that shows association between smoking history and cancer diagnoses in CDKN2A mutation carriers.

        "Background":"['Concurrent inactivation of the p16Ink4a and p53 tumor suppressors, often through mutation of CDKN2A and TP53, is frequent in early development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers. The role of this early combined inactivation, and the oncogenic drivers that subsequently lead to tumor development, are poorly defined. To characterize the precancerous role of concurrently mutated CDKN2A and TP53, we combined a number of recent advances to disrupt both loci in primary cells. First, we grew primary keratinocytes in medium conditioned by irradiated J2-3T3 cells and containing an inhibitor of ROCK kinases, conditions that greatly extend their normally limited proliferative potential. Second, we transfected primary keratinocytes with plasmid vectors expressing both Cas9 and sets of guide RNAs targeting specific regions of CDKN2A and TP53. We targeted either or both of the p14Arf and p16Ink4a protein products of CDKN2A for knockout (KO), together with either TP53 KO or a TP53 point mutation (R248Q protein product), two major categories of genetic alterations of p53 in HNSCC. Third, we evaluated use of nutlin-3, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, to try to select against cells that still contained wild-type p53. We assessed KO efficiency by PCR of genomic DNA; the TP53 point mutation introduced a SauA3i site into TP53. Two weeks of nutlin-3 treatment led to a 3 fold increase in p53 KO efficiency versus untreated cells (50% versus 14%). p16Ink4a KO efficiencies were enhanced 2 to 14 fold after nutlin-3 treatment, depending on the specific Cas9/guide-RNA constructs used. In cells transfected to produce p53 R248Q, 14% of PCR products amplifying the mutated region after nutlin-3 exposure showed Sau3Ai digestion, whereas no Sau3Ai digestion was detected in untreated cells. This result suggests that up to 14% of nutlin-3 treated keratinocytes had integrated the mutated donor oligo sequence. We similarly enrich for mutated keratinocytes having p14Arf-specific or combined CDKN2A KO along with TP53 KO or mutation. Combined transfection to generate concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations under conditions that allow extended proliferation in culture, followed by selection for successful TP53 mutation with nutlin-3, will facilitate identification of keratinocyte clones with bi-allelic knockout genotypes. This panel of keratinocytes with concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations will help delineate the roles of these genes in early cancer development and will allow screening for the oncogenic drivers required for tumor development and metastasis, with emphasis on discovering more effective and specific druggable targets for improving treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Cancers arise due to accumulation of mutations in genes critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Direct interaction with cell cycle regulators characterizes growth suppression by several tumor suppressor genes. Mutation or polymorphisms that occur in the promoter or coding regions may affect gene expression and may thus have the potential to be of phenotypic or even of pathological significance. In our previous studies, we showed the differential gene expression patterns and gene interactions/ association of of BCCIP and/or CDKN2A gene1, TNF and/or CCR52 with respect to genotypes, melanoma types and family history. We reported a significant interaction between BCCIP and CDKN2A genotypes among melanoma cases and a significant difference between cases and controls for the BCCIP/CDKN2A haplotype, when adjusted with age and sex, possibly confering different levels of susceptibility to melanoma. In the same report we also had a finding of CDKN2A mutant genotype showing significant association with Melanoma type 1 followed by type 2 suggesting this gene to be critical only in cases with family history and /or with other malignancy. Previous reports have shown that BCCIP as an important component in maintaining the tumor suppression function of wild type p53.Without BCCIP, p53 fails to form tetramers, cannot bind with its target promoter sequences, and is defective in transactivation activity. The p53 pathway responds to cellular stresses that threaten the fidelity of DNA replication, genome stability, chromosome separation and cell division. Many of the cellular stresses can be oncogenic in nature and in skin, the most damaging stresses in carcinogenesis is UV radiation. In this follow up study we show a strong association of p53 codon72 polymorphism (p<0.003) with melanoma (N=126) as compared to controls (N=172). Positive correlations of p53 gene with BCCIP polymorphism (p<.013), BCCIP(p<0.010) & CDKN2A(p<0.032) gene expressions from tumor tissues from melanoma patients suggest the possible functional role of these reported gene interactions in causation or in disease progression.

Five hundred and four archived tumor blocks from breast cancer cases were retrieved, DNA was extracted and methylation of 11 genes (SFN, ESR1, GSTP1, RASSF1, RARB, SYK, SCGB3A1, CDKN2A, CCND2, BRCA1, and FHIT ) was assayed with pyrosequencing. TSP exposure at birth address was estimated with ArcGIS 8.0 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA), based on annual average TSP concentrations (1959-1997). Participants reported household SHS exposure before age 20. Hypermethylation was defined as mean methylation greater than 20%. Unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for age, estrogen receptor status and current smoking status.Results', ' Exposure to SHS before age 20 was associated with decreased average methylation (OR', ' 0.83; 95% CI', ' 0.50, 1.41) as was TSP exposure at birth (OR', ' 0.56; 95% CI', ' 0.29, 1.11), although these associations were imprecise. Exposure to SHS before age 20 was associated with decreased FHIT methylation (OR', ' 0.39; 95% CI', ' 0.17, 0.89). The other genes assessed showed similar inverse risk estimates and imprecision.Conclusions', ' While our results are necessarily preliminary, they are not consistent with our hypothesis that TSP or SHS exposure in early life is associated with DNA hypermethylation of promoter regions of genes in breast cancer tumor tissue. Inferences are complicated by several limitations. For instance, air pollution may have a stronger impact on global DNA hypomethylation. However these findings could also be attributed to low variability in exposures, relatively small sample size, or the choice of loci and genes assayed.']",

        "Background":"[\"BackgroundSoft tissue sarcomas are rare malignant tumors that account for approximately 1% of all malignancies. Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is one of the most common sarcomas in elderly patients. Because of their highly complex Karyotypes with extensive intratumoral heterogeneity, no specific recurrent aberration has emerged. In our Precision Cancer Medicine Program, we enroll patients with rare malignancies, metastatic or treatment-resistant disease in order to analyze the individual patient's disease and identify druggable targets. We sequenced two macroscopically different appearing tumor areas from a patient with a primary high-grade MFS using a Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) clinical test called EXaCT-1.DesignThe patient was enrolled prospectively through our Precision Medicine Clinic under an IRB approved protocol. Genomic DNA from fresh OCT (TissueTek) - frozen tissue from a myxoid hypocellular tumor area, from a more pleomorphic hypercellular tumor area and from benign tissue were extracted using the Promega Maxwell 16 MDx. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2100bp). A total of 21,522 genes were analyzed using Agilent HaloPlex Exome. Reads were aligned to GRC37/hg19 reference using BWA and processed accordingly to IPM-Exome-pipeline v0.9. Sequencing results were confirmed and further analyzed using CLONET (CLONality Estimate in Tumors) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CDK4/6 inhibitors (PD0332991, LY2835219) were tested in a MFS monolayer cell line (OH931) and an engineered 3D mini-MFS system.ResultsWhole exome sequencing and CLONET analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion in the myxoid hypocellular tumor area and a homozygous deletion in the pleomorphic hypercellular tumor area of the tumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A (p16/Ink4a). Looking through the genomic data published by Barretina et al. (Nat Genet. 2010), we recognized a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in 15% of the MFS analyzed. Screening full sections of 30 MFS with FISH for CDKN2A deletion shows intratumoral heterogeneity with hemizygous deletion, homozygous deletion and amplification of CDKN2A. CDKN2A loss may be associated with increased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Treatment of CDKN2A null MFS cell line OH931 (kindly provided by Dr. Julia Bridge) with CDK4/6 inhibitors (PD0332991, LY2835219) showed decreased cell proliferation compared to a CDKN2A wild-type sarcoma cell line RD (ATCC CCL-136) in monolayer culture and in our newly developed 3D system.ConclusionTumor suppressor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A (p16/Ink4a) deletion or methylation has been reported in multiple cancer types and is correlated with worse patient outcome. Patients suffering from a CDKN2A (p16/Ink4a) null high-grade MFS may benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition as shown in a monolayer and 3D cell culture model of a MFS cell line. This study also provides proof of principle for the benefit enrolling sarcoma patients in Precision Cancer Medicine Programs.\"]",

Upon bioinformatics analyses for target sites of commonly up regulated miRNAs, we found that miR-134 was predicted to target CDKN2A (Miranda, microT, PITA, RNA22, TargetScan).

        "Background":"['Germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 underlie joint susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, but do not account for all cases. Genome wide association studies show little overlap between common variants associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, whereas rare variants in genes initially identified as breast cancer susceptibility genes also confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer cases, unselected for breast cancer. Ovarian and breast tumors also are observed in Peutz-Jeghers and possibly in Lynch syndrome. To further elucidate rare germline susceptibilities for breast and ovarian cancer, we have ascertained a unique cohort of 90 BRCA1/2-negative probands with a personal history of breast cancer and ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer, unselected for family history. Cases are from the clinical genetics services of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and University of Pennsylvania. Analysis is ongoing using both targeted and exome sequencing approaches. Germline DNA of 69 cases will be subjected to whole exome sequencing. A total of 21 additional cases will undergo targeted sequencing for 28 genes (8 cases) and an extended panel of 54 genes (13 cases). The majority of ovarian cancers are high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (n=51), in combination with invasive ductal or DCIS (n=36), invasive lobular (n=4), or unspecified (n=11) breast cancers. The remaining ovarian subgroups comprise other epithelial subtypes; endometrioid (n=9), clear cell (n=3), mucinous and low-grade serous (n=3) and non-epithelial (n=4) or unclassified (n=20), in combination with invasive ductal or DCIS (n=21), invasive lobular (n=5) or unspecified (n=13) breast cancers. Preliminary analysis of the targeted set of genes in 69 cases, reveals 43 predicted pathogenic coding or splice site variants; 17 of which are within PALB2, MSH2, MSH6, BARD1, FANCE, CDKN2A, TP53, SETD2, SIRT1, BRIP1, RAD50, and RAD51D and are not seen in dbSNP138, 1000 Genomes or Exome Variant Server ESP6500 and 26 variants with reported frequencies in MUTYH, MSH6, MLH1, FAM175A, RAD50, UIMC1, JARID2, PHF3, SIRT1, MRE11A, ATM, BRCA2, TP53BP1, CDH1, RAD51D, BRCA1, BABAM1 of less than 1% allele frequency in public databases. Analysis of these variants across and within histologic subtypes is being undertaken to look for specific genotype-phenotype correlations. Analysis of novel candidate genes and pathways by co-segregation, functional analysis, as well as external replication is underway to determine whether shared rare variants, mutated genes, or altered pathways confer cancer susceptibility in this cohort. Germline susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer is heterogenous and remains a critical research and clinical question. Improved understanding of the susceptibility genetics will allow further examination of the utility of targeted cancer prevention strategies in those who are found to be at risk.']",

Methods', '  We performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 795 BRCA1/2 negative BC patients in a research laboratory and analyzed 18 cancer susceptibility genes.Three high risk groups were studied', ' multiple primary cancers (MP, n = 315), early onset breast cancer (EOBC, n = 323), and familial breast cancer (FBC, n = 415).  MP was defined as at least one BC and at least one other primary malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, EOBC was defined as BC under age 40, and FBC was defined as at least three first to third degree relatives with BC under age 75.   Results', '  Overall, 78 patients (10%) were found to have a deleterious mutation. Mutations were found most commonly in CHEK2 (n = 32, 4.0%), ATM (n = 14, 1.8%), TP53 (n = 10, 1.3%), and MSH6 (n = 4, 0.5%).  One to two patients each had deleterious mutations in BARD1, BRIP1, CDKN2A, MRE11A, MSH2, NBN, PALB2, PTEN, PMS2, and RAD50; no mutations were identified in CDH1, MLH1, or STK11.  Deleterious mutations were more common in MP patients versus FBC patients without MP (12% versus 7%, p = 0.04) but not EOBC patients without MP (10%, p = NS).

The most common cancers in mutation carriers were a second primary breast cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, hematological malignancies, ovarian, thyroid and uterine cancer.  There was a similar distribution of malignancies in MP mutation carriers versus non-mutation carriers.  Sequencing is ongoing for 276 additional MP patients to validate these findings.  Conclusions', '  Our results indicate that multiplex panel testing may find a higher rate of mutations in patients with MP malignancies as compared to patients with FBC alone; however, the type of second primary malignancy may not be predictive of mutation status.']",

When targeting SHRs for BC therapy, the major challenge is how to increase the selectivity of drugs against SHRs in specific cell/tissue. While estrogen- and progesterone- receptors are well studied in BC, glucocorticoid (GC) as a ubiquitous stress activated steroid hormone is less investigated. However, the elevated GC circadian dynamics is associated with poor prognosis, and GC receptor (GR) is highly expressed in metastatic BC. GCs are used successfully as an adjuvant therapy to induce apoptosis of leukemia and lymphoma. However, when applied to BC, the results are controversial with most GCs showing either pro-survival or no effects. To analyze the underlying mechanisms, gene expression profiling was performed in this study using qRT-PCR array that covers the genes as the drivers of BC. Our results showed that compared to MCF7 (luminal subtype) cells, MDA-MB-231(basal B subtype) cells are more responsive to Dexamethasone (Dex; a synthetic GC) treatment with the higher number of genes that were either up- or down-regulated. Shared by both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the Dex-regulated genes are highly related to cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), followed by the genes involved in signal transduction, cell division and apoptosis, including SERPIN-E1, CDKN2A, c-Myc, THBS1, Snai2 and E-cadherin. However, the up- and down-regulation patterns are different between MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells. Using a real-time label-free cell assay, we identified that Dex promotes MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion and migration but only the spreading for MCF7 cells, suggesting that there are cell-specific effects of GC/GR in different subtypes of breast cancer.']",

In previous studies, calorie restriction has been effective in cancer prevention through inhibiting cellular senescence and SASP. However, obesity has shown to be cancer promoting with inconsistent findings on its role in cellular senescence.Purpose', ' We tested the hypothesis that calorie restriction is protective to the protumorigenic, age-related changes that occur within the mammary microenvironment while diet-induced obesity accelerates these changes.Methods', ' Six week old female mice were randomized to receive either a low-fat control regimen (10 kcal% fat), a 30% calorie restricted (CR) regimen relative to control, or a high-fat diet induced obesity (DIO, 60 kcal% fat) regimen, resulting in control, CR, and DIO mice respectively. A subset of mice was sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 12 and 20 months following diet initiation with mammary fat pads (MFP) harvested and serum stored for further analysis. H&E staining was analyzed using a digital algorithm to quantify the composition of adipose, epithelia and stoma in the MFP tissue.

MFP composition remained relatively stable from 1 and 12-month time points.

Additionally, control and CR mice demonstrated an increase in CDKN2a expression with age from 5 months to 20-months.Conclusions', ' Stromal composition of murine MFP displayed an age-related increase that is consistent with findings in human breast tissue. Despite this uniform increase, we see a decrease in the age-related acquisition of a senescence phenotype in CR mice relative to control supporting the notion that CR is protective to this protumorigenic change that occurs with advancing age.

While functional tests for determining the pathogenicity of missense germline mutations in the CDKN2A coding region have been developed, rare polymorphisms or sequence variants at the CDKN2A/ p16INK4a 5UTR, encountered during routine screening, are usually defined as variants with unknown significance after determining their frequency in control population and the cosegregation analysis in the family, when possible. We recently developed reporter assays to study a panel of p16INK4a 5UTR variants identified as heterozygous changes in patients from a hospital-based series of melanoma cases (c.-21C>T; c.-25C>T&c.-180G>A; c.-56G>T; c.-67G>C). Monocistronic as well as bicistronic luciferase-based reporter vectors were developed and used to test wild type and variant p16INK4a 5UTR activity upon transient transfection in melanoma-derived cells (WM266-4, G361 and SK-Mel-5) and in the breast cancer-derived MCF7 cells. Results revealed that the c.-21C>T variant had a strong negative impact on the reporter activity, similar to that of the known melanoma-predisposing mutation c.-34G>T, included as a control. The variants at 56 and at 25&-180 exhibited a milder impact, while results with c.-67G>C were dependent on the type of reporter vector. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA conducted in parallel with the luciferase assay indicated that the impact of the variants was mainly post-transcriptional. We also applied a polysomal profiling technique to measure allelic imbalance starting from heterozygous patient-derived cell lines and found that the c.-21C>T variant but also c.-56T>G and c.-67G>C exhibited lower association with the polysomes suggestive of reduced mRNA translation efficiency. A panel of eleven additional germline variants in the 5UTR of p16INK4a is being investigated. In particular we are focusing on the functional interactions between wild type and variant p16INK4a 5- and 3-UTR sequences and on the impact the variants can have on the targeting of the p16INK4a mRNA by microRNAs (including mir-346, -636, -639, -935) or RNA binding proteins (including YB-1).']",

Based on these observations, a phase I/II study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID', ' NCT00721409) in combination with letrozole as first-line therapy in advanced ER+ post-menopausal breast cancer was initiated. The phase I portion has been completed and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined to be PD 0332991 125 mg once daily (QD) on Schedule 3/1 (3 weeks on treatment followed by 1 week off treatment) plus letrozole 2.5 mg QD. The combination was generally well tolerated, and encouraging antitumor activity was observed (Slamon et al. ASCO 2010. Abstract 3060). Methods', ' The phase II portion is a two-part study. In both parts, eligible patients are randomized to receive either letrozole 2.5 mg QD plus PD 0332991 125 mg QD on Schedule 3/1 or letrozole 2.5 mg QD alone.

Results', ' Overall, 207 (15.2%) men with BC were found to carry a PV, where 147 (10.8%) men had a PV in BRCA1/2 (BRCA1, 0.7%; BRCA2, 10.2%) and 60 (4.4%) men had a PV in a non-BRCA1/2 gene (CHEK2, 2.0%; ATM, 1.0%; PALB2, 1.0%; BARD1, 0.2%; NBN, 0.2%; MSH6, 0.1%; BRIP1, 0.1%; CDH1, 0.1%; CDKN2A, 0.1%; MLH1, 0.1%, TP53, 0.1%). There were no substantial differences in the median age-at-diagnosis for men without a PV (65) compared to those with a BRCA1/2 PV (66) or a non-BRCA1/2 PV (63). Prostate cancer was the most common additional malignancy among all men with BC (9.0%), with a similar incidence among men with a BRCA1/2 PV (9.2%) and a non-BRCA1/2 PV (8.3%). In addition, 1.4% of men with a BRCA1/2 PV and 3.3% of men with a non-BRCA1/2 PV had a second BC. A family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer was present in 44.4% of the testing cohort, 66.7% of men with a BRCA1/2 PV, and 48.3% of men with a non-BRCA1/2 PV. This is consistent with the relative penetrance of BRCA1/2 and other genes included here. There were no other substantial differences in family history among BRCA1/2 PV carriers versus non-BRCA1/2 PV carriers. Conclusions', ' Close to a third of all PVs identified here in men with BC were in a gene other than BRCA1/2. There were no obvious differences in the clinical presentation of men with a BRCA1/2 PV compared to men with a PV in another gene or no PV at all.

CDKN2A and CDK4 are the two established major susceptibility genes for melanoma identified so far. Recent evidence suggests that copy number variations (CNVs) may contribute to disease susceptibility in several inherited diseases including cancer. The goals of this study were 1) to assess whether the frequency of CNVs varied by CMM or CDKN2A/CDK4 mutation status; and 2) to identify rare CNVs that were related to melanoma predisposition in these high-risk families. We used genome-wide tiling CGH arrays (Nimblegen 720K exon-focused) to investigate characteristics of CNVs in 174 CMM cases, 44 high-risk unaffected family members (with dysplastic nevi/large number of moles or germline CDKN2A mutations), and 48 unrelated spouses from 50 American melanoma-prone families (21 CDKN2A+, 2 CDK4+, 27 mutation negative). We used the Nexus Copy Number built-in FASST2 algorithm to identify significant CNVs (significant threshold = 0.000001; minimal number of probes per segment = 5; log2 ratio>0.3 for gains and -0.3 for losses). We found that the median number of total CNVs, or gains or losses separately, did not show significant differences in CMM cases, high-risk unaffected family members, and unrelated controls. Among CMM cases, CNV frequencies were not significantly associated with germline CDKN2A/CDK4 mutation status, age at melanoma diagnosis, or number of melanomas. Similar results were obtained when number of genes and lengths of DNA segments affected by CNVs were analyzed. Restriction to large CNVs (>10 kb or >100 kb) or rare CNVs (not reported in the Toronto CNV database) did not change results significantly. On the other hand, we identified several rare large CNVs (>10 kb, not reported in unrelated controls) that either involved known melanoma genes or co-segregated with melanoma (observed in multiple CMM cases) within families. These included a 1.3Mb deletion in PARP1 in a single CMM case, a 10 kb deletion in CDKN2A in 4 of 5 CMM cases and two obligate gene carriers in a large family that was negative for CDKN2A mutations by sequencing, a 175 kb deletion in LINGO2 in 2 of 3 CMM cases in one family, a 10 kb deletion in 8q24 in 3 of 4 CMM cases in one family, a 110 kb deletion in 2q22.1 in all three cases in a family, and a 57 kb duplication in 4q32.2 in all five cases in a CDKN2A mutation positive family.

To identify additional driver genes, we did an integrated analysis of copy number and expression data, followed by focused sequencing. Methods', ' Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data (Agilent 244K arrays) and gene expression data (Affymetrix U133A arrays) were generated from frozen samples of 53 MPM. To identify recurrent gains or losses of statistical significance, we used the RAE algorithm. Minimal common regions (MCR) of gain or loss were defined both by RAE and standard MCR analysis. Results', ' The 3 most frequent losses were 9p21 (CDKN2A), 22q (NF2), and 3p21. Recurrent gains of 5p and 7 were seen. We selected for sequencing 25 genes based on RAE and MCR analyses and integration with expression data, including some previously known genes (NF2 but not CDKN2A). The most commonly mutated gene (12/53; 23%) was the BRCA-associated Protein 1 (BAP1) gene at 3p21, encoding a de-ubiquitylating enzyme that interacts with the BRCA1 complex and other proteins. The discovery of BAP1 mutations in MPM was then confirmed in MPM cell lines (4/13 mutated; 31%) and in an additional set of 96 MPM tumors (12 mutated; 12.5%). Overall, the 28 mutations consisted of 6 nonsense mutations, 5 missense, 9 frameshifting indels, and 8 mutations at or near splice sites. Based on aCGH data, 30% of MPM show a loss of BAP1 and 42% show either loss or mutation. Tumors with BAP1 loss have lower BAP1 expression levels at RNA and protein levels. There was no correlation between BAP1 mutation, NF2 loss, and CDKN2A loss. Conclusions', ' We used integrated cancer genomics to identify BAP1 as a new and frequent target of inactivating somatic mutations in MPM.

        "Background":"['The CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes two tumor suppressors', ' the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a and the MDM2 regulator p14ARF. Homozygous deletion of this locus is among the most common genetic events in human cancer across tissues, with the resultant selective advantage to cancer cells generally attributed to the loss of CDKN2A proteins, which help maintain functional Rb and p53. However, in greater than 90% of cancer tissues harboring CDKN2A deletion, the adjacent CDKN2B gene encoding the p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is also deleted. The degree to which CDKN2B-encoded p15 loss contributes to human tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that CDKN2B is highly upregulated in common, benign melanocytic nevi (moles) expressing the constitutively active BRAF(V600E) oncogene. A large percentage of melanomas develop in continuity with these pre-existing nevi, suggesting that nevus melanocytes are not permanently senescent, and can serve as tumor-initiating cells upon acquisition of additional genetic changes. By examining primary melanocytes isolated directly from freshly excised benign human nevi, as well as normal primary melanocytes engineered to inducibly express BRAF(V600E), we link BRAF activation to a TGF-dependent p15 induction that arrests nevi in their pre-malignant state. We also use the primary nevus cells to establish a new genetically-defined, human in vivo melanoma xenograft model, which maximizes medical relevance by utilizing the naturally occurring melanoma precursor cells in a native 3-dimensional environment. With this approach, we show that p15 depletion in benign nevi promotes progression to melanoma, establishing the reversibility of nevus melanocyte growth arrest, and the functional importance of CDKN2B loss in human cancer.']",

We sought to define the mutational landscape of AMEs and investigate the functional impact of recurrent likely pathogenic mutations identified in these tumors. Nineteen AMEs were subjected to whole-exome massively parallel sequencing (MPS, n=7) or targeted capture MPS using MSK-IMPACT assay (n=12). Somatic genetic alterations and the cancer cell fraction of mutations were defined using state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms. Selected genes (i.e. HRAS and PIK3CA) were subjected to Sanger sequencing in a series of 17 additional AMEs (total n=36). Non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (i.e. MCF10A, MCF10A with the PIK3CAH1047R mutation and MCF12A), which are estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, were utilized for 2D and 3D functional studies. Of 36 cases, 22 were ER-positive and 14 were ER-negative. MPS analysis revealed a low mutation burden and HRASQ61 and PIK3CA hotspot mutations in 6/19 (32%) and 11/19 (58%) AMEs, respectively. All HRASQ61 and all but one PIK3CA mutations were clonal. ER-positive and ER-negative AMEs were fundamentally histologically and genetically distinct. Whilst ER-positive AMEs displayed recurrent PIK3CA mutations (50%, 11/22) but lacked HRAS mutations, ER-negative AMEs displayed, in addition to PIK3CA mutations (57%, 8/14), recurrent HRASQ61 mutations (57%, 8/14). HRASQ61 mutations co-occurred with PIK3CA mutations (50%, 4/8), PIK3R1 deletions (12.5%, 1/8) and/or CDKN2A homozygous deletions (25%, 2/8). HRASQ61 mutations, but not PIK3CA mutations, were significantly associated with ER-negativity (100% vs 21%), concurrent carcinoma (50% vs 7%), axillary metastases (38% vs 0%), high proliferation (63% vs 4%), necrosis (63% vs 11%) and nuclear pleomorphism (75% vs 29%). In vitro forced HRASQ61R expression in MCF10A and MCF12A cells resulted in increased proliferation and transformation. In 3D organotypic cell cultures, forced HRASQ61R resulted in a highly disorganized growth pattern, a partial loss of epithelial phenotype and acquisition of aberrant myoepithelial differentiation, which was more overt in PIK3CA-mutant MCF10A cells. In conclusion, AMEs are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Whilst PIK3CA hotspot mutations occur across the spectrum of lesions, HRASQ61 hotspot mutations are restricted to ER-negative AMEs, which should arguably be classified as breast EMCs. Our genomic and functional analyses are consistent with the notion that HRASQ61 mutations are driver events in the pathogenesis of ER-negative AMEs and may be sufficient for the acquisition of myoepithelial differentiation in breast cells.']",

Methods', ' 90 ATC were studied by CGP to define the frequency of GA and opportunities for targeted therapy approaches in this devastating disease. DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections, and CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 579X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer.

Fishers exact test used for mutation frequency comparisons among age groups. Results', ' Median patient age was 65 (range 33-86), 50 patients were male. There was a mean of 4.2 Known Likely Variant (KLV) genomic alterations per case, range 1-11. Adding Variants of Undetermined Significance (VUS) mean was 12.9, range 5-27. The most common KLV-GA were p53 (66%), BRAF (34%), TERT (32%), CDKN2A (32%), NRAS (26%), CDKN2B (20%), NF2 (14.4%), PTEN (13.3%), PIK3CA (12.2%). There were 2 EGFR; 5 JAK2 and 29 GAin the promoter region of TERT. BRAF V600E and NRAS/HRAS alteration were entirely mutually exclusive, and one case demonstrated both BRAF V600E and KRAS. Co-occuring mutations were CDKN2A with p53 (p=0.04). Some GA were more frequent in patients greater than 70 yrs of age such as BRAF, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, JAK2; while others were more common in 50 yrs patients like PTEN, NRAS.

The molecular profile of metastatic cancers remains to be unraveled. Here we present mutations and gene copy number variations (CNV) of metastases across tumor types from patients enrolled in the SHIVA trial2.Patients and methodsThe SHIVA trial is a multicentric randomized proof-of-concept phase II trial comparing molecularly targeted therapy based on tumor molecular profiling versus conventional therapy in patients with any type of refractory cancer. Mutations using targeted NGS (AmpliSeq cancer panel on Ion Torrent / PGM (Life)), and CNV using Cytoscan HD (Affymetrix) were assessed on a mandatory biopsy from a metastatic site with 30% of tumor cell content. Sequencing data were processed in order to detect actionable somatic mutations. Detected variants were filtered according to their frequency (4% for SNVs and 5% for indels), strand ratio (0.2), and reads coverage (30X for SNVs and 100X for indels). Non polymorphic deleterious mutations were reported. Copy number and allele difference profiles were processed taking into account% of tumor cells and ploidy of the sample. Homozygous and heterozygous deletions and focal amplifications were reported for tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Between October 2012 and July 2014, 741 patients with any type of solid cancer were enrolled in the SHIVA trial. Among these, 507 and 496 patients had high quality NGS and CNV profiling, respectively.ResultsMajor cancer types for which molecular analyses were possible on a metastatic biopsy were', ' breast (14%), colorectal (11%), lung (11%), ovarian (11%), pancreatic (8%), sarcoma (6%), head and neck (4%), cervical (4%), urothelial (4%), endometrial (3%), oesogastric (3%) cancers, adenoid cystic carcinoma (3%) and others (18%). TP53 mutations were present in 44% of metastatic patients. Major mutated oncogenes were KRAS (20%), PIK3CA (12%), MET (6%), FGFR3 (5%), EGFR (2%) and BRAF (2%). Tumor suppressor genes PTEN, FBXW7 and CDKN2A were mutated in 3% of patients. Alternatively, homozygous and heterozygous deletions of PTEN, FBXW7 and CDKN2A were observed in around half of the patients analyzed (40%, 40% and 54%, respectively).ConclusionsMutations and CNV analyses on metastatic tumors from patients enrolled in the SHIVA trial showed similar results in terms of frequency of previously reported genetic alterations1,3. The frequency of KRAS mutations (20%) was however higher than the frequency (7%) reported in the pan cancer cohort of the tumors portal3. This result needs to be interpreted in accordance with tumor types before suggesting potential resistance mechanisms in heavily pretreated patients. Clustering of these alterations in specific signaling pathways is currently ongoing.']",

The clinical applications envisioned with liquid biopsies range from monitoring of treatment response to disease progression and acquired resistance. However, the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is challenging owing to the small fraction of tumor specific DNA relative to background levels of non-tumor derived DNA and therefore requires highly specific and sensitive techniques.Experimental proceduresThe Ion AmpliSeqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, covering 2,800 COSMIC mutations from 50 cancer genes was used to analyze 31 primary tumor and metastatic lesions along with 19 matched plasma samples from 13 breast cancer (BC) patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment and 6 advanced stage metastatic BC patients. Digital PCR (dPCR) experiments were set up using mutation-specific assays (Biorad) for the detection of 13 hotspot mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, AKT1, CDKN2A and STK11 genes previously identified in the solid tumor samples using next generation sequencing (NGS).ResultsThe specificity and sensitivity of the mutation-specific dPCR assays were tested in dilution curves using synthetic oligonucleotides and tumor samples bearing the mutation of interest. Mutations could be robustly detected in plasma samples using dPCR with a sensitivity as low as 0.1% and a sensitivity of 0.5% using NGS. All mutations previously identified using NGS were validated using dPCR in tumor (n = 27) as well as in plasma samples (n = 5). Moreover, dPCR identified 4 additional mutations in 4 plasma samples in the neoadjuvant setting and 4 in the metastatic setting, 2 in tumor and 2 in plasma samples. The mutant allelic frequencies (MAF) of these newly identified mutations were very low (range 0.2%-1.8%) close to the detection limit of the technology. Through the use of dPCR, the detection rate of plasma ctDNA increased from 8% using NGS to 38% in the neoadjuvant setting and from 67% using NGS to 100% in the metastatic setting thereby highlighting the greater sensitivity of the dPCR technology. The MAF assessed by NGS and dPCR were highly correlated both in the neoadjuvant and metastatic (Spearman  = 0.84 and  = 0.97) settings, a higher concordance between NGS and dPCR being observed when the MAF are high.ConclusionsThe use of dPCR allows the detection of low-frequency tumor-specific mutations in plasma with a greater sensitivity compared to NGS providing the high accuracy and sensitivity essential for liquid biopsies.']",

Meta-analyses of public datasets have revealed new subgroups, but these studies are plagued by samples collected from multiple protocols and poor reproducibility. We aimed to identify stable subsets that could be treated with targeted therapy by employing integrated genomic profiling of a large number of TNBC cases (confirmed by IHC) from a single protocol before applying those subgroups to publicly available TNBC sets.We employed non-negative matrix factorization on two independent gene expression datasets (Discovery n = 84 and Validation n = 118) using the top 1000 variant genes in each set. Cophenetic, dispersion, and silhouette metrics revealed 4 clusters, with significant enrichment of differentially expressed (DE) genes in each subgroup among both sets (all comparisons Fisher Exact p < 2.2E-16). A parsimonious gene centroid signature of 480 total genes was selected based on Goeman's Global Test BH-adjusted p-values and fold change of only the Discovery Set. Subgroups were assigned by Pearson Correlation in the Discovery (Rand Index = 0.97) and Validation Sets (RI = 0.84), as well as an External Set made up of 214 IHC-confirmed cases of TNBCs, and another 5 publicly available studies with clinical outcome data for TNBCs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was carried out separately on DE genes from each dataset (BH adjusted p < 0.01). There was overwhelming statistical agreement for all subgroups between the Discovery, Validation, and External Sets. Subgroup 1 was defined by Intermediate Grade LumB tumors and overexpression of ESR1, HER-2, and AR, with activated downstream signaling of ESR1 despite being ER- by IHC. In subgroup 2, CDKN2A and TP53 appeared activated while MYC was inhibited. Dozens of immune cell signaling pathways were downregulated in the third subgroup, a basal-like set of TNBCs, which was driven by inhibition of cytokine gamma-IFN. Disease-free and Overall Survival was the worst for subgroup 3 (log rank p = 0.041 and 0.039). The final subgroup (4) was found to be p53 inactivated, a known feature of TNBC but specific to this second basal-like subgroup. Analysis of 84 and 58 cases with corresponding copy number profiling data from the Discovery and Validation Sets revealed subgroup specific copy number changes in addition to known TNBC patterns. Most notably, loss of chr 6 was unique to subgroup 1, while all other tumors shared common loss of chr 5.We have described four molecular phenotypes of TNBC in two independent sets from the same protocol, and a third set composed of public data. These subgroups have strong agreement of DE genes, pathways, and regulators, and are additionally supported by DNA events and prognostic differences between subgroups.

Activating mutations in the N-Ras proto-oncogene are characteristic for cutaneous melanoma. The most frequent mutation found in N-Ras is a lysine substitution of glutamine at codon 61 (Q61K) constitutively activating the protein. Together with other mutations, especially inactivation of the CDKN2A locus, it is sufficient for spontaneous melanoma formation and subsequent metastasis formation in mice.STAT3 proteins are highly phosphorylated in melanoma. We identified strong STAT3 expression and activation in 70% of patients that show melanoma brain metastases. Here, we investigated whether deletion of this transcription factor in a mouse model expressing mutant N-RasQ61K transgene under the control of the tyrosinase promoter in combination with a homozygous CDKN2A deletion, leads to modified melanoma formation. Interestingly, we found decreased survival in male mice that do not express STAT3 in melanoma cells. We analyzed primary tumor development, metastasis, and survival using histo-pathological examination between groups of STAT3 positive and negative mice.To further assess whether the enhanced tumor progression upon loss of STAT3 is a cell autonomous effect we established melanoma cell lines derived from mouse tumors with or without STAT3. These novel cell lines will be used to analyze growth and survival properties.

We have used massively-parallel sequencing to provide a comprehensive analysis of the step-wise progression of cancer in the highly tractable E-Myc mouse model. The E-Myc mouse has been engineered to harbor a t(8;14) translocation juxtaposing the IgH enhancer to the proto-oncogene Myc, a lesion frequently observed in mature B-cell malignancies. E-Myc mice develop spontaneous Burkitt-like B-cell leukemia/lymphoma with 100% penetrance through predicable premalignant to malignant progression phases. Malignant progression ostensibly occurs as a result of secondary somatic mutations that co-operate with Myc. Despite common perception that the majority of tumors can be explained by disruption of the archetypal Cdkn2a and Trp53 tumor suppressor axis, in more than half of spontaneous E-Myc tumors harbor secondary mutations that remain unknown. We hypothesize that the identification of genes that cooperate with Myc could therefore yield not only new biological insight into oncogenic pathways involved in B-cell lymphomagenesis but also improve therapy for patients in the future.We applied exome-sequencing to a cohort of 18 spontaneous murine E-Myc lymphomas to determine novel somatic driver mutations capable of cooperating with Myc. In addition to exome-sequencing, we harvested blood samples at 2-week intervals throughout the premalignant to malignant phases to allow a temporal analysis of mutations that were detected at end-stage. End-stage tumors were found to be heterogeneous in nature, ranging from 11 to 36 single-base mutations, deletions or insertions. The screen identified genes previously described to be mutated in E-Myc lymphoma (Trp53, Cdkn2a, Kras and Nras). Interestingly, concurrent mutations in known cancer genes were evident in clonal tumors from the sequenced cohort with, for example, a Cdkn2a deletion co-occurring with an activating Kras mutation. In addition to these mutations, we identified novel protein-truncating mutations in Bcl6 co-repressor (Bcor), which has not previously been described in E-Myc lymphoma. Bcor truncating mutations were present at a high frequency, occurring in 3 out of 18 samples. RNAi mediated knockdown of Bcor in E-Myc fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted into lethally irradiated congenic recipient mice accelerated lymphomagenesis, validating Bcor as a tumor suppressor gene in this model.BCOR loss-of-function mutations have recently been identified in human cancers suggesting that BCOR acts as a tumor-suppressor in a wide range of malignancies. Given that Bcor mutations frequently occur in the E-Myc lymphoma, we hypothesize that Bcor is critically important for B-cell development and that its disruption can induce malignancy in co-operation with other potent oncogenes such as Myc.']",

The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used for our analysis, and results were subjected to internal validation using a resampling method (bootstrap analysis). In a multivariable analysis (Cox regression model), the parameters that were statistically associated with a poorer overall survival were the presence of metastases at diagnosis (P = 0.014), gastrointestinal histology (P<0.0001), PTEN (P<0.0001), and CDKN2A alterations (P = 0.0001).

Other tumor suppressor genes inactivated by mutation included the cell cycle genes TP53 (32% of cases), RB1 (8%), and PTEN (3%), the Wnt/beta catenin pathway gene AXIN1 (4%), and the chromatin remodeling genes ARID1A (9%), BAP1 (6%), ARID1B (4%), ARID2 (4%), and PBRM1 (3%). The oncogene CTNNB1 was mutated in 27% of HCCs. Mutations were also found in the MTOR pathway genes, MTOR (4%), TSC2 (4%) and TSC1 (3%). The patterns of mutational signatures observed included signatures characteristic of the known carcinogens aristolochic acid and aflatoxin B1. Clustering of mRNA, miRNA, or protein expression, DNA hypermethylation and DNA copy number profiles identified five, four, two, five and three clusters, respectively. Analysis of mRNA expression data identified five groups. In particular, Group 1 was associated with Asian race, higher histologic grade, and micro- and macrovascular invasion. Integrated clustering showed a grouping of HCCs into three superclusters', ' iCluster 1 had a low frequency of CDKN2A silencing, lack of CTNNB1 mutation, a normal-like methylation pattern, and overexpression of proliferation marker genes; iClusters 2 and 3 had a high frequency of CDKN2A silencing, CTNNB1 mutation, and overexpression of oxidative response genes; iCluster 3 tumors had a higher degree of chromosomal instability, high frequency of 17p loss, and a highly altered methylation profile. Copy number aberrations included gains in the MYC, VEGFA, CCND1, TERT, and MET loci and losses in the TP53, RB1, ERFFI1, CDKN2A, ARID1A and PTEN loci. Discussion', ' Based on integrated analysis of genome, transcriptome, methylome and proteome we showed that HCCs naturally separate into three to five distinct groups with associated molecular and clinical characteristics. Importantly, we identified a novel germline mutation in the TERT promoter that may be associated with an inherited risk for HCC.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Multiplex panel testing may be an efficient way of evaluating MP patients for the presence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. However the spectrum of mutations in many cancer susceptibility genes in the MP patient population is largely unknown. We performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 15 genes with well-established risks of breast and/or other cancers, specifically TP53, CDH1, PTEN, STK11, ATM, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH. Our patient cohort consisted of 221 BRCA1/2 negative patients diagnosed with breast cancer and at least one other primary cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients diagnosed with contralateral breast cancer were included. Thirty patients (14%) were found to have at least one deleterious variant in these 15 genes. Deleterious variants were found in CHEK2 (16 patients, 7.2%), TP53 (4, 1.8%), MSH6 (3, 1.4%), ATM (2, 0.9%) and one patient each had deleterious variants in CDKN2A, PTEN, PMS2, PALB2, BRIP1 and NBN. In addition, six patients (2.7%) were found to be heterozygous carriers of a MUTYH mutation. In comparison, deleterious variants were identified in 9% of 341 patients with breast cancer only, indicating a small but nonsignificant increase in the rate of deleterious variants in MP patients. The rate of MUTYH heterozygous mutations was also non-significantly different in patients with breast cancer only (1.2%). There was a significant increase in the rate of CHEK2 and MSH6 mutations in the MP versus breast-only patients (7.2% vs 3.5%, p = 0.04 for CHEK2 and 1.4% vs 0%, p = 0.05 for MSH6). As a corollary study, a subset of MP patients (n = 165) were assayed on a panel including TET2. Deleterious TET2 mutations were identified in 2 of 165 patients (1.2%) at allele frequencies of 0.17 and 0.36. These patients blood samples were ascertained at ages 77 and 72, respectively. These preliminary data show that in our cohort of patients with multiple primary cancers, over 16% of patients were found to have deleterious variants in 15 cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, approximately 1% of MP patients have deleterious variants in TET2 that may be due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis, although it is unknown if these mutations are related to the development of the tumors in these individuals. Further analysis of variants in less well-characterized cancer susceptibility genes and unclassified variants is ongoing. Discovery of clinically relevant mutations can potentially guide future treatment practices for those with similar diagnoses to our patients.']",

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, KRAS mutation occurs in 90-95% of cases and is often coupled with inactivation of CDKN2A (>90% incidence), typically by homozygous deletion. Based on the high incidence of these genetic events, the present study addresses the hypothesis that dual targeting of MEK and CDK4/6 represents a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A panel of primary and high passage xenograft models was screened for in vitro synergy to the antiproliferative effects of the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Two models that emerged as highly sensitive to this combination treatment strategy, L3.6pl and UM59, both exhibited G1 cell cycle arrest that was significantly more pronounced in response to the combination compared to either single agent. In vivo studies were subsequently carried out to evaluate the efficacy of this combination in tumor-bearing mice. Mice implanted subcutaneously with L3.6pl or UM59 cells were treated daily by oral gavage for ten days with trametinib (3 mg/kg), palbociclib (100 mg/kg), or the combination of these two agents at these doses. Consistent with in vitro synergy observations, both models proved to be exceptional responders in vivo to this combination treatment strategy, showing a robust response to the combination not seen with either single agent. These results suggest that the combined inhibition of MEK and CDK4/6 may offer a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Among the 58 microRNAs downregulated in NPC, transcriptional silencing of miR-31 was consistently found in both NPC tumor lines and primary tumors. Expression of miR-31 was detected in none of 6 EBV-positive tumor lines and 38 microdissected primary tumors, but in all normal nasopharyngeal epithelia. Interestingly, miR-31 is located at 0.5 Mb telomeric to CDKN2A at 9p21.3, which is commonly homozygous deleted in NPC. Homozygous deletion of both miR-31 and CDKN2A locus was confirmed in 2 tumor lines. In the 4 tumor lines with intact miR-31, hypermethylation of 5CpG islands was detected by bisulfate sequencing and MSP analysis. Re-expression of miR-31 was demonstrated in the EBV-positive NPC cell line C666-1 treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. The findings suggested that homozygous deletion and promoter methylation are the major mechanisms for transcriptional silencing of miR-31 in NPC. By microarray and bioinformatic analysis, we have identified a number of putative targets of miR-31. Among these candidates, we have proven that miR-31 targeted FIH1 and MCM2 expression in NPC. Ectopic expression of miR-31 in NPC cells resulted in repression of FIH1 and MCM2 protein. Finally, we have demonstrated that restoration of miR-31 or knockdown of FIH1 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation of C666-1.

ROC analysis and LOOCV were used to assess the performance of five specific genes known to confer doxorubicin chemoresistance (TP53, TOP2A, CTNNB1, CDKN2A and AKT1). Results', ' Radiomic analysis identified TP53 (AUC = 86.61%, Specificity = 92.31%, Sensitivity = 92.9%), TOP2A (AUC = 78.0%, Specificity = 69%, Sensitivity = 85.7%), CTNNB1 (AUC = 86.8%, Specificity = 92.3%, Sensitivity = 85.7%), CDKN2A (AUC = 76.9%, Specificity = 76.9%, Sensitivity = 78.6%) and AKT1 (AUC = 72.5%, Specificity = 69.2%, Sensitivity = 85.7%) in treatment-nave HCC CT studies. Conclusions', ' The identification of specific genes that confer chemoresistance to doxorubicin can be reliably ascertained via the use of radiomic analysis. This study may help tailor future treatment paradigms via the ability to categorize HCC tumors on genetic level and identify tumors which may not have a favorable response to doxorubicin based therapies.']",

Methods', ' We report the use of an Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 (906,600 SNPs) to screen for gene copy number changes and allelic imbalances in 8 microdissected primary pancreatic tumors and 7 established pancreatic cancer cell lines. Gene Chip Human Genome U133 2.0 Array was used to make an RNA expression profile. Mutation analysis of KRAS and M-FISH analysis of cell lines was performed. Results', ' SNP arrays confirmed the presence of previously reported cytogenetic abnormalities in the cell lines and primary tumor probes, including MYC amplifikation at 8q24, gain of 17q12 (ERBB2/HER2), 7p12 (EGFR) and 12p12.1 (KRAS). KRAS mutation was seen in 71% of cell lines (5/7). We identified several alterations in signaling pathways such as Wnt/Notch Signaling and KRAS signaling. A sizeable subset ( 7 of 15 cases; 47%) showed an amplikon at 19q13.1-13.2 in which the serine/threonine kinase Mirk/Dyrk1B is localized, a downstream effector of oncogenic k-ras. There was also strong concordance between primary tumors and cell lines with respect to gains on 8q, 12p and 18q. Analysis of gene expression was used to localize potential target genes.

        "Background":"['Benign Brenner tumors (BTs) are composed of nests of epithelial cells resembling urothelium, which are surrounded by a dense fibromatous stroma and are considered the benign counterpart of ovarian transitional cell tumors. Their origin remains enigmatic.We have previously described the junction between the fallopian tubal epithelium and the mesothelium of the tubal serosa, and reported that transitional cell metaplasia (TM) is frequently found in this location. We hypothesize that BTs arise from TM epithelium that, when embedded in the ovary as Walthard cell nests (WCs), may develop into BTs, some of which may progress to so-called atypical proliferative BTs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular genetic features of BTs in an attempt to confirm this hypothesis.A total of 17 ovaries, 25 peritoneal mesothelia, 38 fallopian tubes, 10 TMs, 56 WCs, 48 BTs and 7 atypical proliferative BTs were included in this study. IHC for AKR1C3, alpha-inhibin (INH), AR, -catenin, calretinin (CRT), CEA, CYP19, ER, p16, PAX2, PAX8, PR, SF1, and WT1, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for CDKN2A (p16 encoding gene) were performed. Genomic DNA from 20 BTs was extracted for sequence analysis of BRAF, CTNNB1, ERBB2, FOXL2, KRAS, PIK3CA, and PPP2R1A mutations.A somatic mutation of PIK3CA was detected in the stromal component in one BT. No other mutations were detected in either the epithelial or the stromal component in the remaining BTs. IHC analysis revealed that fallopian tubal secretory cells, TM, WC and epithelial component of BTs and atypical proliferative BTs shared the same IHC profile, consistently expressing AKR1C3, AR, but not CRT, as opposed to mesothelium and ovarian surface epithelium. The stromal component of the tumors showed weak expression of AKR1C3 in 23/26 (88%), AR in 26/29 (90%), ER in 32/42 (74%), PR in 38/43 (88%), and WT1 in 13/41 (32%), and strong expression of CRT in 34/41 (83%), INH in 33/41 (80%), and SF1 in 38/40 (95%) BTs. Notably, CRT, INH, and SF1 showed particularly strong staining in the stromal cells that immediately surrounded the epithelial nests. In contrast, expression of these biomarkers was absent in the BT epithelium. p16 was intensely and diffusely positive in the epithelial component of 9/13 (69%), patchy in 3/13 (23%), and negative in 1/13 (8%) benign BTs. In contrast all 7 atypical proliferative BTs were completely negative for p16 in the epithelial component. FISH identified homozygous deletion of CDNK2A in all atypical proliferative BTs, but CDKN2A was retained in benign BTs (Fisher exact test two sided p-value<0.0001).In summary, our findings suggest', ' 1) tubal origin of BTs through TM and WC, based on similar IHC profile, 2) an active role of the ovarian stroma in the pathogenesis of BT, based on the periepithelial IHC pattern of CRT, INH, and SF1, markers of steroidogenic cells, along with the epithelial expression of AR, 3) the role of CDKN2A loss in the progression of BT to atypical proliferative BT.Citation Format', ' Elisabetta Kuhn, Ayse Ayhan Ayhan, Jeffrey D.

Development of MM has been linked directly to exposure to asbestos fibers, but with a long latency period. Recent studies have indicated that the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced cancers is due, in part, to chronic inflammation and oxidative tissue damage caused by persistent asbestos fibers. Whole grain flaxseed (FS) has known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties. Rationale', ' As a prelude to future chemoprevention studies, we tested the ability of oral FS and its lignan component, FLC which is enriched in the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), to prevent acute asbestos-induced inflammation and inflammatory cytokine release in MM-prone Nf2+/mut;Cdkn2a+/mut mice. Methods', ' Mice were given a single ip bolus of 400 mM of crocidolite asbestos. They were then placed on 10% FS or 10% FLC supplemented diets 1 day prior (-1) to or after (+1) asbestos instillation. All mice were evaluated 3 days after injection of asbestos for abdominal inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine release. The Nf2+/mut;Cdkn2a+/mut model was selected as it develops an accelerated form of MM when exposed to asbestos. Results', ' Using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), we showed that systemic levels (plasma) of flaxseed lignan metabolites (such as the mammalian lignans Enterolactone (EL) and Enterodiol (ED)) were comparable to those in other mouse models where FS was shown to be an effective chemopreventive agent. The numbers of macrophages (MF) and neutrophils (PMN) in peritoneal lavage fluid indicated that both FS and FLC blunted acute abdominal inflammation induced by asbestos. In addition, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha and IL-1 beta in lavage fluid were also decreased by the dietary agents. Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that the known chemopreventive properties of FS and its lignan component appear to reduce short-term asbestos-induced inflammation and may thus prove to be a promising dietary agent in the chemoprevention of MM.Funding', \" This study was supported in part by Penn's SRP Center Grant (P42 ES027320), Asbestos fate, exposure, remediation and adverse health effects from the National Institute of Environmental Health (NIEHS) and 1R03CA180548-02 (MCS).\"]",

Clusters I and II express high HER2 (ERBB2) and estrogen receptor beta signaling signature, sharing features with Luminal A breast cancer. Cluster III shows similarities to Basal-like breast and squamous cell head and neck carcinomas.. Integrated analyses confirm alteration of multiple pathways, including cell cycle regulation (93%), kinase and PI3-K signaling (72%), and epigenetic regulation (histone-modifiers', ' 89%; SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex', ' 64%). Recurrent alterations in the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway (42%) and RTK/RAS pathway (44%) are potentially actionable.. Overall, this study and others have identified multiple druggable targets in UC. FGFR3 is activated by mutation, gene fusion, and overexpression, suggesting clinical trials of FGFR3 inhibitors. PI3-kinase/mTOR/AKT/TSC1 pathway alterations are frequent, and mutation in TSC1 has been associated with response to mTOR inhibitors. ERBB2 amplifications and activating mutations may be targetable with agents such as trastuzumab, trastuzumab-DM1, lapatinib, and neratinib. The frequent alterations in epigenetic regulatory pathways suggest trials of agents such as the bromodomain inhibitors.

        "Background":"['The INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus on human chromosome 9p21 is a hot spot genomic region that undergoes frequent inactivation or deletion in a wide spectrum of human cancers. The locus encodes three cell cycle inhibitory proteins', ' p15INK4b encoded by CDKN2b, p16INK4a encoded by CDKN2a and p14ARF (p19Arf in mice) encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF) of CDKN2a. We have recently identified a homologous INK4 genomic locus in zebrafish that is surprisingly devoid of ARF sequences, and encodes a single zebrafish ink4ab gene that functions to activate stress-induced senescence. Therefore, evolution of the mammalian INK4 locus to include multiple tumor suppressors sharing regulatory features could attribute to stronger mechanisms of tumor suppression in these longer-lived vertebrates. Oxidative and/or oncogenic stress provokes cellular senescence involving the retinoblastoma (Rb) and ARF/p53 pathways, leading to silencing of growth-promoting genes by methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) with the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. We found that ink4ab deficient zebrafish had deregulated Rb signaling and senescence responses, and reduced suv39h1 expression levels that led to poor overall survival. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had increased lymphocyte proliferation, splenomegaly, and developed multiple spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma, leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders. Moreover, zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates tumor latency, likely by reversing cellular senescence responses. To further examine ARF-independent senescence regulatory roles of INK4 products in a mammalian model, we have generated conditional mice deficient for all three INK4 open reading frames in the adult hematopoietic system. Within seven months, homozygous Ink4a/Ink4b/ARF-/- mice exhibited marked splenomegaly and developed spontaneous tumors, including leukemias and soft tissue sarcomas. Peripheral blood, splenic and bone marrow analyses of homozygous mutant mice showed deregulated lymphocyte development, uncontrolled proliferation, apoptosis and Suv39h1-dependent senescence when compared to heterozygous and wild type mice. These results identify ARF-independent and Suv39h1-dependent senescence regulatory and tumor suppressor mechanisms whose inactivation permits tumor formation in response to oncogenic and/or oxidative stress. Our models offer the opportunity to reveal novel paradigms for promoting cellular senescence as an alternative strategy for cancer prevention and therapy.']",

There are no effective treatment options in metastatic disease. Targeted therapies to ALK and BRAF are occasionally associated with dramatic responses. Retinoblastoma (Rb) inhibits cell cycle progression and is inactivated by CDK 4/6, which is the target for ribociclib. Nearly all differentiated thyroid cancers are Rb negative, conversely nearly 100% of ATC expresses intact Rb which may be crucial for rapid cell cycle progression. Ribociclib is a CDK 4/6 inhibitors that slows cell cycle progression and DNA replication in tumors with functional Rb. The p16 protein similarly inhibits CDK4/6; if p16 levels are high Rb is phosphorylated and thus inactive. p16 is low in ATC, and from our comprehensive genomic analysis 30% of ATC lacks the p16 gene CDKN2a. Most ATC demonstrates PI3K/Akt/mTOR abnormalities, this pathway represents an attractive target in ATC. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promising efficacy in ATC cell lines, especially in those with TSC2 mutation whose wild type negatively regulates mTOR. Methods', \" The combination of everolimus and ribociclib targets mutations/abnormalities that are frequently seen in ATC, and is tolerable based on Phase I/II trial results in the latest arm of the biomarker/oncogene driven ATC Master Protocol .

To identify sequential genomic changes in stepwise hepatocarcinogenesis, we analyzed fusion genes and mutations using next generation sequencer about 43 early and 105 advanced HCCs. First, exome sequence showed that base sequence aberrations (non-silent) were more frequent in advanced HCC than early HCC (70.9  29.0 vs 53.7  23.8 genes per tumor, P = 0.0002). Mutations in p53/RB pathway including TP53, ATM, RB1, CDKN2A, and CDKN1A were observed in 27.9% and 38.1% in early and advanced HCCs, respectively (P = 0.161) and those of WNT/b-catenin pathways consisting of CTNNB1, AXIN1, and APC were recurrently observed in both early and advanced HCCs (27.9% vs 41.0%, P = 0.095).

We also found that every HCC harbored 2 to 5 fusion genes, which were more frequent in advanced than earlyHCC, although there were no recurrent rearrangements in neither advanced nor early HCCs. Especially chromathripsis, in which 10 to 100 rearrangements were localized in the specific genomic regions and genomic features imply chromosome breaks occur in one-off crisis, was the event observed only in advanced HCC. Taken together, genomic changes were more frequent in advanced HCC, and inactivating mutations of p53/RB and WNT/b-catenin signaling pathways are the driver mutation in the initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis and that of ARID2 may play pivotal roles in the progression from early to advanced HCC.']",

Although other genes exhibiting moderate to high penetrant mutations have been recently associated with melanoma susceptibility, such as CDK4, PALB2, MITF, and TERT promoter, the majority of the melanoma susceptibility remains without a clear genetic etiology. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a common class of structural variants of the human genome, mainly impacting genes that mediate the interaction with environment. However, many rare germline CNVs have been causally associated with diseases, including mental impairment and cancer predisposition.Objective', ' Aiming to identify new genes potentially related to melanoma predisposition, 34 melanoma-prone patients negative for CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations were investigated for rare germline CNVs.Material and Methods', ' Patients - patients were ascertained at the A.

Using two prognostic gene signatures and an experimentally defined proliferative signature, highly concordant results for the top ranking sets of MTRs were found.

All of the three products play a pivotal role in tumor suppression and are frequently deleted or inactivated in a wide spectrum of human cancers. Despite the critical role of the mammalian INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in tumor suppression, its counterpart in zebrafish has not yet been characterized. Zebrafish is an advantageous vertebrate to model human cancers, specifically because of the high fecundity, the ease of performing high-throughput screens, and the genetic conservation with mammals. We identified a syntenic zebrafish ink4ab locus that consists of a single gene orthologous to both mammalian CDKN2a (INK4A) and CDKN2b (INK4B), and functions to activate senescence in response to oxidative stress. Utilizing morpholino targeted knockdown and zebrafish mutants for the ink4ab gene, we have developed a zebrafish model for tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the zebrafish ink4ab gene functions as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle regulation under stress. Senescence was activated by oxidative stress in wild type embryos but not in embryos with ink4ab deficiency when examined with a whole embryo senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA--gal) assay. Surprisingly, we find that ink4ab deficient embryos also display significantly higher levels of apoptosis than controls. We determined that the apoptosis associated with ink4ab deficiency is p53-dependent. Furthermore, ink4ab deficiency led to significantly lower survival rates, both overall and upon radiation. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had splenomegaly, increased lymphocyte proliferation, and developed spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders. Thus, the zebrafish ink4ab protein functions as a tumor suppressor similarly to the human p15INK4B and p16INK4A. To study the upstream control of zebrafish ink4ab expression, we investigated the orchestrated regulation by the Bmi-1 oncogene, and identified bmi-1a as a repressor of ink4ab expression. Zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates the latency and broadens the tumor spectrum including the formation of retinoblastoma. Collectively, the zebrafish ink4ab model of tumor suppression provides a platform to perform large-scale screens for small molecules that modulate tumorigenesis in the ink4ab deficient fish, and permit defining the genetic pathways of CDKN2a- and CDKN2b-mediated tumor suppression.']",

It is known that individuals with a personal history of colon adenomas or cancer are at increased risk for metachronous colon neoplasms.

Tophat, Cufflink, Mev, R was used for determining the expression levels. Splicegrapher and Genomon-fusion was used for identifying the fusion genes. Ordinal regression analysis was performed to characterize site-dependent expression profiles. Gene interaction was examined using String (Open database). All statistical tests were two-sided, except where noted. Expression profile showed that highly expressed genes associated with inflammation were detected in adenoma. Our results indicated that highly expressed genes associated with inflammation were initially found in adenoma tissues and its levels were consistent in carcinoma tissues. Number of somatic mutation was extremely increased in carcinoma tissues when compared to adenoma tissues. The same mutations in KRAS, CDKN2A(p16) and TP53 that were observed in carcinoma tissues. They were also present in normal tissues and adenoma tissues. Disruption of TP53, CDKN2A, and KRAS were all seen as possible initial events in tumorigenesis; the sequence of mutations (the tumor development pathway) differed among lesions. Also, unique somatic mutations were found 17 genes which were not exist in normal tissues. Those somatic mutations were found in carcinoma tissues.

Similarly, SCNA were compared between HPV + and HPV - tumors identifying numerous differences, including a paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase alterations in HPV + tumors and novel deletions in chromosome 11q and 14q. Exome sequencing revealed at least 15 significantly mutated genes at the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of <0.01, including', ' CDKN2A, TP53, PIK3CA, FAT1, MLL2, TGFBR2, HLA-A, NOTCH1, HRAS, NFE2L2, and CASP8. Consideration of differences between HPV + and HPV - tumors suggested differences which included nearly universal alteration of TP53 and frequent p16 mutations in HPV - tumors. By contrast, few TP53 or CDKN2A mutations were observed in HPV + samples. Strikingly, a large number of co-occurring genomic alterations were observed. For example, mutations of HRAS were observed nearly universally in combination with either CASP8 or FAT1. All three of these mutations were absent in HPV + patients. mRNA expression profiling revealed four distinct expression subtypes, each one enriched with distinct SCNA and mutational profiles', ' classical, basal, mesenchymal, and atypical. Deep sequencing by multiple platforms allowed for a detailed accounting of the role of HPV in alterations of the cancer genomes of HNSCC patients, including integration sites, disruption of tumor suppressor genes, and more complex rearrangements.

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14ARF and p16. We now show that p14ARF (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REG. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knock-down of REG or by pharmacological blockade of its nuclear export. Thus our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of two key tumor suppressors mediated by a REG-dependent mechanism.']",

The genetic etiology in these familial cases is poorly defined, with known susceptibility genes, such as', ' BRCA2, PALB2, CDKN2A, BRCA1, PRSS1 and STK11, accounting for only 10-15% of familial pancreatic cancer. In an effort to identify previously unappreciated pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes, we used next generation sequencing technology to evaluate the whole genome and whole exome sequences of 16 (6 families) and 22 individuals (10 families) respectively. All of these families enrolled into one of the familial pancreatic cancer registries participating in the Pancreatic Cancer Genetic Epidemiology (PacGene) Consortium, all had at least three members with PDA, and DNA was available from at least two affected members in each kindred. Using this approach, we identified heterozygous, inactivating, ATM mutations in two kindreds with familial pancreatic cancer (c.8266A>AT; p.K2756X and c.170G>GA; p.W57X). These mutations were previously reported as disease causing variants in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive condition resulting from bi-allelic deleterious mutations of ATM.

Various targeted therapies are being clinically and preclinically tested for BC management. MIBC have been associated with loss of cell cycle control. Defects in the RB pathway are a major mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation in MIBC. RB1 mutations were reported in 13% of TCGA samples, although significant mutations also were noted in CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CCND3. The CDK 4/6 complex combines with cyclin D1 to inhibit RB activity. Therapeutic targeting of this complex improves outcome in ER positive advanced breast cancer. Methods', ' Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is a cdk4/6 inhibitor currently tested for the treatment of other malignancies characterized by the presence of a functional RB1 gene. A series of BC cell lines of known genomic characteristics and differing in their RB1 status, were tested for their sensitivity to Palbociclib. Results', ' unexpectedly, we observed a similar response to Palbociclib in pRb wt and pRb mutant cell lines in vitro and in xenografts in vivo, although with different biochemical and cell cycle effects. Genomic characterization of these treated cells shows strong gene expression divergence as a consequence of Palbociclib treatment in pRb wt and mutant cells. Nonetheless, bioinformatic analyses revealed FoxM1 as a possible common regulator of some downregulated genes in both cases. Importantly, FoxM1 has been demonstrated a bona fide cdk4 substrate and may confer cis-platinum resistance. We observed reduced FoxM1 phosphorylation upon Palbociclib treatment in all cell lines tested, and also increased sensitivity to cis-platinum. Remarkably, we found that phosphorylated FoxM1 is a potential poor prognosis factor in human BC clinical samples. Conclusions', ' in our study we observed that the activity of Palbociclib in BC cell lines is independent on the RB1 status and showed synergistic activity with cisplatin.

This approach is now widely used to interrogate simple somatic mutations but experience with the analysis of copy number variations (CNV) is still limited.

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

The majority of specimens (28/34) used for profiling were from primary breast sites and contained 50% neoplastic cells. The transcriptomes were profiled using Illumina's HumanHT-12 microarray (v4). Data were normalized using mean normalization procedure. Differential expression analysis was performed using R's Limma package. Pathway analysis was carried out using R's signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) package with 69 cancer, immunity, and cell signaling related KEGG pathways. Results\", ' Using a cutoff of two-fold and adjusted p-value of 0.05, we identified 954 genes differentially expressed between Cav1+/- TNBC patients. Included in these were 31 genes which were found to be up-regulated by over five- fold and 3 genes down-regulated by over five fold in Cav1+ TNBC. Genes of notable interest for their role in cell signaling, cell adhesion, tumor invasion and metastasis, included an up-regulation of TGFBR2, SPARC, integrins (ITGA11, ITGB5, ITGBL1), cell adhesion proteins (LAMB3, COL5A3) and molecules which facilitate tumor invasion (LAMB3, MMP1, MMP2, MMP9). In addition, genes found to be down-regulated in Cav1+ patients and notable for their roles in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) included Claudin 3(CLD3) and CA125/MUC16 (Mucin 16). We also detected an approximately two-fold down-regulation of CDKN2A in Cav1+ patients. Using SPIA pathway analysis, 12 pathways were found to be differentially activated in Cav1+ vs. Cav1- TNBC. The most differentially activated pathways were the focal adhesion pathway (p = 4.51E-18), PI3k-Akt signaling pathway (p = 2.01E-6) and TGF- and MAPK signaling pathways (p = 0.005, 0.014, respectively). Conclusions', ' Differential gene expression patterns and pathway analyses provide evidence for distinct profiles for gene expression between Cav1+/- TNBC. Cav1+ TNBC patients exhibit up-regulation of genes important for cell signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion, and down-regulation of genes that may facilitate EMT and loss of cell cycle control. The focal adhesion pathway, as well as TGF-, PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, were identified as differentially activated among Cav1+/- TNBC. Taken together, these data support the role of Cav1+ in identifying a subtype of TNBC that may have a greater risk for invasion and metastasis.

In the last few decades, a steady increase in incidence rate of SCCT has been reported across the world. More importantly, though SCCT is considered to be a tobacco-related late-onset cancer, recent reports indicate an increase in incidence of SCCT in the young and in non-smokers. We analyzed the status of known tumorigenic pathways/genes including TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), microsatellite instability (MSI), CDKN2A, FHIT and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in 120 surgically resected primary oral SCCT (SCCOT) samples and correlated with clinico-pathological variables and disease specific survival. 78 of 121 (65%) samples exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization confirming earlier reports. Interestingly, p53 nuclear stabilization was more common in young (36/46; 78%) than in older (44/75; 56%) patients (p = 0.0184). Further, PCR based mutation screening of exons 5-8 (encoding the DNA binding domain of p53) revealed mutations in ten of nineteen samples (52.6%) that exhibited p53 nuclear stabilization and in three of fifteen tumors (20%) that did not. We identified a novel 33bp deletion, c.616-648del33, located in exon 5 in a p53 positive tumor from a chronic tobacco chewer. Case control analysis revealed that Proline at TP53 codon 72 increased the risk of SCCOT. Majority of samples (97/121; 80%) exhibited significant EGFR expression though HPV infection was rare (14/106; 13%). MSI was observed in 14/106 (13%) samples, a frequency higher than reported for other populations. Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) was more frequently observed in CDKN2A (28%) and FHIT (26%). In addition, LOH at FHIT locus was significantly associated with p53 nuclear stabilization (p = 0.0508), especially in non-smokers. A significant difference in survival rate between p53 positive and negative group (p = 0.0056) (Hazard ratio 2.5595) was observed. Though associated with p53 stabilization, FHIT loss did not exhibit significant effect on patient survival. Interestingly, patients exhibiting p53 nuclear stabilization as well as FHIT loss exhibited worse survival. We performed genome-wide DNA copy number and transcript profiling in several SCCOT samples. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in extent and profile of chromosomal instability in p53 positive and negative tumors. Amplifications were detected at chromosomal regions 3q26.1 (PIK3CA), 5p, 8q22 (MYC, RUNX1T1), 11q13 (CCND1) and 20q13 (HNF). Genome-wide transcript profiling identified novel pathways that appear to drive tumorigenesis in tumors not exhibiting p53 inactivation. Our comprehensive analysis has therefore revealed important insights into the molecular basis for SCCOT and identified prognostic indicators in patients not associated with tobacco use.']",

Methods', ' Asymptomaticpts with RECIST and/or CA125 measurable disease failing chemotherapy or anti-hormonal therapy were given oral palbociclib 125 mg once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off over 28-day cycles. Response was assessed every 8 wks. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients progression-free at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included ORR (RECIST or GCIG CA125 criteria), PFS and safety. Tumor was collected for targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). NCT01536743 Results', ' As of January 28, 2016, 37 of 40 pts were accrued from 2 centers.

Using RECIST median PFS was 3.7 months (95%CI, 1.2-6.2), and 1/26 PR (4%), 17/26 SD (65%) and 8/26 PD (31%) were seen. Using GCIG CA125 criteria median PFS was 4 months (95%CI, 0.3-7.6), 1/30 CR (3%), 3/30 PR (10%), 18/30 SD (60%) and 8/30 PD (27%) were seen. Toxicity was minimal; grade 2 events included anemia (2), nausea (1) abdominal pain (1), grade 3/4 events included neutropenia (5), thrombocytopenia (4), hypokalemia (1) and emesis (1). 1 pt experienced a bowel obstruction and 1 pt died due to disease progression within 30 days of treatment discontinuation. Efficacy is being correlated with targeted NGS data including CDKN2A, RB or CCNE.

Affording a survey of the wide breadth of genomic lesions found in melanoma, we present here an analysis of the somatic mutations discovered in the sequenced exomes of 121 melanoma tumor-normal pairs. We identify frequent genomic alterations both in genes previously implicated in melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN) as well as in several genes whose role in melanoma tumorigenesis has not yet been established and thus are of particular interest. To do so we implement a novel method to increase the identification of genes that are significantly recurrently mutated in melanoma in the setting of its exceptionally high mutation rate. A preponderance of C>T transitions (85%) in the observed mutational profile reflects a history of DNA damage due to UV radiation, though the majority of somatic mutations in known melanoma genes are not C>T events. Our study broadens understanding of the genomic lesions involved in melanoma tumorigenesis, and we expect our analysis approach to inform future genomic studies of cancer lineages with similarly high mutation rates.']",

        "Background":"['Targeting cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) with inhibitors such as abemaciclib has shown promise in early and late phase clinical trials in both breast cancer and NSCLC. While there is evidence that patients benefit from single-agent abemaciclib, combination strategies leveraging this compound together with immunotherapy are of interest for the treatment of these and other cancers. Consequently, it is important to understand if and how a cell cycle inhibitor can be combined with immunotherapy. However, because most preclinical studies have been performed using xenograft tumors in immune-compromised mice, the potential immunomodulatory effects of abemaciclib have not been adequately ascertained. To investigate the immune combinatorial potential of abemaciclib, we studied the effects of treatment alone and in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy in a murine syngeneic tumor model sensitive to abemaciclib using immuno-competent mice. Abemaciclib monotherapy of established murine CT26 tumors, which harbor KRAS G12C mutation and CDKN2A deletion, caused a dose-dependent delay in tumor growth. Surprisingly, gene expression analysis showed that treatment was associated with an increase in intra-tumor immune inflammation without major alteration in immune subset frequencies. Testing of various dosing regimens in this preclinical model found that monotherapy abemaciclib pretreatment followed by combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy, induced an enhanced anti-tumor response compared to abemaciclib and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Optimal combination therapy exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy, resulting in complete tumor regression (CR) in 50-60% of mice in a setting where anti-PD-L1 monotherapy showed little or no efficacy (0% CRs). Mice which maintained CRs after cessation of combination therapy were able to resist later CT26 rechallenge, demonstrating that abemaciclib in combination with anti-PD-L1 enabled the generation of an immunologic memory. Examination of intra-tumor gene expression during treatment found that combination therapy further amplified the immune/T cell activation signature compared to both monotherapies. Intra-tumoral suppression of cell cycle genes, which are indicative of inhibition of CDK4/6, was also greater during the combination therapy, suggesting that the effects anti-PD-L1 therapy may augment the cell cycle arrest induced by abemaciclib. Although it was uncertain if agents that inhibit cell proliferation could be combined with immunotherapy, these preclinical results demonstrate that it is possible to combine CDK4/6 inhibition by abemaciclib with checkpoint immunotherapy to improve tumor efficacy. The synergistic responses observed in terms of tumor efficacy, immune activation, and cell cycle control provides support for the clinical investigation of this combination.']",

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION', ' It is estimated that cancer prevention efforts can reduce cancer incidence by over 50%. Unlike for advanced disease, effective molecularly-driven interventions and risk assessment are not available for clinically normal tissues that may be have been exposed to carcinogens or for precancerous lesions. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) comprises 15-20% of all skin cancers and has the most accessible and clinically well-characterized progression sequence of any human cancer, from a distinct precancerous lesion, the actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive carcinoma. Thus, it is an ideal model for establishing a paradigm of molecularly targeted cancer chemoprevention.METHODS', ' Here, we performed next-generation sequencing of total RNA and miRNA (Illumina HiSeq) on matched isogenic samples of human cuSCC, surrounding normal (chronically irradiated) skin (NS), and AK. In parallel, we profiled matched samples from a UV-driven Hairless mouse model of cuSCC for cross-species analysis, to identify the most important drivers of progression from NS to AK to cuSCC.RESULTS', ' Unsupervised clustering of both mRNA and miRNA expression changes showed that preneoplastic AKs span a continuum indistinguishable from cuSCC or surrounding NS, whereas cuSCC and NS were easily distinguished. Through cross-species computational analysis of mRNA-miRNA functional pairs, we identified miR-21, miR-205, miR-31, let-7B, and miR-497 and their mRNA targets as core drivers of cuSCC development through the AK intermediate. We show that several of these miRNAs are modulated by UV exposure, regulate susceptibility to apoptosis, and regulate cell motility. Several miRNAs are being inhibited in our mouse model to validate them as chemoprevention targets. TRANSFAC analysis identified E2F, SP1, AP1, and TCF3 as key transcriptional regulators of SCC development. We tested the global mRNA and miRNA expression similarities to other tumor types profiled by the NIH TCGA effort, showing that cuSCC is most closely related to head & neck SCC, lung SCC, and basal subtype of breast cancer. Exome analysis confirmed a high frequency of TP53, NOTCH1/2, and CDKN2A mutations in cuSCC, with mutational loads of >30/Mb that are strongly dominated by UVB signature lesions. Surprisingly, NS contains evidence of numerous mutations reflecting UV-induced somatic mosaicism.CONCLUSIONS', ' We report the first integrated transcriptomic characterization of the development of cuSCC through the preneoplastic AK. AKs are indistinguishable from cuSCC, suggesting that chemoprevention efforts should be directed at UV-exposed skin prior to the emergence of lesions. Key transcriptional responses in miRNAs and transcription factor networks were identified in our cross-species analysis, which have been functionally validated. Finally, SCCs of diverse anatomic sites share deep genomic commonalities suggesting that there may be common chemoprevention strategies applicable to multiple SCC types.']",

        "Meeting_name":" The long non-coding RNA CAI2 is a tumor suppressor gene",
        "Background":"['We have recently reported on the discovery of a long non-coding RNA imbedded in intron 2 of the p16/ARF (CDKN2A) locus at 9p21. CAI2 is a non-conserved, RNA pol II regulated gene with whose expression is highly correlated with parent genes p16 and ARF. However, CAI2 is expressed in cell lines deleted for p16, ARF and even p15, and is expressed cell lines epigenetically silenced for p16 and/or ARF. Furthermore, treatment of p16 and/or ARF epigenetically silenced cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidin allows p16 and/or ARF re-expression while having no influence on CAI2, confirming independent regulation. Speculating, therefore, that the regulatory region of CAI2 lies imbedded in the non-transcribed portion of intron 2, we created expression constructs of the immediate 5 region of CAI2. However, consistent with a bioinformatical analysis, no regulatory activity was detected. This suggests that this non-coding RNA is non-traditionally controlled by remote but yet to be identified regulatory element(s) and/or mechanisms. By colony formation assay, CAI2 overexpression can inhibit cell growth in the p16 intact HEK293T and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines. RNA Immunoprecipitation has revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and BMI1, a PRC1 complex protein that is a negative regulator of p16. Consistent with this effect, CAI2 can induce p16 expression in HEK293T cells, and this was hypothesized to be the mechanism by which CAI2 inhibits cell growth. However, we now show that CAI2 can also inhibit colony formation in the p16/ARF deleted MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly however, CAI2 overexpression had little to no effect on 2D cultures of HEK293T or MCF7 cells including DNA synthesis, XTT metabolic activity or cell count.As CAI2 is imbedded in the p16/ARF gene, standard siRNAs may inadvertently influence p16 and/or ARF expression due to actions on their pre-mRNAs. Therefore, we created a series of partial CAI2 knockouts using CRISPR technology and compared their growth by colony formation assay. Notably, clones containing a partial knockout of the 5 region of CAI2 proliferated faster than mock transfected clones, consistent with the growth suppressive properties observed with CAI2 overexpression. In 2D cultures, a small increase in DNA synthesis was also observed in the partial deletions. The HEK293T clones containing partial deletions of CAI2 also exhibited small increases in expression of the remaining intact portions of the gene with a concomitant decrease in p16 expression, all consistent with an influence of CAI2 on p16 expression and cell growth; no influence on ARF expression was observed.Taken together, the data demonstrate that CAI2 is capable of influencing p16 expression, but this influence is insufficient to fully account for the ability of CAI2 to regulate growth, and we conclude that CAI2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in its own right.']",
