This dysregulation of Met signaling was implicated in the proliferation and eventual metastasis of NSCLC, and therefore represents an attractive target for anticancer drug development.Currently, there are a number of clinical trials for Met targeted small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of the Met protein will be very important for these Met targeted therapies and requires a highly specific antibody to prevent false positives. To develop a highly specific monoclonal antibody against Met for IHC analysis in NSCLC, we generated 97 monoclonal antibodies. IHC evaluation showed that 8 of the antibodies had suitable performance in Met positive NSCLC patient tissues. The 8 Met monoclonal antibodies were further tested on a high density protein microarray chip containing 17,000 human proteins. The microarray analysis showed that clone 3G5 was highly specific as evidenced with it only reacting with Met on the microarray. This new 3G5 Met monoclonal antibody will be a promising candidate as a diagnostic reagent for detecting Met protein in NSCLC with minimal false positives.']",

Methods', '  The study included 73 NSCLC patients tested for ALK rearrangements at Cleveland Clinic (2000-2012), including 21 ALK+ and 52 ALK-. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on FFPE tumor tissue was performed for c-MET using a monoclonal CONFIRM antibody (SP44, Ventana) with Ventana Benchmark XT automated immunostainer and for HGF using a polyclonal antibody (R&D) following a manual protocol. IHC scoring was interpreted on a 4-tier  system (0, 1+, 2+, 3+). MET gene amplification by MET/Chromosome 7 dual probe in-situ hybridiazation (DISH) (Ventana) was also performed.

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas.

        "Background":"['Drug resistance is one of important factors limiting effect of most cancer therapies. Understanding mechanisms causing resistance can facilitate overcoming resistance. c-MET gene activation, via either activating mutations or gene amplification, is an oncogenic driver for some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) in patients as well as in patient derived xenograft (PDX) (1). c-MET gene activation is also one of the two most dominant TKI-resistance seen among the patients treated with EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) (1, 2). Therefore, c-MET inhibitor could become an important treatment option for NSCLC patients whose c-MET is either de nova activated or activated during TKI treatment (1). We recently demonstrated that Crizotinib (PF2341066), an approved drug against NSCLC with ALK-fusion and a known c-MET inhibitor, can effectively treat NSCLC with c-MET gene amplification, including those resistant to EGFR-TKIs (1), in PDXs. Specifically, we described two models LU1901 and LU2503  both with amplified gene, accompanied with over-expression, of c-MET, and both sensitive to Crizotinib (complete regression in LU2503, while near-complete regression in LU1901) (1), confirming the c-MET activation as dominant oncogenic driver for these two tumors.In the present study, interestingly, the treated LU1901 tumors subsequently re-emerge and re-grow even in the presence of continuous treatment. In particular, the re-growed LU1901 become completely resistant to Crizotinib (we call LU1901R), even after it was re-engrafted. Pharmacodynamic analysis revealed that the LU1901R tumor has similar level of phosphorylation (or activation) of c-MET as the parental LU1901. Crizotinib treatment caused nearly-similar inhibition of c-MET in both LU1901 and LU1901R, as well as the downstream signaling, including pMEK and pAKT by Crizotinib in both LU1901 and LU1901R tumors along with c-MET inhibition. All these suggest that the threshold of c-MET activation for prompting tumor growth/survival is significantly lower in LU1901R than LU1901. We are currently characterizing the LU1901R in order to identify the mechanisms of resistance, and attempt to find approach to overcome them.In summary, we have successfully developed c-MET inhibitor resistant models that may reflect resistance emergence in the clinics. These models could be particularly useful in investigating clinical resistant mechanisms and evaluating new therapy that can overcome resistance.']",

The current study investigated the potential of EMD1214063 (provided by EMD Serono Merck Inc) in enhancing cancer cell sensitivity to radiation.Materials and Methods', ' Three NSCLC lines (A549, H460 and H1993) and three HNSCC lines (FaDu, HN-5 and UMSCC-1) with different levels of Met protein were used for the study. The effects of EMD1214063 on Met expression, cell viability, migration and cell radiosensitivity were assessed. Various scheduling effect on the magnitude of increased cell radiosensitivity was evaluated. 53BP1 foci formation was assayed for DNA repair kinetics. In vivo tumor growth delay assays on two NSCLCs and two HNSCCs generated in mice were performed to test the efficacy of EMD1214063 on tumor growth and tumor response to radiation.Results', ' NSCLC lines expressed higher levels of Met than HNSCC lines. EMD1214063 reduced survival of NSCLC lines markedly and had a minimal effect on HNSCC lines in vitro. Western blots showed three major Met protein bands with molecular weights of about 145 kDa, 60 kDa and 45 kDa. Radiation increased the expression levels of the 145 kDa and 60 kDa fragments of Met in a dose dependent manner.

It potently enhanced the radiosensitivity of A549, H1993, HN-5 and FaDu but not that of H460 and UMSCC-1. The enhancement factors at the survival fraction of 0.5 ranged from 1.11 to 2.24, with H1993 being the most responsive cell line. In vivo data showed lack of single agent activity of EMD1214063 on the growth of tumor xenografts tested (A549, H460 and FaDu).

        "Background":"['Background. MET is the tyrosine kinase receptor for the ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). MET kinase has been identified as a novel promising target in non-small cell lung lung cancer (NSCLC). Crizotinib, a recently FDA-approved ALK inhibitor for NSCLC harboring ALK 2p23 fusion (ALK+), was initially developed as a MET inhibitor. MET expression level is a potential biomarker for response to MET inhibitors. The role of MET/HGF pathway in ALK+ NSCLC is unknown.Methods. A cohort of 51 NSCLC patients tested for ALK fusion at Cleveland Clinic (2000 to 2012), including 15 ALK(+) and 36 ALK(-) subjects, were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain against MET was performed using a monoclonal CONFIRM anti-Total c-MET antibody (SP44, Ventana). Staining was performed on a Ventana Benchmark XT automated immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems). A four-tier (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) scoring system and H-score (the sum of each intensity score x %) were used. Thirteen ALK(+) patients treated on crizotinib therapy were prospectively followed and a total of 32 blood plasma samples were collected (1) prior to crizotinib initiation, (2) during responding period and (3) at disease progression, for HGF level measurement using HGF ELISA kit (R&D). Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test in JMP.Results. Of the 51 tumor tested for MET IHC, 39 were adenocarcinoma (15 ALK+ and 24 ALK-), 6 squamous cell, 4 large cell carcinoma and 2 other NSCLC. None received any MET inhibitor when tissue was collected. The percentage of negative MET IHC (score 0 or 1+ in 50% tumor cells) was not statistically significant between ALK(+) and ALK(-) groups (40% vs 30%, p=0.5). The plasma HGF levels in ALK(+) patients varies from undetectable to 14000pg/ml. The median (25th-75th quantiles) level in patients prior to crizotinib therapy (n=5), during responding period (CR/PR/SD, n=12) and at disease progression (n=5) were 2137(767-12100)pg/ml, 1629(785-3430)pg/ml and 4064(1108-7308)pg/ml. The plasma HGF level showed a trend of decreasing during clinical response to crizotinib and elevation upon disease progression, albeit not reaching statistical significance in this small study cohort (p>0.05).Conclusions. MET expression is commonly seen in NSCLC, and no significant difference were observed between fusion ALK(+) and ALK(-) NSCLC. The baseline plasma HGF concentration varied significantly among ALK(+) NSCLC patients, but showed a trend correlating with therapeutic response and resistant progression, to crizotinib therapy. Prospective study with larger cohorts is warranted to further evaluate the role of MET/HGF as biomarker in ALK targeted therapy.']",

Tepotinib is a highly selective c-Met inhibitor with good tolerability and promising activity against solid tumors. We report final data from a phase Ib trial of tepotinib + gefitinib in pts with c-Met+/EGFR-mutant NSCLC conducted in Asia. Methods', ' Eligible pts were adults with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC and ECOG PS 01.

The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of tepotinib in combination with gefitinib; secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and antitumor activity. Results', ' 18 pts were enrolled (median age 65 [4178]; 8 male); 6 received T300G250, 12 T500G250.

Grade 3 TRTEAEs were increased amylase (n = 4), increased lipase (3), neutropenia (1), and hyperglycemia (1). The best overall response was partial response in 6 pts; 4/7 pts with IHC 3+ tumors responded (all treated with T500G250) vs 2/11 with IHC 2+ tumors.

Moreover, the clinicopathological characteristics and targeted therapy of these MET/EGFR-coexisting patients remain elusive. Methods', ' Next-generation sequencing was performed on the DNA of 969 patients and Sanger sequencing was conducted on cDNA of 621 patients for MET exon 14 mutations in NSCLCs.

        "Background":"['MET is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is deregulated (gene amplification, mutation and over-expression) across multiple cancer types. Signaling through MET is normally activated through interactions with its specific ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Aberrant MET/HGF activation can stimulate tumor growth, promote angiogenesis, induce metastasis and may contribute to resistance mechanisms in several tumor types. Several non-selective MET inhibitors have entered clinical development; results have been mixed based on potency, selectivity, and/or patient selection. Volitinib is a potent (IC50 4 nM) and selective (>650 fold selectivity over 265 kinases), small molecule inhibitor of MET. Recent evaluation of Volitinib across a panel of cancer cell lines demonstrated selectivity for MET-driven disease, with MET amplified cell lines being most sensitive (IC50s of 1nM) and also suggesting limited off target activity. Volitinib resistant cell lines with MET amplification were identified and used to better understand the relationship of concurrent mutations with response. In addition to cancer cell line selectivity, we are analyzing preclinical models of NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) that are representative of key patient segments, namely MET amplification and over expression. In newly diagnosed NSCLC adenocarcinomas, focal MET amplification events represent 3% of the population while over expression of MET (without gene amplification) is observed in the majority of patients. In preclinical models, focal Met amplification in EBC-1 and NCI-H1993 caused significant tumor growth inhibition, confirming sensitivity to Volitinib. Given the prevalence of over expression in NSCLC, however, we sought to build a platform of evidence for the therapeutic use of Volitinib in preclinical models lacking amplification of the MET gene. Using a patient-derived xenograft model (PDX) of EGFR WT, KRAS WT and metastatic NSCLC disease (HLXF-036LN), we demonstrate that Volitinib induces tumor regression as monotherapy and has added therapeutic benefit when used in combination with taxotere. In addition, we show robust efficacy effects for additional preclinical models, LG0567, LG0645 and Calu-3, for either Volitinib alone or in combination with taxotere. In parallel pharmacodynamic studies, we demonstrate that Volitinib inhibits p-MET and downstream signaling in each model. Together, using an integrated platform of molecular characterization and MET FISH and IHC scores, corresponding antitumor responses to Volitinib are being evaluated for several patient segments. We are using these studies to inform the design of patient selection criteria for upcoming clinical trials in NSCLC.']",

It belongs in the family with CBL-B and CBL-3. Our previous studies detected CBL mutations, loss of heterozygosity, and low protein expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We also determined the genetic variations of CBL, their relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as EGFR and MET, and their functionality in NSCLC. However, ubiquitination of EGFR showed no difference between CBL wild type (WT) and mutants (Mts). Therefore, we undertook to investigate whether MET is a potential target of CBL and better therapeutic strategy.Materials/ Methods', ' CBL alterations were determined in NSCLC patients with next generation sequencing. Immunoprecipitation was performed to detect the ubiquitination of MET by CBL WT and Mts. MET inhibitor SU11274 was utilized to compare cell viability of CBL WT cells with viability of CBL Mt cells. Cell motility after SU11274 treatment was examined by wound healing assay. Soft agar assay was performed to investigate colony formation of shRNA knockdown (sh-CBL) cells and SU11274 treatment. PamGene Chip analysis was used to detect and predict the RTK phosphorylation difference between CBL WT and Mt/sh-CBL cells. In vivo mouse study was performed to examine tumor growth and metastasis of sh-CBL cells.Results', ' CBL had 6% (8/135) mutation rate in NSCLC patient population. When CBL and MET protein expression levels were analyzed by immunoblot, CBL WT cells had lower MET protein expression than CBL Mt cells. The ubiquitination of MET was decreased in cells that transiently expressed CBL Mt relative to CBL WT cells. In addition, CBL Mt cells were more sensitive to MET inhibitor SU11274 than CBL WT cells. Wound healing assay demonstrated sh-CBL cells had an increase in cell motility and more sensitive with SU11274 migration inhibition. Furthermore, soft agar assay showed an increase in colony number and size of sh-CBL cells compared to control cells. After treatment with SU11274, sh-CBL cells showed inhibition in colony formation. In vivo study showed sh-CBL cells had lower tumor growth but more metastasis than control cells. PamGene results predicted an effective cell signaling pathway involving MET, paxillin, EPHA2, and VEGFR..Conclusions', ' Ubiquitination assay result suggested MET is one of direct targets of CBL. The cell viability and motility results demonstrated that CBL mutants and sh-CBL cells are more sensitive than CBL WT cells to MET inhibitor SU11274, suggesting they have higher MET protein expression.

        "Background":"['Tumor invasiveness and therapeutic resistance strongly contribute to the low (<10%) five-year survival rate for advanced stage lung cancer; thus, identification of novel interventions targeting metastasis and therapeutic resistance is a necessity. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are two cell surface receptors known to be associated with lung cancer invasiveness and cell survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that Fn14 was over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlated with activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and that expression of Fn14 modulated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis. We hypothesize that elevated Fn14 expression can be maintained by c-Met activation, and that blockade of Fn14 can suppress NSCLC invasiveness driven by c-Met. Here we demonstrate that Fn14 protein expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression in primary NSCLC patient tumors. Fn14 and c-Met were more highly expressed in metastatic tumors compared to patient-matched primary NSCLC tumors, suggesting a role in the metastatic phenotype. To further elucidate the relationship between Fn14 and c-Met in NSCLC invasiveness, we employed two cell lines derived from a primary tumor (H2073) and metastatic lymph node (H1993) of the same patient. H1993 cells (c-Met receptor amplification) expressed significantly elevated protein levels of Fn14 compared to H2073 (low c-Met), which were significantly diminished in H1993 cells upon c-Met inhibition through SU11274 treatment. Moreover, exposure of H2073 cells to HGF induced the protein expression of Fn14. The elevated expression of Fn14 through HGF stimulation (H2073) or c-Met receptor amplification (H1993) was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a potent MEK inhibitor, suggesting that c-Met-induced Fn14 expression may depend on MAPK signaling. To further elucidate the effect of Fn14 on global c-Met-induced expression, genome-wide expression analysis was employed to determine genes both over-expressed in H1993 compared to H2073 and subsequently suppressed in Fn14 depleted H1993 cells. RALGPS2, a gene over-expressed in lung tumors that induces of c-fos and OPRL1, a gene elevated in metastatic melanoma, were elevated in the metastatic cell line and subsequently suppressed with Fn14 depletion. In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of Fn14 in H1993 cells attenuated cell migration and invasion by 45% and 40%, respectively. This work demonstrates that c-Met and Fn14 may play a critical role in NSCLC metastasis, and suggests that targeting Fn14 may impact c-Met-driven NSCLC invasiveness. Successful targeting of NSCLC invasiveness would have significant clinical impact on a disease that is deadly in its advanced stages.']",

To understand how cells develop EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance, we use three model NSCLC cell lines', ' H2170, H358 and H1975. H2170 and H358 cell lines express high levels of EGFR and c-Met and are EGFR wild-type. These cell lines were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib, the c-Met TKI SU11274 and a combination of both by exposure to increasing concentrations of these TKIs. The H1975 cell line is positive for two EGFR TKD mutations (T790M and L858R) which confer resistance to erlotinib.Studies have shown that EGFR/c-Met TKI resistant cells may use alternative signaling pathways to activate downstream transcription/translation proteins previously activated by EGFR and c-Met signaling. The Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways are demonstrated to have significant roles in cell survival, resistance and tumorigenesis in NSCLC. Several EGFR/c-Met-linked proteins in these two signaling pathways were differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines. The Wnt signaling transducer -catenin plays a role in cellular proliferation and death and its deregulation is implicated in lung cancer. Protein kinase GSK-3 also plays an important role in lung cancer and its inhibition by Wnt results in mTOR activation. It is encoded by two genes, GSK-3 and GSK-3. GATA-6 is a transcriptional activator of Wnt and is also implicated in several cancers. Active -catenin was found to be 2 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SU11274-resistant (SR) cells and 2 to 20-fold upreglated in H2170 erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells, in the presence and absence of TKIs and growth factor ligands, when compared to nave H2170 cells. GATA-6 was found to be 1.5 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SR cells and 2 to 3-fold upreglated in H2170 ER cells. Conversely, p-GSK-3 and p-GSK-3 were found to be 1.2 to 4.8-fold and 1.5 to 10.7-fold downreglated in H2170 SR cells, respectively. These results indicate increased activation of the Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways in TKI resistant cells.We are currently studying the expression of these proteins further in the H1975 cell line.To translate our studies to patients, we are investigating the role of EGFR/c-Met synergism in NSCLC by conducting a retrospective biomarker analysis using IHC on 100 tissue samples from patients with stage 3 and 4 squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. Preliminary results indicate that EGFR and c-Met receptors are co-expressed in lung cancer tissues and we are acquiring data to determine how co-localization and synergism affects patient prognosis. Further studies are being conducted on proteins in the Wnt and mTOR signaling pathways, such as p70S6Kinase, mTOR, -Catenin and Axin-2, and their involvement in patient prognosis and resistance.

        "Background":"['Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for more than 80% of lung cancer, the leading cause of death among all cancer casualties. The MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is often co-expressed with EGFR in the NSCLC cells, and is an important alternative resistant mechanism for escaping EGFR-targeted therapy. To assess the benefit of dual blockage of MET and EGFR for NSCLC therapy, we investigated the activities of these two RTK pathways in several NSCLC cell lines carrying distinct cellular contexts, and determined their responses to SGX523 and erlotinib, the small molecule kinase inhibitors of MET and EGFR, respectively. Here, we showed that MET can cross-activate EGFR in MET-amplified or overexpressing cells via hetero-receptor dimerization, and the MET-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR can be abolished by SGX523 but not by erlotinib. More importantly, combined inhibition of MET and EGFR in vitro results in a maximal suppression of downstream ERK and AKT activation and of cell proliferation when their ligands (HGF and EGF) are present. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SGX523 and erlotinib combination strengthens anti-cancer activity in vivo in a cellular context-dependent manner. The combination led to regression of MET-amplified H1993 tumors by enhancing suppression of proliferation and inducing apoptosis, whereas significantly reduced MET-non-amplified H1373 tumor growths by suppression of proliferation without inducing apoptosis. Although SGX523 alone was sufficient to achieve near complete regression of MET-addicted EBC-1 tumors, its combination with erlotinib strongly inhibited viability of a population of SGX523-insensitive cells emerging from SGX523-treated EBC-1 tumor relapse. Our data suggest that dual blockage of MET and EGFR can enhance anti-cancer effects on NSCLC in a context-dependent manner, and provide a strong rationale and mechanisms for combining MET and EGFR inhibitors for NSCLC therapy.']",

MET overexpression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in which  50% tumor cells with moderate to high intensity staining were defined as MET positive. MET amplification was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and FISH positive was defined as gene focal amplification or high polysomy (at least 15% cells with  5 copy numbers). Meanwhile, EGFRmutations were tested by DNA sequencing or Scorpion amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Results', ' The frequency of concomitant MET overexpression and EGFR mutation was 38.9% (58/149) in advanced NSCLC. However, the frequency of MET amplification was 13.6% (6/44). The frequency of primary resistance to EGFR TKIs was 24.1% (14/58) in EGFR/MET-coexisted patients and 14.2% (13/91) in those with only EGFR mutations, P= 0.13. Response rate (RR) of EGFR-TKIs was 48.3% (28/58), and 71.4% (65/91) in these two arms respectively, P= 0.004. Median PFS was 10.7 vs 11.2 months, Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 95% CI 0.69~1.60, P = 0.82. Primary resistance to EGFR TKIs were found in 2 cases with concomitant MET amplification and EGFRmutations, but they responded to combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors. Conclusions', ' Advanced NSCLC patients with concomitant EGFR mutation and MET overexpression have relatively low RR with EGFR-TKIs, indicating that MET overexpression potentially causes primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs which might be overcome by combination of EGFR and MET inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) are receptor tyrosine kinases that each plays a key role in cancer signaling.Co-expression and activation of MET and EGFR are found in a number of tumor types, including non-small cell lung, colorectal, gastric, and head and neck cancers (Nanjo et al. 2013). Blocking one receptor tends to up-regulate the other, leading to resistance to single-agent treatment (Engelman et al. 2007). Amplification of MET and/or high levels of HGF expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with intrinsic or acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR (Engelman et al. 2007; Yano et al. 2011). Conversely, MET-amplified lung cancer cells exposed to MET-inhibiting agents for a prolonged period develop resistance via the EGFR pathway (McDermott et al. 2010). The crosstalk between the MET and EGFR pathways suggests that dual inhibition of these targets may lead to improved outcomes for patients with MET- and EGFR-positive cancers, and that simultaneous inhibition may overcome or delay resistance compared to the blockade of just a single pathway. LY3164530 is an engineered mAb-scFv bispecific antibody that consists of an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody to MET and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to EGFR fused to the N-terminus of each heavy chain (HC). LY3164530 binds to extracellular domains of MET and EGFR with high affinity and inhibits signaling via both MET and EGFR receptors by blocking ligand binding and internalizing and degrading both receptors. In tumor cells, it binds and co-immunoprecipitates both receptors. LY3164530 has increased avidity binding to MET in cells expressing higher level of EGFR. This increased avidity binding leads to better neutralization of HGF compared to parental MET antibody in these cells. Surprisingly, LY3164530 has superior activity in internalizing/degrading EGFR (wild type and mutant forms) in vitro and in vivo relative to the combination of LY2875358 (i.e., emibetuzumab) and cetuximab in cells expressing high MET and EGFR. In addition, LY3164530 has superior activity in overcoming HGF-mediated resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, or vemurafenib as compared to the combination of individual monoclonal antibodies targeting these receptors in cell-based assays. In vivo, administration of LY3164530 results in dose-dependent antitumor activity in multiple cell line-derived NSCLC and gastric xenografts. The antitumor activity of LY3164530 is equivalent, and in some cases superior to the combination of emibetuzumab and cetuximab in NSCLC and gastric tumor models. The Phase 1 study with LY3164530 is on-going (NCT02221882).']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is a leading cause of deaths from cancer among men and women worldwide with an estimated 1.5 million deaths each year. Available molecularly targeted therapies benefit a limited number of patients and even in these patients acquired resistance is a major impediment to effective therapeutic response. To address the need for additional therapeutic targets, we used a unique approach to identify and target tumor-stroma paracrine crosstalk pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).To explore paracrine crosstalk in NSCLC, we analyzed transcriptomes of specific stromal and epithelial compartments that were sorted from Kras driven mouse model of NSCLC. Transcriptome analysis and computational modeling of multi-cellular network identified potential tumor-stroma crosstalk signaling pathways. We have selected the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway because both HGF and MET are associated with poor survival in many cancer types including lung cancer. Notably, we identified reprogrammed intratumoral macrophages as unique source of HGF, while the expression of MET receptor was confined to tumor epithelial compartment. Importantly, we have observed elevated HGF in chemoresistant tumors both in mouse and human. Previous studies have implicated MET receptor amplification or mutations as the main mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, but little is known about the contribution of HGF ligand-dependent activation of MET signaling in NSCLC growth and resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens that are widely used. We have used a combination of culture experiments and in vivo genetic approaches to show that macrophage-derived HGF interacts with the MET receptor on tumor epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion, to activate downstream signaling pathways that promote tumor progression and mediate resistance to standard chemotherapies. Our investigations on this relatively unexplored HGF-MET paracrine interaction as a key mechanism of resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimens-and not just EGFR targeted therapies-have the potential to benefit the NSCLC population as whole rather than a small subset of patients.']",

MET exon 14 contains the Y1003 CBL ubiquitin ligase regulatory binding site that normally mediates CBL-dependent MET degradation and signal attenuation. Deletion of this exon results in sustained activation of MET and its downstream signaling pathways. The diverse splice site mutations leading to exon 14 skipping comprise a unique and unprecedented class of RTK activating mutations and the molecular mechanism by which these genetic alterations transform cancer cells is not fully understood. One major challenge in understanding the utility of MET inhibition of the METex14del class has been the lack of available pre-clinical models.In the present study, we generated and characterized multiple METex14del-driven cancer models to study the mechanism of MET-dependent cellular transformation as well as the response to MGCD265, a small molecule inhibitor of MET and AXL. METex14del models were identified via mining patient-derived xenograft (PDX) databases or were engineered using genome editing techniques to generate isogenic pairs of METex14del and WT cell lines.The METex14del cell lines formed increased size and number of colonies in anchorage independent growth assays compared to their WT counterparts. The transformation of METex14del cells was associated with an increase in durable HGF-dependent activation of MET and downstream signaling pathways potentially due to dysregulated MET processing and signaling attenuation. MGCD265 was shown to effectively inhibit this growth and MET-dependent signal transduction in a concentration-dependent manner. When evaluated in the amplified METex14del-driven gastric xenograft model Hs746T, significant tumor regression was observed following MGCD265 treatment. In addition, MGCD265 demonstrated substantial regression of large established tumors, in two novel NSCLC METex14del-positive PDX models.Together, these data confirm METex14del mutations are bona fide oncogenic drivers and sensitive to targeted therapeutics. Moreover, the models described in this study represent a relevant pre-clinical platform to further study receptor hyper-activation and drug action that is clinically actionable. Identification, development, and understanding of METex14del models will likely help further guide precision medicine strategies to treat NSCLC patients harboring these mutations.']",

These results were confirmed in cells treated with the combination of ceritinib and su11274 (c-MET inhibitor) or with ceritinib and erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor).

The two stage patients received MET inhibitor treatment.One trial (NCT02896231) patient was treated with bozitinib and achieved confirmed PR, but with 3 months PFS and 5 months OS. The best response was PR and PFS was 5.6 months for the other one receiving the study drug capmatinib (NCT02276027). In the PDX mouse model experiment, we found three single-anget inhibitors monotherapy to be active but only transiently effective in controlling the growth of PDX. The PDX models showed more sensitivity to taselisib among the three single-anget groups. In contrast, the combination of the two inhibitors caused a stronger and long-lasting growth inhibition in PDX models. The addition of taselisib to bozitinib or crizotinib monotherapy provided obvious enhanced activity. Regretfully, two mice died because of the toxicities in the crizotinib+taselisib group. Conclusions', ' Patients with dual MET/PIK3CA amplification represent a rare molecular subtype of NSCLC and have a relatively short duration of response to MET inhibitors.The combination of MET/PI3K inhibitors is synergistic preclinically.']",

        "Background":"[\"Lung cancer is projected to be the number one cause of cancer mortality in the United States in 2014. Therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancer cases. EGFR is a protein that is often targeted by these TKIs and several EGFR-TKIs have been approved for clinical use. However, NSCLC tumors almost inevitably acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs, limiting drug efficacy. Previous studies have suggested that co-localization of c-MET and EGFR may be one possible modality of acquired resistance. Additionally, upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt or mTOR have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis and have been described as potential mechanisms of resistance. Thus, this study examined these signaling pathways and the status of EGFR/c-Met co-expression in 42 patients with stage I-IV NSCLC. Tumor tissue from biopsy or resection was obtained with patient consent and IRB approval and was subsequently processed, sectioned, and mounted on microscope slides. Total and active forms of EGFR, c-Met, mTOR, S6K, -Catenin, and Axin2 were detected using a singleplex or multiplexed immunohistochemistry staining procedure, and stains were graded by an independent pathologist using a validated scoring system. 65.9% of patients exhibited co-expression of EGFR and c-Met (n = 27) while 51.2% showed co-activation of the two markers (n = 21). Additionally, we observed EGFR/c-Met co-expression to have a statistically significant positive correlation with mTOR expression with a Spearman's rho of 0.411 (p = 0.033), suggesting EGFR/c-Met co-expression may play a role in tumorigenesis possibly via regulation of the mTOR pathway. This notion is further supported by our finding that expression of pS6K, a downstream mTOR pathway protein, showed a strong positive correlation with EGFR expression with a Spearman's rho of 0.504 (p = 0.001). In contrast, Wnt pathway protein active -Catenin exhibits a negative correlation with EGFR expression while Axin2, a negative regulator of active -Catenin, showed a positive correlation. Our findings indicate an inverse relationship between the two signaling pathways in NSCLC with increasing mTOR activation correlating with Wnt downregulation. Furthermore, EGFR expression may be associated with this relationship. Thus, we conclude that EGFR/c-Met co-expression as well as activation of the mTOR pathway may be involved in enhanced pathogenesis of NSCLC and possibly acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy.\"]",

        "Background":"['In clinical practice, acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) causes EGFR TKI treatment failure. Several resistance mechanisms have been identified; EGFR T790M mutation and aberrant activation of c-Met through c-Met gene amplification and/or HGF upregulation are the two most common mechanisms. We have previously shown that combining the highly selective c-Met inhibitor tepotinib with 1st or 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs overcomes gefitinib resistance caused only by c-MET amplification. Third-generation EGFR TKIs such as rociletinib have been developed specifically to overcome T790M-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs. We hypothesized that combining a 3rd-generation EGFR TKI with tepotinib could overcome resistance to a 1st or 2nd-generation EGFR TKI (e.g. gefitinib) regardless of the mechanism of resistance.We assessed the efficacy of tepotinib and a Merck-synthesized version of rociletinib (MSR) as monotherapy or in combination in a NSCLC cell line xenograft model (HCC827-GR-T790M) with an EGFR del 19 mutation, c-Met amplification, and exogenous T790M expression, and in a patient-derived xenograft model (DFCI081) with an EGFR del 19 mutation and c-Met amplification, but not a T790M mutation.Single-agent tepotinib, erlotinib, and afatinib did not show antitumor activity in HCC827-GR-T790M xenografts and tumors progressed on treatment (median tumor volume [TV] changes >73%). The combinations of tepotinib + erlotinib and tepotinib + afatinib delayed tumor regrowth more than single-agent therapy, but were no more effective than single-agent MSR. In contrast, the combination of tepotinib + MSR had strong antitumor activity in this model with double resistance due to c-Met amplification and exogenous T790M expression, resulting in complete tumor regression (median TV change -97%).In the patient-derived xenograft model DFCI081, tumors progressed under single-agent therapy with the EGFR TKIs erlotinib, afatinib, and MSR, as expected given that this cell line expresses c-Met. In contrast, tepotinib induced complete tumor regression as monotherapy and when combined with each of the EGFR TKIs (median TV change -100%). Complete regression was maintained until the end of the 60-day observation period after treatment termination.These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that combining tepotinib with a 3rd-generation EGFR TKI to overcome double resistance to 1st and 2nd-generation TKIs mediated by T790M and c-Met in NSCLC is more effective than using either agent alone. Furthermore, whereas EGFR TKIs were not effective in tumor models showing c-Met amplification and EGFR del 19 mutation but not T790M mutation, ie resistance is c-Met mediated, tepotinib monotherapy induced complete tumor regression.']",

        "Background":"['Combination therapy of c-Met/EGFR TKIs against c-Met/EGFR, while initially effective, has been shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance. To establish a mechanism of TKI resistance, the NSCLC model cell lines H2170 and H358 were made resistant to the c-Met/EGFR TKIs SU11274, erlotinib, or a combination by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of inhibitors. Phospho-Met (Tyr1003) was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in H2170 and H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be upregulated in H2170 cells and downregulated in H358 cells. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in c-Met/EGFR downstream signaling proteins, indicating that alternative signaling pathways such as the canonical Wnt pathway may confer TKI resistance. To determine differences in Wnt signaling between parental and resistant cell lines, immunoblotting was performed. In the H2170 erlotinib resistant (H2170-ER) cell line, a 5- and 6-fold increase in phospho-LRP5/6 as well as a 2- and 3-fold increase in total-LRP5/6 was observed in the presence or absence of erlotinib, respectively. Furthermore, H2170-ER cells exhibited a 3- and 16-fold increase in NKD2 as well as a 2.5- and 6-fold increase in Wnt3A in the presence or absence of EGF, respectively. A 2- to 2.5-fold increase was also observed in DVL2/3 in the absence of EGF. However, the Wnt pathway did not seem to have a significant role in H358 cells. Since EGFR and Wnt signaling are known to exhibit crosstalk, activation of the Wnt pathway may stimulate activation of EGFR causing resistance. This is suggested as upregulation of proteins involved in the Wnt pathway was seen only in the H2170 cell line. These results were confirmed by treating H2170 cells with the Wnt inhibitor XAV939. MTT analysis indicated that parental cells showed no significant response to XAV939, however, resistant cell lines showed a 2-fold decrease in viability when compared to a c-Met/EGFR TKI combination treatment. We propose a new treatment modality with Wnt inhibitors which have not yet entered clinical testing.To identify new targets for NSCLC, stable isotope labeling by heavy/light amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled with mass spectroscopy was used. Analysis revealed more than 200 proteins modulated greater than 1.5-fold, six of which have significant potential to influence cell growth and survival based on their biological roles in NSCLC. These proteins include total--catenin, TPR, syntenin, HMGB2, TOM34 and AIF. We are currently using tandem mass tagging (TMT) to further investigate additional modulated proteins. Proteins of interest identified by this method include TPD52, erbB2, MESDC2, PIN1, PEA15 and NRAS. Proteins confirmed to be upregulated/activated in resistant cell lines will be further investigated as targets which induce drug resistance in NSCLC.Citation Format', ' Ryan Jacobs, Jason Fong, David Moravec, Greg Botting, Ryan Bomgarden, John Rogers, Rosa Viner, Michael Blank, Neelu Puri.

We developed an EGFR mutation gene expression signature to identify genes associated with the EGFR-dependent phenotype. Methods', ' Gene expression and EGFR status were measured in 95 adenocarcinomas (training set), two sets of lung adenocarcinomas (N=102 and 82) and 53 NSCLC cell lines (testing sets). A proteomic profiling, generated by reverse phase protein array technology in 74 NSCLC cell lines, using 170 antibodies, was analyzed. MACC1 and MET immunostaining, of a tissue-microarray including 287 NSCLC, was studied. MACC1 knockdown experiments were conducted. Results', ' We identified a set of 45 genes significantly associated with EGFR status in the training set. The gene-set was used to compute a signature which was shown to be predictive of EGFR status in 3 testing sets. Pathway analysis of the genes showed that EGFR-mutations was marked by increased endocytosis and decreased mitosis genes. The signature was correlated with drug sensitivity to EGFR TKI in vitro, and significantly associated with survival in early stage adenocarcinomas, even in the subgroup with EGFR wild-type tumors. Our current study identified MACC1 as the most significantly up-regulated gene in EGFR mutant. MACC1 and MET expression levels, in vitro and in vivo, were highly correlated both at the mRNA and protein levels. A correlation heatmap of the proteomic profiling showed a strong correlation of MACC1 with MET, downstream signal transducers (STATs), markers of the epithelial phenotype (a classical feature of EGFR mutant tumors), and RAB25 (a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases that are involved in endocytosis). Finally, we showed that MACC1 knockdown in vitro reduced MET levels. Conclusions', ' A gene expression signature associated with EGFR-dependent phenotype was developed. The signature was shown to be prognostic regardless of EGFR status. The results also suggest MACC1 to be a regulator of MET in NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Therapeutics used to treat patients with NSCLC include cytotoxic agents such as taxanes, and targeted agents such as EGFR inhibitors. Although these treatments provide some clinical benefit, there is a need for improved therapies in advanced NSCLC. MGCD265 targets Met, VEGFR1/2/3, Tie-2 and Ron. Met is overexpressed and phosphorylated in NSCLC, and Met activation is identified as a molecular mechanism through which tumors evade specific inhibition of EGFR. In support of the clinical development of MGCD265, the studies described here provide a rationale for combining MGCD265 with a taxane or an EGFR inhibitor. Methods', ' The in vivo anti-tumor activity of MGCD265 (10 or 20mg/kg orally, daily) in combination with either docetaxel (5 or 10mg/kg, iv weekly), paclitaxel (30mg/kg iv, on days 0, 1, 13, 14),or an EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib (25 or 50 mg/kg orally, daily), was analyzed in multiple xenograft models including NSCLC models. The anti-angiogenic activity of MGCD265 with docetaxel was evaluated by immunohistochemistry following CD31 labeling of tumor sections from treated animals. Results', ' We demonstrate that the combination of MGCD265 with docetaxel or paclitaxel achieves greater anti-tumor responses than treating with either agent alone and this occurs in the absence of overt toxicity. The combination of MGCD265 with docetaxel also results in greater reduction of tumor vasculature. Good anti-tumor activity in the absence of overt toxicity is also demonstrated when MGCD265 is combined with erlotinib in NSCLC xenografts including a model that expresses an EGFR mutant resistant to erlotinib (T790M). PK analyses demonstrate that the combination of MGCD265 with either docetaxel, paclitaxel or erlotinib does not result in drug-drug interactions. Conclusions', ' The combination of MGCD265 with either a taxane or erlotinib results in improved antitumor activities when compared to treatments with either agent alone. In addition, these combinations are well tolerated and do not show drug-drug interactions.

        "Background":"['MET is involved in many mechanisms of cancer proliferation and metastasis. Inappropriate activation of MET can be induced by HGF-independent mechanisms such as gene amplification, specific genetic mutations, and transcriptional up-regulation, or by HGF-dependent autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. LY2875358 is a novel humanized bivalent MET antibody currently in phase I clinical testing (trial NCT01287546). LY2875358 has high neutralization and internalization activities against MET for inhibiting HGF-dependent and HGF-independent MET pathway activation and tumor growth. In HGF-dependent MET activation, LY2875358 blocks HGF binding to MET, HGF-induced MET phosphorylation and tumor growth both in cell culture and in mouse xenograft models, resembling activities of a humanized one-armed 5D5 MET antibody (monovalent antibody similar to Onartuzumab). In tumors with HGF-independent MET activation through MET gene amplification, LY2875358 induces internalization and degradation of MET, which results in decreased pMET and total MET, inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor growth in MKN45 and SNU5 gastric tumor lines and EBC-1 and H1993 NSCLC tumor lines. Moreover, LY2875358 enhances antitumor activity in combination with cisplatin or 5-FU in vitro and in vivo in MET amplified tumor cells. However, under the same ligand-independent conditions, the one-armed 5D5 antibody did not have anti-tumor activities. When HGF is added to tumor cells with high MET gene amplification, LY2875358 decreases cell proliferation, while the one-armed 5D5 antibody does not. In contrast to other bivalent MET antibodies, LY2875358 has no or otherwise negligible agonist activity and does not stimulate biological activities such as cell proliferation, scattering, invasion, tubulogenesis, apoptosis protection or angiogenesis in various HGF responsive cells. These findings indicate that LY2875358 has a different mechanism of action from the humanized one-armed 5D5 MET antibody. LY2875358 may be a promising therapy for treatment of patients whose tumors are driven by HGF-dependent and HGF-independent MET activation.']",

        "Background":"['S49076 is an oral ATP-competitive inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases MET, AXL, and FGFR1-3 currently in phase I/II clinical development in patients with advanced solid tumors. Here, we investigated the effect of S49076 on both MET- and non-MET- dependent cell lines alone and in association with ionizing radiation (IR) both in vitro and in vivo. We performed proliferation and clonogenic survival assays using the low MET-expressing H460 and A549 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, the high MET-expressing H441 NSCLC cell line and the MET-dependent GTL16 gastric cancer cell line. Activity against the MET receptor and Aurora B kinase was assessed by analyzing the phosphorylation status of MET Tyr1234/1235 and Histone H3 Ser10 residues. Pharmacologic and RNA interference approaches against Aurora B and MET were used to determine the molecular mechanism of the cell response to S49076.S49076 inhibited MET activity in the nanomolar range (1 - 100 nM). At higher, but still clinically-relevant concentrations (0.5 - 1 M), S49076 was also found to inhibit Aurora B kinase activity in all cell lines tested. In non MET-dependent cell lines, the antiproliferative and anti-clonogenic effects of the drug correlated with its activity against Aurora B, whereas in the MET-dependent cell line, these effects could be attributed to direct inhibition of the MET receptor. When treatment with S49076 was combined with IR, an enhancement of IR effects was observed in all cell lines tested in vitro. In vivo, a significant growth delay of subcutaneous tumors was observed at 50 mg/kg bid oral S49076 in non-MET dependent models and at 3 mg/kg bid oral S49076 in the GTL16 MET-dependent model. For non MET-dependent models, immunohistochemistry revealed that treatment with S49076 reduced Histone H3 phosphorylation on Ser10. This is consistent with the finding that S49076 concentrations above 1 M were attained in the tumors, as determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. In all tumors tested, S49076 treatment significantly delayed tumor growth when combined to a fractionated IR (4 fractions of 2.5 Gy) compared to IR alone. An orthotopic model of lung cancer using luciferase-expressing H460 NSCLC cells was also used to evaluate the combination of S49076 (50mg/kg bid) and locally fractionated thoracic IR (4*2.5 Gy). In this model, the median survival after cell implantation was 22 days for control mice, 29.5 and 29 days for S49076 treated and irradiated mice respectively and 41 days for mice receiving the combined treatment (p<0.002 for combined treatment versus the irradiated arm or the S49076 treated arm).Our findings indicate that S49076 improves the efficacy of radiotherapy in both MET- and non-MET- dependent cell, supporting the use of combined treatment with S49076 and radiation in clinical trials without patient selection.']",

Data suggest that lung adenocarcinomas harboring c-METex14 are sensitive to c-Met kinase inhibitors. The highly selective c-Met inhibitor tepotinib is well tolerated and active at an oral dose of 500 mg QD. This single-arm phase II trial (NCT02864992) is investigating the efficacy and safety of tepotinib in patients (pts) with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring METex14. Methods', ' Adults with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma who have failed 1 or 2 lines of systemic therapy, including a platinum doublet-containing regimen, are eligible.

Pts receive tepotinib 500 mg QD until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal from treatment for other reasons. The primary endpoint is objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include progression-free and overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetics, and quality of life. Recruitment of 60 patients in Europe, USA, and Japan is planned. Results', ' Four pts (age 6477 years; 3 stage IV, 1 stage IIIB, all Caucasian males) have been enrolled. All had received two prior chemotherapy regimens including a platinum doublet.

        "Background":"['c-Met amplification and acquisition of a second T790M mutation are key mechanisms accounting for majority of resistant cases to first generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs; i.e., erlotinib). The third generation EGFR-TKIs (e.g., AZD9291), which selectively and irreversibly inhibit EGFR activating and T790M mutants while sparing wild-type EGFR, represent very promising therapeutic options for NSCLC patients who have become resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs due to T790M mutation. However, eventual resistance to the 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs has already been described in the clinic, resulting in disease progression. Therefore, there is a great challenge and urgent need to understand how this resistance occurs and to develop effective strategies to delay or overcome the resistance. We show that c-Met amplification and hyperactivation is an universal mechanism to both 1st and 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs since both erlotinib- and AZD9291-resistant HCC827 cell lines possessed elevated levels of c-Met (due to gene amplification) and p-c-Met and were cross-resistant to AZD9291 or erlotinib. Both chemical and genetic inhibition of c-Met overcame the resistance of these cell lines to AZD9291 including enhancement of apoptosis or G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistently the combination of AZD9291 and c-Met inhibition effectively inhibited the growth of both erlotinib- and AZD9291-resistant HCC827 xenografts in nude mice. Hence, we suggest that inhibition of c-Met is also an effective strategy to overcome resistance of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs with c-Met amplification or hyperactivation to AZD9291, providing the rationale for clinical development of this novel combination strategy.

It was not sensitive to volitinib treatment in cell survival assay due to dual activation of EGFR and c-Met pathways. The results from signal pathway study demonstrated that in HCC827C4R cells, volitinib or gefitinib alone only inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Met or EGFR, respectively, but had no effect on the activation of downstream molecules such as Akt and ERK which drive tumor cell proliferation and other cell functions. In contrast, combination of volitinib and gefitinib significantly inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, c-Met, Akt and ERK in HCC827C4R, and consequently led to a synergistic effect on inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro. These results were further confirmed in HCC827C4R xenograft model in vivo at clinically relevant doses. Combination of volitinib and gefitinib induced significant tumor regression and displayed synergistic effect compared to treatment by either gefitinib or volitinib alone. Consistent with in vitro results, combination group strongly inhibited the downstream Akt and ERK phosphorylation. In addition, combination treatment was well tolerant and no significant drug-drug exposure interaction was observed. These data indicated that both c-Met and EGFR could contribute to activating downstream signaling pathway and control HCC827C4R cell growth. Blocking either pathway may not be strong enough to stop tumor growth.In conclusion, a cell line with activating EGFR mutation and c-Met gene amplification was generated with resistance to gefitinib and insensitivity to volitinib. The combination treatment with volitinib and an EGFR inhibitor gefitinib was highly effective in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that such combination could provide a safe and effective treatment in clinics for this particular patient population.']",

        "Background":"['c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has hepatocyte growth factor as its ligand. Evidence from biochemical and human genetic studies indicate that c-Met is one of the most frequently activated tyrosine kinases in human cancer. Dysregulated c-Met signaling can result in the development of tumors highly dependent on c-Met. Furthermore, enhanced c-Met signaling is likely involved in conferring resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. The orally available EMD 1214063 and EMD 1204831 inhibit c-Met activity in a potent and highly selective fashion, and are currently being evaluated in cancer patients. Here we report the activity of these compounds in combination with inhibitors of EGFR and VEGF in various tumor xenograft models. EMD 1214063 was tested alone and in combination with EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib and cetuximab) in xenografts of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells, namely the lung cancer H1975 and the NCI-H441 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The H1975 cell line expresses moderate amounts of c-Met, and EMD 1214063 was inactive as a single agent (treatment group/control group [T/C] 78%; tumor growth delay [TGD] 2 days). Cetuximab was active with a T/C of 13% inducing a TGD of 21 days. The combination of EMD 1214063 and cetuximab was active with a T/C of 1% and a TGD of 42 days. The NCI-H441 cell line is characterized by constitutive c-Met overexpression and is sensitive to c-Met inhibitors in vivo. EMD 1214063 (100 mg/kg) was active inducing a T/C of 20%, while erlotinib alone (30 mg/kg) was not efficacious. However, the combination of EMD 1214063 with erlotinib enhanced tumor growth inhibition, induced partial tumor regression in 2/9 mice, and delayed tumor re-growth. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that cMet pathway activation confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We additionally investigated the combination of either EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 with VEGF inhibitors in NSCLC models. In NCI-H441 xenografts, EMD 1204831 produced a modest T/C (66%) at the suboptimal dose of 25 mg/kg/bid, similarly to aflibercept at 40 mg/kg (T/C 55%). In contrast, the combination of both compounds yielded a T/C of 1% with partial responses in 2/10 mice. In the EBC-1 model, treatment with EMD 1214063 (10 mg/kg) or with the antiVEGF antibody B20-4.1 (20 mg/kg) as single agents resulted in a T/C of 21% (with partial regression in 1/10 mice) and 19%, respectively. In contrast, the combination of EMD 1214063 and B20-4.1 exhibited enhanced anti-tumor activity with a T/C of 72% and partial regressions in 10/10 mice. These data support the hypothesis that EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 may be effective in NSCLC patients in combination with VEGF-targeting agents. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of EMD 1214063 or EMD 1204831 with EGFR and VEGF inhibitors in NSCLC patients.']",

Somatic activating mutations of EGFR gene and some clinical and pathological features have been associated with tumor response and favourable clinical outcome with these agents. However, tumor that initially respond to EGFR-TKIs almost inevitably become resistant later. We present a comprehensive analysis of MET, EGFR, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations in advanced NSCLC patients treated with TKIs, with the aim of clarifying the relative contribution of these molecular alterations to resistance. Methods', ' Genomic DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, amplified for MET (exons 14, 15), EGFR (exons 18, 19, 20 and 21), PIK3CA (exons 9, 20) KRAS (exons 2, 3) by nested PCR and sequenced in both sense and antisense directions.

At univariate analysis of OS TKIs no-sensitive mutations were associated with worse prognosis (16.1 months vs 30.2 months, p = 0.02). Cox's multivariate analysis including histology and stage showed that TKIs no-sensitive mutations were independent factors to predict poor OS (p = 0.02). Conclusions\", ' When TKIs no-sensitive MET, KRAS, PIK3CA and EGFR mutations are concomitant, up to 96% of NSCLC patients unlikely to respond to anti-EGFR therapies, can be identified.

        "Background":"['Alterations in the MET oncogene occurs across a broad range of tumor indications. Amplification or mutations in MET lead to increased activity of downstream pathways including PI3K and MAPK, eventually resulting in tumor formation. Several small molecule inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, including the selective inhibitor Savolitinib (HMP-504, Volitinib, AZD6094), which shows single digit nanomolar activity in MET-amplified cell lines. Newly emerging data suggest mutations in MET causing complete skipping of Exon 14 occur in approximately 4% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and are more rare in other indications [1, 2]. MET exon 14 skipping mutations were shown to be mutually exclusive from EGFRm, ALK and KRAS and can occur in the context of MET gene amplification [3]. Exon 14 harbors the CBL binding site (Y1003), which is critical for receptor degradation after binding of its ligand, HGF, and suppression of downstream signaling events. Clinical trial results with less potent, pan RTK inhibitors Crizotinib (31nM GI50 vs 3nM for Savolitinib) and Cabozantinib show promising early results, but fall short in long term responses. Therefore, better therapies targeting MET are needed. Human cell line models with Exon 14 deletions are rare. Therefore, we used engineered cell lines to test the effect of Savolitinib on these mutations. To do this, we expressed MET-Y1003F mutants in NIH-3T3 and HEK293T cells. We found that Savolitinib potently inhibited phospho-MET in both models expressing this mutant (100% phospho-MET inhibition). In addition, we tested whether or not Savolitinib could inhibit HGF-dependent signaling and growth of a NSCLC cell line, NCI-H596. In the presence of FBS (10%), Savolitinib had no effect on the growth rate of these cells, however was highly efficient at blocking HGF-dependent growth in the absence of FBS. To test the effect of this mutation in the background of amplification, we also tested the gastric cancer cell line Hs746T, which harbors exon 14 skipping in addition to MET amplification. Savolitinib was highly efficacious at blocking the growth of this cell line. Future studies are aimed at looking at the in vivo effect of Savolitinib targeting exon 14 mutants. These data provide a platform of evidence for using Savolitinib to target exon 14 mutant MET in patients.1.Paik, P.K., et al., Response to MET inhibitors in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring MET mutations causing exon 14 skipping.

        "Background":"['NSCLC is a common cancer with the highest mortality and few effective treatment options, except for the patients with EGFR (Erlotinib, Iressa) and ALK (Crizotinib) activating mutations. Recent studies indicated that some patients with the activating EGFR mutations but without pre-exposure to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are resistant to TKIs. The proposed mechanisms (1) include', ' T790M gatekeeper mutation preventing accessing the kinase activation site, Kras mutation, pTEN loss (2), or c-met amplification (3) that activates ERBB3 signaling (4). Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models have been suggested to more closely represent patient tumors (5, 6). We established several PDXs, including HuPrime LU858, LU859, LU357, LU387, LU1901 and LU2503, using tumor tissues from individual NSCLC patients. LU858/859 contain the classic activating EGFR mutation, L858R; LU1868 contain L858R/T790M double mutations; LU357/LUF387 contain the common exon 20 insertion (2319-2320 AACCCCCAC); and LU1901/2503 have wild type EGFR. To our surprise, the two models with single L858R mutation, just like the model with double mutations, respond to the erlotinib poorly, as seen in some of clinic cases (1). Since they do not have T790M and Kras mutation, we examined them for c-met status, finding that their c-met gene are significantly amplified with also increased c-met/HGF expression as measured by at mRNA and protein levels (IHC), consistent with those seen in clinic (3). Furthermore, LU357 is sensitive to erlotinib while LU387 is not, corresponding to no c-met amplification in LU357 but significant amplification in LU387. All these suggest that the observed erlotinib resistance in these models could potentially be attributed to c-met signaling activation via c-met/HGF autocrine. To this end, we treated LU858, LU859 and LU2503 (also with c-met amplification) with c-met inhibitor, Crizotinib. Indeed, Crizotinib caused significant tumor response as expected in all these models. In particular, the combination treatment of LU858 and LU859 with erlotinib caused complete tumor regression by overcoming the resistance, suggesting a new potential effective treatment option. The results using PDX models can potentially help to design a prospective human study to demonstrate improved efficacy by the combination treatment via patient stratification to include the nave NSCLC patient subjects with c-met amplification/EGFR mutation. 1.

        "Background":"['c-Met and EGFR are therapeutic targets in NSCLC with a direct role in tumor progression. Highly specific TKIs against c-Met, have limited efficacy individually, and resistance to c-Met TKIs could be due to activation/mutations in EGFR, or c-Met amplification/mutations which could lead to increased expression and constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met. In recent clinical trials, simultaneous treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against c-Met/EGFR has improved patient prognosis, however, their efficacy has been limited due to the development of resistance to TKIs. To establish the mechanism of TKI resistance in NSCLC, two cell lines (H2170 and H358) were made resistant to c-Met and EGFR TKIs (15-30 fold increase in IC50 of SU11274 and 8-10 fold increase in IC50 of Erlotinib) by exposing the cells to progressively increasing concentrations of both drugs simultaneously. In H2170 cell lines, a 4-fold downregulation p-cMet 1003 (c-cbl binding site) and a 5-fold increase in p-c-Met 1234/1235 (autophosphorylation site) was observed. Additionally, several proteins in signaling pathways (mTOR and Wnt) linked to EGFR and c-Met, were also found to be differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines', ' active -catenin (1.5-2.5 fold increase), p-mTOR (2-4 fold increase), and phospho-pS6kinase (2-20 fold increase). Interestingly, few differences were observed in p-ERK or p-AKT, which are EGFR/c-Met downstream signaling proteins, indicating that other pathways such as mTOR and Wnt may cause TKI resistance. To confirm the role of mTOR and Wnt pathways in resistance and to break their resistance, parental and resistant cell lines were treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the Wnt inhibitor XAV 939 in addition to c-Met and EGFR TKIs. An MTT viability assay showed resistant cell lines to be 2-4 fold more susceptible in comparison to parental cells with the addition of everolimus to TKI combination treatment. In response to the Wnt inhibitor XAV 939, parental cell lines showed no significant increase in sensitivity while resistant lines showed a 2.5-3 fold decrease in viability when compared to c-Met and EGFR TKI combination treatment. Our results suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to c-Met TKI which are mediated by increased c-Met stability, resulting in increases in Wnt expression/mTOR activation. The decreased phosphorylation of c-Met 1003 may lead to decreased binding/activity of Cbl and/or deficient ubiquitination of c-Met. This may result in increased stabilization of c-Met as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of c-Met 1234/1235 and the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt pathways which has been shown. These studies suggest a new treatment modality since inhibitors of Wnt pathway or agents targeting -catenin have not entered clinical testing. These results suggest that Wnt/ mTOR inhibitors combined with c-Met/EGFR TKIs may be a novel combination therapy for lung cancer.']",

Primary resistance to erlotinib could result from the absence of an EGFR-organized network. Crosstalk and transactivation between other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR, IGF-1R and MET, is recognized as a mechanism of growth in several tumors. Mutant EGFR could activate the IL-6/gp130 pathway. Overexpression of AXL has been observed in NSCLC and in GIST imatinib-resistant tumors. Methods', ' The expression of MET, IGF-1R, IL-6/gp130 and AXL was examined by QPCR in the original pretreatment tumor biopsies of 98 NSCLC p with EGFR mutations. Expression levels by terciles were correlated with outcome to erlotinib. Results', ' There was a good correlation between the expression of IL-6/gp130 and AXL (r = 0.33; p = 0.001). No differences were observed in expression of the four genes according to gender, smoking history, type of EGFR mutation, or other clinical characteristics. The highest tercile of AXL expression was associated with a higher incidence of lung metastases (87.5%; p = 0.02). No other association between any of the genes and metastatic sites (including brain and bone) was observed. Overall RR was 70%, progression-free survival (PFS) was 14 months (m), and median survival (MS) was 27 m. No differences in RR, PFS or MS were observed according to the expression of any of the four genes. Conclusions', ' The coactivation of other receptor tyrosine kinases seems not to affect the initial outcome to erlotinib in NSCLC p with EGFR mutations. The association of high levels of AXL with lung metastases should be further examined, since AXL expression has been correlated with metastasis to the lung in a breast cancer model. The addition of AXL inhibition could be a novel treatment approach for enhancing the effect of erlotinib in p with EGFR mutations.']",

        "Background":"['The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling pathway is often dysregulated in lung cancer. We previously showed that HGF activation of c-Met in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells led to a significant induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) followed by secretion of PGE2. PGE2 caused secretion of TGF by NSCLC cells, followed by both phosphorylation of EGFR and later, delayed phosphorylation of c-Met that does not require HGF. Secretion of PGE2 also appears to boost c-Met pathway signaling downstream via cross-activation by EGFR, in a reinforcing loop that is independent of HGF. We hypothesized that targeting of both c-Met and COX-2 might lead to enhanced anti-tumor effects by blocking both upstream and downstream pro-tumor events. Maximum effects on cell proliferation, invasion and EMT markers were observed in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with combination celecoxib and crizotinib treatment. We next tested whether targeting c-Met with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib combined with celecoxib to target COX-2 would result in enhanced anti-tumor effects in an animal model with heightened HGF/c-Met pathway signaling in the airways. Mice transgenic for airway expression of human HGF were treated with the tobacco carcinogen, 4-(methylnitroso-amino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, from weeks 1-4. Crizotinib (40mg/kg), celecoxib (50mg/kg), combined crizotinib and celecoxib or placebo control was administered by oral gavage daily from week 3 until week 15, at which time lung tumors were evaluated. A highly significant decrease in the number of lung tumors per animal was observed with crizotinib treatment (mean 3.6, range 2-6), celecoxib treatment (mean 4.3, range 3-6) and combination treatment (mean 1.5, range 0-3) compared to placebo control (mean 9.9, range 6-13; P<0.001, Poisson regression). The number of tumors in the combination treatment group was also significantly lower than either single agent treatment (P<0.001). There was also a significant decrease in mean tumor size with crizotinib (mean 0.20mm2), celecoxib (mean 0.22mm2) and combination (mean 0.15mm2) compared to placebo (mean 0.38mm2, P<0.001, mixed effects modeling). Three biomarkers (COX-2, PGE2, and P-MAPK) were optimally down-modulated by combination treatment, compared to single treatment. Additionally, E-cadherin expression was up-regulated while the E-cadherin repressor, snail, was down-regulated with dual treatment. In a pulmonary environment with heightened HGF/c-Met pathway activity, dual inhibition of the c-Met and COX-2 pathways may enhance anti-tumor effects by targeting reinforcing up- and downstream signaling. Such a combination has potential clinical benefit for lung cancer patients with dysregulated c-Met/COX-2 pathways. Supported by R01 CA79882 and P50 CA090440.']",

Preclinical research and clinical data derived from patients with tumors containing MET gene amplification and exon 14 mutations showed significant growth inhibition and meaningful clinical benefit after treatment with MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), supporting the hypothesis that MET gene amplification and exon 14 mutations are actionable biomarkers. We have identified several anti-MET monoclonal antibodies that block MET-dependent signaling and tumor growth through', ' (1) binding to the Sema/PSI domain, (2) preventing HGF interaction with MET and (3) inducing receptor ubiqutination and degradation. One of the anti-MET antibodies, KTN0073, induces potent degradation of oncogenic exon 14 mutant MET, which has been reported to propagate prolonged MET signaling due to a defect in receptor degradation. Our data suggest that KTN0073 engages a pathway different from HGF-induced receptor degradation and protease-mediated shedding, which is independent of the 47 amino acids that are encoded by exon 14 in the intracellular juxtamembrane region and only partially inhibited by the TKI crizotinib. In summary, we report the use of an anti-MET monoclonal antibody to elucidate an exon 14-independent mechanism of MET degradation that could provide a novel way to design anti-MET therapeutics to inhibit growth of human tumors that are driven by HGF, MET amplification and exon 14 mutations.

        "Background":"['Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) systems, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor MET and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor EGFR, are known to be expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and play an important role in the progression of NSCLC. Recent research shows that co-inhibition of MET and EGFR signaling results in more robust antitumor activity, relative to either alone, although the mechanisms of this synergism are not clear. P53, a tumor suppressor gene, is a potent regulator of apoptosis which is induced by DNA damage. The dysregulation of p53 protein is related to both oncogenesis and drug resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of synergistic antitumor effects of an EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) and two different MET inhibitors (SU11274 and tivantinib [ARQ 197]) and to potentially define the role of P53 function as a predictive biomarker for the observed synergy. P53 wild-type (A549 and H460) cells and P53 null-type (H358 and H1299) cells without met gene amplification or EGFR mutation were used. Combined gefitinib and SU11274 or tivantinib induced profound growth inhibitory effects and apoptosis in cell lines harboring wild-type P53, but not in cells harboring null P53. SU11274 or tivantinib appeared to abrogate the P53/Mdm2 interaction, concomitantly reducing P53-ubiquitination followed by protein stabilization. Treatment with gefitinib resulted in the translocation of P53 from cytosol to nucleus. In P53 wild-type cells, the combination treatment of SU11274 or ARQ197 with gefitinib induced more robust apoptosis than single agent treatment, presumably through up-regulation of p53 target genes (FAS, Bax and PUMA). Furthermore, inhibition of P53 expression in A549 cells using siRNA significantly reduced apoptosis and downregulated mRNA and protein expression of FAS, PUMA and Bax upon combined treatment with gefitinib and SU11274. Overexpression of wild-type P53 in H1299 cells enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis by combined gefitinib and SU11274 treatment through up-regulation of FAS, PUMA and Bax and restoration of caspase activation. In an A549 xenograft model, the combination of gefitinib and SU11274 (or tivantinib) effectively shrunk tumor volume and also induced apoptosis more effectively than either treatment alone. In conclusion, P53 plays an essential role in determining synergistic efficacy of combination therapy with pharmacological EGFR and MET inhibition in NSCLC with wild type EGFR. The validation of the predictive value of P53 mutation is warranted in appropriate ongoing clinical trials of combination therapy in advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR.']",

Third generation irreversible TKIsAZD9291 and CO-1686were developed for efficacy in the T790M setting. However, resistance to the new class of EGFR TKIs is inevitable, prompting us to investigate the relationship between erlotinib and AZD9291 resistance mechanisms and explore novel ones. NSCLC cell lines harboring activating EGFR mutations with (NCI-H1975) or without T790M (HCC4006, HCC827, and PC-9) were exposed to erlotinib, dacomitnib, or AZD9291 at IC 75 or greater for three months to generate resistance. We observed cross-resistance to other EGFR TKIs in nearly all resistant lines, suggesting that T790M was not the main driver of resistance in the erlotinib-treated lines and that a common mechanism might account for resistance in each cell line set. An epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was observed and a corresponding increase in vimentin staining was seen in resistant lines, consistent with cross-resistance. Previous studies showed that MET amplification caused erlotinib resistance in HCC827; our data suggest MET amplification also accounted for the AZD9291 and dacomitnib resistance in HCC827. In AZD9291-resistant HCC4006 and H1975 lines, PTEN levels were substantially reduced compared to the parental line, with a corresponding increase in PIK3 pathway markers. Whole exome sequencing data support homozygous deletion of PTEN loss as a mechanism of acquired resistance to AZD9291 in NCI-H1975. The PTEN null line NCI-H1650 was found to be resistant to all three TKIs without long-term drug exposure, implicating PTEN loss as a mechanism of de novo resistance.

Activation of MET signaling is a relatively common hallmark of a diverse range of human cancer types, and as a result, inhibition of MET signaling represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of cancer. In this study, we describe the characterization of AMG 337, a potent and highly selective small molecule ATP-competitive MET kinase inhibitor that demonstrates robust activity in MET-dependent cancer models.In enzymatic assays, AMG 337 inhibited MET kinase activity with an IC50 of < 5nM nM. AMG 337 demonstrated exquisite selectivity for MET when profiled against a diverse panel of over 400 protein and lipid kinases in a competitive binding assay. In cellular assays, AMG 337 inhibited HGF-dependent MET phosphorylation with an IC50 of < 10 nM. To identify predictive genomic markers of response, AMG 337 was profiled in cell viability assays using a diverse panel of over 200 cancer cell lines. Treatment with AMG 337 only affected the viability of two gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-5 and Hs746T), both of which harbor amplification of the MET gene. The AMG 337 IC50 in the two sensitive cell lines was < 50 nM, and > 10 M in all other tested cell lines.Further studies in an expanded panel of additional cancer cell lines derived from gastric, NSCLC, and esophageal cancer confirmed that the in-vitro anti-proliferative activity of AMG 337 correlated with amplification of MET. In those cell lines, treatment with AMG 337 inhibited downstream PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, which translated into growth arrest as evidenced by an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a concomitant reduction in DNA synthesis, and the induction of apoptosis.In vivo, oral administration of AMG 337 resulted in robust dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in MET amplified gastric cancer xenograft models, with inhibition of tumor growth consistent with the pharmacodynamic modulation of MET signaling.In conclusion, these findings illustrate the potential clinical utility of AMG 337 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of tumors with evidence of dysregulated MET signaling, including MET amplification.

Upon long term in vivo treatment, emibetuzumab-resistant tumors and cell lines were generated, isolated, and characterized to investigate their acquired resistance mechanisms. Extensive reverse phase protein array and network analysis were used to characterize the proteomic profiles of three resistant cell lines, revealing three distinct resistance profiles, one involving activation of the PI3Kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway. We further show, how these resistance mechanisms can be overcome by treatment with other targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in vivo. Two of the models demonstrated in vivo sensitivity to Sym015, a novel mixture of two mAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes of MET, partly due to ADCC, indicating that Sym015 can overcome acquired resistance to emibetuzumab. The third model demonstrated a marked increase in PI3Kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway activation. This activation translated into induced cancer cell and tumor growth, which could be inhibited by agents targeting PI3Kinase, AKT, or mTOR.

Initial characterization of these cell lines using phospho-specific antibodies showed that phospho-c-Met was found to be downregulated 4- and 1.5- fold in SU11274-resistant (SR) H2170 and SR H358 cells, respectively. Phospho-EGFR was found to be constitutively autophosphorylated (upregulated 19-fold) in erlotinib-resistant (ER) H2170 cells, but downregulated 6-fold in ER H358 cells.

To further investigate the mechanism of TKI resistance, phospho-peptide enrichment was also used in combination with TMT quantitation to profile changes in protein phosphorylation state.

        "Background":"['Rociletinib is a novel, oral, targeted irreversible inhibitor of the cancer-causing mutant forms of EGFR currently being studied for the treatment of NSCLC. Rociletinib was designed to spare wild-type EGFR signaling. Heavily-pretreated T790M+ patients treated with rociletinib at 500 or 625mg BID demonstrated a 67% objective response rate (n = 56, Soria et al., ENA 2014). Despite these promising data, acquired resistance to rociletinib monotherapy is anticipated. To assess the in vivo mechanisms of acquired resistance to rociletinib, mice bearing PC-9 (EGFR del19) human NSCLC tumors were chronically dosed with erlotinib (50 mg/kg QD) or rociletinib (150 mg/kg BID). Rociletinib treated mice had an increased time to tumor progression as compared to erlotinib treated mice. Resistance, as defined by tumors reaching >300mm3, was observed in all (n = 10) erlotinib treated mice between days 42-61. Alternatively, resistance to rociletinib was only observed in 3/10 mice after 126 days of dosing. Emergence of the EGFR T790M resistance mutation was detected in all tumors resistant to erlotinib. Erlotinib resistant tumors (n = 7) were crossed over to rociletinib monotherapy on day 60 of the study at a mean tumor volume of 500mm3. Rociletinib treatment generated durable tumor regressions in both crossover and monotherapy treated mice, however continued dosing of rociletinib ultimately allowed for the collection of four resistant tumors. Rociletinib resistant tumors were analyzed using the SuraSeq 500 NGS panel, and all harbored copy number gains (n = 12-15) in MET and corresponding MET pathway activation as shown by RTK arrays and Western blotting. Combining rociletinib with the MET inhibitor crizotinib caused regression of the MET amplified rociletinib-resistant tumors. In separate experiments, the addition of 50 ng/ml exogenous HGF was sufficient to render several mutant EGFR cell lines immediately resistant to rociletinib, and this effect could be overcome with the combination of rociletinib and crizotinib. Finally, the combination of rociletinib and crizotinib also demonstrated potent activity in a patient derived L858R EGFR xenograft model with MET amplification (14 copies). Taken together, these data show that (1) in a PC-9 front-line model of mutant EGFR lung cancer, rociletinib has a longer time-to-resistance than erlotinib; and (2) MET/HGF pathway activation is a likely driver of acquired resistance to rociletinib in patients with mutant EGFR lung cancer, and can potentially be successfully prevented and/or treated with a combination of rociletinib plus a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor.']",

        "Background":"['MET, which is located in 7q31, is a receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor. Overexpression of MET has been reported in various malignancies and is associated with cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and metastasis. MET amplification has been reported to contribute to acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), being observed among 5-10% of those patients. Therefore, MET gene alterations could be both prognostic and predictive. To evaluate MET gene copy number, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), real-time PCR, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have been used. The results of real-time PCR do not directly reflect cancer cells. CGH is not suitable for the evaluation of a large number of specimens due to cost. Therefore, FISH is the most practical method for evaluation of MET gene copy number. However, the frequency of positive cases varies due to a lack of standardized criteria. We evaluated MET gene copy number in lung adenocarcinoma and its association with clinicopathological characteristics. FISH was applied to evaluate high MET gene copy number and true amplification in 138 lung adenocarcinoma patients using two criteria', ' the Cappuzzo scoring system and PathVysion. MET positive cases according to the Cappuzzo scoring system evidenced both aneuploidy and true amplification, whereas PathVysion revealed only amplification. Proportion of MET FISH positive cases was 15% and 4% determined by the Cappuzzo system and PathVysion, respectively. PathVysion demonstrated higher frequencies of MET FISH positives among men and smokers and evidenced no MET FISH positives in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, which is recognized as pure lepidic growth without invasion of stroma, blood vessels, or pleura. Prognosis was significantly associated with MET FISH positive only as defined by the PathVysion system (gene amplification), not by the Cappuzzo system. However, progression-free survival time of patients with both EGFR mutations and MET FISH positive defined by the Cappuzzo scoring system was significantly shorter than with EGFR mutations alone.

Inhibition of c-MET activation was performed by c-MET inhibitors, PHA665752 and Crizotinib or small interfering RNA against c-MET. We found MET inhibitors (4 or 8M) reduced cell growth and restored drug sensitivity (2M) of resistant cells, PC-6/SN38, compared to parental cells. To reveal the mechanisms of c-MET in drug resistance we examined ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters expression in PC-6/SN-38 compared to the parental cells by qRT-PCR, and found the mRNA level of ABCG2, which effluxes SN-38 as substrate, in PC-6/SN-38 cells was extremely increased and another ABC transporters that do not efflux SN-38 were not. Recently we reported PC-6/SN-38 cells had c-MET overexpression, and c-MET inhibition in resistant cells such PC-6/SN-38 resulted in restoration drug resistance. Based on this report we examined c-MET inhibition by c-MET inhibitor and small interfering RNA against c-MET in PC-6/SN38, and qRT-PCR and WB were performed to investigate alteration of ABCG2 expression, and found both two c-MET inhibition reduced ABCG2 expression. In addition, to demonstrate c-MET upregulation in resistant cells is addicted to the ligand HGF, PC-6 cells were incubated with HGF treated for 3 weeks and made PC-6/HGF, then continued to incubate with HGF and SN-38 was added two times in a week. Although c-MET expression is equal in PC-6 and PC-6/HGF, after SN-38 treatment c-MET was overexpressed. Furthermore, serum HGF level in SCLC patients correlated with clinical course. We demonstrated upregulation of ABC transporters via HGF/c-MET signaling activation might be one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to cytotoxic anticancer agents in lung cancer cells. Decreased ABC transporters expression through inhibition of c-MET activation might overcome drug resistance to cytotoxic agents.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Recent studies revealed that ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) 2p23 translocation, most commonly fused with echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), is a novel driver oncogene in about 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK 2p23 fusion (ALK+) can be diagnosed by dual color break-part ALK FISH assay to inform personalized targeted therapy using the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, the underlying mechanisms of ALK oncogenic signaling and more importantly ALK inhibitor crizotinib resistance are not well understood.Materials and Methods', ' To understand the mechanism of oncogenic ALK signaling, an ALK+ NSCLC microarray dataset was retrieved from NCBI-GEO data repository (GSE31210) and analyzed using data-mining bioinformatics approaches. This dataset includes the gene expression profiles of 11 ALK+ NSCLC and 20 normal lung tissue samples. Statistical analysis was carried out to identify altered genes in ALK+ NSCLC and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was deployed to uncover their network interactions. To study the resistance mechanism of the ALK+ H3122 human NSCLC cell line against the specific ALK inhibitor TAE684, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), cell viability assay and immunoblotting were performed using standard techniques.Results', ' We identified a set of 1,656 genes that were significantly altered in ALK+ NSCLC, consisting of 662 upregulated and 994 downregulated. The principal component analysis (PCA) based on the top 51 of these dysregulated genes evidently separated ALK+ and normal lung tissue samples, implicating that these genes could represent potential genomic signature of ALK+ NSCLC. The IPA analysis revealed 35 canonical pathways linked to ALK signaling, including beta-adrenergic and angiopoietin signaling pathways. The results of qRT-PCR, cell viability assay and immunoblotting showed that in translocated ALK+ H3122 human NSCLC cell line, HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) overexpression could activate ALK downstream signaling via activation of MET receptor kinase pathway, thus potentially bypassing the oncogenic ALK signaling under ALK inhibitor TAE684 treatment. Hence, alternative direct activation of ALK downstream signaling molecules via MET/HGF axis activation may potentially contribute to ALK inhibitor drug resistance.Conclusion', ' Using bioinformatics data-mining, we have identified dysregulated genes and pathways in ALK+ NSCLC, many of which are novel biomarkers not previously reported. We also verified the relevance and potential key role of MET/HGF signaling axis in ALK inhibitor resistance. Taken together, our results highlighted the cross-talk between ALK and MET signaling in NSCLC and shed new insights into possible pitfalls of potential specific ALK targeting inhibitor drugs.']",

Upregulation of alternative signaling pathways such as Wnt or mTOR have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis and are a potential mechanism of resistance. This study aims at examining these signaling pathways and EGFR/c-MET co-expression in 100 patients with stage I-IV NSCLC. We have data on 50 patients, and are working on the remaining samples. Tumor tissue from biopsies or resections have been obtained with IRB approval, processed, sectioned, and mounted on microscope slides. Total and active forms of EGFR, c-MET, mTOR, S6K, beta-catenin, and Axin2 were detected using singleplex or multiplex IHC staining procedures, and stains were graded by an independent pathologist using a validated scoring system. We selected Stage IV NSCLC (n = 32) patients to correlate EGFR/c-MET expression with overall survival, and analyzed them for months to mortality based on high or low EGFR expression. Patients with high EGFR expression (n = 16) showed lower overall survival compared to those with low EGFR expression (n = 16). Expression of c-MET is linked to decreased survival in Stage IV NSCLC patients (n = 4). Patients with EGFR/c-MET co-localization (n = 19) showed decreased overall survival compared to patients without EGFR/c-MET co-localization (n = 9). Elevated mTOR and p-mTOR are associated with worse prognosis in Stage IV NSCLC patients. Patients categorized with either low mTOR expression (n = 10) or high mTOR expression (n = 19) showed increased mortality with high mTOR expression (5.9 months) compared to patients with low mTOR expression (13.5 months). A similar trend was seen in patients with either low (n = 4, 7.5 months) or high (n = 24, 15.9 months) p-mTOR expression. Patients with low beta-catenin expression (n = 4) showed improved survival in comparison to patients with high beta-catenin expression (n = 18), 9.4 months vs 6.3 months, respectively. To determine correlations in expression of these proteins we found that EGFR/c-MET co-expression is inversely correlated with active beta-catenin and directly correlated with a negative regulator of beta-catenin, Axin-2 suggesting EGFR/c-MET co-expression is associated with a downregulation of Wnt activity. In contrast, elevated EGFR/c-MET co-expression and co-activation is statistically significantly correlated with elevated mTOR-S6K expression and activation suggesting EGFR/c-MET co-expression is associated with an upregulation of the mTOR pathway activity. Elevated mTOR pathway activation at the time of diagnosis is statistically significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with stage IV NSCLC. These preliminary results suggest that mTOR inhibition therapy in addition to EGFR/c-MET inhibition therapies may be beneficial in this population.']",

One patient with metastatic, c-Met amplified gastric cancer refractory to platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens, was treated at 0.3 mg/kg (escalated to 1.0 mg/kg) and maintained stable disease by RECIST for 6 months, associated with mixed metabolic response on PET scan, and a more than 50% reduction in CTCs.
