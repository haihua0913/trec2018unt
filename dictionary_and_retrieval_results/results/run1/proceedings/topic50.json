In contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants, there have been a few reports on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in infants including our group (A. Shimada et al, ASH 2011). We and other group reported that MLL-R had the clinical impact in infant ALL, however, not in infant AML. Infant ALL with MLL-R expressed high FLT3 mRNA, on the other hand, the importance of FLT3 mRNA remains to be obscure in infant AML. Patients', ' Forty four infants with AML, aged less than 1 year at diagnosis, registered in JPLSG AML-05 from 2006-2010. Patients with Down syndrome were excluded. The most frequent FAB classification type was M7 (18/44, 40.9%), followed by M5 (15/44, 34.1%), and M4 (4/44, 9.0%). Total 16 of 44 (36.4%) infant AML patients had MLL-R, 9 patients were detected by G-banding method, and other 7 patients were by FISH analysis or RT-PCR. There was not t(8;21), t(15;17) except for one inv(16) patient. Methods', ' FLT3 mRNA expression and internal tandem duplication (ITD) were analyzed in the first diagnostic bone marrow samples by RQ-PCR and PCR. Results', ' No patients had FLT3-ITD, however, higher FLT3 mRNA expression was found in MLL-R patients (n=16) (median 623,150 copies/gRNA) compared with MLL-wild type (WT) (n=28) (median 25,105) (p<0.005). This phenomenon was also observed in 12-23 months AML patients. Discussion', ' High FLT3 mRNA expression was reported in infant ALL with MLL-R and it can be a molecular target for FLT3 inhibitor. On the other hand, there was no report in infant AML. Our previous data suggested that SCT had the limited efficacy for infant AML, FLT3 inhibitor might be considered to be used for infant AML with MLL-R in future.']",

        "Background":"['FLT3 is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes C-KIT, C-FMS and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). FLT3 is primarily expressed in early myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and plays an important role in their proliferation and differentiation. In human leukemia, FLT3 is expressed on 70-90% acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and most B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). FLT3 genetic aberrations are commonly detected in patients with AML. The most common aberration is internal tandem duplication (ITD), which occurs in 25-30% of AML patients and causes constitutive activation of FLT3. Point mutation in codon D835 of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain is reported in 7-10% of AML patients and also causes constitutive activation of the receptor. FLT3 small molecule inhibitors targeting the kinase domain are predominantly active against FLT3 activated AML. The restricted normal tissue expression profile and higher differential in leukemic specimens makes FLT3 amenable to antibody-based therapeutics, requiring only target expression independent of kinase activation status. Therefore, development of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) may provide a therapeutic alternative for AML patients.Here, we report the development of the first FLT3specific ADC, AGS62P1, employing site-specific conjugation using the non-natural amino acid, p-acetyl phenylalanine (pAF). AGS62P1 comprises a human gamma one antibody including an inserted pAF residue in each of the heavy chains. The antibody was conjugated to a potent cytotoxic payload via an oxime bond at the pAF sites, thus creating a nearly homogeneous drug distribution, with approximately 2 drug molecules per antibody. Strong binding affinity (0.1-0.9 nM) and potent in vitro cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 0.2-12 nM) was achieved in AML cell lines. The anti-FLT3 ADC was highly efficacious in AML tumor xenografts, leading to statistically significant tumor growth inhibition of both FLT3 ITD and non-ITD models. Additional characterization of both the antibody and ADC was performed, including ligand receptor interaction, degradation, internalization, and apoptosis.In summary, we have developed a site-specific ADC targeting FLT3 that exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in xenograft models regardless of FLT3 activation status. This drug can potentially offer a new and more versatile approach in targeting FLT3-expressing leukemia through a mechanism independent of FLT3 genetic aberration.']",

Here, we report the Denovo preclinical candidate SC110237, a novel, selective, highly potent, and orally active FLT3 inhibitor which has very similar antitumor efficacy in MV4-11 xenograft models, but has better cardiac safety, and more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles compared with AC220, the first-in-class FLT3 inhibitor in clinical trial.SC110237 showed potent activity against FLT3 enzyme (IC50 = 91 nM) and anti-proliferative activity against MV4-11 tumor cells (SC110237 IC50 = 0.09 nM, AC220 IC50 = 0.56 nM).

MV4-11, MOLM-13 human AML cells have FLT3-ITD mutations, EOL-1 human CEL (Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia) cells have FIP1L1-PDGFRA and over-expression of wild-type FLT3 receptor. In s.c. MV4-11 AML model, SC110237-2 (2, 6, 18 mg/kg) demonstrated potent activity. Tumor is completely eradicated in all groups even at the lowest dose of 2 mg/kg, with prolonged inhibition effect on tumor growth after drug withdrawal. At the lowest dose of 2 mg/kg for SC110237-2, there is 1 tumor re-growth until day 55 (12 days post last dose) compared to 3 tumors re-growth (one of the mice died) on the day 55 (12 days post dose) for AC220 at the same dose of 2 mg/kg. At higher dose of 6 mg/kg for SC110237-2, there is no sign of tumor re-growth until day 82 (39 days post last dose) comparing with 1 tumor re-growth on the day 76 (33 days post dose) for AC220 at the same dose of 6 mg/kg. In s.c. MOLM-13 and EOL-1 models, Tumor is completely eradicated in 4/8 mg/kg groups after 5 or 8 days dosing. SC110237-2 has no inhibition on CYP450 2C9, 2D6, 3A4 (Midazolam). Exposure of SC110237 is similar to that of AC220 which has the best PK profile among FLT3 inhibitors, while Cmax of SC110237 is lower than that of AC220. SC110237-2 exhibits linear dose-proportional exposure in mice and dog, and easier to adjust the dosage. Bioavailability of SC110237-2 in dog is 35%. To evaluate the effects of SC110237-2 and AC220 on the cardiovascular system, real time ECG was observed in conscious monkeys by a telemetry system. No abnormal phenomena have been observed in the 20 and 40 mg/kg SC110237 group, only with faster heart rate in the 80 mg/kg SC110237-2. On the other hand, 40 mg/kg AC220 can obviously prolong the QTcB interval.

The purpose of this study was to identify downstream targets of NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived ROS signalling in acute myeloid leukemia cells, by performing a proteomic analysis utilizing two-dimensional phosphotyrosine immnoblotting. The majority of the targets identified were cytoskeletal-associated proteins including Ezrin, a known regulator of the cytoskeleton, which was examined further. The study demonstrated that inhibition of Nox enzymes, using diphenyleneiodonium chloride in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line MOLM-13, resulted in a decrease in Ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation and also triggered a shift in Ezrin sub-cellular localization as detected by immunofluorescence. The change in Ezrin localization coincided with altered cell morphology, observed using scanning electron microscopy and a decreased ability to migrate through a polycarbonate transwell membrane. Similar effects were observed upon inhibition of the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 using the staurosporine derivate PKC412, implicating a role for FLT3 as an upstream regulator of Ezrin. Our results indicate that FLT3 drives production of ROS by Nox, which stimulates changes in Ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation and localization via redox regulation of Src.

We observed that Grb10 physically associates with normal and oncogenic FLT3 through FLT3 phospho-tyrosine 572 and 793 residues. Although Grb10 expression did not affect FLT3 activation or stability, its expression enhanced FLT3-mediated Akt and STAT5 phosphorylation without affecting Erk or p38 phosphorylation. Selective Grb10 depletion reduced Akt and STAT5 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 and OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 regulates cell cycle by accelerating G2-M transition followed by an increased cell population in S-phase. Expression of Grb10 furthermore resulted in an increased proliferation, survival and colony formation of Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells. Grb10 expression was significantly increased in AML patients compared to healthy controls and was also elevated in patients carrying FLT3-ITD mutants. The elevated Grb10 expression correlated to relapse as well as to poor prognosis. In addition, Grb10 expression led to resistance to chemotherapy.

The FLT3-D835 mutation was found in 1 of 4 patients with IDH1 mutations. These results suggest that although the involvements of IDH1/2 mutations in the pathogenesis of pediatric myeloid malignancies are extremely rare, closely positioned to near activation site, R132 IDH1, these IDH1 mutations are the candidate second genetic events in a subset of MLL-leukemia.']",

        "Background":"['FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are the most common alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor disease prognosis. Targeted therapy using FLT3-ITD inhibitors showed limited effect in reducing leukemia blasts in bone marrow (BM) than that in peripheral blood. The BM microenvironment is enriched with cytokines and adhesion molecules, such as CXCR4 and E-selectin, which are believed to provide AML cells protection against chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, blocking CXCR4 and E-selectin concomitantly with FLT3 inhibition could theoretically eliminate the protection in FLT3-mutant AML patients. We recently reported that targeting CXCR4/E-selectin with the dual inhibitor GMI-1359 showed significant prolongation of survival of mice engrafted with FLT3-ITD mutant MV4-11 leukemia cells. In the present study, we further investigated anti-leukemia effects of dual CXCR4/E-selectin inhibition. Results indicate efficient mobilization of leukemia cells into the circulation by GMI-1359 in a MOLM14-engrafted murine model 2h after drug treatment, which was 3.3-fold ( 0.3) higher compared with the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor, and 7.4-fold ( 2.7) higher compared with controls. In addition, GMI-1359 also mobilized normal murine leukocytes from the BM, suggesting that GMI-1359 may block interactions of leukemia cells with various BM components. Combination therapy of GMI-1359 and sorafenib significantly reduced leukemia burden (1.9e7 vs. 2.3e9, 1.0e9 and 8.5e7 photons/sec in the combination group versus control, GMI-1359 and sorafenib groups, respectively, at day 20 as determined by Xenogen IVIS bioluminescence Imaging; p < 0.001). Moreover, the combination treatment profoundly reduced leukemia burden in the BM of leukemic mice after a 15-day treatment (1.7e7 vs. 1.6e9, 6.3e8 and 7.0e7 photons/sec, p < 0.01; and 1.76% vs. 70.96%, 72.8% and 33.8%.leukemia cell engraftment measured as GFP positive leukemic cells in BM by flow cytometry, in the combination group vs. vehicle, GMI-1359 and Sorafenib groups, respectively, p < 0.01). Of note, the combination therapy profoundly extended the median survival of the leukemia-bearing mice from 27 days in the control group to 46.5 days in the combination treatment groups (p < 0.001). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that direct blockade of the interaction of E-selectin-CXCR4/SDF-1 with GMI-1359 was critical for leukemic cell mobilization via the disruption of adhesion to stromal cells. Furthermore, the presence of GMI-1359 enhanced sorafenib-induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD mutated leukemic cells co-cultured with stromal cells. This effect occurred even under hypoxia, which is characteristic for the leukemic BM microenvironment. These findings provide the pre-clinical basis for the evaluation of GMI-1359 in patients with FLT3-mutant AML.']",

This heterogeneity is thought to underlie the divergent responses to treatment observed and contribute to relapse. The Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase containing an internal tandem duplication (Flt3 ITD) is a common mutation in AML and associated with a poor prognosis; however, its effect on chemotherapy response is currently unknown. Methods', ' Murine AML was generated by retroviral transduction of an MLL-ENL fusion protein into fetal liver cells and subsequent transplantation into syngeneic mice. Blasts were harvested from moribund animals and myeloid lineage confirmed by immunophenotyping. Flt3 ITD sequence was inserted into a GFP tagged vector. Blasts were infected with Flt3 ITD or control virus. For competition assays mixtures of infected and uninfected blasts were exposed to chemotherapy for 72 hours. Among the remaining viable cells, percentages of infected blasts were determined by flow cytometry. For in vivo competition assays animals were injected with mixtures of blasts, treated with chemotherapy and percentages of Flt3 ITD positive blasts as well as total leukemic burden in femoral bone marrow was assessed. Results', ' Presence of the Flt3 ITD confers an advantage to doxorubicin (dox) in vitro. After exposure to dox at 5ng/mL more infected blasts remained viable when compared to controls (p = 0.0001). Presence of the Flt3 ITD increased sensitivity to cytarabine (Ara-C). After exposure to 50 nM Ara-C fewer Flt3 ITD blasts remained viable (p = 0.0293). Flt3 ITD confers sensitivity to Ara-C in vivo. Bl6 mice were injected with 1x106 blasts, 10% containing Flt3 ITD. After 12 days mice were treated for 5 days with either Ara-C at 200mg/kg, dox at 3mg/kg or observation. Ara-C treated animals had fewer Flt3 ITD blasts than controls (p = 0.0030) or dox treated animals (p < 0.0001) and lower leukemic burden (p < 0.0001). In contrast there was no difference in leukemic burden between Ara-C treated, dox treated or control animals in AML without Flt3 ITD (p = 0.2833). Conclusions', ' The Flt3 ITD confers resistance to doxorubicin in vitro and sensitivity to Ara-C in vitro and in vivo.

        "Background":"['CDK4 is a cyclin D dependent kinase that promotes cell cycle progression in a broad range of tumor types by phosphorylating the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and releasing transcription factor E2F. Critical involvement of the cyclin D-CDK4-Rb pathway in carcinogenesis is strongly supported by a large amount of genetic evidence. In addition, promoter methylation with consequent silencing of expression of the CDK4 inhibitor, p15, has been reported in 44-60% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. It is also well established that constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase FLT3 via mutation contributes to the development of AML, with 30% of AML carrying such activating mutations. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors used as single agents reduce peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts in only a minority of AML patients, and the effect tends to be transient. This may be due to insufficient FLT3 inhibition, the selection of drug-resistant clones, or the independence of the cell on FLT3 signaling for proliferation and survival. In preclinical models, a synergistic effect of CDK4 inhibition and FLT3 inhibition resulting in increased apoptosis of AML cell lines was reported (Wang et al., Blood, 2007). From a HTS hit through SAR optimization led to AM-5992, a potent and orally bioavailable dual inhibitor of CDK4 and FLT3 including all FLT3 mutants reported to date. AM-5992 inhibits the proliferation of a panel of human tumor cell lines including MDA-MB-435(Rb+), colo-205(Rb+), U937(FLT3WT) and induced cell death in MOLM13(FLT3ITD), MV4-11(FLT3ITD), and even in MOLM13(FLT3ITD, D835Y) which exhibits resistance to a number of FLT3 inhibitors currently under clinical development. In mouse models of leukemia using cells with the FLT3ITD mutation, AM-5992 treatment at 150 mpk qd on days 6-16 after leukemia cell injection significantly reduced the leukemia burden and prolonged survival 11 days over that of vehicle controls. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that simultaneously inhibition of CDK4 and FLT3 may improve the durability of clinical response in AML; and consequently that this hypothesis should be tested in the clinic.']",

        "Background":"['The use of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of FLT3 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been explored as a promising strategy for over a decade. However, FLT3 TKIs have thus far shown limited clinical benefit in patients with FLT3/ITD AML. We hypothesized that FLT3/ITD leukemia cells exhibit mechanisms of intrinsic signaling adaptation to FLT3 TKI treatment that are associated with an incomplete biologic response. If true, combined targeted therapeutic approaches that overcome the adaptive resistance to FLT3 inhibition could be used to maximize the efficacy of anti-leukemia treatment for those expressing this mutation.To evaluate this hypothesis, the FLT3/ITD AML cell lines Molm14 and MV4;11 were treated with FLT3 TKIs for up to 48 hours at concentrations sufficient for maximal FLT3 inhibition and downstream signaling was analyzed by immunoblotting. We identified a rebound in ERK phosphorylation discernible by six hours and continuing for the duration of treatment, despite continued drug presence. This rebound resulted in near baseline levels of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and was coupled to a rebound in phosphorylation of elements both upstream and downstream of ERK as well as in the expression levels of ERK target genes, suggesting a global reactivation of the signaling cascade. Rebound was sensitive to a reduction in serum, suggesting a growth factor-dependent mechanism.To explore the consequences of this adaptation, the impact of combinatory targeting of ERK activity using selective small molecule inhibitors of MEK was evaluated. When Molm14 and MV4;11 cells were treated with inhibitors of both FLT3 and MEK in combination, little to no pERK rebound was observed. Additionally, the anti-leukemia effects were more pronounced for the combination compared to either drug alone, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the addition of a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901 or trametinib) to FLT3 TKI (sorafenib) treatment synergistically increased cell death and decreased cell viability. This effect was most pronounced at mid-range sorafenib combined with low dose MEK inhibitor. In vivo, the addition of low-dose PD0325901 to sorafenib treatment resulted in a significant reduction of both peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts in a transplant model (p < 0.05).Together, these studies reveal that FLT3/ITD leukemia cells demonstrate an adaptive feedback mechanism capable of reactivating ERK signaling in response to FLT3 inhibition. This adaptation limits the efficacy of FLT3 TKI treatment and can be abrogated by the addition of a MEK inhibitor. Our data suggest that the addition of low-dose MEK inhibitor to FLT3 TKI treatment as a means to overcome signaling adaptation may improve outcomes for patients with FLT3/ITD AML.']",

Treatment with FLT3 inhibitors is initially effective, but residual leukemia cells survive in the bone marrow microenvironment and clinical resistance develops within months. We tested proteins from the bone marrow microenvironment for their ability to protect FLT3-ITD+ MOLM14 cells from AC220, and found that FLT3 ligand (FL) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) were among the most protective.Results', ' Consistent with previous reports, FL restored downstream FLT3 phosphorylation and signaling in the presence of the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib (AC220). In contrast, FGF2 activated FGFR1 and the MAPK pathway, circumventing the effects of AC220 on MOLM14 cells and increasing cell survival. To model the effect of prolonged contact with the bone marrow microenvironment, MOLM14 cells were cultured continuously in FGF2 and AC220. Under these conditions, 4/4 cultures developed AC220 resistance and resumed exponential growth after 7 weeks. Development of FGF2-mediated resistance was accelerated compared to MOLM14 cultured continuously in AC220 alone (only 2/4 resistant cultures,12 weeks). Long-term resistant cultures grown in FGF2 were protected from AC220 across a wide range of concentrations, but concurrent treatment with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 synergistically overcame FGF2-mediated protection.Serial bone marrow biopsies of patients on the AC220 phase II clinical trial were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Quantification of FGF2 revealed a significant increase in AC220 during treatment (34% to 51% after one month, p<0.01) and FGF2 expression peaked at 61% after 4 months (p<0.01), indicating that residual leukemia cells exist in a microenvironment abundant in FGF2. To test if FGFR inhibition could overcome FGF2-mediated protection from bone marrow stroma, we grew MOLM14 cells in co-culture with an FGF2-expressing stromal cell line (HS-5). HS-5 co-culture increased viability in MOLM14 in AC220 treatment, however concurrent PD173074 treatment abrogated stromal cell protection suggesting that combination of FLT3 and FGFR inhibitors may overcome resistance mediated by the microenvironment.Conclusions', ' FGF2 ligand-induced activation of the FGFR1/MAPK pathway leads to protection from AC220 in vitro and eventual development of resistance. FGF2-mediated resistance can be overcome by concurrent FLT3 and FGFR inhibition. Consistent with our in vitro model, patients treated with AC220 had increasing FGF2 in their bone marrow, which peaked prior to resistance and relapse, suggesting that combined FLT3 and FGFR inhibitors may improve the durability of response. Our results provide an approach to develop rational inhibitor combinations that cirucumvent ligand-mediated pathways of resistance.']",

However, clinical studies with Flt3 kinase inhibitors have shown that mutations of the gate keeper or an activation loop residue in the Flt3 catalytic domain limits the duration of response. Such mutations generally reduce kinase domain binding affinity and residence time of the kinase inhibitor, and consequently its efficacy. We therefore investigated whether covalent, irreversible binding to Flt3 could overcome some of the limitations of classic non-covalent Flt3 inhibitors. Here, we report for the first time on the high-affinity Cys828-covalent binding mode of a resorcylic acid lactone to the isolated Flt3 kinase domain using X-ray crystallography and kinetic binding assays. In a cellular context (Ba/F3-Flt3-ITD), mutation of Cys828 to Ala reduces potency (IC50) from low nM to microM, demonstrating all relevant Flt3 inhibition in cells critically depends on Cys828. Consistently, the molecule is a low nM inhibitor of both Flt3-ITD and Flt3D835Y in vitro and in BaF3 cells, translating to potent nM inhibition of Flt3-ITD driven AML cell line proliferation, with only microM antiproliferative activity in non-Flt3 driven AML and unrelated leukemia cell lines. Finally, in spite of its fast clearance when dosed to MV4-11 (Flt3-ITD AML) xenograft bearing mice, robust anti-tumor activity was observed using a once-daily treatment schedule.

When mutated, this receptor tyrosine kinase increases the activity of pathways for proliferation and blocks apoptosis. Quizartinib is a 2nd generation FLT3 inhibitor that inhibits FLT3-ITD in AML, but has a median duration response of 12.1 weeks. Studies revealed a secondary mutation in FLT3 at the aspartate of codon 835 (D835X) is responsible for relapse. The D835 substitution renders FLT3 constitutively active.

Here, we tested the utility of ON150030, developed by our group, as a novel therapeutic agent to treat AML. Structural studies suggest ON150030 binds to the active form of FLT3 (Type 1 inhibitor) so mutations such as D835X do not affect the inhibitory activity of the compound. In vitro kinase assays demonstrate that ON150030 potently inhibits Wildtype and FLT3-D835Y forms, while Quizartinib fails to inhibit FLT3-D835Y. Additionally, ON150030 demonstrated time and temperature dependent inhibition of FLT3, suggesting that the compound is an irreversible inhibitor of FLT3. Biological studies reveal that ON150030 specifically inhibits the growth of MV4-11 cells harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation (GI50', ' 10nM).

The JAK independent phosphorylation of STAT5 seen in the context of FLT3-ITD is also reduced in response to ON150030. Future goals are to introduce FLT3 and its various mutant isoforms into the mouse myeloid cells (32Dcl3) and examine how it affects proliferation and differentiation, and then compare the effects of ON150030 and Quizartinib. In addition to strongly inhibiting FLT3, ON150030 inhibits SRC, which was shown to induce resistance to targeted therapies in several leukemias including AML. We will introduce SRC into the 32D-FLT3-ITD cell lines sensitive to ON150030 and test whether these cells retain their sensitivity to the drug. Next, we will perform cytotoxicity and biochemical assays on patient-derived primary AML cells using ON150030. Mouse xenograft models will be used to determine if ON150030 synergizes with standard chemotherapy agents and inhibits cancer progression in vivo. At the conclusion of this project, we hope to demonstrate that ON150030 can be used in combination therapies in all AML patients harboring a FLT3 mutation, and result in sustained remission of disease.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a hematologic cancer associated with advancing age and relatively poor prognosis. Although diverse genetic changes are associated with AML, about one-third of cases involve activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase, Flt3. Clinical trials of most Flt3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been disappointing, indicating that additional signaling pathways contribute to the transformed phenotype. Previous studies have linked the c-Fes protein tyrosine kinase to Flt3 in AML, and RNAi-knockdown studies suggest that c-Fes may be required for Flt3 function. Recently, our laboratory reported several classes of inhibitors with favorable selectivity profiles for c-Fes both in vitro and in cell-based assays. In this study, we tested c-Fes inhibitors from four different chemical classes for their growth-suppressive activity against myeloid leukemia cells lines with an activating mutation in Flt3 (MV4-11 cells) vs. wild-type Flt3 (THP-1). All c-Fes inhibitors tested potently inhibited the growth of MV4-11 AML cells, but were far less active against THP-1 cells. The IC50 values for inhibition of MV4-11 cell proliferation by c-Fes inhibitors of the diaminopyrimidine, phenoxyquinazoline and pyrrolopyrimidine classes ranged from 25-140 nM, rivaling the potency of the clinical Flt3 inhibitors lestaurtinib and tandutinib. In contrast, two pyrazolopyrimidine c-Fes inhibitors were less potent in MV4-11 cells, with IC50 values for growth arrest in the low micromolar range. KINOMEscan analysis, an indirect binding assay which provides a relative measure of inhibitor selectivity across the kinome, suggested that the more potent compounds may have dual specificity for both Flt3 and c-Fes while the less potent compounds may be more selective for c-Fes alone. To test this idea, we performed in vitro kinase assays with recombinant purified c-Fes and Flt3 proteins. We observed that the most potent inhibitors of MV4-11 AML cell proliferation inhibited both c-Fes and Flt3 kinase activity, with IC50 values in the 0.2-1.5 M range for c-Fes and in the 0.2-4.0 M range for Flt3. For example, the phenoxyquinazoline analog TL02-59 showed similar potency against both c-Fes (IC50 of 1.0-1.5 M) and Flt3 (IC50 of 0.6-4.0 M) in vitro, and potently blocked MV4-11 cell proliferation (IC50 of 26.5 nM) and induced apoptosis. In contrast, the pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitor WZ4-49-8, which exhibited 20-fold greater selectivity for c-Fes over wild-type Flt3 in vitro, was less active against MV4-11 cell proliferation (IC50 of 1.86 M) and produced a lower apoptotic response than TL02-59. Interestingly, the established Flt3 inhibitor lestaurtinib was also a relatively potent inhibitor of c-Fes, yielding IC50 values in the 0.4-0.8 M range. These results suggest that dual inhibition of both Flt3 and c-Fes may provide a therapeutic advantage for the treatment of AML.']",

        "Background":"['Every year in the US there are approximately 12,000 new cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Amongst these patients, 25% have internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3, causing constitutive activation of the receptor. This mutation has been associated with a poor survival rate, thus making the FLT3/ITD an important target in the treatment of AML. Treatment with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has shown high response rates in AML patients.1 However, this response is often temporary due to the development of resistance-conferring point mutations.2 Furthermore, QTc prolongation has proven to be a dose-limiting toxicity with some FLT3 TKIs.1 Crenolanib is a TKI with activity against PDGFR and FLT3 and is currently being tested in trials involving patients with a variety of solid tumors. We have determined that crenolanib has potent activity in vitro against FLT3. Crenolanib is cytotoxic to the FLT3/ITD-expressing leukemia cell lines Molm14 and MV411, with an IC50 of 7 nM and 8 nM, respectively. In immunoblots, crenolanib inhibited phosphorylation of both the wild type FLT3 receptor (in SEMK2 cells) and the FLT3/ITD receptor (in Molm14 cells) in culture medium with an IC50 of 1-3 nM. Importantly, the IC50 of crenolanib against the D835Y mutated form of FLT3 was 8.8 nM in culture medium. Using primary AML patient samples, we determined that crenolanib was cytotoxic to FLT3/ITD-expressing samples in a manner comparable to agents such as sorafenib and AC220. Furthermore, crenolanib had cytotoxic activity against primary samples that were obtained from patients who had developed D835 resistance mutations while receiving FLT3 TKIs. In vitro, the IC50 of crenolanib for inhibition of FLT3/ITD in plasma was found to be 34 nM, indicating a relatively low degree of plasma protein binding. From pharmacokinetic studies of crenolanib in solid tumor patients, steady state trough plasma levels of roughly 500 nM were found to be safe and tolerable, suggesting that crenolanib could potentially inhibit the target in vivo as effectively as AC220. Unlike AC220, crenolanib has no significant activity against c-KIT, which may be an advantage in that myelosuppression can be avoided. Furthermore, there was no evidence of QTc prolongation in patients treated with crenolanib. In summary, crenolanib offers a number of advantages over other FLT3 TKIs. Clinical trials of crenolanib in AML patients with FLT3 activating mutations are planned. References', ' 1) Cortes et al.

        "Background":"['FYN is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the SRC family of kinases. SRC family kinases are frequently over-expressed in human cancers, and play key roles in cancer cell invasion, metastasis, proliferation, survival and many other biological processes. SRC has long been recognized as an important oncogene; but little attention has been given to its other family members such as FYN. In this report, we have studied the role of FYN in FLT3 signaling with respect to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase which is found to be mutated in around 30% of AML cases. We observed that FYN displays a strong association with wild-type FLT3 as well as oncogenic FLT3-ITD. While association with wild-type FLT3 is dependent on ligand stimulation, it is constitutively associated with FLT3-ITD. In addition, a kinase-dead FLT3 mutant was unable to associate with FYN suggesting that FLT3 activation is required for association with FYN. A FYN SH2-domain mutant lacking a critical arginine residue was unable to associate with FLT3 indicating that FYN associates with FLT3 through its SH2 domain. A phopho-peptide fishing experiment identified multiple FYN binding sites in FLT3, which partially overlap with the known SRC binding sites but also differ from these sites. To understand the role of FYN in FLT3 signaling, we have generated Ba/F3-FLT3/FYN or Ba/F3-FLT3/empty vector cell lines. We observed that expression of FYN results in enhanced phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells overexpressing FYN also showed higher STAT5 activation. Furthermore, FYN expression led to a significant increase in FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation but did not alter apoptosis induced by cytokine starvation. Finally, we showed that FYN expression was deregulated in AML patient samples and that higher expression of FYN in combination with FLT3-ITD expression correlates with poor prognosis in AML. Taken together our data suggest that FYN cooperates with oncogenic FLT3-ITD which results in poor prognosis in AML and therefore inhibition of FYN in combination with FLT3 inhibition will most likely be beneficial for AML patients.']",

Activating FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) mutations are detected in 30% of AML cases with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations conferring worse prognosis. Recently, the potent FLT3 inhibitor AC220 has achieved composite complete remission in 45% of patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutant AML (Cortes et al, EHA 2011). Translational studies from our laboratory implicate reactivation of FLT3-ITD through kinase domain mutations in the majority AC220 relapse cases (Smith et al, ASH 2011). Given that less than half of treated patients initially achieve deep remissions on AC220, we hypothesize that off-target (non-FLT3 mediated) resistance is responsible for primary resistance to AC220, and may mediate loss of response in a subset of patients. Results', ' To model and identify putative mechanisms of off-target resistance to AC220 in vitro, we cultured the FLT3-ITD+ patient derived cell lines MV4;11 and Molm14 in escalating concentrations of AC220. To date, we have isolated 8 Molm14 subclones that are resistant to at least 20nM AC220, which is >60-fold the IC50 of the parental line (0.3nM), while efforts to generate resistant MV4;11 cells have repeatedly failed. Analysis of FLT3 signaling revealed persistent FLT3 phosphorylation in 5 clones in the presence of 10nM AC220. Sequencing of the FLT3 kinase domain identified acquired secondary activation loop mutations suggesting on-target acquired resistance. The remaining 3 clones demonstrated off-target resistance as evidenced by the absence of a FLT3 mutation and loss of FLT3 phosphorylation with 10nM AC220 treatment. Despite FLT3 inhibition, the clones failed to undergo apoptosis and maintained ERK phosphorylation when treated with AC220. Sequencing of K- and NRAS revealed an NRAS G12C mutation in 2 clones and an NRAS Q61K mutation in the third clone, both of which are known activating RAS mutations. The AC220 IC50 values for the G12C mutant clones were determined to be 134nM and 329nM AC220 and the Q61K mutant was one of the most resistant of all clones with an IC50 of >1000nM AC220.

T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a serine-threonine protein kinase, is highly expressed and associated with an aggressive cancer phenotype, but is hardly detectable in normal tissues. Here, we investigate TOPK in AML and demonstrate that it is highly expressed in most AML cell lines and some primary blasts, but is not detected in CD34+ cells of healthy donors. MV4-11 and U937 cells transfected with TOPK-siRNA showed significant decrease in cell viability (70%, P<0.001). We then examined the anti-leukemia activity of TOPK inhibitor OTS514 in AML. Primary blasts obtained from 3 patients (pts) with AML showed significant decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 values were 10-20nM). Moreover, OTS514 treatment resulted in significant decrease in number of colonies of CD34+ cells obtained from a pt with AML (41 vs 73, P = 0.01), but not of CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors (39 vs 36, P = 0.67).Treatment of 10 AML cell lines with OTS514 showed that FLT3 mutated cell lines were significantly more sensitive (IC5020nM). Annexin/PI staining showed 80% and 70% increase in apoptosis in FLT3-ITDmut cells (MV4-11 and MOLM13) treated with OTS514 (40nM; 48hrs). In contrast, only 40% and 10% apoptosis was observed in FLT3wt cells (U937 and KG1, respectively) treated under the same conditions. Additionally, cell cycle analysis in cells treated with OTS514 (20nM; 24 and 48 hrs) showed a dramatic decrease of S phase (98%; P = 0.003) in MV4-11 but only 70% (P<0.001) and 30% (P = 0.02) in THP-1 (FLT3wt) cells compared with untreated cells.Importantly, OTS514 treatment decreased cell viability and increased cell differentiation and apoptosis in primary blasts from pts relapsed after FLT3 inhibitor treatment (AC220). Furthermore, using a MV4-11-engrafted mouse model, we found that mice treated with 7.5mg/kg IV every day for 3 weeks survived significantly longer than vehicle treated mice (median survival 46 vs 29, P<0.001). Mechanistically, OTS514 or TOPK-siRNA significantly decreased FLT3 mRNA and protein levels and decreased CEBPA phosphorylation in FLT3-ITDmut cells. Furthermore, activating FLT3 in THP-1 cells via FLT3 ligand increased TOPK protein. Also, FLT3 knockdown or inhibition with MLN518 (50 and 100nM) decreased TOPK levels in MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells, but not in U937 cells, suggesting that TOPK is a downstream target of FLT3.In conclusion, TOPK inhibitor exhibits preferential activity in FLT3-ITDmut AML, partially via inhibition of FLT3 expression. Thus, OTS514 represents new targeted therapy for this adverse risk subset of AML.']",

AC220 inhibited [125I]-IAAP photolabeling of ABCG2 and ABCB1 with IC50 values of 0.27 M and 3.3 M, respectively. Co-incubation with AC220 at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 M sensitized K562/ABCG2 cells to the ABCG2 substrate chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone 1.6-, 3.3- and 6- fold, respectively, in the cell viability assay. Finally, co-incubation with AC220 at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 M increased apoptosis of K562/ABCG2 cells induced by fixed concentrations of the ABCG2 substrate chemotherapy drugs mitoxantrone and topotecan by 28, 45, 48 and 60% and 27, 61, 76, and 85%, respectively. We conclude that AC220 is a potent inhibitor of ABCG2-mediated drug transport at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. AC220 inhibition of ABCG2 should sensitize ABCG2-overexpressing AML cells to ABCG2 substrate chemotherapy drugs, but may also cause clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions. These effects should be considered in the design and evaluation of regimens combining AC220 with chemotherapy drugs.']",

While blacks had a higher incidence of complex karyotypes (27% vs. 13%, p=0.002) and a lower incidence of normal karyotypes (30% vs. 45%, p=0.04), OS did not differ (15 vs. 14 months; p NS) and did not differ within cytogenetic subsets. OS of black males was longer than that of white males (21 vs. 12 months, p=0.02), likely attributable to a younger median age (53 vs. 63 years, p<0.001) and a trend toward a higher incidence of t(15;17) (13% vs. 6%, p=0.09) in black males. Females did not differ by race in median age or OS but there was a much higher incidence of complex karyotypes in black females (30% vs. 12%, p=0.003) and also a trend toward more total unfavorable karyotypes (45% vs. 28%, p=0.06).

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic disease and the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. Despite remarkable progress made in the therapy of AML, the mainstays of treatment have not significantly changed over the last 20 years. Technological advances have greatly accelerated genomic discovery and precision medicine holds promise to better tailor medications to AML with specific mutations. Importantly, one major obstacle to greater success with target therapy of leukemia is drug resistance. But the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in AML are poorly understood.The activating mutations of FLT3 are now recognized as the most common molecular abnormality in AML and FLT3ITD mutations are found in nearly 30% of AML patients. The poor prognosis of patients harboring FLT3 mutations renders FLT3 an obvious target of therapy. Quizartinib (AC220) is a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of FLT3. It is in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3ITD positive and negative AML patients and as a maintenance therapy. So far, those clinical trials have showed very promising result. However, drug resistance to AC220 has also been reported through the early clinical studies. To understand the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance to AC220, we undertook an unbiased approach with a novel CRISPR pooled library to screen new genes whose loss of function confer resistance to AC220. In our screen, we identified SPRY3 and GSK3 as positive hits and the related Wnt and FGF-Ras-ERK signaling activation as the major mechanisms to cause resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor AC220. In the next step, we will explore the detailed underlying mechanisms by which SPRY3 and GSK3 mutations lead to drug resistance to AC220. We will also confirm our findings in primary AML patient samples. Taken together, our study will provide new insight into signaling pathways that contribute to the acquired resistance in AML. The knowledge learned from this study may lead to the development of more efficient therapeutic avenues for AML.']",

        "Background":"['The tumor suppressor 2A (PP2A) is a multi-enzyme complex that targets a variety of oncogenic signaling cascades such as Raf, MEK and AKT. Numerous reports have now emerged indicating that the inhibition of PP2A leads to the development of tumors including breast, gastric and lung and a range of hematological malignancies such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML, respectively). We and others have shown that inhibition of PP2A is crucial for the oncogenic effects of leukemia associated receptor tyrosine kinases such as BCR/Abl, c-KIT and FLT3. Importantly when PP2A is reactivated using pharmacological agents (FTY720 and AAL(S)), growth and survival of these cells is inhibited. This approach targets molecules downstream of these oncogenic kinases and thus PP2A reactivation is designed to avoid resistance associated with kinase inhibitor therapy. As the mechanism of action of these PP2A activators is unknown, it is essential that we now determine the molecular targets of these compounds to generate more effective drugs. Using a chemical proteomics approach incorporating click chemistry linking the drugs to beads, unbiased pull down assays were performed in myeloid leukaemia cells and protein isolates were identified by mass spectrometry. Using this approach we have identified a novel cellular target, which is known to be overexpressed in a range of cancers, including leukemias. We have also shown that this protein associates with PP2A complexes in these cells, and thus may act as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A activity. We have also performed phospho-proteomics and co-immunoprecipitation studies to identify protein changes in myeloid leukemia cells in response to PP2A activators. In addition to identifying known PP2A targets, such as Akt and ERK, we have also identified a number of novel protein changes, including altered expression of the SET oncoprotein. SET is a known inhibitor of PP2A, suggesting that FTY720 may act via inhibition of SET. Other PP2A regulatory proteins such as CIP2A, PME-1 and PP2A-B56alpha are also affected by FTY720/AAL(S) treatment. Our research findings are thus providing the vital clues necessary for determining the mechanism of action of clinically relevant PP2A activators, thereby moving us towards the provision of novel anti-cancer treatment regimes.']",

A well characterized example is the tyrosine kinase Flt3, which harbours internal tandem duplications in about one third of AML patients that render the kinase constitutively active. AML cells often become addicted to such constitutively activated survival inducing signaling pathways that can be therapeutically exploited by using small molecule kinase inhibitors.By screening bone marrow biopsies of AML patients for kinase expression profiles, we detected Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) in AML blasts in 26 out of 30 analyzed cases. Btk acts as an oncogene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as in certain B-cell lymphoma subtypes. As compared to diseases of lymphoid origin far less is known about the role of Btk in myeloid neoplasias.Here, we show that Btk is often constitutively activated in AML and moreover, that genetic as well as pharmacological inhibition of Btk in AML cell lines as well as primary patient-derived AML cultures strongly diminishes AML cell growth. By applying quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified a signalosome consisting of Btk and Toll-like receptor 9 that is needed to constitutively transduce proliferation signals through the NFkB pathway.

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that is characterized by increased myeloproliferation and a block in differentiation of progenitor cells, leading to infiltration of immature blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Approximately 30% of AML cases harbor a mutation in the FLT3 gene leading to constitutive activation of FLT3. The most commonly observed mutation occurs in the juxtamembrane domain as an internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) of variable length sequence repeats. In addition, activating mutations in the kinase domain are observed in 7-10% of patients. The presence of FLT3-ITD mutations confers a poor prognosis, and thus many studies are directed at developing and testing novel FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of AML. A number of clinical trials are now underway studying tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target FLT3. There have been limitations in the responses observed in patients on these trials related to insufficient achievement of FLT3 inhibition and the development of drug resistance through a variety of mechanisms. This includes resistance conferring point mutations that appear in patients following drug treatment, as well as selection for cells with activation of parallel signaling pathways. Therefore, the search for novel TKIs that overcome some of these mechanisms and the discovery of additional targets for the treatment of AML are necessary to improve the cure rate of this disease. TTT-3002 is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that has activity against FLT3-ITD. Here we report the results of the characterization of this compound in a panel of AML cell lines. TTT-3002 has potent activity against FLT3 phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD cell lines at subnanomolar concentrations and significantly decreases cell viability through the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, TTT-3002 is highly active against cell lines with known activating or resistance mutations in the FLT3 gene, indicating the potential for broad clinical application. Furthermore, through analysis of TTT-3002 potency in cell lines cultured in human plasma preparations from healthy donors, we observed a 10-20 fold shift in IC50 values for FLT3 phosphorylation compared to cell culture media. These results suggest that TTT-3002 has reasonable protein binding, and may require lower doses than many other TKIs to achieve an effective concentration of free drug in plasma. Finally, we have found that 6 mg/kg bid in a solid dosing form is well tolerated in BALB/c mice, and it is sufficient to eliminate luciferase expressing Ba/F3 cells containing a FLT3-ITD mutation after 4 days of treatment. Continual dosing with TTT-3002 significantly prolongs tumor free survival over vehicle control treated mice (p<0.0001, n=10). These findings demonstrate the potential of TTT-3002 as a promising targeted therapeutic in the treatment of AML.']",

        "Background":"['The need for improved therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is urgent as the disease is still highly fatal. Protein Kinase B (AKT) activation has been shown to predict poor clinical outcome for patients with AML. In 253 newly diagnosed AML cases, we have found that AKT phosphorylation on Thr308 analyzed by reverse-phase protein arrays was significantly higher in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics (p=0.037). The adverse prognostic factor of high levels of pAKT was observed among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (p=0.013), as it was associated with an inferior survival (median survival 44.2 weeks) compared to patients with low or intermediate pAKT (78.7 weeks). Recently, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. has developed a compound, MK-2206, that is a highly specific allosteric inhibitor for all three AKT isoforms. In the current study, we have determined that MK-2206 as a single agent used at clinically achievable concentrations suppresses cell growth of a variety of AML derived cell lines including OCI-AML3, U937, and MOLM13. MK-2206 can also induce apoptosis in blast cells derived from AML patients. Consistent with its role as an AKT inhibitor, the drug suppresses phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 and inhibits phosphorylation of AKT downstream targets including S6 ribosomal protein, 4-EBP1, and PRAS40 in the AML cells. We recently identified that low expression of the PP2A isoform that acts as the AKT phosphatase (i.e. the one containing the B55 subunit) in AML negatively correlates with AKT T308 phosphorylation and activation in a cohort of 511 AML patients (Ruvolo et al Leukemia, 2011). Patients with low B55 expression exhibited shorter complete remission duration. We suppressed B55 expression by shRNA in OCI-AML3 cells to determine if loss of the AKT phosphatase promotes AKT activation and chemoresistance. Cells with reduced B55 exhibited higher levels of AKT phosphorylation and were more resistant to killing by the conventional chemotherapy agent AraC. OCI-AML3 B55 shRNA transductant cells were also more resistant to MK-2206 compared to cells expressing control non-specific shRNA. These results suggest that AKT phosphatase activity in AML may affect response to MK-2206. A recent study in liver cancer demonstrated that MK-2206 synergized with the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib. Since Sorafenib targets the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and mutations that activate the kinase in AML confer poor prognosis, we examined if MK-2206 could synergize with Sorafenib to kill leukemia cells with mutation of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. The combination of MK-2206 and Sorafenib was effective at killing MOLM13 cells and AML blast cells with the FLT3-ITD. Taken together, these findings suggest that MK-2206 may be effective to block AKT signaling pathways and could be beneficial as a therapeutic agent perhaps as a single agent or in combination with a drug such as Sorafenib in the therapy of AML.']",

        "Background":"['Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) are found in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Flt3-ITD expression is associated with aggressive, chemotherapy-resistant disease and decreased overall survival. Multiple selective Flt3 kinase inhibitors have been developed as targeted therapy for Flt3-ITD+ AML. However, the clinical utility of these kinase inhibitors has been limited by the rapid recurrence of drug-resistant disease that often results from Flt3 kinase domain mutations that prevent inhibitor action. Recent studies revealed that multiple non-receptor tyrosine kinases are over-expressed in AML, including the myeloid Src-family kinases Hck, Lyn and Fgr, and may cooperate with Flt3 to drive disease. These observations suggest that kinase inhibitors with specificity profiles targeting Flt3 and these AML-associated cytoplasmic kinases may be less prone to acquired resistance. In the present study, we determined the contributions of Hck and Fgr kinase activities to Flt3-ITD+ AML cell growth using a chemical genetics approach. While RNAi-mediated knockdown of each of these kinases reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis in primary AML cells, the impact of pharmacologic inhibition of their kinase activities on AML cell growth is not known. Because no selective Hck or Fgr inhibitors exist, we developed kinase domain mutants that desensitize each kinase to the broad-spectrum SRC-family kinase inhibitor, A-419259. Examination of a previous crystal structure of Hck with A-419259 bound to the active site suggested a role for the ‘gatekeeper’ residue in compound binding. Substitution of the gatekeeper threonine of Hck and Fgr with methionine conferred 3-fold resistance to A-419259 in vitro without diminishing kinase activity. When expressed in human TF-1 myeloid cells transformed with Flt3-ITD, these inhibitor-resistant Hck and Fgr mutants conferred resistance to growth inhibition by A-419259 to a similar extent, while expression of the corresponding wild-type kinases was without effect. The sensitivity of the TF-1/Flt3-ITD cell lines to A-419259 correlated with inhibition of mutant Hck and Fgr kinase activity in the cells. Our findings suggest that suppression of AML cell growth by A-419259 is due in part to inhibition of Hck and Fgr, and identify these AML-associated kinases as therapeutic targets. Ongoing studies are addressing the role of Hck and Fgr as inhibitor targets in Flt3-ITD+ AML cell lines and patient samples as well as the propensity of A-419259 and other multi-targeted inhibitors of AML-associated kinases for acquired drug resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Survival rates for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved dramatically, but outcomes for the 15% who relapse and for adults with ALL remain poor. Up to 40% of pediatric ALL patients require central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis treatments that pose significant risk. We previously showed that p53/ Rag-2/ Prkdcscid;scid triple mutant (TM) mice spontaneously develop early B-cell ALL that disseminates to the CNS. We used this model to investigate molecular mechanisms that drive CNS dissemination of leukemic B-cells. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed that TM ALLs have recurrent polyploidy or partial gains of telomeric chromosome 5 containing the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) locus. FLT3 is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase normally expressed on multi-potent hematopoietic progenitors. Small molecule FLT3 inhibitors abrogated proliferation of leukemic TM blasts in vitro, suggesting that Flt3 is a leukemic driver. During normal B-cell development, Flt3 is repressed by the PAX5 transcription factor, which also induces expression of B-lineage genes. Although TM ALLs expressed many genes indicative of B-lineage commitment, they ectopically over-expressed a truncated form of Flt3 (trFlt3) driven by an endogenous retrovirus long terminal repeat. The trFlt3 allele lacked most of the extracellular ligand-binding domain, but retained the trans-membrane region. Retroviral transduction of trFlt3 into BaF3 hematopoietic progenitor cells rendered their growth independent of interleukin-3. Phospho-flow cytometric profiling studies demonstrated that the signaling properties of trFLT3 are similar to those of FLT3-ITD, but are distinct from ligand-dependent FLT3 signaling. Thus, genomic rearrangements make Flt3 resistant to PAX5 repression and allow ectopic ligand-independent FLT3 signaling in TM B-ALL. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify genes downstream of Flt3 as potential drivers of B-ALL CNS dissemination. TM B-ALL blasts (but not murine B-ALL blasts lacking Flt3 expression) expressed RANKL, a key regulator of osteoclast differentiation and normal B-cell development. Cell surface expression of RANKL was absolutely correlated with the presence of trFLT3 protein, and RANKL cell surface expression was down-regulated by FLT3 inhibitors, suggesting that RANKL expression was controlled by trFLT3 signaling. We also found that interleukin-7, an important cytokine in B-cell development, up-regulates RANKL in normal pro-B cells. We are currently investigating if a RANKL antagonist can inhibit CNS dissemination of TM B-ALL expressing RANKL. Our studies have identified a novel Flt3 mutant allele with unusual signaling properties as a leukemic driver of early B-ALL, and provide a model for in vivo testing of the role of RANKL in mediating CNS dissemination of leukemic B-cell progenitors.']",

Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining, percent cells in sub-G1 cell cycle phase using PI staining and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using JC-1 dye, as well as flow cytometric and western blot measurements of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3.Results', ' Co-treatment with 1M AZD1208 and daunorubicin induced significantly more apoptosis than daunorubicin or AZD1208 alone (e.g., 65% vs. 25% and 7% in Ba/F3-ITD) in FLT3-ITD cell lines. At least two-fold increase in apoptosis was also seen when AZD1208 was combined with mitoxantrone, etoposide or topotecan, compared with each drug alone, but AZD1208 did not increase apoptosis induced by cytarabine. Chemosensitization of FLT3-ITD cells with the combination treatment was confirmed by a higher percentage of sub-G1 cells (e.g., 33% for AZD1208 and daunorubicin combination vs. 17% for daunorubicin alone in Ba/F3-ITD), more rapid loss of MMP and increased time-dependent cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Apoptosis was significantly (P<0.0001) rescued by co-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD. Cell lines with wild-type FLT3 were less sensitive to combined AZD1208 and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Finally, increased cytotoxicity of daunorubicin in the presence of AZD1208 was also seen in FLT3-ITD AML patient marrow samples, but not remission marrow samples.Conclusion', ' Our work supports clinical applicability of combining a Pim kinase inhibitor with chemotherapy to treat AML with FLT3-ITD.

        "Background":"['FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), a member of the class III tyrosine kinase receptor family, is expressed by immature hematopoietic cells, and highly associates with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While acquired resistance to selective FLT3 inhibitors, the treatment became inefficient. Many literatures suggested that dual FLT3-Aurora inhibition may overcome selective FLT3 inhibitor resistance, in part due to inhibition of Aurora kinase, and may benefit patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Thus, utilizing dual FLT3-Aurora inhibitors may be the viable therapy for the treatment of AML.Recently, our group reported a novel AURKA inhibitor by using high-throughput parallel synthesis and structure-based drug design (SBDD). Based on this, we wanted to modify the selective AURKA inhibitor to maintain its Aurora A inhibition as well as improve its FLT3 activity to develop dual FLT3-Aurora kinase inhibitors. Through rapid construction of the platform of FLT3 virtual screening, the lead was quickly and efficiently identified. Proceeding investigation of structure-activity relationship could lead to 6-phenyl pyrrolopyrimidine analogue, showing FLT3 inhibition with an IC50 of 101 nM as well as Aurora kinase A inhibition with an IC50 of 33 nM. To further increase the level of inhibition of FLT3, binding energy calculations and docking study of FLT3 model were introduced to select terminal groups of the side chain with high priority. The selected compounds were synthesized and evaluated the bioactivity. The dramatic antiproliferation of the dual FLT3-AURKA inhibitor against MOLM-13 and MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD (+) human AML cell lines) was observed, and its biologic mechanism of inhibition of FLT3 and Aurora kinase A was proved the by significant evidence of biomarker. For this finding, this novel inhibitor holds potential for further development of preclinical investigations as an anti-AML drug candidate.']",

        "Background":"['Pim kinase proteins (Pim-1, -2 and -3) are a family of conserved proto-oncogenes that are upregulated in leukemias and lymphomas and are involved with leukemogenesis. Pim kinase substrates include transcription, translation, cell cycle, and survival proteins. Increased Pim expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in FLT3-ITD activating mutation, provides a rationale to evaluate Pim kinase inhibitors in AML. AZD1208 is a small molecule pan-Pim kinase inhibitor [IC50', ' Pim-1 (0.4 nM), Pim-2 (5.0 nM) and Pim-3 (1.9 nM)]. AZD1208 treatment resulted in growth inhibition in AML cell lines including FLT3-WT (OCI-AML-3, KG-1a, MOLM-16) and FLT3-ITD mutated (MOLM-13, MV-4-11), with greater sensitivity measured in MOLM-16, followed by KG-1a and MV-4-11. The effects of AZD1208 on cell survival were investigated and there was limited apoptosis induction (<10% increase) in the AML cell lines evaluated as measured by flow cytometry and annexin-V/propidium-iodide staining after 24 h with up to 3 M AZD1208. This was consistent with a lack of decline in Mcl-1 protein levels, suggesting that growth inhibition is not through apoptosis induction. Preliminary data also indicated that there was limited change in cell cycle profile in OCI-AML-3 or MV-4-11 cells treated with AZD1208 for up to 72 h, suggesting that growth inhibition is not attributed to cell cycle arrest.To elucidate the mechanism of AZD1208, Pim kinase target protein phosphorylation was evaluated. With 3 M AZD1208 for 24 h, there was a decrease in Bad (Ser112) phosphorylation relative to total Bad only in KG-1a and MOLM-16 cells. Similarly, there was significant decline in histone H3 (Ser10) phosphorylation only in MOLM-16. However, several mTOR signaling pathway proteins were modulated by AZD1208. Pim-1 target PRAS40 (Thr246) phosphorylation decreased in KG-1a, MOLM-13, MV-4-11 and MOLM-16 within 6 h of exposure to 3 M AZD1208. Similarly, Pim-2 target 4E-BP1 (Ser65) phosphorylation decreased in all five cell lines by 24 h. Phosphorylation of downstream S6 (Ser235/236) was dramatically reduced in KG-1a and MOLM-16, and also declined in MV-4-11. Growth inhibition mediated by AZD1208 is similar in FLT3-WT (KG-1a) and FLT3-ITD (MV-4-11), however there is a varied response in Bad and S6 phosphorylation. These results indicate that although growth inhibition induced by AZD1208 is similar in cells with disparate FLT3 mutation status, the molecular events are divergent and may uncover signaling differences between Pim and FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD. Taken together, Pim kinase inhibition by AZD1208 may be a valuable strategy to inhibit AML cell proliferation even in hard-to-treat AML with FLT3 activating mutations, and these investigations will be used to identify biomarkers during clinical trial that may be predictive of response in patients. There is a multi-center Phase I clinical trial with AZD1208 in AML currently underway and investigations are ongoing.']",

        "Background":"[\"To date, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a poor-prognosis disease with only approximately 25% of patients surviving five years after being diagnosed (SEER  2005-2011). There are a wide variety of treatment options ranging from intense chemotherapy to targeted therapies. Beyond tolerability, identifying the ideal treatment strategy for each patient remains a difficult task. Mitochondrial profiling of AML patient samples using Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3) mimetics has proven to accurately identify patients that respond to several therapies in AML. In this method, cancer cells are exposed to BH3 mimetics designed to test for susceptibility to induction of apoptosis. The readout, called BH3-Priming indicates anti-apoptotic protein dependencies in cancer cells.In this study, samples from AML patients that were treated with at least one cycle of the hypomethylating agent, decitabine, at The Ohio State University were collected and BH3 profiled (n = 64). The patients were assessed for a complete response to the drug and were characterized by several molecular biomarkers including FLT3 mutational status. We found that the FLT3 mutation negative patients (n = 32) who responded to decitabine had significantly higher mitochondrial responses to the BIM and HRK mimetics (p = 0.04) compared with non-responders. We also found that FLT3 mutant patients (n = 12) had significantly (p = 0.02) higher priming than those patients lacking those lesions. Surprisingly, despite being apparently more predisposed towards apoptosis, these patients are less likely to respond to decitabine (42% versus 20%) in vivo than those without these mutations. This could indicate that additional non-mitochondrial inhibitory mechanisms are present in those FLT3 mutant leukemias that prevent response to decitabine.To further examine the interaction between FLT3 and mitochondrial priming, we profiled engineered cell lines with and without FLT3 mutations. We found that mitochondrial priming was significantly lower (p = 0.03) in BAF3 cells with unmutated FLT3 compared with five BAF3 cell lines containing FLT3 mutations (ITD and TKD mutations). Further, we examined the Broad Institute's Cancer Therapeutics Response database (CTRP v 2.0) for cancer cell line response to decitabine and found that wild type FLT3 cell lines that responded to decitabine had significantly higher mitochondrial priming than those that did not respond to the drug (p = 0.04), consistent with the patient data.Taken together, we have discovered that response to decitabine in AML cell lines and AML patient samples depends on mitochondrial dependencies and FLT3 mutational status. Genetic lesions in FLT3; however, may be able to over-ride mitochondrial responsiveness to pro-apoptotic factors, illustrating the probable need to measure multiple attribute types including genetics and ex vivo functional testing to accurately determine the likelihood of response to AML therapies.\"]",

To increase detection sensitivity of FLT3-ITD, we developed new detection algorithm using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. We validated results using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. We compared results of NGS data, nested PCR and conventional PCR methods.First, using whole exome sequencing data of 83 AML patients, we applied calling algorithm for FLT3-ITD. Briefly, to detect ITDs with NGS data, the reads are aligned to a reference sequence (UCSC hg19), with BWA which is a read aligner allowing soft-clipping. Some reads can be an indication of the occurrence of ITD and BWA aligns those reads as soft-clipped.Second, we deigned two types of primer for Nested PCR. The first primer was targeted wildly for between exon14 and exon15 of FLT3 gene. Nested PCR primer was deigned to target previously reported regions which are frequently occurred ITD mutation. PCR reactions of two steps were performed using the PCR primers sequentially.In these 83 patients, FLT3-ITD was positive only in 7 patients when tested by conventional PCR methods. When NGS detection method was applied, this resulted in positive FLT3-ITD in 11 patients (11/83, 13%). When validation was performed using nested PCR, FLT3-ITD was confirmed in all of 11 patients. Nested PCR detected additional 4 patient positive for FLT3-ITD in this population. For 68 patients, FLT3-ITD was negative by both NGS and nested PCR method. Overall, NGS method improved sensitivity of FLT3-ITD detection by 57% in this population. And the concordance rate of NGS method and nested PCR was 95.2% (79/83).Then we investigated clinical significance of sensitive FLT3-ITD detection. For this, we performed nested PCR and conventional PCR at the same time in 238 AML patients to detect FLT3-ITD. Positive rate for FLT3-ITD was 20% (48/238) and 10% (24/238) by nested PCR and conventional PCR respectively. When survival analysis was performed, among patients with negative FLT3-ITD result by conventional PCR, patients who showed positive for FLT3-ITD by nested PCR had shorter overall survival compared to those who showed negative for FLT3-ITD by nested PCR.

Currently ABT-348 is being evaluated (monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxic therapies) in the HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia xenograft model in vivo. Dose/scheduling studies for combination therapies in the SKM-1 and HL-60 xenografts are ongoing. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic biomarker analyses in these xenograft models were evaluated using phospho-H3 (an Aurora B substrate, proliferation) and cleaved caspase-3 (apoptosis) by IHC at various timepoints post single dose (1/2 hr to 5 days). A general decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis consistent with the mechanism of action was observed which coincided with the potent in vivo efficacy in xenograft models. Overall, ABT-348 is a potent, oral Aurora kinase inhibitor, demonstrating robust in antitumor activity in AML and MDS xenograft models with a good safety profile that warrants investigation in the clinic. ABT-348 is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials in advanced hematologic malignancies.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a heterogeneous group of aggressive myeloid malignancies characterized by the accumulation of blasts in the bone marrow. The prognosis of AML is variable, likely reflecting its diversity at a genetic level. The pathogenesis of AML has not been completely defined; however it is clear that recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., translocations and numeric abnormalities) and genetic events (e.g., point mutations and indels) are necessary for disease development. Genetic changes are diverse and consist of large genomic changes such as rearrangements and ploidy anomalies, as well as submicroscopic changes, including point mutations and indels. Few studies have correlated cytogenetically detected anomalies with molecularly detected mutations in AML. Here we describe our experience using a hematological next generation sequencing (heme-NGS) panel in conjunction with conventional cytogenetic studies to interrogate diagnostic AML specimens in a routine clinical setting. Next generation sequencing was done using a custom designed amplicon panel and Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA) capture. Using a customized bioinformatics pipelines we were able to detect single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertion/deletion (indel) to a lower limit of 5% with 100% sensitivity and specificity. 28 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies were examined including targeted regions of NPM1, FLT3, KIT, PTPN11, NRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, DNMT3a, EZH2, PTEN, CEBPA, TP53, WT1, RUNX1, TET2, ATM, BRAF, CBL, MPL, SF3B1, ASXL1, HRAS, KRAS, PHF6, GNAS, ETV6 and MYD88. Over 100 specimens were analyzed by NGS and cytogenetics , with only a single case being normal by both tests. Comparison of mutation-positive AML demonstrated more mutations present in cytogenetically normal cases, compared with those with chromosome abnormalities detected. Conversely, in 11 cases no mutations were detected by heme-NGS, with 10/11 of these cases showing recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. In those cases where NGS mutations were identified, comparison of cases with normal (CN-AML) and abnormal (CA-AML) cytogenetic studies demonstrated different mutation frequencies, with more mutations detected in CN-AML. Interestingly, TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in CA-AML and least mutated in CN-AML. These results illustrate the complementary information gained from NGS sequencing performed with conventional cytogenetic studies in diagnostic AML specimens, providing a comprehensive picture of the genomic landscape in this disease. A complete description of these combined cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities seen in AML and correlation with clinical features will be presented.']",

Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of sorafenib on FLT3 phosphorylation. Dose escalation began at 400 mg BIDx14days per month, and proceeded through 600 mg BID x 21 days per month. Plasma concentration of sorafenib and its primary metabolite sorafenib N-oxide were measured by LC/MS//MS method. The plasma inhibitory assay was used to measure target inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3 and phosphorylated Erk. Results', ' Fifteen patients (13 = AML, 2 = ALL) were enrolled (ages 37-85) and treated on three dosing schedules (400 mg BID x 14 d, 400 mg BID x 21 days, 600 mg BID x 21days) of single agent sorafenib. The maximally tolerated dose was 400 mg BID x 21 days per month. Grade 3 or greater toxicities were experienced in 55% of cycles, most common grade 3 or greater toxicities being fatigue (16%) and hypokalemia (13%). No patients met criteria for complete or partial response, but 11 of 15 (73%) patients experienced stable disease as best response, with 6 showing a reduction in bone marrow blasts after only one cycle, half of who experienced a >50% reduction in bone marrow blasts. Interestingly, 2 pts with FLT3-ITD mutations both showed marrow blast response (1 pt >50%). Sorafenib resulted in sustained complete inhibition of FLT3 and Erk as demonstrated in all patients assessed (n = 11). Importantly, this inhibition was maintained throughout treatment cycle and 3/5 pts had FLT3 inhibitory activity 7 days post their last dose. Correlative studies suggest sorafenib N-oxide is an active metabolite. Conclusions', ' Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of FLT3 with favorable PK and PD properties. Clinical activity as a single agent was limited to transient reductions in bone marrow blast counts and dose escalation was limited due to toxicities.

        "Background":"['Despite huge effort spent on understanding acute myeloid leukemia (AML), current standards of care are still based on the same chemotherapy agents as two decades ago - typically based on cytarabine chemotherapy with an anthracycline. Although patients aged <60 years may achieve remission to induction therapy, most patients will relapse. One of primary reasons for that is high heterogeneity of the disease. Recently one of the most extensively investigated approaches to the treatment of AML, are targeted therapies, especially inhibition of certain kinases. Probably mostly investigated up to date are inhibitors of FLT3 with most advanced clinical compound - AC220 (Quizartinib). FLT3 inhibitors are very effective in killing cancer lines with a major drawback of the therapy being fast development of resistance.PIM kinases are expressed in various cancers including AML but also other liquid tumors as well as in some solid tumors. Inhibition of PIM kinases which are downstream in the FLT3 signaling cascade have already shown influence on cancer cell survival. In addition there are great hopes related to the fact that PIM kinases were shown to contribute in resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. This leads to the conclusion that combined inhibition of PIM and FLT3 may be a rational strategy.Selvita has developed series of inhibitors combining activity against PIM and FLT3 kinases. Selected clinical candidate SEL24-B489 - has shown excellent anticancer efficacy.

AML patients who are administered myeloablative therapy exhibit a marked and transient rise in plasma FL concentrations. Furthermore, the presence of high concentrations (1000 pg/mL) of FL impedes the efficacy of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in vitro. However, the behavior of FL concentrations throughout the course of AML treatment remains unknown. This pilot study was undertaken to track the relationship between AML therapy and FL levels over time.  Methods', '  Ten AML patients were enrolled in an IRB-approved procurement protocol. Blood samples were collected at weekly intervals for one year, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. Plasma FL and stem cell factor (SCF) concentrations were measured by ELISA.  Results', '  We observed four distinct patterns in FL fluctuations. First, in all cases where induction or consolidation chemotherapy resulted in an aplastic bone marrow (nine patients), FL concentrations rose markedly and consistently to levels >1000 pg/mL following the administration of chemotherapy. Second, in three of four patients whose leukemia was refractory to induction chemotherapy, FL concentrations remained below 500 pg/mL during induction. Third, in two patients receiving the FLT3 TKI sorafenib, FL concentrations did not rise above 500 pg/mL while on this medication. Fourth, in one patient receiving the hypomethylating agent 5-azacitidine, FL concentrations remained below 100 pg/mL throughout the course of therapy. SCF concentrations did not vary throughout the course of chemotherapy.  Conclusions', '  An FL surge was seen when cytotoxic chemotherapy resulted in aplasia. This FL surge was not seen with sorafenib or 5-azacitidine. In addition, the FL surge was attenuated in three patients whose leukemia was refractory to chemotherapy. These observations give rise to two new hypotheses regarding FL', ' 1) It is possible to maintain lower FL levels with targeted agents than with chemotherapy; and 2) Residual leukemia appears to inhibit the FL surge, providing indirect evidence of cross-talk between leukemia and the stromal microenvironment. This inhibition may be the explanation for why AML patients develop pancytopenia early in relapse.']",

        "Background":"['Epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation are frequently altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Guadecitabine is a novel next generation hypomethylating drug with a demonstrated clinical activity in elderly AML. In our previous study of guadecitabine, we identified in relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML patients a gene expression signature (high DNMT3B, low P15, and low CDA) associated with reduced LINE-1 demethylation and resistance to the drug. Since pharmacodynamics only explains a small portion of the variability in response to guadecitabine, we suggest that intrinsic genetic and epigenetic characteristics can distinguish responders from non-responders. We analyzed genome-wide methylation patterns and screened 54 genes frequently mutated in leukemia in DNA from pre-treatment blood or bone marrow from 119 patients with r/r AML enrolled in guadecitabine phase I/II trials. Blood samples from 49 healthy donors were used as controls. We also examined expression of a panel of genes (CDA, P15, P21, DNMT3B, DNMT3A, DNMT1, and CTCF) at baseline by quantitative RT-PCR. Global DNA methylation at pre/post treatment was estimated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing of the LINE-1 repetitive sequence. For comparing methylation profiles at CpG islands (CGI), we performed hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially methylated 2794 CGI sites in 119 r/r AML and 49 healthy controls. Hierarchical clustering split them into 3 main groups of normal-like cluster (n=36), intermediate (n=41) and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) like cluster (n=42). Normal-like cluster had a higher response rate (39 %) compared to intermediate (17%) and CIMP- like cluster (15%) (p=0.025, Fisher’s exact test). Demethylation rate of LINE-1 was lower in CIMP-like cluster than in normal-like and intermediate cluster (average demethylation -19 ± 2 % in CIMP-like cluster vs. -31 ± 2 % in normal-like vs. -23 ± 2 % in intermediate cluster, p=0.0007, One-way ANOVA). Mutation screening revealed frequent alterations affecting signaling pathways (CSF3R, KIT, KRAS, NRAS and FLT3) in the CIMP-like cluster (62%) compared to normal-like (11%) and intermediate cluster (13%) (p<0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). High number of hypermethylated sites per patient was prominent in the CIMP-like cluster and associated with a four gene expression classifier z-score (low CDA, low P15, low CTCF and high DNMT3B) (R=-0.637, p<0.0001) as well as resistance to guadecitabine (mean of 4 gene z-score 0.54 in non-responders vs. 2.31 in responders, p=0.001). We propose that DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, mutations in signaling pathways and unfavorable gene expression signature can be developed as biomarkers predicting resistance to guadecitabine in r/r AML.

A number of genes and variants are known to have prognostic/predictive utility in several myeloid malignancies, allowing for more accurate stratification, and enhanced patient management. This has led to consideration of NGS for detection of somatic mutations in myeloid malignancies in the clinical diagnostic setting, to supplant single-gene molecular testing assays in current use. Building on our prior work establishing a novel mass spectrometry-based high throughput mutation detection assay for hematologic malignancies, we investigated the application of NGS to myeloid malignancy diagnostics. To do this, we validated the Illumina TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (54 genes, 568 amplicons) on 71 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patient samples, alongside relevant controls. NGS Libraries were prepared using standard protocols, and sequencing performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Concordance among NGS calls, single gene tests, and Sanger verification was tested as part of the clinical validation process.Analysis of 41 cases tested in our previously developed mass spectrometry assay indicated 100% concordance (70/70) for reportable variants mutually covered in both assays. Single nucleotide variations detectable in lab-standard single gene assays were all found by NGS (100% concordance). 58/71 (82%) cases had at least one additional potentially clinically relevant variant that would not have been identified in the existing assay (mean 1.95 additional variants/case; range 1-9). Additionally, we determined that AMLs carrying IDH1, IDH2 or TET2 mutations had a higher mutation burden (mean 4.6 mutations/case, range 2-7), compared to AMLs wild-type for these three genes (mean 3.1 mutations/case, range 2-4; p = 0.008). Clinically relevant insertions (up to 33 bp) and deletions (up to 52 bp) associated with AML and MPN, including FLT3 ITD and CALR deletions, were detected in known positive cases. In these cases, our analysis was supplemented with a custom bioinformatics algorithm allowing for alignment against an artificial reference sequence to detect larger indels. Due to low coverage of the clinically actionable CEBPA, we supplemented the NGS assay with Sanger sequencing for this locus. Therefore, we report the validation of an NGS panel for high throughput detection of mutations in myeloid malignancies, and the development of a wet-bench and informatics workflow enabling maximal information benefit in the diagnostic setting. This pipeline allows the detection of variants that impact diagnosis and patient management, with significantly improved information benefit over current tests.']",

FLT3 ITD is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (TK) that drives the activation of STAT5 leading to the growth and survival of AML cells. Although there has been some success in identifying TK inhibitors that block the function of FLT3 ITD, treatment options are still limited. This is mainly due to drug resistance development by mutations that allow for the continued activation of STATs. Since STAT5 represents a critical mediator of malignant cellular behavior and sits at the convergence point of many kinase pathways, the direct targeting of STAT5 may be an effective means of overcoming this resistance to TK inhibitors. First, we screened a library of potential STAT5 inhibitors for specific SH2 domain binders using a fluorescent polarization assay. Thereby, we identified small inhibitory molecules, called AC-3-019 and AC-4-130, that bind to the SH2 domain of STAT5, subsequently resulting in the disruption of the reciprocal STAT5-phosphopeptide interactions. They efficiently blocked kinase-mediated phosphorylation, dimer formation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding and STAT5 mediated target gene expression. Further, we observed a time- and dose-dependent impairment of proliferation, blocked cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis. Studies with human AML patient-derived samples similarly showed an induction of apoptotic cell death and decreased colony forming capabilities. A combinatorial drug screen revealed synergistic effects with TK inhibitors, as well as with drugs standardly used in the treatment of AML patients, e.g. Cytarabine. Finally, AC-3-019 and AC-4-130 significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo without general toxicity in healthy organs. Overall, our findings indicate that AC-3-019 and AC-4-130 are potent and selective inhibitors of STAT5.

The novel retinamide (NR) VNLG-152, targets translation by promoting degradation of MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks), thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. eIF4E aids in translation by recruiting ribosomes to mRNA, a process that is upregulated in AML with FLT3-ITD. The association of the eIF4E protein complex is the rate- limiting step in translation initiation. We characterized the effects of VNLG-152 in AML cell lines and patient samples with FLT3-ITD and with wild-type FLT3.Methods', ' Cell lines studied included human MV4-11 and MOLM-14, with endogenous FLT3-ITD expression, HL60 and U937, with wild-type FLT3, and Ba/F3-ITD and Ba/F3-WT, which are murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with human FLT3-ITD and wild-type FLT3, respectively.

        "Background":"['Depletion of bone marrow (BM)-resident myeloid progenitor cells is a consequence of various anti-cancer treatments, including bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibodies targeting myeloid cell antigens. Currently, aspirates are required to determine the extent of myeloid cell depletion in the BM. This procedure is painful and potentially invasive for patients. As a surrogate marker for BM myeloid cell depletion, we evaluated soluble FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) in non-human primates treated with myeloid cell-depleting BiTE antibodies. While FLT3L is not detectable in serum during steady-state hematopoiesis, it is detectable in response to hematopoietic deficiency. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship of serum FLT3L with depletion and recovery of BM myeloid cells in non-human primates treated with BiTE antibodies against CD33.Serum FLT3L levels were determined using an anti-human FLT3L ELISA kit. Validation studies demonstrated that both the capture and detection antibodies recognized cynomolgus FLT3L. Serum FLT3L concentrations were determined using a standard curve with rhesus FLT3L (99.6% identical to cynomolgus FLT3L). Serum samples were taken from cynomolgus monkeys before, during and after treatment with anti-CD33 BiTE antibodies and compared with the number of BM-residenttarget cells.In the first study, cynomolgus monkeys were dosed once with different dose levels of anti-CD33 BiTE antibody ranging from 1- 15 g/kg. BM-resident myeloid cells were transiently reduced in some, but not all, cohorts. Soluble FLT3L was detected only when there was a reduction in BM myeloid cells. When FLT3L was detectable, the serum concentration correlated with the extent of target cell reduction and FLT3L levels decreased as the myeloid cells recovered.In the second study, cynomolgus monkeys were dosed three times with anti-CD33 BiTE antibody. In these studies target cell reduction was greater and persisted longer compared to the single dose studies. Similarly, the magnitude and duration of increased FLT3L in the multidose studies was also greater. Within the multi-dose study, FLT3L levels continued to increase as more BM-resident myeloid cells were depleted, suggesting that it was possible to detect cumulative stress to the BM.In summary, serum FLT3L levels are correlated with the extent and duration of myeloid cell depletion in the BM suggesting that serum FLT3L levels reflect depletion and subsequent myeloid cell replenishment. All studies to date have involved treatment with myeloid antigen-specific BiTE antibodies; future studies will evaluate FLT3L levels following treatment with anti-lymphoid or solid tumor antigen-specific BiTE antibodies to determine if FLT3L increases are associated with myeloid cell depletion or indicative of general BM stress or inflammation. The potential benefit of this marker is that it could allow for repeat non-invasive BM monitoring in patients on myelosuppressive therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Despite huge effort spent on understanding the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), current standards of care are still based on the same chemotherapy agents as two decades ago - combinational treatment of cytarabine with an anthracycline. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is one of the most common genetic lesions in AML. Although FLT3 inhibitors initially exhibit clinical activity, resistance to treatment inevitably occurs within months. PIM kinases are thought to be major drivers of the resistance phenotype and their inhibition in relapsed samples restores cell sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors. Thus, simultaneous PIM and FLT3 inhibition represents a promising strategy in AML therapy. Selvita has developed a potent and selective first-in-class, dual PIM/FLT3 kinase inhibitor, the SEL24-B489 compound, and profiled its activity for in vitro and in vivo AML models showing significantly broader anti-tumor activity of SEL24-B489 than selective FLT3-ITD or PIM inhibitors. We compared SEL24-B489 head-to-head with a selective PIM inhibitor (AZD1208) and a selective FLT3-ITD inhibitor (AC220) in a panel of AML cell lines with FLT3-ITD or unmutated kinase (FLT3-WT) as well as peripheral AML cells and CD34+ bone marrow blasts. SEL24-B489 exhibited a significantly broader activity, irrespective of FLT3 status, than either of the selective inhibitors. Since PIM kinases have emerged as important mediators of FLT3-inhibitor resistance, we hypothesized that the dual specificity of SEL24-B489 might overcome the phenotype of resistance. We utilized previously developed MOLM-14 cells transduced with either FLT3-WT or FLT3 alleles containing TKD point mutations to show that neither of the these mutations decreased the cellular sensitivity to SEL24-B489. Higher cellular activity and biomarker response of SEL24-B489 than competitive inhibitors was shown by inhibition of specific biomarkers such as S6 and STAT5 phosphorylation at nanomolar concentrations in both FLT3-ITD positive and FLT3-WT cell lines in vitro. We have also demonstrated SEL24-B489 superior potency of SEL24-B489 in xenograft models in vivo. Consistent with the experiments in vitro showing marked synergy between SEL24-B489 and AraC, a combination of these agents resulted in almost completely blocked tumor growth in vivo. Most importantly, SEL24-B489 has been selected as a clinical candidate and is currently in phase I clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['With standard cytotoxic chemotherapy the majority of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) fail to achieve long term remission. Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) can catalyze methylation of arginine residues in target proteins like histones and P53. The epigenetic marks of PRMT5 on histones H3 (S2Me-H3R8) and H4 (S2Me-H4R3), directly lead to transcriptional silencing of genes. Overexpression of PRMT5 has been reported in hematologic and solid malignancies and represents a promising therapeutic target. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of PRMT5 enzymatic activity using a first in class, selective small molecule inhibitor BLL1 would result in antileukemic activity and novel methods to treat AML.PRMT5 was upregulated in AML-derived cell lines and primary patient samples. PRMT5 in complex with co-repressors like histone deacetylase (HDAC)s and DNA methyltrasferase (DNMT)s is involved in epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Using Co-IP assay we captured PRMT5 in association with DNMT3a and HDAC2 in AML cells, in which treatment with BLL1 (25M) resulted in disruption of this interaction. We confirmed the ability and specificity of BLL1 by detecting the loss of unique epigenetic mark of PRMT5, S2Me-H3R8. We previously reported that pharmacologic inhibition of DNMTs (by decitabine) and HDACs (by AR42) or the disruption of their repressor complexes (by bortezomib) can inhibit critical oncogenes in AML, KIT and FLT3, by upregulating miR-29b and consequently lead to better clinical response in AML. Similar to these epigenetic-targeting compounds, BLL1 upregulated miR-29b (>7 fold; MV411, FLT3 ITD+ cells) and resulted in downregulation of FLT3 RNA (>4 fold) and protein (3.8 fold). We examined the in vitro antileukemic activity of BLL1 in AML and demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (MTS assay) in AML cell lines (MV411; IC50=6M & Kasumi1, KITmut, IC50=11M) and primary patient blasts (#1, FLT3 ITD+, NPM1+, CD34; IC50=8M & #2, FLT3 ITD+, CD34+; IC50=7.5M). Colony forming ability was significantly decreased (p<0.001) in BLL1 (2M) treated AML cells compared to controls. We observed a BLL1-dependent increase in apoptosis measured by AnnexinV staining (25 & 50M, MV411; 8.6 fold & Kasumi1; 4 fold) within 48 hrs. BLL1 treatment promoted cell maturation measured by increased monocyte differentiation marker CD11b in AML cells (50M, MV411; 11.5 fold & Kasumi1; 6.8 fold) and primary patient blasts (25M, #1; 4 fold).In conclusion, our data suggest that inhibiting PRMT5 activity interferes with the production or activity of oncoproteins and, subsequently, disrupts leukemogenic and proliferation pathways in AML. Given the substantial antileukemic potential of PRMT5 inhibitor compound on AML cells and primary patient blasts, an assessment of therapeutic implications of this novel drug in vivo is highly warranted.']",

Low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) is superior to supportive care in these pts (Burnett, 2007). In a phase I study of sorafenib, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with FLT-3 inhibitory activity, in AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) pts we observed modest activity (Crump, 2004) which seemed more prominent in AML pts with FLT3 mutations. The NCIC Clinical Trials Group initiated a multicentre phase I/II study of the combination of LDAC with sorafenib in elderly pts with AML or high risk MDS. Methods', ' Eligible pts were age > = 60 yrs and unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy regimens. Phase I dose escalation proceeded in cohorts of 3 pts based on toxicity in cycle 1. Phase II was a Simon 2-stage design; 2/15 complete remissions were required in stage 1 to accrue an additional 17 pts in stage 2. FLT3 mutational status was determined in all pts. Results', ' 21 pts were enrolled', ' 4 MDS, 17 AML (9 with prior MDS). Median age was 77 (range 63-83). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was LDAC 10 mg bid days 1-10 and sorafenib 300 mg bid days 2-28. Further escalation was not possible due to fatigue, sepsis, diarrhea and skin rash at this dose. In 15 evaluable pts at the RP2D, 1 CR, 1 PR, 2 SD, 2 PD, 9 treatment failures were seen. Duration of response in CR, PR, and SD pts was 2.8, 3.9, 2.5, and 8.7 mos. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3- ITD) was found in 1 pt (this pt had the PR), and tyrosine kinase domain mutation (FLT3-TKD) in 2 pts. The CR was seen in a pt without FLT3 mutation. Conclusions', ' The study did not meet the prespecified criteria to complete the second stage of phase II accrual.

        "Background":"['FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are found in > 20% of pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, detection of FLT3-ITDs presents a challenge to NGS-based approaches, as many variant callers fail to identify the highly variable repeated sequences associated with FLT3-ITDs.We have developed a novel targeted assay, the Archer VariantPlex Core AML Panel, that utilizes Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) with probes in multiple locations proximal to exons 13, 14, and 15 of FLT3. These exons encompass the commonly mutated juxtamembrane domain and tyrosine kinase domain 1. This panel yields high-complexity, dual-strand coverage of known FLT3-ITD locations. Because AMP probes, unlike traditional PCR probes, function independently of each other, we are able to produce multiple overlapping snapshots of the region of interest, thereby enhancing the ability to confidently identify complex mutation types. The sequenced reads are assembled using a novel de novo assembly algorithm in the Archer Analysis bioinformatics pipeline, in which the resulting consensus is annotated and events that involve FLT3 exons 13 14 or 15 are marked as FLT3 abnormalities.In order to assess Archer Analysis and the VariantPlex Core AML panel, we tested it on >20 patient-derived samples with known FLT3-ITDs. In addition, we generated over two thousand in silico datasets, representing the spectrum of known ITDs, to further test our panel design and analysis algorithm. Each in silico dataset was constructed to simulate reads originating from probes in VariantPlex Core AML Panel. This methodology permitted rigorous optimization of both the VariantPlex Core AML Panel and the analysis algorithm.The VariantPlex Core AML Panel, in conjunction with our novel detection algorithm, showed both exceptional sensitivity and specificity in the detection of FLT3-ITDs. FLT3-ITDs were successfully identified in all patient samples tested, and no false positives were detected. Our in silico datasets showed similarly high sensitivity and specificity.These data indicate that AMP libraries targeting the FLT3-ITD region are ideal for the detection of this complex mutation type, largely because of the overlapping and anchored read structure. Therefore, the Archer VariantPlex Core AML panel, in conjunction with Archer Analysis represents a reliable platform for the detection of FLT3-ITDs, in addition to other mutations commonly found in AML.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionPacritinib, a potent clinical small molecule inhibitor of JAK2, it also suppresses signaling through wild-type and mutant FLT3, IRAK1, and CSF1R. Pacritinib does not cause marrow suppression and has demonstrated single agent activity preclinically in myelofibrosis and other myeloid neoplasms including AML and CMML. Stromal protection was not observed. However, the capacity of pacritinib to eradicate therapy resistant leukemia stem cells (LSC), residing in the bone marrow niche, had not been examined. Thus, we investigated the impact of pacritinib alone or in combination with standard of care therapy on primary blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC CML), myelofibrosis (MF) and AML LSC survival and self-renewal in a stem cell supportive niche.MethodsGenetically engineered mouse bone marrow fibroblasts producing human SCF, IL3 and G-CSF were used as stromal monolayers to support LSC survival and self-renewal. Human primary CD34+ cells were selected from BC CML (n = 5), MF (n = 5) and relapsed AML (n = 4) before and after clinical treatment with azacitidine. As a control, CD34+ cells from age matched normal bone marrow (a-NBM, n = 4) were used for the co-culture. Survival and self-renewal of the cells were investigated by colony forming and replating assays. Pacritinib was used at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 nM alone and in combination with 1 nM dasatinib.ResultsPacritinib alone induced dose-dependent inhibition of self-renewal in a-NBM, AML, MF and CML-BC, with the optimal concentration of 20nM leading to IC50 diversity in the response between normal and leukemia progenitors. AML and MF responded uniformly and inhibition reached 50% at 10nM concentration. BC CML cells were more divergent', ' 40% demonstrated >50% inhibition, in another 40% it was 20-50% and in 20% inhibition was <20%. Combined treatment with the low dose of dasatinib and pacritinib doses of 10 or 20 nM resulted in a significant (p<0.001, Anova) difference in self-renewal of all BC CML cells, raising a possibility of an additive/synergistic mechanisms. AML cells collected before and after clinical treatment with azacitidine uniformly showed a significant decrease in self-renewal starting with 10 nM pacritinib alone and combined treatment with dasatinib did not enhance the inhibition, suggesting a prospect of using pacritinib as a single agent in the treatment of relapsed AML.ConclusionsTogether these data indicate that possibly through inhibition of CSF1 and IRAK1 signaling in addition to suppression of JAK2, even in the presence of a LSC supportive niche, readily clinically achievable low nM concentrations of pacritinib alone are effective in reducing self-renewal of MF and relapsed AML. However, a combination of dasatinib and pacritinib is required to eliminate self-renewing LSC in BC CML with minimal toxicity toward normal progenitors. Targeting niche-dependent signaling could represent a robust avenue for treatment of refractory myeloid leukemia.']",

        "Background":"[\"The partial tandem duplication (PTD) of the MLL gene is a molecular defect in human myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and associates with poor patient outcomes, especially when other molecular prognostic markers are co-present such as the internal tandem duplication (ITD) of FLT3, i.e., FLT3-ITD. In human AML, MLL-PTD alters the epigenome via aberrant H3K4 methylation activity but is also associated with increased DNA methylation through an unknown mechanism (Whitman, et al, Blood 2008). Using a double knock-in mouse model of AML with Mll-PTD and Flt3-ITD, we analyzed the DNA methylome using a methyl binding protein (MBD2) pull down followed by next generation sequencing. Leukemic mouse bone marrow (BM, n=8) exhibited a 1.7 fold increase in global DNA methylation compared to non-leukemic controls (n=9, P=0.017). Consistent with this finding, DNA methyltransferases (Dmnt) 1, 3a, and 3b were overexpressed (1.5 fold P=0.03, 2.3 fold P=0.01, and 5.3 fold P=0.03, respectively). We previously showed that the non-coding microRNA 29b (miR-29b) expression directly downmodulates DNMT3a and 3b, but indirectly inhibits DNMT1 via miR-29b-driven SP1 suppression. In the murine Mll-PTD/Flt3-ITD AML, the precursor to the mature miR-29b (pri-miR-29b-2) was downregulated in leukemic BM (0.7-fold, P<0.001), whereas Sp1 mRNA was upregulated compared to wildtype (1.6-fold P=0.01). Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that also downregulates Dnmt's (Liu, et al, Blood, 2008) by increasing the expression of miR-29b (Liu, et al, Cancer Cell, 2010). In vitro, bortezomib induced a dose-dependent reduction in proliferation of Mll-PTD/Flt3-ITD leukemic blasts (MTS assay, EC50 23.83nM) and apoptosis. Prior to cell death in bortezomib-treated cells, expression of pri-miR-29b-2 increased by 1.7 fold over vehicle treated cells (P=0.01) while Dnmt3b mRNA (P=0.001) and protein levels decreased to half of the vehicle treated level. Targeting of this pathway in vivo using liposomal-bortezomib (1mg/kg IV twice per week for 2 weeks followed by 2mg/kg IV twice per week for 2 weeks) significantly increased survival of AML transplanted mice, compared with vehicle or free-bortezomib with 80% alive 90 days post-transplant (P<0.001). At day 90, treated mice had normal spleen weights (mean 86mg) and absence of leukemic blasts in BM, liver, or spleen compared to vehicle-treated mice that showed significant blast infiltration (mean spleen weight 396mg, P<0.001). Taken together, these data support the miR-29b/SP1/DNMT pathway of epigenetic modulation as active in Mll-PTD/Flt3-ITD AML, and indicate bortezomib as a valuable treatment option to be explored in patients with MLL-PTD/FLT3-ITD-associated AML.\"]",

The DSRT panel covered FDA-approved small molecule oncology drugs (n=120), as well as emerging, investigational and pre-clinical oncology compounds (n=120), such as kinase (e.g. RTKs, checkpoint and mitotic kinases, Raf, MEK, JAKs, mTOR, PI3K), and non-kinase inhibitors (e.g. HSP, Bcl, activin, HDAC, PARP, Hh). To generate dose-response curves, each of the drugs was applied over a 10,000-fold concentration range. In addition, the samples underwent deep molecular profiling including exome- and transcriptome sequencing, as well as phosphoproteomic analysis. DSRT provided consistent and reliable data from ex vivo samples with a high correlation between data from individual healthy BM samples (r=0.93). Bioinformatic processing of the data from AML resulted in several key observations. First, overall drug response profiles of AML blast cells were distinctly different from healthy BM controls suggesting several potential leukemia-selective effects, such as multi-kinase (dasatinib), MEK, and mTOR inhibitors. Second, the overall drug responses from AML cell lines and the patient ex vivo samples showed differences, suggesting that ex vivo testing may reveal cancer-selective effects not previously seen in established cancer cell line panels. Third, the response data from patient samples clustered many drugs consistently into the expected functional classes (such as topoisomerase II inhibitors, MEK inhibitors and rapalogs), whereas other drug classes were more dispersed (such as FLT3 inhibitors with quizartinib clustering away from all other tyrosine kinase inhibitors), suggesting secondary targets playing a key role in drug efficacy. Fourth, analysis of serial samples from patients developing clinical resistance to targeted agents showed striking agreement between the ex-vivo DSRT profiles and clinical responses. In conclusion, comprehensive DSRT platform generated powerful novel insights on AML drug response and may enable individual optimization of therapies, particularly for recurrent leukemias. DSRT will also serve as a powerful hypothesis-generator for clinical trials, particularly for emerging drugs. The ability to correlate ex vivo response profiles for hundreds of drugs in clinical samples with deep molecular profiling data will yield exciting new translational and pharmacogenomic opportunities for cancer therapy.']",

Pts ages 16 to 21 years (yrs) were defined as AYA. Results', ' Among 3,934 adult AML pts treated during this period, 163 pts (4%) were AYA with median age of 19 yrs. This cohort included 27 (17%) pts with Core Binding Factor (CBF)-AML [inv(16), t(8', '21)] and 19 pts (12%) with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Among the other pts, 50% had diploid cytogenetics, 11% had 5 or 7 abnormalities, 39% had other cytogenetic changes. Antecedent hematologic disorders were present in 33 pts (20%). Among 20 evaluated pts, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) was present in 4 pts and FLT3 kinase domain mutation was found in 2 pts. Complete remission (CR) rates were 89% for CBF AML, 79% for APL, and 75% for all other pts. Median survival for the total cohort was 1.7 yrs with 36% alive at 3 yrs, and median CR duration of 1.3 yrs (30% CR at 3 yrs). Outcome is better for pts with CBF leukemia (3 yr survival 56%, sustained CR 49%) and APL (3 yr survival 51%, sustained CR 36%) compared to other AML (3 yr survival 28%, sustained CR 24%). CR rates have improved from 71% in 1965-1984, to 85% in 1985-1994, and 83% after 1994. Similarly, overall survival (OS) has increased during the same time periods (3-yr survival 18%, 44%, and 53%, respectively) together with CR duration (3 yr CR duration 21%, 32% and 39%, respectively) as early mortality has decreased (11%, 8%, and 4%, respectively). To compare outcomes of AYA with older adults, we focused on those with diploid cytogenetics.CR for pts ages 16-21 was 81%, with 3 yr survival of 46%; for ages 22-45, CR was 75% and 3 yr survival 36%; for ages 46-60 CR was 68% with 3 yr survival 28%; and for pts age greater than 60, CR was 54% with 3 yr survival of 22%. Conclusions', ' The outcome of AYA pts with AML is significantly better than for older adults with AML. Despite the advances in treatments over time, there is still significant room for improvement, particularly among those AYA with AML other than CBF and APL.

        "Background":"['Background', ' B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Intensified and central nervous system (CNS)-directed chemotherapy has significantly improved outcomes for pediatric patients but are associated with late-effect morbidities. Moreover, 20% pediatric and a higher frequency of adult patients suffer relapses that are often fatal. Thus there is a need to develop therapies that target signaling abnormalities in B-ALL, which may reduce complications of CNS leukemia and decrease long-term morbidities. Rationale', ' Using a p53-/- SCID mouse model of B-ALL we observed pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR)-independent activation of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and found that it was crucial for the proliferation and survival of these leukemias. We then asked whether abnormal SYK activation occurs in human B-ALL and whether these cells are sensitive to small molecule SYK inhibitors. Methods', ' Viably frozen diagnostic B-ALL samples from children (n=54) and adults (n=42) tested for sensitivity to SYK inhibitors R406 (Astra-Zeneca) and BAY61-3606 in a short-term in vitro proliferation assay. Phospho-flow cytometry was also performed to quantify phosphorylation of SYK and other signaling proteins in B-ALL samples. The R406 pro-drug (Fostamatinib', ' Fosta) was used in a xenotransplant assay to determine therapeutic potential of SYK inhibition in vivo. Results', ' Phospho-flow cytometry profiling of primary B-ALL samples revealed prominent phosphorylation of SYK (Y348) and downstream signaling proteins that was decreased by SYK inhibitors. Furthermore, SYK inhibitors significantly attenuated proliferation of pre-BCR-negative and pre-BCR-positive B-ALL samples indicating that SYK was required for their survival and proliferation. In contrast, FLT3 or SRC inhibitors did not inhibit proliferation of pediatric and adult B-ALL samples. Importantly, siRNA-mediated SYK knockdown also reduced proliferation of B-ALL cell lines. Therefore, we tested the therapeutic potential of SYK inhibition using xenotransplantion. NOD.SCID.gamma C-/- (NSG) mice were injected intrafemorally with primary B-ALL samples (n=9) and fed chow containing either vehicle (AIN-76A diet) or Fosta (AIN-76A diet with 2g Fosta/kg). Leukemia burden was assessed 4-8 weeks post-transplantation. Mice given the Fosta diet had significantly reduced numbers of leukemic blasts in their injected femurs, other bones, spleens and CNS as compared to vehicle-treated mice. In addition, Fosta treatment reduced spleen, liver and kidney weight in ALL-transplanted mice. Conclusion', ' SYK signaling is vital to B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia survival; small molecule SYK inhibitors have therapeutic potential in poor-prognosis and relapsed B-ALL.']",

        "Background":"['Aberrant expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL is observed in many tumors including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). An obvious strategy for AML therapy would be to target the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. While compounds such as ABT-737 have shown promise for treatment of some malignancies, the compound binds poorly to MCL1 and thus cells that overexpress MCL1 usually display high resistance to the drug. Furthermore, ABT-737 activates ERK signaling resulting in MCL1 overexpression in surviving cells (Konopleva, et al, Leukemia 2011). The apogossypolone derivative -BI97D6 binds MCL1 and BCL2, BCL-XL, BFL1 with high affinities (Wei, et al, J Med Chem 2010). We recently reported that -BI97D6 (a) efficiently kills AML cell lines even in the presence of protective mesenchymal stroma cells, (b) interferes with the association between MCL1/BIM and BCL2/BAX, (c) stimulates BAX conformational change, (d) requires BAX or BAK for cell killing, and (e) does not induce ER stress. These data suggests that -BI97D6, unlike other gossypol or apogossypol compounds, acts mainly as a BH3 mimetic.In the current study, we first examined the role of MCL1 in -BI97D6-mediated killing. OCI-AML3 cells are extremely resistant to ABT-737 due to its high expression of MCL1. MCL1 expression was suppressed by lenti-viral shRNA in OCI-AML3 cells and knockdown of MCL1 protein by 80% was achieved as determined by quantitative western blot. Compared to cells with non-specific control shRNA, cells with MCL1 shRNA were greatly sensitized to ABT-737, and significantly sensitized to AraC, while -BI97D6, which binds MCL1 with high affinity, is almost equipotent in knockdown and control cells. Since results with AML cell lines have been promising, we examined the efficacy of -BI97D6 on primary AML samples. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that -BI97D6 potently induced apoptosis in AML blast cells at low nM concentration (EC50<50nM). -BI97D6 also effectively killed putative CD34+CD38- leukemia stem cells (LSC). Importantly, primary AML with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835 mutations showed similar sensitivity as those without FLT3 mutations (EC50<50nM). As FLT3 mutations are associated with poor prognosis in AML, these findings suggests that -BI97D6 can target AML LSC and could benefit even high risk patients. In summary, compound -BI97D6 may be a promising drug candidate for MCL1-targeted AML therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic cancer. Thirty percent of AMLs express mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3) that render it constitutively active. The internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of FLT3 is associated with poor clinical prognosis as it results in aberrant signaling leading to proliferation and survival. As such, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed against FLT3 are being developed. However, as with most TKI therapies, de novo and acquired resistance occurs. We have developed an isogenic cell line model of acquired resistance to FLT3 TKIs by treating BaF3/FLT3-ITD cells (FLT3-ITD) with lestaurtinib over time (FLT3-ITDR cells). Challenge of FLT3-ITDR cells with lestaurtinib showed >3-fold resistance to this TKI as measured by proliferation and propidium iodide sub-diploid analysis. In addition, we tested FLT3-ITDR cells for sensitivity to quizartinib, a more potent and selective inhibitor of FLT3, and found that FLT3-ITDR cells were 7-fold more resistant, suggesting pan-FLT3-TKI resistance. To confirm this resistance was specific for TKI, FLT3-ITDR and FLT3-ITD cells were treated with the histone deactylase inhibitor vorinostat and the anthracycline doxorubicin. Similar sensitivities were noted between the two cell lines to both of these drugs suggesting that resistance of FLT3-ITDR cells to FLT3-directed TKI is specific. Combination therapy is often utilized as a mechanism to overcome clinical resistance. Recently, proteasome inhibitors have been explored as an option for combinatorial therapeutics in leukemia. To determine if the proteasome may be a good target for combination therapy in FLT3-ITDR cells, the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity was measured in FLT3-WT, FLT3-ITD, and FLT3-ITDR cells. Chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity was significantly reduced in both FLT3-ITD (41%) and FLT3-ITDR (59%) vs. FLT3-WT cells. This activity stems from activation of the 5 subunit of the proteasome; therefore we performed western blotting with antibodies directed against 5. As seen with chymotrypsin-like activity, FLT3-ITD cells had a significant decrease in 5 protein expression (58%) compared to FLT3-WT. However, despite decreased proteasome activity, FLT3-ITDR had no decrease in 5 protein compared to FLT3-WT cells. One potential explanation for this result is that FLT3-ITDR cells have increased levels of inactive free 5 subunits compared to FLT3-WT. Future studies will examine the implication of these alterations. Despite these changes in proteasome sub-unit regulation and activity, all three cell lines were sensitive to single agent treatment with the reversible FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and its irreversible counterpart marizomib. As such, we will continue to explore the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in combination therapy for TKI resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease of the blood. About 30 % of AML patients carry an oncogenic mutant of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. Among the various mutations in FLT3, the internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain are the most common type of mutation, while point mutations in the kinase domain also occur. Although oncogenic FLT3 mutants are constitutively active, the wild-type receptor needs its ligand (FLT3 ligand, FL) for activation. Ligand binding to the receptor induces dimerization, auto-phosphorylation, and activation of the receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation sites on FLT3 constitute docking sites for interacting proteins that transduce pro-survival and proliferative signals. The so-called activation loop tyrosine residue (in FLT3, Y842) is well conserved in all receptor tyrosine kinases and long been known essential for the activity of some but not all receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently we have shown that activation loop tyrosine residue in KIT is not essential for its activation but plays an important role in receptor stabilization and downstream signaling. However, so far the role of FLT3 activation loop tyrosine residue remains unknown. We generated 32D cell lines carrying a Y-to-F mutant (Y842F) of FLT3 in either the wild-type or ITD background to study the role of this tyrosine residue. We show that the Y842 residue is not necessary for FLT3 activation or stability but is required for oncogenic transformation. We observed that Y842F mutation results in reduced cell viability, proliferation and in vitro colony formation in semi-solid medium. In addition, cells expressing the Y842F mutant in FLT3-ITD background display a significant reduction in tumor volume and weight in a xenograft model in nude mice. Gene set enrichment analysis (GESA) shows that mutation of Y842 causes suppression of anti-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phosphorylated Y842 is one of the binding sites of the protein tyrosine phosphataseSHP2, which is required for activation of signaling through the RAS/ERK pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that activation loop tyrosine residue in FLT3 plays an important role in the cellular transformation which is regulated by RAS/ERK signaling.']",

Here, our aim was to i) identify potential clinically used or emerging cancer drugs by quantitative drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) of 16 AML cell lines ii) compare the cell line data with results obtained from tested 24 ex vivo AML patient specimens iii) identify genomic correlations potentially explaining drug responsiveness.Methods', ' The cancer pharmacopeia-wide drug collection is composed of 119 FDA approved and 90 investigational chemical compounds including cytotoxic agents and cell signaling molecule inhibitors. Each drug was tested over a 10,000-fold concentration range and that has generated quantitative five point dose-response curves. AML cells were plated in 384 well plates (where the drugs were pre-printed using an acoustic nano-dispensing technology, Labcyte) and incubated in standard cell culture conditions. Cell viability was measured by Cell Titer Glow luminescence assays. Analysis of dose response curves using Dotmatics software resulted in IC50 values. Moreover, the genomic profiles of the AML cell lines were determined by microarrays and/or next-gen sequencing data for further integration with drug responses.Results', ' Comprehensive data analysis of 16 AML cell lines indicated that specific targeted drugs were selectively killing AML cells. The data analysis revealed relatively strong responses for MEK inhibitors in most AML cell lines (e.g. refametinib 87%, trametinib 82%, selumetinib 75%) while 21% of ex vivo AML patient samples were sensitive to these MEK inhibitors. In case of rapalog sensitivity, 80% of AML cell lines (e.g. temsirolimus 82%, everolimus 71%, sirolimus 81%) and 25% of ex vivo AML patient cases were responsive to the mTOR inhibitors. The AML cell lines carrying FLT3-ITD mutations were extremely sensitive to FLT3 inhibitors (e.g. quizartinib, lestaurtinib, tandutinib, and sorafenib) but very few responses to FLT3 inhibitors were observed in AML patients carrying an ITD mutation in the FLT3 kinase.Summary', ' Systematic DSRT profiling of AML cell lines illustrates drug sensitivity patterns to classify the cell lines as sensitive or resistant to specific classes of drugs. mTOR and MEK inhibitors were among the most effective inhibitors for most cell lines and also in some ex vivo patient cases suggesting that these drugs may have potential as therapeutic agents in AML. Also, bioinformatics predictions can be used to identify key synergistic combinations of tested drugs for effective AML therapy.

        "Background":"['BackgroundHypoxia is characteristic of almost all types of solid tumors and is an important component of the bone marrow microenvironment. It is an adverse prognostic indicator in cancer as it is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance. Cells may adapt to hypoxia in different ways; including growth arrest, stimulation of angiogenic factors, inhibition of apoptosis, induction of the ER stress program, or modification of the cellular energy metabolism. YM155 inhibits survivin gene expression by suppressing promoter activity and subsequent gene expression. The role of hypoxia and its clinical implications in childhood cancer remain largely unknown. Therefore, studying the drug response of cancer cells within a hypoxic environment is critical for the accurate prediction of patients response to therapy.The aims of the present study were (1) to perform screening of the effects of 5 molecularly targeted compounds on a large panel of pediatric cancer cell lines including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Ewings sarcoma (ES), osteosarcoma (OS), and neuroblastoma (NB), under normoxia and hypoxia, and (2) to determine the potential mechanisms of drug resistance under hypoxia.Methods and ResultsIn the present study the IC50 values were determined for the following targeting agents', ' linsitinib, picropodophylin (insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor), YM155 (survivin), AZD 8055 (mTOR), dovitinib (FLT3, c-kit, FGF4), and Palbociclib (CDK4/CDK6) in a panel of 15 AML, 4 ES, 2 OS and 2 NB cell lines using Cell Titer Glo assay. The effect of hypoxia was differential. It depended on the cell line and the compound used. However, hypoxia induced universal resistance to YM155 in all cell lines tested. YM155 had significant cytotoxicity in AML cell lines (IC50 between 2.5-1775 nM) in normoxia, however, the IC50 values in hypoxia were in the micromolar range, with an increase of > 100 fold. The effect of hypoxia on YM155 response in ES cell lines was less pronounced with (IC50s between 1-10 nM) in normoxia compared to (IC50 between 6 and 350 nM) in hypoxia. We studied the effect of hypoxia on the cell cycle using propidium iodide and flow cytometry in MV4-11 AML cells. Treatment with YM155 for 24 h in normoxia induced a pronounced decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase and G2/M phase and an increase in the sub-G1 phase. However, no change in cell cycle phases was detected under hypoxia. Ongoing studies are focusing on determining the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced YM155 resistance through studying the expression of proteins regulating hypoxia, cell cycle, and apoptosis using western blot.ConclusionThese data demonstrate that hypoxia induced different effects in a panel of pediatric cancer cell lines. However, it conferred pronounced resistance to YM155 in AML and ES cell lines. Hypoxia is likely a key factor in programming treatment resistance and, thus, relapse and poor outcomes.']",

Results', ' BMS 754807 induced apoptosis (Annexin V binding by flow cytometry) in MOLM13 cells (AML cell line with FLT3-ITD mutation and wild type p53) at 48 hrs at submicromolar concentrations, while OCI AML3 cells (p53 and FLT3 wild type) were resistant.

Western blot analysis confirmed reduction in FLT3, Akt, ERK, S6 ribosomal protein and GSK3 beta phosphorylation and increase in p53 levels in MOLM13 cells. Interestingly, apoptosis induction was not associated with caspase activation. Moreover, apoptosis induction by BMS 754807 appeared to be p53 dependent as MOLM13 cells with stable expression of short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA) targeting p53 (p53-shRNA) were resistant, while MOLM13 cells expressing scramble sh-RNA underwent apoptosis comparable to parental MOLM13 cells. Surface expression of IGF1R was comparable among parental and p53-shRNA MOLM13 cells. Apoptosis induction by BMS 754807 in p53-WT and FLT3-ITD cells was associated with phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. Conclusion', ' BMS 754807 has selective activity against AML cells with FLT3-ITD mutation and this activity is p53 dependent and associated with phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. Results suggest that IGF1R inhibition has therapeutic potential as novel targeted therapy for AML with FLT3-ITD mutation.']",

Detection of internal tandem duplication (ITD) in short-read sequencing data remains challenging due to deficiencies in short-read alignment where reads carrying signatures of ITD are often unmapped. Assembly based approaches collapse repetitive sequences, resulting in reduced or lost genomic complexity. The majority of structural variation detection tools are limited to finding insertions that are contained entirely within individual read alignments, and are unable to detect read-spanning duplications. Tools designed to detect large structural variation from paired-end reads that map discordantly based on expected fragment size and orientation do not provide the precision needed to detect ITDs. Only tools that consider the characteristic alignment features that signal the presence of ITDs will be able to detect them; these alignment features include', ' an excess of reads with unaligned, soft-clipped bases, read pairs where one end is unmapped located near the site of insertion, and read pairs where both ends are unmapped.We introduce ITD Assembler, a novel approach that searches all unmapped reads from exome capture or whole genome sequencing data to identify duplications. From the entire set of unmapped reads plus subset of mapped reads harboring soft-clipped bases, de Bruijn graph assembly is applied to select reads that form cycles, indicative of duplicated sequence structures. Reads from de Bruijn graph cycles are then assembled using an Overlap Layout Consensus (OLC) methodology thereby alleviating the collapse of repeat sequences affecting de Bruijn graph assembly approaches. Resulting OLC assembled contigs are locally aligned to the reference sequence to annotate the position of ITDs.ITD Assembler was run on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset, and FLT3-ITD detection rates were compared against orthogonal algorithms. ITD Assembler identified the highest percentage of TCGA FLT3-ITDs, reported significantly higher allele fractions, and discovered additional ITDs in the KIT, CEBPA and WT1 cancer genes.']",

Although, it is now feasible to perform single-cell RNA-Seq on thousands of, several challenges remain for high-throughput single-cell DNA sequencing. To address these challenges and enable the characterization of genetic diversity in cancer cell populations, we developed a novel approach that barcodes amplified genomic DNA of individual cells confined to microfluidic droplets. The barcodes are used to reassemble the genetic profiles of individual cells from next generation sequencing data. A key feature of our approach is the “two-step” microfluidic workflow that releases genomic DNA from cellular proteins prior to amplification. The microfluidic workflow first encapsulates individual cells in droplets, lyses the cells and prepares the lysate for genomic DNA amplification using proteases. Following this lysate preparation step, the proteases are inactivated and droplets containing the genomes of individual cells are then paired with molecular barcodes and PCR reagents. We demonstrate that the two-step microfluidic approach is vastly superior to workflows without the two-step process for efficient DNA amplification on tens of thousands of individual cells per run with high coverage uniformity and low allelic dropout of targeted genomic regions. To apply our single-cell sequencing technology to the study of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a targeted panel to sequence genes frequently mutated in AML including TP53, DNMT3A, FLT3, NPM1, NRAS, KRAS, JAK2, IDH1 and IDH2. Using this panel, we were able to identify clonal populations from AML research samples; moreover, the single-cell nature of our approach enabled the correlation of multiple mutations within subclones and determination of whether the mutations existed as as a homozygote or heterozygote.

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease with numerous signaling pathways that contribute to its pathogenesis. Advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AML pathogenesis and prognosis so far did not translate into significant clinical improvements. AML is still the highest unmet medical need within hematological malignancies area, particularly in case of the elderly patients. FLT3 inhibitors were investigated in the recent years as possible therapeutic agents, however to date the clinical trials of FLT3 inhibitors have yielded disappointing results. On the other hand, PIM kinases have been identified in the last years as critical downstream components of FLT3 signaling, especially in the case of oncogenic FLT3 mutants. PIM kinases are being overexpressed in a range of hematopoietic malignancies and solid cancers and the overexpression of PIMs is associated with a poor prognosis and decreased survival of patients suffering from cancer. In many cases also, PIM overexpression was associated with development of drug resistance. As dual and simultaneous inhibition of various pathway components is an emerging therapeutic idea, exemplified by several compounds in development for cancer treatment, we have developed a series of dual PIM/FLT3 small molecule inhibitors to investigate this concept. Similarly to examples of small molecule inhibitors from the JAK/STAT or PI3K/AKT pathways, where compounds are being developed as a way to improve efficacy, resistance development and overcoming the negative feedback loops, often seen after single target inhibition, we have observed increased potency of compounds developed in this series of dual PIM/FLT3 inhibitors. Synthesized inhibitors showed higher activity towards mutated FLT3 (FLT3-ITD and other FLT3 mutants) than wild type kinase and the selectivity profile on a panel of 450 kinases was comparable to best clinical examples of kinase inhibitors. In contrast to selective PIM inhibitors, the treatment with dual PIM/FLT3 inhibitors showed potent apoptosis induction as a results of Erk and S6 phosphorylation inhibition. The in vitro activity in FTL3-ITD positive cells was also confirmed in vivo in a PK/PD xenograft experiment, where sustained biomarker inhibition was observed already after single compounds administration. Oral administration of dual PIM/FLT3 inhibitors led to potent effect in vivo and in certain cases also to remissions in subcutaneous xenograft models. Observed activity profile and synergistic effects observed with other targeted therapies and standard of care compounds, makes dual PIM/FLT3 inhibitors an exciting approach for treatment of FLT3-mutant positive AML patients with high chances of clinical success.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) afflicts 12,330 new patients per year in the United States. Regrettably, only 25% of patients will survive five years past diagnosis. The most common mutation in AML is internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain of the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (Flt3), which renders it constitutively active. Flt3-ITD regulates proliferation and survival, and also increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as secondary messengers for oncogenic signaling. ROS can cause the induction of a number of molecules, however, one protein, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a well-known antioxidant, has been connected to both proliferation and drug resistance of various cancers. We hypothesized that Flt3-ITD-dependent signaling and ROS production increase constitutive expression of HO-1, leading to the activation of antioxidant and anti-apoptotic pathways, resulting in proliferation and drug resistance in AML. Western blotting revealed a two-fold increase of HO-1 protein in Flt3-ITD+ cells as compared to Flt3-WT; a four-fold up-regulation of HO-1 mRNA was noted by quantitative real-time PCR suggesting transcriptional control. To determine if this up-regulation was due to the altered redox status of Flt3-ITD+ cells, the flavonoid inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) was used. Consistent with published results implicating the flavonoid protein complex NADPH oxidase (NOX) as a primary source of ROS in these cells, DPI reduced ROS levels as early as two hours post treatment. This ROS reduction coincided with a decrease in HO-1 protein, suggesting that NOX may be involved in HO-1 up-regulation. Our previous results in chronic myeloid leukemia suggest that a Rac1-dependent isoform of NOX controls HO-1 expression, however, in Flt3-ITD+AML, dominant negative inhibition of Rac1 was insufficient to alter HO-1 expression suggesting that either a Rac1-independent NOX isoform is involved or that another flavonoid protein modulates HO-1 expression in this leukemia subtype. Interestingly, when HO-1 expression was knocked down using RNAi, there was a 50% reduction of proliferation and 40% reduction of viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion in Flt3-ITD+AML cells. These data suggest that the function of HO-1 up-regulation is to promote survival and proliferation of Flt3-ITD+AML. Additionally, we have created a model of acquired resistance to lestaurtinib, a Flt3 kinase inhibitor, by treating with increasing doses of the drug over time. Preliminary results suggest that HO-1 is further elevated in these resistant cells as compared to parental Flt3-ITD cells; thus, we will use this model to test the functional role of HO-1 in acquired resistance. Together, our data suggest that HO-1 is a growth and survival factor in Flt3-ITD+AML; therefore, targeting HO-1 or the mechanisms that control its expression may prove therapeutically valuable.']",

Although the activity of FLT3 inhibitors such as AC-220 is currently evaluated in phase II and III trials with promising results, some studies suggest that leukemic cells can develop various mechanisms of resistance including mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD).In the present work, we show that AML cell lines harboring FLT3-ITD mutation, MV4-11 and MOLM-14, are exquisitely sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Importantly, although bortezomib induced apoptosis in all primary AML samples (n=24), FLT3-ITD mutated cells (n=13) are much more sensitive than non-mutated samples (n=11). Moreover we observed a positive correlation between FLT3-ITD mutation load (measured by the FLT3-ITD/FLT3wt ratio) and bortezomib activity among FLT3-ITD samples (p=0.0084, r=0.719). At the molecular level, bortezomib induced autophagy, as shown by an increase of LC3-II protein expression and by electron microscopy analysis. This autophagy was mainly cytotoxic as cell death was inhibited by the autophagy pharmacological inhibitor, 3-methyladenine. Before cell death occurs, we observed that bortezomib induced a downregulation of FLT3-ITD both in cell lines and primary samples. Accordingly, cell signalling dependent on FLT3-ITD (ERK/Akt/STAT5) was inhibited upon bortezomib treatment. Others proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132 or carfilzomib were also able to downregulate FLT3-ITD protein level. Interestingly, 3-methyladenine restored FLT3-ITD expression and signaling after bortezomib exposure, suggesting a role for autophagy in the downregulation of the mutated receptor. Using confocal microscopy, we showed a co-localization between FLT3-ITD and LC3 structures after bortezomib exposure. Electron microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of the receptor in autophagy vesicles. Furthermore, the membrane trafficking inhibitor dynasore inhibited autophagy, cell death and degradation of FLT3-ITD induced by bortezomib. We also showed that bortezomib overcomes the resistance to AC-220 in a MOLM-14 ITD/TKD model, by triggering the degradation of the receptor. Finally, in vivo studies using a mouse xenograft model, confirmed that bortezomib was able to decrease FLT3-ITD protein level and inhibit leukemic cell growth.Altogether, our results show that proteasome inhibitors induce a downregulation of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase FLT3-ITD in an autophagic-dependent manner, suggesting that they could be used as an alternative strategy in AML with FLT3-ITD mutations.']",

This mutational heterogeneity arises because driver mutations target genes in signaling and regulatory pathways, each of which can be perturbed in numerous ways.We introduce CoMEt, an algorithm to identify combinations of candidate driver mutations de novo, without any prior biological knowledge (e.g. pathways or protein interactions). CoMEt searches for combinations of mutations that exhibit mutual exclusivity, a pattern expected for mutations in pathways. CoMEt uses an exact statistical test for mutual exclusivity that is less biased toward high frequency alterations than previous approaches and more sensitive in detecting combinations of lower frequency alterations. We compute the exact test using a novel tail enumeration procedure and also derive a binomial approximation. CoMEt simultaneously identifies collections of one or more combinations of mutually exclusive alterations, consistent with the observation of multiple hallmarks of cancer, and also performs simultaneous analysis of subtype-specific mutations. Finally, CoMEt uses an MCMC algorithm to sample from collections in proportion to their significance, summarizing the distribution in a marginal probability graph. We show that CoMEt outperforms other mutual exclusivity approaches on simulated and real data.We apply CoMEt to hundreds of samples from four different TCGA cancer types', ' gastric cancer (STAD), glioblastoma (GBM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and breast cancer (BRCA).

We apply this approach using four gene expression subtypes of breast cancer and identify several pathways that are enriched for mutations in specific subtypes including the PI(3)K/AKT signaling pathway in the Luminal A subtype.

Despite the power of next-generation DNA sequencing to describe AML genomes and to identify recurrent mutations, our fundamental understanding of the genomics of leukemogenesis is incomplete. Founder mutations in the majority of AML cases are unknown because pre-leukemic cells are clinically silent and are outcompeted by their malignant descendants. Our limited knowledge of founder mutations comes from infrequent cases of AML arising secondary to antecedent clonal bone marrow disorders or rare instances of inherited syndromes. Importantly, recent advances in AML stem cell biology now enable the prospective separation of residual non-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from AML cells. We previously showed that non-leukemic HSC contain clonal antecedents of AML in patients in long-term remission post-therapy, and have proposed a model in which serial acquisition of mutations occurs in self-renewing HSC. Here, we investigated this model and the nature of founder mutations through the genomic analysis of de novo AML and patient-matched residual non-leukemic HSC. Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations present in eight individual AML genomes (mean 10 mutations per patient) and screened for them in the residual HSC. We identified several mutations present in residual HSC that retained normal multilineage differentiation in vivo. These putative early mutations detected in residual HSC include NPM1c, mutations in TET2, and novel AML mutations in genes involving the cell cycle and mRNA biogenesis. Putative late mutations absent from residual HSC and only found in leukemic cells include FLT3 ITD and IDH1 R132H. Finally, through single cell analysis, we determined that as we hypothesized, a clonal progression of multiple mutations occurs in non-leukemic HSC. Quantitative genetic analyses of the HSC compartment enabled us to reconstruct the subclonal architecture of normal and pre-leukemic stem cells. Consistent with mouse models, pre-leukemic HSC with TET2 mutations outcompeted their normal counterparts. However, in most cases, normal HSC were 6-50 times more numerous than pre-leukemic HSC. In two cases where sequential populations of pre-leukemic HSC were identified, the less mutated pre-leukemic HSC population was 10-25 times more numerous than its more mutated descendent. This result contrasts with the classical model of a linear succession of dominant pre-leukemic subclones. These pre-leukemic HSC reveal the clonal evolution of AML genomes from founder mutations, suggest a potential mechanism contributing to relapse, and constitute a cellular reservoir that may need to be targeted for more durable remissions.']",

        "Background":"['Leukemia stem cells play important roles in leukemia initiation, progression, and relapse, and represent a critical target for therapeutic intervention. BMI-1 is essential for the self-renewal of normal hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells. High expression of BMI-1 has been associated with poor prognosis in AML. PTC-209 is a novel transcriptional inhibitor of BMI-1, which has been reported to exhibit antitumor activity against cancer-initiating cells in colorectal cancer. We investigated anti-leukemia effects of the BMI-1 inhibitor PTC-209 on AML cells. A total of 8 AML cell lines (MOLM-13, OCI-AML3, MV4-11, NB4, HL-60, U-937, MOLM-14, OCI-AML2) were treated with different concentrations of PTC-209 for 48 hours and the IC50 values (concentration at which cell growth is inhibited by 50% at 48 hours of exposure) and the ED50 values (effective concentration inducing 50% killing as measured by Annexin V positivity) were determined. The IC50 values were 0.38  0.07 M (mean  SEM), indicating high anti-proliferation effect. The ED50 values ranged from 1.2 to 2.6 M in 7 cell lines (1.97  0.22 M) and the remaining cell line (NB4) showed relative resistance to PTC-induced apoptosis (> 10 M). PTC-209 exhibited dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activities, by inducing G1-S transition delay and apoptosis. PTC-209 induced conformational change of BAX (i.e., BAX activation), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in addition to phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, indicating mitochondrial apoptosis. PTC-209 induced Annexin V in primary AML cells (23.4  4.6% after 48-hour treatment with 1 M PTC-209, n = 23) in a dose-dependent manner, which is more prominent in immature CD34+CD38- population (33.7  6.0%; P = 0.0036). In accordance with its high anti-leukemia activity, PTC-209 strongly reduced cellular BMI-1 levels in CD34+CD38- AML cells. Higher reduction of BMI-1 expression was positively correlated with higher susceptibility to PTC-209 in CD34+CD38- AML cells (r = 0.88; P = 0.047). The apoptotic activity was observed independent of p53 or FLT3 mutational status of the leukemia cells. Our data suggest that BMI-1 inhibition by small molecule inhibitors may be developed into a novel therapeutic strategy for AML. (Drs M. Andreeff and S. Kimura are co-senior authors with equal contribution to the work)']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' In the treatment of acute leukemia, much of the therapeutic effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is centered on engraftment of donor cells into the host, with a resultant graft versus leukemia effect. Work previously done by our group and others has shown the infusion of haploidentical stem cells in patients with acute leukemia results in a cytokine storm and exhibits an anti-tumor effect in the absence of engraftment. Whether the underlying clinical response was due to this cytokine storm or secondary to host or donor effector cell interactions was not determined. We present in vitro data collected from leukemia patients in which patient CD3+ cells are stimulated with randomly selected unrelated normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The stimulated patient CD3+ cells are then collected and tested for their ability to lyse leukemia cells from the patient.Methods', ' New leukemia patients were identified through standard pathologic diagnostic criteria. Patient samples were collected and separated into CD3+ and CD3- fractions. Patient CD3+ cells were then placed in a mixed lymphocyte culture and stimulated with mitomycin C treated unrelated normal donor PBMC. Cell proliferation was measured on Day 5. On Day 7, the stimulated patient CD3+ cells were collected and then cultured with Chromium 51 labeled CD3- cells, the bulk of which were leukemic blast cells. Cytolytic activity was measured through Cr51 release assays. Cell lysis was recorded as lytic units/million cells (LU/106), which is inversely related to the effector to target ratio at which 30% cell lysis occurs. Patient demographic data including sex and age in addition to leukemia type, cytogenetics, and molecular markers were recorded.Results', ' 10 total patients were enrolled in the study; 8 AML, 1 CML, and 1 CMML. 9 patients underwent ex vivo CD3+ stimulation with 2 separate donor PBMC samples while 1 sample underwent only 1 donor stimulation for 19 total assays. The average white blood cell count was 57,640 cells/uL (range 7,100-336,500 cells/ul) with 4-80% peripheral blasts. 7 out of 19 (37%) assays showed leukemia cell cytolytic activity greater than 1 lytic unit. All 7 successful assays were derived from patients with AML (Table 1).Conclusions', ' Patient CD3+ cells stimulated with random unrelated donor PBMC are able to generate a cytolytic anti-leukemia response in a donor dependant fashion. This cytolytic activity appears to be unrelated to host lymphocyte proliferation upon donor antigenic stimulation. Interestingly, of the seven assays with cytolytic activity greater than one lytic unit, four were performed in the two patients with known FLT3 ITD positive leukemia, which has a notoriously poor prognosis. Further studies to elucidate a mechanism of action for cellular therapy are warranted.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Separase overexpression defines a new subset of acute myeloma leukemia patients characterized by high CD34 and MYC levels.",
        "Background":"['The endopeptidase Separase, encoded by the ESPL1 gene, plays a key role in faithful segregation of sister chromatids by cleaving the cohesin complex at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Its overexpression associates with aneuploidy and bad prognosis in solid tumors. Little is known in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). We profiled the genomic landscape of 405 and 78 AML cases by SNP array (SNP 6.0 and Cytoscan HD, Affymetrix) and whole exome sequencing (100 bp, paired-end, Illumina), respectively. Bone marrow blasts from 61 patients were analyzed by gene expression profiling (HTA 2.0, Affymetrix). Separase expression was determined by Immunohistochemistry (1', '600 antibody dilution Abnova, clone 6H6) in 44 AML and 4 control bone marrow specimens. One patient exhibited a nonsynonimous mutation in ESPL1 (1.3%), which was predicted to alter the protein function. Moreover, ESPL1 copy number gain was observed in 5/405 cases (1.2%)', ' 2 hyperdiploid AML, one trisomy 12 and 2 cases with a short gain at 12q. Notably, protein level detection in one of the 12q-gain cases confirmed Separase overexpression. To determine the incidence of Separase overexpression, we performed Immunohistochemistry on additional 43 AML. Separase was overexpressed in 29/44 AML (66%, Separase-high), being comparable to control marrow biopsies in the remaining 15 samples (Separase-low). Sixty-two percent of Separase-high AML were aneuploid. However, no significative association was observed, as previously reported for mutations in the cohesin genes in AML. Separase overexpression correlated with increased patients’ age (median age 64 vs. 57 years, p=.01), 17-fold upregulation of CD34 (p=.004) and a trend towards reduced overall survival (6-years follow-up). Separase overexpression was not mutually esclusive with cohesin gene mutations, it co-occurred with NPM1 and FLT3 lesions and frequent mutations in genes involved in protein post-translational modification and ubiquitination (p=.04). Separase-low cases were enriched for mutations in RAS signaling pathway (NRAS, KRAS, NF1, RIT1, GRAP2, RALGDS; p=4.5x10-5) and in cell migration-related genes (LIMS2, S1PR1, PPIA, PLXNB1, FAT1). Separase-high cases also showed a defined transcriptomic profile, characterized by reduced expression of HOXA/B family genes, the DNA damage repair gene ATM, the p53 regulator MDM2 and forced expression of the cell cycle markers CDC20, AURKB, NUSAP1 and of MYC, independently of chromosome 8 gain. Taken together, our data suggest that genomic lesions targeting ESPL1 are a rare event in AML. However, Separase overexpression is a common feature and defines a new subset of AML cases with a distinct gene expression profile, which may benefit of innovative targeted therapies including CDC20 and bromodomain inhibitors.

        "Meeting_name":" Integrated genomic analysis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
        "Background":"[\"Hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive form of leukemia characterized by multiple whole chromosomal losses and very dismal outcome. Our previous genome wide study of hypodiploid childhood ALL cases treated by the Children's Oncology Group and St Jude, employed interrogation of DNA copy number alterations using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays, candidate gene resequencing and gene expression profiling using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. These analyses showed that this disease can be divided into multiple subtypes characterized by variation in the degree of aneuploidy, distinct submicroscopic deletions, sequence mutations and gene expression profile. Near haploid ALL (24-31 chromosomes) frequently harbors alterations of genes regulating Ras signaling (67.6%; NF1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, FLT3, and PAG1), IKZF3 (encoding the lymphoid transcription factor AIOLOS; 13.2%), and a histone gene cluster at 6p22 (17.6%), while low hypodiploid ALL (32-39 chromosomes) is enriched for IKZF2 (HELIOS; 52.9%), TP53 (70.6%) and RB1 (41.2%) alterations. A striking finding was exclusivity of Ras signaling and IKZF2/3 alterations, and biochemical indications of Ras pathway activation in both near haploid and low hypodiploid ALL. To further interrogate the genomic changes of hypodiploid ALL, we performed next generation sequencing using either Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq3000 sequencers on both tumor and matched remission DNA. Whole genome sequencing to at least 30 fold haploid coverage was performed on 10 near haploid and 8 low hypodiploid cases, and whole exome sequencing (Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50Mb) on 5 near haploid and 1 low hypodiploid cases. The burden of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertion/deletion (indel) mutations was in general low in this ALL subtype, with 0-5 indels and 9-95 SNVs in coding regions and untranslated leader regions in the whole genome sequenced cases, where the majority of cases had fewer than 30 SNVs. Further, the number of structural variations, including the ones too small to be identified by SNP microarray analysis, and structural rearrangements, were also low, with less than 25 structural variations identified in the whole genome sequenced cases. For the whole exomes, between 10 and 42 non-silent SNVs and 1-2 indels were identified per case. No recurrent alterations not previously identified in the hypodiploid cohort were found in these 24 cases, indicating that the initial genome wide study of this cohort identified the major recurrent alterations in hypodiploid ALL. However, the recurrence screening including the remaining 78 near haploid and low hypodiploid cases in our cohort on the alterations identified by the whole genome and exome sequencing study is ongoing. Altogether, these findings provide critical new insights into the genetic basis of hypodiploid ALL, and indicate that therapeutic targeting of the Ras pathway should be pursued in this disease.\"]",
