        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a category of T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas characterized by marked cellular pleomorphism, and expression of CD30. Two systemic forms of ALCL are defined by the presence or absence of chromosomal translocations involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23 locus. Among several pathways triggered by ALK signaling, it has been widely shown that the constitutive activation of STAT3 is strictly required for ALK-mediated transformation and survival.To discover essential mediators of STAT3 oncogenic activity that may represent feasible targets for ALCL therapies, we performed gene and miRNA expression profiling experiments in association with functional validation approaches. The transcriptome of STAT3 was analysed in ALK positive ALCL cell lines using a tightly controlled time course experimental condition, in which the STAT3 signalling was abrogated by an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA).Gene expression profiling analysis identified a selected number of genes (1730) specifically modulated by STAT3 silencing. A significant overrepresentation of putative STAT3 binding sites was found in regulatory regions of early down-regulated genes. Functional studies using a shRNA lentiviral library established that Interferon Regulatory Factor-4 (IRF4) targeting specifically affect cell viability of ALK+ ALCL cells. In contrast, forced expression of IRF4 partially rescued STAT3 knock-down sustaining the survival of ALK+ cells.In a parallel experiment, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling identified 48 miRNAs concordantly modulated by the inducible knock down of ALK and STAT3. Among these, we demonstrated that expression of miR-1792 cluster significantly reverted STAT3 deprivation, sustaining both proliferation and survival of ALCL cells.In conclusion, genes and miRNA expression profiling associated to functional screenings allowed the identification of new biologically relevant targets for ALK+ALCL. We speculate that IRF4 and miR-1792 cluster are involved in the lymphomagenesis of STAT3+ ALCL, and that their inhibition might represent an alternative avenue to interfere with ALK signaling in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas.']",

        "Background":"['ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)-positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) occurs predominantly in children and young adults. Their chemotherapeutic treatment leads to a 5-year overall survival amounted to 70-80%. The tumor relapses are often very aggressive and lethal and their underlying mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, there is still a need to improve current therapy. Crizotinib is the most advanced ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor already used in clinics for ALK-associated lung cancers. However, mechanisms of escape to crizotinib have been reported in cell lines and patients submitted to continuous crizotinib treatment. Thus, its use in frontline treatment for ALCL is hampered by the emergence of resistance. As autophagy has been proposed as a cell survival mechanism potentially involved in the acquisition of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor, we investigated here whether autophagy was activated during ALCL treatment. We demonstrated in ALCL that autophagy is induced upon ALK inactivation, as a pro-survival response. We found that different ALK inhibition approaches (crizotinib or ALK-targeting siRNA) combined with autophagy inhibition (chloroquine, 3-methyladenine or ATG7-targeting siRNA) compromised cell survival and cell growth. Altogether, our results suggest that crizotinib and chloroquine (two drugs already used in clinics) co-treatment could be beneficial for ALK-positive ALCL patients.']",

It may be sub-divided into cases with or without translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK), leading to overexpression of ALK. While the outcome for patients with ALK positive ALCL - particularly in pediatric patients - has been very favorable following doxorubicin-based therapy, ALK negative cases have fared more poorly. Approaches such as autologous transplantation have been studied in this group in an attempt to improve outcome (dAmore et al. J Clin Oncol. 2012).   Methods', '    23 patients with newly diagnosed ALK positive (15) and ALK negative (8) ALCL underwent treatment with 6 to 8 cycles of dose-adjusted infusional etoposide, vincristine and doxorubicin with prednisone and cyclophosphamide (DA-EPOCH).

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTIONAnaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) is a mature T-cell lymphoma. Depending on the presence or absence of chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK gene and hence the expression of ALK, ALCL is further subdivided into ALK positive (ALK+) or ALK negative (ALK-) types. NPM-ALK chimeric fusion oncogenic protein is found in around 80% of ALK+ ALCL, as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35). The current standard of treatment for ALK+ ALCL is combination chemotherapy. Crizotinib, an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only agent available to target NPM-ALK in ALCL. The identification of other targeting agents would potentially improve the treatment outcome of ALK+ ALCL especially for relapsed and/or refractory cases. In this study, we investigated the effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on NPM-ALK in ALCL.MethodsWe treated ALK+ ALCL cell lines with various clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3 (0, 0.5, 1 and 2M) for 24 hours and examined its effects on NPM-ALK mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by Western immunoblotting. The downstream signaling pathway of NPM-ALK, phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705, was also examined. Next, we analyzed apoptotic cell death and growth arrest induced by As2O3 in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL cell lines using Annexin V-7AAD staining and cell cycle analysis. The effect of As2O3 on cell viability was also measured with WST-1 assay.RESULTSOur data showed that As2O3 downregulated NPM-ALK at the protein level without affecting the transcription. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in all ALK+ ALCL cell lines. We also found that blocking protein degradation through proteasome with MG132 abrogated the effect of As2O3 on NPM-ALK. Furthermore, As2O3 induced apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and growth inhibition in ALK+ but not in ALK- ALCL cell lines, with a GI50 of less than 1M, which was a level achievable with clinical use of As2O3.CONCLUSIONS.Our data demonstrated that As2O3 downregulated NPM-ALK by facilitating protein degradation through the proteasomal pathway, thereby inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL. As2O3 may therefore represent a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL.']",

        "Background":"['Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for 10-20% of childhood NHL. The normal cellular counterpart of this malignancy is thought to be an activated T lymphocyte, based on the observations that tumour cells often exhibit clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements and possess cytotoxic granules containing proteins such as Perforin and serine protease, Granzyme B (GzB). Chromosomal translocations involving the ALK tyrosine kinase gene are the defining characteristic of this lymphoma. These translocations result in the expression of oncogenic ALK fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK), which are able initiate signalling events crucial for the pathogenesis of ALK+ ALCL. We have previously found that signalling initiated by NPM-ALK and the JunB transcription factor contributes to the phenotypic characteristics of ALK+ ALCL by promoting the expression of GzB. GzB is best characterized for its role as an effector molecule used by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells to kill virally infected and transformed cells; however, GzB can also be secreted from different cell types and has the ability to cleave extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Furthermore, GzB is expressed in some urothelial and bladder cancers and was shown to promote invasion of bladder cancer cell lines in vitro and GzB expression is associated with a greater level of tumour invasiveness in patients with urothelial cancer. Given these findings, and that NPM-ALK signalling promotes GzB expression in ALK+ ALCL, we hypothesized that GzB plays a role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy by influencing the interaction of ALK+ ALCL cells with ECM proteins. In this regard we hypothesize that GzB released by ALK+ ALCL cells can cleave ECM proteins which may affect the ability of ALK+ ALCL cells to adhere to these ECM proteins and may also promote tumour cell invasion. We have found that ALK+ ALCL cell lines express enzymatically active GzB that has the ability to cleave the ECM proteins, fibronectin and vitronectin. Furthermore, we have found that these cells also release active GzB and we are now examining if GzB expression influences adhesion of ALK+ ALCL cell lines to ECM proteins and whether GzB promotes the invasion of ALK+ ALCL cell lines in vitro. This work will determine if the expression of GzB is more than just a phenotypic characteristic of ALK+ ALCL, and whether this protein may contribute to the invasive potential of this lymphoma. If so, these findings may help to explain why tumour cells are found to be widely disseminated in ALK+ ALCL patients and murine xenograft models.']",

ALCL cells rarely express a T cell receptor (TCR), CD4 nor CD8 despite displaying an activated cytotoxic T cell phenotype (production of perforin and Granzyme B).

Crizotinib was the first clinically relevant ALK inhibitor, now approved for the treatment of late stage and metastatic cases of lung cancer. Several patients soon developed Crizotinib resistance, mainly due to the appearance of new point mutations located in ALK kinase domain. Currently, other ALK inhibitors are available and already in clinical trial, hopefully representing the second line therapy able to overcome Crizotinib resistance. In this work we focused our attention on the more potent phase I/II dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 (Ariad Pharm.), able to overcome the Crizotinib-resistant gatekeeper mutation L1196M. Two NPM-ALK+ human cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, were grown in four independent flasks in the presence of increasing doses of AP26113, so that eight cell lines able to grow in the presence of high AP26113 doses were selected.

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma (NBL) is a cancer of early childhood arising from the developing sympathetic nervous system. NBL tumors display a broad clinical and biological heterogeneity, ranging from highly aggressive tumors with fatal outcome to tumors with spontaneous regression. Recurrent mutations are mainly only observed in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), which is involved in the pathogenesis of both familiar and sporadic NBL. ALK encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with importance in neuronal development and was initially characterized in anaplastic large cell lymphoma from a translocation leading to the NPM-ALK fusion protein. Subsequent studies show that additional ALK chimeras have been generated with different fusion partners in various cancers. To date no ALK-containing rearrangement has been reported in primary NBL tumors although one study has describeda NBL cell line with an ALK intragenic deletion leading to constitutive ALK kinase activity. This led us to screen for and further investigate possible ALK containing translocations in our NBL material.Genomic profiling of 350 NBL samples though SNP microarrays indicated ALK-rearrangement in four primary tumors and two cell lines (IMR32 and CLB-BAR) which were further analyzed through targeted re-sequencing of the common MYCN amplicon region (Chr2;14-18Mb) and the entire ALK gene. Briefly, detection of rearrangements was performed through solution-based enrichment followed pair-end sequencing of 400-500bp libraries.Junction sites were identified by manual sequence viewing on IGV and validated through PCR followed by Sanger sequencing.With this strategy we were able to determine translocation sites for all but one sample. In one tumor ALK was found to be translocated to GAB2 (chr11q14) causing loss of the first exon of respective gene. However,ALK and GAB2 were placed head-to-head with respect to transcription direction and this novel translocation is therefore unlikely to cause a chimeric protein. Another tumor showed translocation between ALK intron 4 and chr 4 subtelomeric region without known genes. Two NBL cell lines and one tumor had both MYCN and ALK amplification and sequencing revealed high level complexity of respective amplicon with multiple rearrangements. IMR32 show involvement of at least six different 2p-regions including MYCN and ALK exon 3-4. CLB-BAR has also multiple rearrangements including an ALK intragenic translocation causing loss of exon 4-11, ultimately resulting in an ALK protein with truncated extracellular domain.Here we show that ALK translocation sites could be deduced from targeted re-sequencing without previous knowledge about fusion partner. However, no translocations resulting in chimeric protein were detected. We were also able to detect MYCN amplicon junctions, which are highly unique for each patient and could be used for detection of minimal residual disease.']",

Lack of representative cell lines and/or models has compromised the development of successful therapy.Toward this end, we report the generation and characterization of a group of novel ALCL tumor grafts. We implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) tumor tissue fragments, fresh or viable cryopreserved, from 11 cases of primary systemic ALCL (3 ALK+ and 8 ALK-) in six- to eight-week old severe immunocombined immunodeficiency NOD Cg-Prkdcscid/Il2rgtm1wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. A single leukaemic ALCL sample was injected i.v. or s.c.Six cases led to successful lymphoma growth within 6-12 weeks as subcutaneous solid spheroid masses constituted by a uniform population of large pleomorphic cells CD30-positive. All tumor grafts were re-implanted in recipient animals, in same cases up to 21 consecutive implants with an analogous time growth rate. Two cases, in the same way of the original human neoplasia, were early associated with concomitant enlargement of multiple organs. All tumor graft lines eventually showed disseminate disease with involvement of distant lymph nodes and of spleen (with homig in peri-arteriolar spaces), liver (initially observed within the sinusoidal spaces) and kidney. The morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation (expression of CD30, cytotoxic proteins and ALK) of the serially propagated ALCL tumor grafts demonstrated a high concordance between primary and derived animal tumors which showed highly stable profile along different passages from the early generation (T1) until the final ones (up to T16). The clonal relationship with primary and corresponding tumor grafts was confirmed by gene TCR rearrangement analyses and by ALK FISH studies.In addition we interrogated the model using gene expression profiling and single nucleotide polymorphism which established a close relationship among primary and derived tumors.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive CD30+ T-Cell lymphoma that accounts for 2-8% and 10-15% non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults and children, respectively. The currently used standard therapy for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK, a member of insulin receptor superfamily) positive ALCL has limited effectiveness, resulting in a substantial percentage of cases with poor outcome, either failing to enter remission or relapsing within a few months after starting the treatment. Thus, there is a clear unmet clinical need for developing novel, effective and safer therapeutic strategies for ALCL. Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is a nucleolar phosphoprotein, which functions as a molecular chaperone for proteins and nucleic acids. Approximately 50% of ALCL cases are positive for the NPM-ALK fusion chimera generated by the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation. The oligomerization domain of NPM1 in the fusion protein NPM-ALK, mediates the ligand-independent dimerization of chimeric protein, which results in constitutive activation of the chimeric tyrosine kinase activity leading to downstream signaling pathways responsible for the oncogenicity. Ceritinib is a second generation FDA approved ALK inhibitor for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Here we report the first preclinical evaluation of ceritinib growth inhibitory effects on ALK-positive ALCL cells. The NPM-ALK expressing ALCL model cell line SUDHL-1 used in our studies. Treatment with ceritinib significantly induced apoptosis dose dependently (10-50nM) in ALCL cells associated with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Mechanistically, ceritinib blocked phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream signaling effectors STAT3, AKT and ERK1/2. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that ceritinib induced G0/G1 arrest with concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases which was associated with decreased cyclin D1 and increased p21 expression. ALCL is also characterized by strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 (a member of the TNF receptor family). CD30 stimulation leads to NF-kB activation and the induction of anti-apoptotic mechanisms. In response to ceritinib treatment, flow cytometry data showed that reduced CD30 expression in a dose dependent manner. Altogether, these pre-clinical results demonstrate that ceritinib induces apoptosis in ALCL cells by inhibiting ALK downstream signaling cascade and support the rational for in vivo testing of ceritinib for the treatment of ALK positive lymphomas.']",

        "Background":"[\"Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, a member of the insulin receptor family, with a tightly controlled expression pattern. Deregulated ALK expression has been linked to the development of several types of cancers. Typically, chromosomal translocations involving ALK generate constitutively expressed chimeric oncoproteins, such as NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, activating mutations in ALK, and increased copy number that result in aberrant gene expression, have also been observed in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancers. Based on the above observations, several small molecule ALK inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials for a variety of tumors expressing this kinase. This has resulted in the use of crizotinib for the treatment of EML4-ALK + lung cancers.Recently several large scale immunohistochemistry and genome sequencing studies of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) revealed aberrant ALK expression. It was found that ALK mRNA expression was significantly different in alveolar (ARMS) and embryonic RMS (ERMS), the two major histological subtypes in children. Thus, ALK expression might play a role in tumorigenesis for this disease, and this kinase may represent a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS. To answer this question we analyzed ALK expression in a large panel of RMS cell lines, and pediatric tumor samples by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. We also compared the sensitivity of these cells to a series of ALK inhibitors. Our results indicate that the majority of ARMS cell lines demonstrated significantly higher ALK mRNA expression as compared to ERMS, and to normal human myoblast control cells. This was confirmed by western analysis. Growth inhibition assays confirmed that all RMS lines were more sensitive to crizotinib and LDK-378 than control lines, consistent with the hypothesis that ALK is a driver of cell growth in these tumors.Based on our in vitro analysis, we suggest that ALK inhibition may represent an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of ALK+ RMS. Preclinical studies to confirm or disprove this hypothesis are currently underway.Supported by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities\"]",

We treated ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, K-299 and SU-DHL-1, with various concentrations of everolimus and crizotinib at a fixed ratio of 1', '40 (0.5 nM, 1.0 nM, and 2.0 nM for everolimus, and 20 nM, 40 nM, and 80 nM for crizotinib, respectively). After 72 hours, the combination index (CI) values were less than 1 (0.596, 0.583, and 0.763 in K-299 cells, and 0.326, 0.616, and 0.271 in SU-DHL-1 cells, respectively) in all tested combinations, suggesting synergistic cytotoxicity of everolimus and crizotinib. Western blot analysis demonstrated that everolimus up-regulated phosphorylation of ERK Thr202/Tyr204 and AKT Thr308 and Ser473. However, this aberrant activation of ERK and AKT was attenuated by the addition of crizotinib. In addition, while everolimus selectively inhibited mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation, a marker for mTORC1 activity, the combination treatment more potently inhibited mTOR Ser2448 phosphorylation and decreased mTOR Ser2481 phosphorylation, a marker for mTORC2, as well. Cell-cycle analysis showed that the combination treatment induced G1 arrest. PARP cleavage was also increased after the combination treatment. To test the hypothesis that our findings could be applyed to other ALK-positive malignancies, we treated NCI-H2228, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that harbors an EML4-ALK fusion gene, with everolimus and crizotinib for 72 hours.

In summary, everolimus in combination with crizotinib synergistically inhibited the growth of ALK-positive ALCL cells. Crizotinib abrogated aberrant ERK and AKT activation induced by everolimus and more potently inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity when combined with everolimus, resulting in increased G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

        "Background":"['Background. Among the posttranslational modifications occurring in eukaryotic cells, phosphorylation is the most critical for proteins, as phosphate-mediated conformational switching of catalytic and non-catalytic motifs impacts expression and activity through changes in structure stability. Activation by phosphorylation is the rule for protein kinases, including oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK (nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase) in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas, though it renders the kinase prone to degradation. For several of them, however, the maintenance of functional stability is provided by the molecular chaperone Hsp90, through the recognition of specific motifs within the catalytic domain. Objectives. Herein, we determined whether NPM-ALK kinase activity facilitates Hsp90 binding, and whether structural motifs within NPM-ALK catalytic domain favor or impair Hsp90 interaction. Design/Methods. To test this hypothesis we prepared a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of wild-type NPM-ALK, as well as inactive point mutants by site-directed mutagenesis of the NPM-ALK ATP-binding site and activation loop. Results. Using NPM-ALK constructs in COS7 and 293T cells, we showed that Hsp90 strongly interacts with wild-type NPM-ALK, but fails to co-adsorb with inactive point mutants and with deletion mutants lacking the entire kinase domain. By comparison, binding to Hsp90 family members Hsc70 and Hsp70 is independent of NPM-ALK activity, suggesting a greater dependence of active NPM-ALK on Hsp90 function. Accordingly, phosphorylated NPM-ALK associated with Hsp90 and co-chaperone cdc37, and pharmacological inhibition of NPM-ALK prevented the interaction of NPM-ALK with both proteins. Of note, mutants unmasking the C-helix motif in the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain maintained the ability to bind Hsp90, whereas mutants lacking C-helix did not. Conclusions. Our findings, therefore, suggest a model in which, in addition to a role in folding nascent NPM-ALK, Hsp90 provides an ongoing folding support to activated NPM-ALK kinase, by protecting self-phosphorylated NPM-ALK from ubiquitination through recognition of specific unstable motifs within its catalytic domain.']",

However, the first mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib, have been reported and hampered its use for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL. Thus, despite the therapeutic success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments, acquired drug resistances universally develop. In this context, cytoprotective autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that cytoprotective autophagy is indeed activated shortly upon ALK inactivation in ALCL and that its inhibition enhances the anti-tumoral action of Crizotinib. A transcriptome analysis showed an increased expression of many genes from the autophagy machinery such as ULK1, MAP1LC3B, or ATG16L2 after crizotinib treatment in ALCL. Moreover, new preliminary results enabled us to identify a set of miRNAs differentially expressed in ALCL upon Crizotinib treatment. As miRNAs are known as fine regulators of gene expression, we anticipate that some of them could be efficient regulators of core autophagy genes expression. The aim of our study is to select a few miRNAs of interest and to confirm their regulatory role on the autophagic machinery.

ALK+ ALCL bears the t(2;5) (p23;q35) translocation in greater than 80% of cases, which results in the expression of the chimeric nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK. This leads to the activation of many different growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic pathways, including PI3K/Akt1/mTOR, Jak/Stat and AP-1. Recently, micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as tiny but potent molecules to regulate cell differentiation and proliferation. In a recent publication we have reported that miR-155 is up-regulated in ALK+ and down-regulated in ALK- ALCL. We have now identified an additional miRNA, miR-146a, that is significantly higher expressed in ALK- ALCL. Both miRNAs are strongly induced by T-cell activation. We report here that in ALCL cell lines that highly express miR-155 (like ALK- Mac1 and Mac2a) its target protein CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein  (C/EBP) is suppressed and moreover reintroduction of miR-155 in cell lines that have low miR-155 levels (Karpas-299, SR786, SU-DHL-1, SUP-M2) can actively down-regulate C/EBP. Conversely, high expression of miR-146a in primary ALK- ALCL FFPE specimens corresponds to low expression of its target protein IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1 in ALK - cell lines. Due to the known roles of miR-155 and miR-146a we assessed cytokine release in a set of ALCL cell lines with and without the ALK translocation. Interestingly, we found expression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, IL-21 and IL-22 in ALCL cell lines. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-21 and IL-22 were 4 to 10-fold higher in ALK- cell lines, whereas anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels were not related to ALK status. Reintroduction of miR-155 into the ALK+ cell lines Karpas-299 and SR786 was able to enhance expression of IL-22. To test the influence of miR-155 on ALK- ALCL tumor growth in vivo we injected 5x10^6 Mac1 cells with low (transfected with anti-miR) or high miR-155 (transfected with pre-miR) into the flanks of BALB/c mice.

In our efforts to discover pharmaceuticals with novel functionality, we introduced a neutral, stable phosphine oxide moiety as a unique hydrogen-bond acceptor in the design of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase first identified as a chromosomal rearrangement (NPM-ALK fusion gene) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and subsequently detected as an alternate fusion oncogene (EML4-ALK) in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Crizotinib, the first approved ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated impressive clinical benefit in EML4-ALK (ALK+) NSCLC patients. Drug resistance, however, emerges rapidly and point mutations within the kinase domain have been identified as a major resistance mechanism.

Although NSCs can be enriched in neurosphere floating culture with serum-free media containing EGF/FGF as a classical method, neurosphere is composed of not only NSCs but also differentiated and apoptotic cells. Therefore, we utilize the method for efficient derivation of NSCs with long-term self-renewal and differentiate capacity in adherent culture. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase first identified in a chromosomal translocation associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Subsequently, new ALK translocations were found in a fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and in other solid tumors. The function of full-length ALK is involved in neuronal cell differentiation, regeneration and synapse formation. Recently, gene amplification and mutations of full-length ALK were identified in neuroblastoma. Furthermore, it is reported that ALK and PTN, ligand of ALK, are required for maintenance of the stem cell population in GBM. Although constitutive activation of ALK signaling results in cell transformation, little is known about the tumorigenic mechanisms induced by activated ALK. We reasoned that ALK activity has a crucial role in GBM. To verify this hypothesis, human GBM stem cell lines were treated with crizotinib, ALK inhibitor. Crizotinib could suppress the proliferation of human GBM stem cell lines in dose-dependent-manner. Next, we have established a stable mouse model of brain tumor transplanting the genetically modified NSCs. Active mutant of H-RAS could transform the Ink4a/Arf KO NSCs but not WT NSCs. However, transplanting of WT NSCs transduced activated ALK could rapidly formed highly proliferative and invasive brain tumors. Histological characteristics of these tumors resembled human GBM phenotype demonstrating necrosis, perivascular cuffing and giant cell formation. Although the activated H-RAS increased expression of Ink4a in WT NSCs, but the activated ALK never changed.

Inversions are exemplified by inv(2)(p21;p23), which leads to the constitutively active oncogenic fusion protein EML4-ALK present in 5% of NSCLC. Crizotinib, a dual cMet/ALK kinase inhibitor, was recently approved by the FDA for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is ALK-positive, thereby validating ALK as therapeutic target. Here we describe the pharmacological characterization of a novel series of potent, selective and orally bioavailable ALK kinase inhibitors. Members of this series inhibit wild type ALK, NPM-ALK fusion and crizotinib resistant ALK[L1196M] kinase activity at sub-nanomolar concentrations, displaying up to 200 fold increased inhibitory activity over crizotinib. Kinase profiling indicate that members of this series display increased selectivity scores relative crizotinib. In Karpas-299 cells, selected compounds inhibited both pY1604 ALK activation (IC50 = 2 nM) and cell proliferation (IC50 = 1 nM). Members of this series were also evaluated in the EML4-ALK expressing NSCLC cell line H3122, and displayed equipotent inhibition of pY1604 ALK activation and inhibition of cell proliferation (both IC50 = 1 nM). Members of this class did not inhibit growth of an ALK negative lymphoma cell line (HT). The in vivo activity of this series was examined in the Karpas-299 ALCL xenograft model. Compound was dosed daily (PO) at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg. Tumor growth inhibition was observed at all dose levels, and the highest dose level resulted in significant tumor regression (96%, p<0.0001) without weight loss. The inhibition of pY1604 ALK was evaluated in these tumors (8 hrs post dose); >80% pALK inhibition was observed at the lowest doses tested, and complete inhibition was seen at doses of 30 mg/kg and above. In a direct comparison, members of this series achieved ALK inhibition in these tumors at a 15 fold lower plasma concentration than crizotinib. A PK/PD time course study was performed in the Karpas-299 model. A single 60 mg/kg dose of an inhibitor was able to maintain >90% ALK inhibition in tumors up to 24 hours post-dose, indicating significant tumor penetration and sustained ALK kinase inhibition. In conclusion, the described compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of ALK kinase, possess an impressive efficacy profile and drug-like pharmacokinetic properties.

        "Background":"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a type of T/null-cell lymphoma, represents about 20-30% of paediatric lymphomas and has an aggressive clinical course with frequent relapse. Recently, high-level expression of CSF1R on malignant cells in ALCL has been linked to shorter progression free survival, providing a rationale to test adoptive C28-mediated T-cell therapy. This approach encompasses the genetic modification of T-cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) named C28, a fusion receptor coupling the recognition of CSF1R on the tumour cell surface to the delivery of tailored T-cell activation signal provided by a fused CD28+CD3 endodomain. To optimize this approach for human translation, the C28 CAR was co-expressed with the chimeric cytokine receptor 4 (combination termed C4), which allows for selective expansion and enrichment of CAR-transduced T-cells using IL-4. PBMCs of healthy donors were isolated and activated using anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Following retroviral T-cell transduction and 14 days expansion of C4+ T-cells in the presence of IL-4, co-cultures with a panel of ALCL cell lines (2 ALK positive and 2 ALK negative ALCL cell lines) were set up to test C4 efficacy in vitro. Successful re-targeting of C4+ T-cells was confirmed by monitoring target cell destruction. Conditioned media was collected and analysed for IFN- and IL-2 production. Cytotoxicity, cytokine release and T-cell proliferation data demonstrated Ag-specific activation of the C4+ cells, which contrasted with T-cells expressing a control CAR with truncated endodomain. This data provides for the first time the basis for successful application of CAR-based immunotherapy against CSF1R-expressing malignancies.']",

        "Background":"['We have previously identified two phenotypically distinct cell subpopulations in ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ALCL) based on their differential response to a Sox2 reporter (SRR2), with reporter responsive (RR) cells being more tumorigenic and chemoresistant than reporter unresponsive (RU) cells. The regulation of the RU/RR dichotomy remains to be elusive. Our bioinformatics analysis of the SRR2 sequence suggests that cMyc may be an important factor. In support of this concept, we found a substantially higher expression of cMyc and more cMyc and Sox2-SRR2 probe bindings in RR cells than in RU cells. Inhibition of cMyc in RR cells significantly decreased SRR2 luciferase activity, and overexpression of cMyc in RU cells significantly increased SRR2 luciferase activity. Correlating with this, cMyc inhibition in RR cells significantly attenuated the clonogenicity and sensitized cells to doxorubicin; while overexpression of cMyc in RU cells conferred to the potentiated clonogenicity and chemoresistance. Importantly, we found cMyc not only maintains Sox2 protein expression, but also promotes Sox2 SRR2 probe binding and its transcriptional activity. Moreover, we found the highly active Wnt canonical pathway (WCP) contributes to the high expression of cMyc in RR cells. Intriguingly, we observed a positive regulatory loop in RR cells, in which Sox2 up-regulates Wnt2B, which can activate the WCP and cMyc. Furthermore, the significance of cMyc in this context was further highlighted by the fact that RU cells with stably transfected c-MYC are phenotypically similar with RR cells in terms of the elevated activation of WCP and increased tumorigenicity in vivo. Lastly, we found cMyc is heterogeneously expressed in ALK+ALCL tumor cells (n = 5) by immunohistochemcial staining, and it co-localizes with active -catenin, a marker of active WCP, in tumor cells by immunofluorescence assay. In conclusion, cMyc is a key regulatory factor in the determination of RU/RR dichotomy, which is linked to tumorigenic potential and chemo-resistance in ALK+ALCL.']",

        "Background":"['Activated Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is seen in several cancers, including 2-7% of non-small cell lung cancer and  70% of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). The most common ALK fusion in ALCL is a translocation, t(2;5)(p23;35), placing the kinase domain of ALK before the constitutively active promoter of nucleophosmin (NPM). Activated ALK drives oncogenesis by turning on multiple proliferative pathways. The success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in ALK+ lung cancer has prompted evaluation of their use in ALK+ ALCL as a therapeutic strategy for patients who fail combination chemotherapy. Clinical studies in lung cancer show resistance to these drugs limits progression-free survival. We aim to identify resistance mechanisms against approved TKIs, crizotinib and ceritinib, in ALK+ ALCL.We selected for resistance in 3 patient-derived cell lines through propagation in gradually increasing drug concentrations. We assessed resistant subclones with long-insert whole-genome sequencing, viability and proliferation assays, qPCR and western blots. Similar profiling was carried out upon drug withdrawal. We validated our findings in cytokine-dependent murine pro-B cells transformed with NPM-ALK during ceritinib incubation. We xenografted resistant clones to SCID mice and assessed tumour burden over time.Resistant clones showed viability stimulation by TKIs and when washed out of drug, these clones underwent apoptosis due to hyper-stimulation of ALK signalling. Genomic amplification of NPM-ALK was seen leading to an increased expression at the mRNA and protein levels. TKI-dependence therefore was co-selected with resistance, showing for the first time toxicity to cancer cells due to an overdose of ALK signalling. We validated our findings in IL3-dependent FL/5.12 cells, which also showed co-selection for drug resistance and dependence due to ALK over-expression. Resistant ALCL lines selected for ability to grow without TKI behaved similarly to parent lines, showing no stimulation of viability in presence of drug. ALK mRNA and protein also return to baseline in these cells. SCID mice injected with resistant cells required TKI treatment for tumour engraftment and tumour burden decreased when drug dosing was stopped. When tumours re-grew, drug treatment was reinitiated, generating a second response demonstrating in vivo that NPM-ALK up-regulation results in both resistance and dependence on the TKI and resistant cells die from an overdose of ALK signalling in the absence of drug.Our results reveal that up-regulation of the fusion-ALK drug target is a resistance mechanism, previously un-reported in any ALK+ cancers. Up-regulation of NPM-ALK provides cells means to acquire resistance but also results in ALK overdose when drug is withdrawn, revealing intermittent dosing as a potential therapeutic strategy to prolong tumour control in ALK + patients.']",

Most importantly, a specific small molecule inhibitor targeting BCL6 successfully suppressed growth of BCL6-dependent DLBCL cell lines and primary human DLBCL cells, further suggesting that BCL6 plays an important pathogenetic role. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been reported to target various oncogenic proteins, including PML-RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia, cyclin D1 in mantle cell lymphoma, NPMc+ in acute myeloid leukemia and NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, for degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

        "Background":"['Recently, over 80 cases of anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK)-negative, T-cell, anaplastic, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-ALCL) have been identified worldwide in patients with textured saline and silicone breast implants. These breast implant-associated T-ALCL cases are striking for their homogeneous clinical presentation and pathology that is distinct from established classes of ALCL. In order to understand the nature of this newly emerged clinical entity, we have established three new cell lines, designated T cell Breast Lymphoma (TLBR) -1, -2, and -3, from patient primary tumor biopsy specimens. Characterization of these pre-clinical models confirmed fidelity to the original tumor biopsy specimens and highlighted unique features that may aid the development of effective treatments for these cancers. Gene expression analysis demonstrated significant up-regulation of survivin and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes (BID, BAK, BBC3) by all TLBR cell lines relative to healthy donor T cells. This preliminary finding prompted examination of upstream regulators of cell survival in T cells, namely the interleukin signaling associated with the JAK/STAT pathway. TLBR cell lines were found to secrete high levels of IL-6 and IL-10, and were strongly positive for the cognate receptors. The TLBR cell lines also showed elevated levels of STAT3 and pSTAT3 by immunoblotting techniques, along with a simultaneous reduction in expression of the pSTAT3 phosphatase, SHP-1. These results implicate an unregulated autocrine STAT3 pathway present in the TLBR cell lines that strongly contributes to their tumorigenesis. Assays of various inhibitors of this pathway support this hypothesis since targeting of STAT3 with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sunitinib, led to dramatic in vitro cell death in all TLBR cell lines. More specific inhibition of STAT3 with S3I-201 had comparable results with Sunitinib. Furthermore, IL-6 neutralization by a monoclonal antibody or SHP-1 restoration by 5-azacytidine treatment also demonstrated moderate efficacy in inhibiting TLBR cell line growth in vitro. These discoveries strongly suggest the use of these reagents in the clinical treatment of Breast Implant Associated T-ALCL. The TLBR cell lines closely resemble the primary breast implant-associated lymphomas from which they were derived, and as such provide valuable preclinical models to study the unique biology and provide clinicians with improved knowledge for treatment and diagnosis.']",

The cell surface tyrosine kinase ALK (CD246, anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a promising target for neuroblastoma in that it is expressed in either native, mutated, or over-expressed forms on the plasma membrane surface of the tumor cell and may contribute to disease progression or severity. We identified antibodies that bind to extracellular domains of ALK, sequenced their variable regions, and used this sequence information to construct chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Primary human T lymphocytes were then transduced with retroviral gene vectors expressing a series of ALK-specific CAR. We tested CARs that incorporated both different structural and signaling motifs. Transduced T cells demonstrated ALK-specific cytolytic activity against ALK-expressing tumors and produced Th1 cytokines upon culture in the presence of tumor.

Using a xenogeneic NSG mouse model for neuroblastoma, human ALK-specific CAR-expressing T cells were found to eradicate ALK-positive tumor, when IL-7 was included to support T cell persistence.

The lead compound was subsequently tested against Crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations in enzyme assays, and was shown to inhibit the clinically relevant ALK mutations, including L1196M. In enzyme assays, it was inactive against G1269S mutation, consistent with modeling studies. Subsequent profiling in an FDCP cell line over expressing ALK G1269S mutation showed potent anti-proliferative activity, suggesting off-target activity. Further characterization of this series identified AurB inhibition to be a key cell cycle kinase responsible for the off-target activity in the engineered cell line. The off target activity hinders it from assessing the primary pharmacology responsible for its preclinical efficacy in disease relevant models. In conclusion, we have identified a novel orally bioavailable compound that is a potent dual active ALK and AurB inhibitor that is active against clinically-relevant gatekeeper mutant.']",

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma (NBL), the most common solid tumor of childhood, is an embryonal malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system. Human Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been identified as an oncogene mutated or amplified in NBLs. However, the role of wild-type ALK in NBL is still largely unknown. For better understanding a molecular event associated with ALK in the pathogenesis of NBL, it is necessary to clarify how ALK gene contributes to NBL progression. Previously in the analysis of NBL clinical samples, we have found that ALK expression is significantly high in MYCN amplified group. Consistent with this evidence, the developing tumors with NBL characteristics in MYCN-transgenic mice possess a high expression of ALK. In the present study, we have found that overexpression of MYCN induced ALK expression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN resulted in the downregulation of ALK expression in NBL and non-NBL cell lines. We have identified the promoter region of ALK, to which MYCN binds, in the upstream of the first exon from +30 to 350 bp and Luciferase reporter assay showed that MYCN overexpression enhanced the promoter activity of ALK. The site-specific deletion at MYCN binding site of ALK promoter region downregulated its promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated that MYCN can be recruited to the ALK promoter region, suggesting that ALK is directly regulated by MYCN. In general, high expression of MYCN is a well-known prognostic marker for aggressive progression and increases growth rate of NBL cells. However, the role of MYCN in enhancing cell migration and invasion has not yet been fully understood. We have further examined an effect of ALK expression in MYCN-induced cell migration. Functional assay revealed that overexpression of ALK enhanced NBL cell growth, migration as well as invasion. Moreover, these activities were suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ALK, indicating that ALK might be involved in the metastatic phenotype of NBLs. On the other hand, the forced expression of MYCN enhanced cell migration in MYCN-single copy cell line, SK-N-AS cells. Of interest, the increased migration by MYCN expression was suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ALK, suggesting that the cell migration induced by MYCN is at least partly regulated by ALK expression. Our present findings explore the fundamental understanding of ALK and help a future development of novel therapeutic tools by targeting ALK for aggressive NBLs.']",

        "Background":"['CD19 directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown clinical responses against B cell malignancies. However, CARs targeting other tumor-associated antigens have been less successful. Factors limiting CAR efficacy are not well understood. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a cell-surface protein overexpressed in a large fraction of neuroblastomas, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. We constructed MSGV1.ALK.BBZ retroviral vectors using single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences from murine monoclonal antibodies targeting ALK and transduced these into human PBMCs. ALK-CAR T cells lysed ALK+ tumor lines, but produced limited amounts of IFN-g and IL-2 upon co-culture with ALK+ tumor cells compared to CD19-CARs co-cultured with CD19+ targets. In order to identify potential differences between ALK-CAR and CD19-CAR induced signaling we employed a reporter system in which GFP expression was directed by an NFAT-responsive promoter and could be visualized by flow cytometry. T cells were co-transduced with lentiviral NFAT-GFP and MSGV1.ALK.BBZ or MSGV1.CD19.BBZ. Transduced T cells were co-cultured with tumor lines expressing ALK or CD19 antigen. GFP expression was induced within 4h of antigen exposure in double transduced T cells and persisted for at least 24h. The magnitude of GFP expression correlated positively with antigen density on tumor targets. Additionally, >50% of GFP+ cells retained CD19-CAR surface expression after antigen encounter. However, we observed drastically reduced surface ALK-CAR expression on GFP+ T cells after encounter with tumor targets. Upon further examination, we noticed that ALK-CARs were down-modulated from the T cell surface within 1h of exposure to antigen, and remained internalized for at least 24h. The magnitude of NFAT translocation in ALK-CAR T cells, as measured by GFP intensity, was also markedly lower than the magnitude of NFAT translocation in CD19-CAR T cells. These results suggest that limited numbers of CARs remaining on the T cell surface after initial antigen encounter may contribute to diminished ALK-CAR T cell efficacy, possibly by preventing temporal summation of repeated CAR signaling. Work is underway to prevent CAR down-modulation after antigen encounter, and to evaluate the impact of increased surface CAR retention on CAR functionality. In summary, optimal design of new CAR therapeutics requires a better understanding of essential factors limiting CAR efficacy. Through evaluation of a novel CAR targeting ALK, we have identified CAR down-modulation as one factor that may influence CAR-T efficacy, and may be amenable to modulation in order to improve CAR functionality.']",

        "Background":"['Genomic rearrangement of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) has been observed in several tumor types including 60-80% anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and 3-6% of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although the ALK inhibitor crizotinib has clinical efficacy in selected ALK positive NSCLC patients, the majority of patients who show initial responses eventually relapse. Various mechanisms leading to resistance have been proposed and include ALK amplification and resistance mutations, as well as alternative pathway drivers including EGFR, cKIT and, more recently, IGF1R. We have discovered a novel and potent inhibitor of ALK, AZD3463 with a Ki value of 0.75nM which also inhibits additional receptor tyrosine kinases including insulin growth factor receptor (IGF1R) with equivalent potency. AZD3463 inhibits ALK in cells as demonstrated by its ability to decrease ALK autophosphorylation in tumor cell lines containing ALK fusions including DEL (ALCL NPM-ALK), H3122 (NSCLC EML4-ALK) and H2228 (NSCLC EML4-ALK). Inhibition of ALK is associated with perturbations in downstream signaling including ERK, AKT and STAT3 pathways leading to preferential inhibition of proliferation in the ALK fusion containing cell lines in vitro. AZD3463 also demonstrates the ability to dose dependently inhibit pALK in xenograft tumors in vivo resulting in stasis (H3122) or regression (DEL, H2228). AZD3463 retains good activity against a number of clinically relevant crizotinib resistant mutations including the gatekeeper mutant L1196M where equivalent potency to wild type ALK is observed in vitro and in vivo in EML4-ALK containing BAF3 cell lines. To further assess the potential ability of AZD3463 to overcome additional resistance mechanisms, antiproliferative activity was assessed in multiple crizotinib resistant cell lines independently derived in vitro from H3122 cells as well as a patient derived crizotinib relapsed model. These resistant cell lines contain multiple resistance mechanisms including the L1196M gatekeeper and T115Ins mutations, ALK amplification and/or secondary drivers including EGFR and IGF1R. AZD3463 retains antiproliferative potency within 4 fold of parental H3122 cells for 10 out of 12 of these acquired resistance models in vitro. In summary, AZD3463 is a potent ALK inhibitor which inhibits additional kinases including IGF1R and has activity in a number of crizotinib resistant models driven by multiple resistance mechanisms.']",

        "Background":"['Most of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) cases carry the t(2;5; p23;q35) that produces the fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK. NPM provides an oligomerization domain that causes the spontaneous dimerization and ligand-independent activation of the ALK. NPM-ALK deregulated kinase activity drives several pathways involved in cellular proliferation and survival and sustains the process of malignant transformation. NPM-ALK is localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but the role of NPM-ALK cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions on ALCL phenotype maintenance is undetermined. We found that in all ALK+ ALCL cell lines and in primary ALCL NPM-ALK was equally distributed between cytoplasm and nucleus, but only the cytoplasmic portion, formed by NPM-ALK homodimers, was kinetically active and had transforming properties. The nuclear portion, formed by NPM/NPM-ALK heterodimers, was inactive. Thus, about 50% of the NPM-ALK fusion is sequestered and inactivated in the nucleus of ALCL cells by WT NPM1. Indeed, relocalization of NPM-ALK entirely to the cytoplasm in NPM-/- cells or its overexpression in several ALK+ ALCL cell lines resulted in cell death through activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and of -H2AX, a key player of the DNA damage response pathway. Thus, excessive oncogenic ALK signaling induces a cell stress leading to apoptosis and a balanced amount of ALK activation is necessary for optimal ALCL growth. Interestingly, we selected three human NPM-ALK positive cell lines resistant to the dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113. Resistance was due to genomic NPM-ALK amplification that caused overexpression of NPM-ALK and consequently hyperactivation of downstream ALK-dependent pathways. These cell lines were not only resistant, but also drug-dependent, meaning that addition of a low amount of AP26113 was required for cellular growth and to keep normal NPM-ALK signalling levels. Indeed, upon drug withdrawal, NPM-ALK and its downstream pathways were hyperactivated. The viability of all three drug-addicted cell lines dramatically dropped, confirming that an excess of NPM-ALK signaling was detrimental for cell growth. In two resistant cell lines out of three a new population recovered in the absence of the drug and was re-sensitized to AP26113. Notably, in these new drug-sensitive populations NPM-ALK overexpression was abrogated. All together, these findings support the idea that deregulation of NPM-ALK localization might be an attractive therapeutic option. Moreover, for a subset of patients that may develop drug dependency as well as drug resistance as a consequence of NPM-ALK overexpression, a discontinuous tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapeutic schedule may be more effective than a continuous one, as it is usually proposed.']",

Various ALK inhibitors are in clinical use for the treatment of ALK-NSCLC, including the first generation ALK inhibitor, Crizotinib, and recently the more highly potent Alectinib and Ceritinib. However, most tumors eventually become resistant to ALK specific inhibitors. To address the mechanisms underlying the development of ALK inhibitor resistance, we used iTRAQ quantitative mass spectrometry and phosphor-receptor tyrosine kinase arrays to investigate intracellular signaling alterations in ALK inhibitor resistant NSCLC cell lines. Src signaling was identified as an Alectinib resistance mechanism, and combination treatment with ALK and Src inhibitors was highly effective for inhibiting the growth of ALK inhibitor resistant cells in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase activation and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling was effectively blocked by inhibiting Src in Alectinib resistant cells. Finally, we showed that the combined use of ALK and Src inhibitors inhibited the growth of other ALK-NSCLC cell lines, including those that were Ceritinib or Lorlatinib resistant.

        "Background":"['Despite development of highly potent and selective inhibitors (e.g., ceritinib, alectinib, lorlatinib) targeting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), resistance invariably develops and limits the efficacy of these inhibitors in the clinic. The major classes of resistance are on-target genetic alterations (e.g., secondary ALK kinase domain mutations) and activation of alternative or bypass signaling pathways. While most patients are responsive to sequential treatment with two or more ALK inhibitors, ALK-independent resistance eventually emerges and leads to failure of further ALK-directed monotherapy. We used a synthetic lethal pooled shRNA screen to discover loss-of-function events that could sensitize resistant patient-derived cell lines to ALK inhibition. In addition to identifying known bypass targets such as FGFR, EGFR and SRC, we also identified PTPN11 (which encodes SHP2, a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that modulates signaling downstream of growth factor receptors) as a common hit shared by cell lines exhibiting different mechanisms of bypass activation. In parallel with the shRNA screen, we also performed a high throughput combination compound screen in the same patient-derived models, and identified activation of the same bypass signaling pathways. We showed that the highly potent and selective small-molecule SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 could sensitize resistant cell lines to ALK inhibition. In biochemical studies, co-targeting of ALK and SHP2 overcame resistance mediated by ALK-independent bypass mechanisms by decreasing RAS-GTP loading potential of cells and inhibiting phospho-ERK rebound. These results suggest that dual ALK and SHP2 inhibition may represent a new therapeutic strategy for ALK-positive patients, whose lung cancers have evolved ALK-independent mechanisms of resistance, including activation of bypass signaling pathways.']",

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is mutationally activated in a subset of primary neuroblastomas, including those with MYCN gene amplification, suggesting pathogenic cooperation. Because the mechanism underlying this cooperation is unclear, we generated a novel transgenic zebrafish model that overexpresses human MYCN and activated ALK in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system to analyze their interaction. The expression of MYCN in this model induces neuroblastomas in the inter-renal gland, the zebrafish analogue of the adrenal medulla, which is the site of origin observed in approximately half of childhood neuroblastomas. Furthermore, the tumors resemble human neuroblastomas histologically, immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Concomitant expression of activated ALK with MYCN in this model profoundly accelerates the onset of neuroblastoma and markedly increases disease penetrance. Detailed in vivo analyses show that MYCN overexpression induces adrenal sympathetic neuroblast hyperplasia, blocks chromaffin cell differentiation, and triggers a developmentally-timed apoptotic response in the hyperplastic sympathoadrenal cells. Coexpression of activated ALK with MYCN provides prosurvival signals that block this apoptotic response and allow continued expansion and oncogenic transformation of hyperplastic neuroblasts. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanism for the synergistic interplay of MYCN with activated ALK in neuroblastoma pathogenesis and demonstrate the utility of the zebrafish model in understanding human disease processes that may aid the development of improved therapeutic strategies.']",

Approximately 4-7% of NSCLCs carry the EML4-ALK chromosomal rearrangement. We identified overexpression of EGFR and c-MET in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cell lines H3122 and H2228. ALK, EGFR, and c-MET may function cooperatively to modulate tumor growth, stress response, and survival in EML4-ALK-positive cells and co-inhibition may favorably impact tumor control. We therefore investigated the effects of co-inhibition of ALK and EGFR or c-MET on cell survival and response to radiation in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cells.Compared with ALK-negative cell lines (H226, A549 and H520), the ALK-positive cell lines (H3122, H2228) were highly sensitive to the ALK inhibitors crizotinb, ceritinib and alectinib, although with differing sensitivity to radiation. Crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib sensitized H3122 and H2228 to radiation, as evaluated by clonogenic assay. However, knockdown of ALK by siRNA in H3122 and H2228, or overexpression of EML4-ALK in NIH-3T3 cells, had only moderate effects on radiosensitivity. Simultaneous knockdown of ALK and MET, or ALK and EGFR, increased radiosensitivity as assessed by clonogenic survival in H3122 and H2228 cells, while also increasing inhibitory effects on cell growth and proliferation. These results were confirmed in cells treated with the combination of ceritinib and su11274 (c-MET inhibitor) or with ceritinib and erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor). We further assessed the impact of drug alone or in combination with radiation on cell cycle, cell survival and DNA damage repair pathways. To further evaluate ALK function in the cellular response to radiation in NSCLC, we are developing EML4-ALK stable expression cell lines. Evaluation of drug-radiation interactions in xenograft model systems are also under consideration.These data indicate that co-inhibition of ALK and EGFR or c-MET can enhance growth inhibitory effects in ALK-positive cells and augment radiosensitivity in-vitro, suggesting the potential value for ALK inhibitors combined with EGFR/c-MET-targeting for therapeutic benefit in ALK-positive NSCLC patients with or without radiation.']",

        "Background":"['Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements are sensitive to the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. However, these cancers invariably relapse due to the development of resistance, and approximately 1/3 of such cancers develop resistance mutations within the ALK tyrosine kinase domain. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI, LDK378 in the setting of crizotinib resistance. Using EML4-ALK mutant Ba/F3 cellular models, in vivo models of acquired resistance to crizotinib, and novel cell lines established from biopsies of crizotinib-resistant NSCLC patients, we have examined the efficacy of LDK378 in crizotinib-nave and -resistant ALK-positive cancers. These studies reveal that LDK378 is more potent than crizotinib and effectively overcomes resistance in vitro and in vivo. In particular, LDK378 inhibits ALK harboring crizotinib resistance mutations, including L1196M, G1269A, I1171T and S1206Y. Cell lines derived from crizotinib-resistant biopsies were sensitive to LDK378, including one that did not harbor an ALK resistance mutation and was also sensitive to crizotinib, suggesting that some crizotinib-resistant cancers with wildtype ALK are still sensitive to complete ALK inhibition. We observed that LDK378 did not effectively overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174CALK, and mutations in one of these residues was identified in 5 out of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to LDK378. Altogether our results demonstrate that LDK378 can overcome many mechanisms of crizotinib resistance, consistent with emerging clinical data showing marked efficacy of LDK378 in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.']",

        "Background":"[\"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric solid tumor that can be stratified into stroma-rich and stroma-poor histological subgroups. The stromal compartment of neuroblastoma is composed mostly of Schwann cells and they play critical roles in the differentiation, survival and angiogenic responses of tumor cells. In certain neuroblastoma cell lines, the coexistence of neuroblastic N-type and substrate-adherent S-type is frequently observed. One such cell line, SK-N-SH, harbors a F1174L oncogenic mutation in the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. Treatment of SK-N-SH with an ALK chemical inhibitor, TAE684, resulted in the outgrowth of S-type cells that expressed the Schwann cell marker, S1006. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of these TAE684-resistant (TR) sublines revealed the presence of the ALK F1174L mutation suggesting their tumor origin, although ALK protein was not detected. Consistent with these findings, TR cells displayed 9-fold higher IC50 values than N-type cells. Also, unlike N-type cells, TR cells have readily detectable phosphorylated STAT3 but weaker phosphorylated AKT. Under co-culture conditions, TR cells conferred survival to N-type cells against the apoptotic effect of TAE684. Co-cultivation also greatly enhanced the overall phosphorylation of STAT3 and its transcriptional activity in N-type cells. Finally, conditioned medium from TR clones enhanced cell viability of N-type cells and this effect was Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase-dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of tumor-derived S-type cells in protecting N-type cells against the apoptotic effect of an ALK kinase inhibitor through upregulating pro-survival signaling.

Anti-proliferative effect was seen in the majority of the cell lines. The median IC50s, calculated at 72h, were', ' DLBCL, 0.19M (range 0.07-12.68); ALCL, 0.48M (0.04-9.1); SMZL, 0.16M (0.1-0.24); MM, 0.45M (0.06-0.7); MCL, 2M (1.22- >15). There were apparently no IC50 differences based on the cell of origin (DLBCL) or ALK-positivity status (ALCL). Apoptosis did not appear as the main effect of the drug, being not observed in 11 cell lines treated with the IC50 defined by MTT test after 72-hour exposure. However, OTX105 determined a dose-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest in 12/12 cell lines (DLBCL, MM and ALCL), and an increased percentage of senescent cells in 3/3 sensitive cell lines (DLBCL and ALCL).MYC mRNA was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in 4/5 DLBCL, 4/4 ALCL and 2/2 MM cell lines. Down-regulation was usually seen within 1h. Real-time PCR showed that MYC and also NFKB target genes were affected. Gene expression profiling (GEP), using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip array, was done in 3 sensitive DLBCL cell lines, exposed to DMSO or OTX015 (0.5M) for 4h and 8h. MYC was the most down-regulated gene. Functional annotation of the down-regulated genes identified an over-representation of genes involved in RNA and DNA metabolism and cell cycle, putative MYC target genes and transcripts reported as down-regulated after treatment with aminopeptidase inhibitors and HDAC-inhibitors. Up-regulated transcripts were enriched of genes coding for proteins involved in chromatin structure, as well as putative MYC target genes and transcripts reported as up-regulated after treatment with HDAC-inhibitors, demethylating agents or aplidine. Also, GEP signature was similar to what reported for the BRD-inhibitor JQ1.In conclusion, OTX015 showed in vitro anti-tumoral activity in a large series of mature lymphoid neoplasms. The activity was largely cytostatic, with cell cycle G1 arrest and induction of senescence. Down-regulation of MYC and its putative targets appeared as the main effect, but it might not be the only mechanism of action, since a few cell lines did not appear to down-regulate MYC after exposure to OTX015, which also induced down-regulation of NFKB target genes and modulation of transcripts similar to what observed with HDAC-inhibitors.

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies.

There is no definitive therapeutic improvement by conventional chemotherapy (CT) for decades. However, the superiority of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has remained inconclusive. The infrequency of PTCL is an obstacle to perform a large prospective study. We conducted a retrospective study of fifty six patients with three major nodal PTCL, histologically classified as PTCL-not specified (NOS, n=29), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL, n=19), and ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, n=8) who underwent ASCT (n=14) or not (n=42) after CT in Tokai University Hospital, Ebina General Hospital, and Hadano Red Cross Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan between 1997 and 2008. We determined whether international prognostic index (IPI), serum soluble IL-2 receptor level (sIL-2R) and ASCT were correlated with the survival. Methods', ' Retrospective, multicenter cohort study by time-dependent or non-time-dependent multivariate survival analysis with Cox proportional hazard regression. Results', ' Median age was 61 (18-81). The percentage of IPI more than 3 was 50. Median sIL-2R was 4120 ng/ml. (311-96,800). In non-time-dependent analysis, both ASCT and sIL-R were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Hazard ratio (HR) of ASCT, IPI, and sIL-2R were 0.24 (95%CI', ' 0.08-0.76, p=0.02), 0.77 (95%CI', ' 0.34-1.77, p=0.54), and 1.45 (95%CI', ' 1.129-1.857, p=0.035), respectively. But in time-dependent manner, the significant effect of ASCT was offset for OS. HR of ASCT was 0.82 (95%CI', ' 0.25-2.71, p=0.75). Only sIL-2R was still statistically significant, which HR was 1.31 (95%CI', ' 1.04-1.66, p=0.03). On the other hand, ASCT was only important effect on progression-free survival (PFS) by non-time-dependent analysis, which HR was 0.20 (95%CI', ' 0.07-0.55, p=0.02). After time-dependent analysis, no variates influenced PFS. Conclusions', ' The OS advantage of high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT is offset by time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analysis.

In fact, both morphology and phenotype largely overlap with those of other nodal PTCLs, including angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) and anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs).Here, we performed an extensive miRNA profiling of PTCLs in order to identify differentially expressed miRNA, either involved in their pathogenesis or potentially useful for their differential diagnosis.Methods', ' We studied by miRNA profiling (TaqMan Array MicroRNA Cards A) 60 samples including PTCLs/NOS (N=25), AITLs (N=10), ALCLs (N=12) and normal T cells (N=13); in addition, 40 independent PTCL cases were studied by qRT-PCR as validation. Further, to assess the functional impact of deregulated miRNAs, we performed a global gene expression profile (GEP) analysis in the same cases by using the Illumina Whole Genome DASL Assay. ANOVA and Student t-test were performed to find genes and miRNAs differentially expressed between PTCLs and normal T cells or among PTCL subtypes, respectively. Differentially expressed miRNAs were further filtered based on their predicted impact on the GEP using Linear Discriminant Analysis, Spearman correlation and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A discriminant function based on linear combination of GEP signatures was then used to better distinguish different PTCLs subtypes. Finally, the functional effects of selected miRNA were assessed by transfection of specific mimic and inhibitors into PTCL cells and then evaluating the GEPs (functional GEP).Findings', ' First, unsupervised analyses clearly discriminated PTCLs and normal T cells based on the miRNA expression patterns. Second, supervised analysis identified 256 miRNA differentiating the two groups (p<0.05, FC 2, Bonferroni correction). To identify those miRNA more likely to impact the GEP of the tumors, we then performed a multi-step analysis integrating miRNA and GEP data. We identified 4 highly discriminant miRNA inversely correlated with different potential target genes. All 4 miRNA were confirmed by qPCR in a validation set, while their target genes were assessed by functional GEP confirming their impact.Thereafter, we sought miRNAs differentially expressed in the PTCL subtypes, to be used as diagnostic markers. Based on ANOVA and subsequent linear discriminant analysis we identified 3 sets of miRNA able to efficiently distinguish PTCL/NOS vs. ALK-/ALCL (N=5 miRNA), ALK+/ALCL vs. ALK-/ALCL (N=4), and PTCL/NOS vs. AITL (N=8). Noteworthy, this novel molecular diagnostic tool was validated by qPCR in independent cases, demonstrating a remarkable diagnostic accuracy ranging between 85% and 95%.In conclusion, miRNA profiling allowed to identify miRNA possibly involved in PTCL pathogenesis and to develop a novel diagnostic tool for the differential diagnosis of the commonest subtypes.']",

        "Background":"['Activating mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) represent important therapeutic targets in neuroblastoma (NB). One of the more common mutations, ALKF1174L, is sensitive to the FDA-approved ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, only at high doses and mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged cancers. To identify compounds that would potentiate the effect of crizotinib, we performed a high-throughput compound screen using ALKF1174L-dependent human NB SH-SY5Y cells and compared viability between cells treated with the screen compound alone and in combination with crizotinib. The strongest hits among the 8,000 compounds screened were inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The combination of crizotinib and two candidate pan-selective CDK inhibitors, AT7519 and SNS-032 resulted in synergistic activity with significantly increased apoptosis over that of either single agent alone. This effect was observed in NB cells expressing not only ALKF1174L, but also in those expressing ALKR1275Q, the most common NB-associated ALK mutation. Synergy was also seen with ceritinib (LDK378), a structurally unrelated ALK inhibitor, in combination with both AT7519 and SNS-032. We determined that the synergistic effect was mediated preferentially through the transcriptional, rather than the cell cycle activity of these CDK inhibitors, denoted by absence of cell cycle arrest, stalling of RNA polymerase II at representative gene promoters, and loss of Pol II phosphorylation at the transcription elongation marker serine 2 in treated cells. These findings were comparable with results obtained using agents that were highly selective for CDK9 or CDK7, CDKs with roles in transcription regulation. Finally, in murine xenogaft models of ALK-mutated NB, the combination resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and prolongation of survival compared to single agents alone. Together, these data support further pre-clinical and clinical efforts to explore the therapeutic potential of combining ALK inhibitors with transcriptional CDK inhibitors in ALK-mutated NB.']",

        "Background":"['A subset of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) carries chromosomal rearrangements involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. More frequently ALK is juxtaposed to the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene on chromosome 2 and generates a constitutively active EML4-ALK fusion protein that triggers downstream oncogenic signals leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. The majority of ALK-rearranged NSCLC presents a peculiar histology characterized by a solid signet-ring cell and a mucinous cribriform pattern that is frequently associated with a metastatic phenotype. As the signet ring phenotype and metastasis are associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular reprogramming often activated in cancer cells during invasion and metastasis, we investigated whether ALK induces EMT in NSCLC. We performed RNA sequencing analysis on human ALK-rearranged NSCLC cell lines treated with ALK inhibitors or where EML4-ALK was knocked-down by shRNA. We found that EML-ALK regulated several genes related to EMT. In particular, the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (ESRP1 and ESRP2), key regulators of a splicing switch during EMT, were repressed in ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells and their repression was dependent on ALK activity. In keeping with these observations, H2228 and DFCI032 cells displayed a mesenchymal phenotype with almost complete suppression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and a strong expression of the mesenchymal markers, vimentin and N-cadherin. In H2228 and DFCI032 cells, both E-cadherin suppression and vimentin up-regulation were dependent upon EML-ALK kinase activity because treatment with ALK inhibitors (TAE684 and crizotinib) or ALK knock-down reverted the phenotype of H2228 and DFCI032 from mesenchymal to epithelial and decreased their invasive potential. We excluded the involvement in EMT of ALK-rearranged NSCLC of other RTKs, such as EGFR or MET, because their inhibition did not have any effect on E-cadherin and vimentin expression. In ALK-rearranged NSCLC, the regulation of E-cadherin suppression was mainly transcriptional whereas vimentin regulation was post-transcriptional for both cell lines. Overexpression of ESRP1 led to up-regulation of E-cadherin, whereas ESRP1 knock-down impaired the reversion to an epithelial phenotype associated to inhibition of ALK activity. In conclusion, we showed that oncogenic ALK regulates EMT in NSCLC through ESRP repression. These findings could have implications for the biology of ALK-rearranged NSCLC in terms of metastatic potential and resistance to therapy.']",

The emergence of resistance to crizotinib is reportedly conferred by genetic alterations, such as ALK kinase domain mutation, ALK copy number gain or activation of the bypass pathways. CH5424802 (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) is a new, highly selective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor that partially overcome acquired resistance to crizotinib, thereby inhibiting crizotinib resistant mutations of ALK in a preclinical experiment (Cancer Cell 19, 2011', ' 679-90) A phase II study of CH5424802 demonstrated 93.5% response rate (JLCS 2012); however, we also encountered acquired resistance phenomenon.To elucidate the acquired resistant mechanisms, we established CH5424802-resistant H2228 cells harboring EML4-ALK fusion gene under the step-wise continuous exposures of CH5424802. Six sublines that could grow in the presence of 1 mol/L of CH5424802 (designated H2228CHR clones -1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and -9) were obtained.

Surprisingly, ALK fusion gene disappeared in all H2228 CHR clones, which were confirmed immunostaining, reverse transcription PCR, FISH and Western blotting. H2228 CHR clones -1 and -2 presented higher phosphorylated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) than the parental H2228 cells and showed sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib.Furthermore, we also established CH5424802-resistant ABC-11CHR cells derived from ABC-11 cells from pleural effusion of an ALK inhibitor nave patient. In ABC-11CHR cells, phosphorylated ALK was markedly decreased and phosphorylated MET was increased.In conclusion, signal switching from ALK to other tyrosine kinase receptors induced resistance to a highly selective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor CH5424802 in NSCLC cell lines harboring ALK fusion gene.']",

The mechanisms of drug resistance to alectinib have been still unclear. To explore whether overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters might provide a potential mechanism of alectinib resistance in lung cancer, we established alectinib-resistant cell lines from NCI-H2228 and primary ALK-rearranged cells and evaluated the expression of ABC transporters.We established ALK-rearranged NSCLC cell lines (KTOR 1, 2, and 3) from tumor cells in pleural effusion obtained from 3 patients with alectinib nave ALK-rearranged NSCLC. In the 2 of 3 patients, tumor cells in pleural effusion were also obtained when disease progression was observed during alectinib treatment (KTOR1-RE and KTOR2-RE). Expression profiling of ABC transporters using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that the expression of ABCB1 was significantly increased in KTOR1-RE and KTOR2-RE compared with the parental cells (4.6 and 10.8 folds), but not other ABC transporters. Then, alectinib-resistant NCI-H2228 cell lines (H2228-AR) were established by exposing the parental cells to stepwise-increasing alectinib up to 5M for 10 months. We found that the ABCB1/MDR1 expression in H2228-AR cells were significantly increased (2.09-16.6 folds) compared with the parental cells using qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Then, we examined the alternation of alectinib cytotoxicity by inhibition of ABCB1. Knockdown of ABCB1 expression using small interfering RNA and inhibition of ABCB1 by verapamil enhanced alectinib cytotoxicity in H2228-AR cells. Next, the levels of ABCB1 expression after short-term alectinib exposure were examined in NCI-H2228 and the three alectinib nave ALK-rearranged NSCLC primary cell lines (KTOR 1, 2, and 3). In all the four ALK-rearranged cell lines, exposure to 100 nM alectinib for 72 hours induced increased expression of ABCB1 compared with control medium.These data suggested that increased expression of ABCB1/MDR1 might be, in part, responsible acquired resistance and sensitivity to alectinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells.']",

XALKORI (crizotinib) is an FDA-approved therapy for locally advanced or metastatic (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mutations of certain residues within the ALK kinase domain have been associated with crizotinib resistance. To understand the molecular basis of mutational resistance, we have kinetically and structurally characterized several clinical mutations of ALK kinase domain. In the basal-state (nonphosphorylated) proteins, mutations C1156Y, F1174L, L1152R and L1196M resulted in 14 to 52-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of phosphorylation of an activation loop peptide. Accordingly, these mutants were more rapidly autophosphorylated, compared to wild-type enzyme. In addition, F1174L, C1156Y and L1156Y had 2 to 6-fold higher catalytic efficiencies when fully activated by autophosphorylation. Conversely, catalytic efficiencies of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated G1269A variant decreased by 1.2 and 1.6-fold, respectively. Inhibition of L1152R, L1196M and G1269A by crizotinib was reduced by 3-28-fold, compared to wild-type enzyme, from Ki determinations. From direct binding studies of the L1196M gatekeeper mutation, the loss of crizotinib binding occurred 6 and 13-fold for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins, respectively. By crystallographic studies apoenzyme and crizotinib complexes of ALK kinase domain displayed an inactive kinase conformation that is stabilized by an extended hydrophobic network of residues. F1174 and L1196 are part of this hydrophobic core, and mutations of these residues are predicted to destabilize the inactive ALK conformation. Taken together, these results suggest that most of the resistant mutations (e.g. L1196M, F1174L, C1156Y, L1152R) result in a more dynamic protein that increases substrate turnover. In addition, the reduction of crizotinib binding for the mutations in the vicinity of the inhibitor binding site (L1196M, G1269A) is likely a contributing factor for the resistance. This structural and kinetic analysis of mutational resistance may be useful for design of new inhibitors targeting multiple clinical mutations of ALK.']",

Methods', '  In this multicenter phase I study, 131 patients (pts) with advanced malignancies harboring a genetic alteration in ALK, including 123 with ALK-rearranged (ALK+) NSCLC (as determined by FISH), were enrolled. LDK378 was administered orally at doses of 50750 mg once daily. All pts were assessed for PK, response to therapy, and adverse events (AEs).  In >20 pts with CRZ-resistant disease, tumor biopsy was performed before LDK378 treatment to identify CRZ resistance mutations.   Results', '  As of November 8, 2012, 131 pts had been enrolled (38% male, median age 53 years), including 59 pts in the dose escalation phase, during which the MTD of 750 mg once daily was established, and 72 pts in an expanded cohort at the MTD. Among 88 evaluable NSCLC pts who received LDK378 at 400750 mg daily, the overall response rate (ORR) was 70%, with 40 confirmed and 22 unconfirmed responses. In the subset of 64 CRZ-resistant pts, the ORR was 73%, with 31 confirmed and 16 unconfirmed responses.  As of November 8, 2012 50% of pts with unconfirmed responses were ongoing. Responses were observed in pts with different CRZ resistance mutations as well as in pts without detectable mutation. Responses were also seen in pts with untreated CNS metastases.  Among NSCLC pts with confirmed response, median duration of response (DOR) was 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.7  NR), and 78% had a DOR of 6 months. In all 123 NSCLC pts, median PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI, 4.3  19.3). The most common AEs were nausea (72%), diarrhea (69%), vomiting (50%), and fatigue (31%). The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were ALT elevation (12%), diarrhea (7%), and AST elevation (6%).   Conclusions', '  LDK378 induces durable responses in the majority of pts with advanced, ALK+ NSCLC, including CRZ-resistant pts with and without CRZ resistance mutations.

AP26113 is a highly potent ALK inhibitor with promising anti-tumor activity in pts with crizotinib-resistant disease. Here we broadly evaluate AP26113's ability to overcome mechanisms of resistance to first- and second-generation ALK inhibitors, in preclinical models (including brain cancer models), and describe a novel methodology to compare in vitro potency, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters, and clinical efficacy.Methods\", 'Ba/F3 cells were engineered to express native EML4-ALK or 17 mutants resistant to crizotinib, ceritinib, and/or alectinib in clinical or preclinical studies. IC50s for all TKIs were compared to clinically effective plasma concentrations (Ceff) of each inhibitor, which were derived using average steady-state levels in pts, and corrected for the functional effects of protein binding in vitro. In vivo studies were performed in mice, in which Ba/F3 cells with mutant or native EML4-ALK were injected subcutaneously, or a NSCLC line with EML4-ALK (H2228) was injected into the brain.Results', 'The Ceff of crizotinib was only 2-fold above the IC50 for native ALK, suggesting that crizotinib may be susceptible to mutants that inhibit binding by only a few-fold. Indeed, 8/10 mutants previously associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib were found to have IC50s that exceed the Ceff. Similar analyses revealed mutants with IC50s that exceeded the Ceff for ceritinib (e.g. L1198F) and alectinib (e.g. I1171N), with G1202R being the most recalcitrant mutant overall. In contrast, the Ceff of AP26113 was >20-fold above the IC50 for native ALK, and exceeded the IC50 for all 17 mutants, including G2102R. In vivo, among all 4 TKIs tested (at doses effective against native ALK), only AP26113 demonstrated significant efficacy against G1202R-mutant ALK (88% tumor growth inhibition).

These results suggest AP26113 may effectively address a broad range of resistance mechanisms identified for other ALK TKIs.

However, even this promising drug is predicted to develop acquired resistance. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of resistance using two alectinib-resistant cell lines.MethodsWe established alectinib-resistant cell lines, H2228/CHR and ABC-11/CHR, from H2228 (EML4-ALK fusion genes variant 3a/b E6) and ABC-11 (EML4-ALK fusion genes variant 3b E6) respectively, by continuous exposure to alectinib. They were characterized using MTT assay, Western blotting, receptor tyrosine kinase array, ELISA, FISH, RT-PCR, and xenograft models.ResultsH2228/CHR and ABC-11/CHR cells were 117- and 40-fold more resistant than the parental lines, respectively, and maintained downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation even in the presence of 10 M alectinib. There were no ALK secondary mutations in those resistant cell lines. H2228/CHR lost the EML4-ALK fusion gene, and exhibited increased activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) with overexpression of the HER3 ligand neuregulin 1. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of IGF-1R and HER3 signaling overcame the resistance. In ABC-11/CHR, MET was activated by stimulated hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) autocrine signaling. We found HGF gene translocation underlying the HGF autocrine system. Anti-HGF antibody suppressed the MET activation and combined treatment with alectinib and anti-HGF antibody or a MET inhibitor suppressed downstream signaling in ABC-11/CHR cells. Finally, crizotinib, which targets both ALK and MET, most effectively inhibited the growth of ABC-11/CHR both in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionsWe identified novel alectinib resistance mechanisms caused by the activation of alternative tyrosine kinase receptors.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common extracranial solid tumors in childhood, which arises from neural crest cells in sympathoadrenal lineage. Although recent studies have revealed that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signal is aberrantly activated in high-risk group of NB due to nonsynonymous mutations, gene amplification and mutation-independent overexpression, the regulatory mechanism of the signal remains elusive. Recently, we have identified neuronal leucine rich repeat 1 (NLRR1), a type I transmembrane protein, as a poor prognostic marker in NB and, notably, it accelerates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal to enhance cell proliferation. Here we have revealed that NLRR1 functionally affects ALK signal and vice versa in NB.Material & Methods', ' Cell growth of NB cell lines was evaluated by WST-8 assay or living cell imaging system. Immunoprecipitation was performed to check protein-protein interactions and concentrate secreted proteins. Further binding studies were performed by utilizing alkaline phosphatase-tagged and Fc-tagged proteins. Quantification of secreted proteins was assessed by sandwich ELISA assay. For ALK and EGFR signal inhibition, NB cells were treated with crizotinib, alectinib and erlotinib. The expression levels of ALK and NLRR1 were evaluated in embryonic Nlrr1 knockout mice as well as in the NB clinical samples by immunohistochemistry.Results', ' In the binding assays including immunoprecipitation, we found that NLRR1 extracellular domain physically interacted with the full-length ALK. Unexpectedly, NLRR1 expression suppressed ALK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in ALK-positive NB cells. Similar inhibitory effect was also observed by the treatment of the conditioned medium from the culture of NLRR1-expressing cells, suggesting a soluble form of NLRR1 protein. Certainly, the additional investigation confirmed that NLRR1 was cleaved to generate a soluble fragment of the extracellular domain. Conversely ALK inhibitors (ALKi) treatment resulted in up-regulation of NLRR1 and EGFR. Furthermore, EGF treatment restored ALKi-induced cell growth suppression. Additional erlotinib treatment certainly competed with the EGF rescue effect against ALKi. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that NLRR1 and ALK showed mutually exclusive expression pattern in NB tissues and murine embryonic dorsal root ganglia.Conclusion', ' We have identified the bilateral regulatory system between ALK and NLRR1, in which NLRR1 suppresses ALK phosphorylation whereas the inhibition of ALK results in the elevated expression of NLRR1 and EGFR. These findings in part support their mutually exclusive expression pattern in developing neural tissues and human NB. Further study should clarify the pathological meaning of the heterogeneity between ALK and NLRR1/EGFR pathways to develop a novel dual inhibition therapy in NB.']",

        "Background":"[\"Neuroblastomas (NBs) harboring activating point mutations in the kinase domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are differentially sensitive to ALK inhibition by crizotinib (Bresler et al. 2011). The F1174L and F1245C amino acid substitutions, which comprise 38.5% (mycancergenome.org) of ALK aberrations in NB, also confer intrinsic resistance to crizotinib and present a significant obstacle in the clinic. Therefore, our goal has been to identify a next-generation ALK inhibitor with improved selectivity and potency to target these resistant mutants effectively. We demonstrate here that PF-06463922 (Pfizer), an ATP-competitive, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, overcomes crizotinib resistance of these ALK variants in NB, and exerts unprecedented activity as a single agent against the F1174L and F1245C ALK-mutated tumors. At a tenfold lower dose (10 mg/kg) than typically used for crizotinib (100 mg/kg), PF-06463922 induces complete tumor regression in patient-derived (COG-N-426x, F1245C ALK-mutated) and cell line-derived (SY5Y, F1174L ALK-mutated) xenograft mouse models. Whereas crizotinib-treated mice in both models experience rapid tumor growth on therapy, PF-06463922-treated mice showed sustained complete responses for several weeks even after treatment was discontinued. Cell-based and biochemical analyses indicate that the superior activity of PF-06463922 is a function of both higher potency and a broader spectrum of effectiveness across mutants. ATP levels were measured in ten NB cell lines upon treatment with PF-06463922 and crizotinib; at 120 hours post-treatment, PF-06463922 is 26-38 times more effective at inducing growth inhibition in cells with primary resistance than crizotinib. These in vitro and in vivo results are corroborated by our biochemical experiments. In comparative kinase inhibition studies of several next-generation ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 was most effective against frequently observed ALK variants accounting for approximately 75% of neuroblastoma samples, including those with F1174L mutations. In vitro, PF-06463922 showed at least 3-4 fold higher potency than crizotinib in peptide phosphorylation assays, and its superior inhibition was consistently observed in cellular analysis of transforming ability. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate PF-06463922's mechanism of action and reveal how it induces apoptotic signaling networks without abrogating phospho-ALK. Taken together, these results support the argument that a modified ALK inhibitor may improve outcomes for patients with primary resistance to crizotinib and provide the preclinical basis from which to design a clinical trial for PF-06463922 for the treatment of ALK-mutated NBs.\"]",

        "Background":"['Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an insidious disease with poor prognosis. This is due to invasive disease that is refractive to conventional therapies. We reported a gene-set of hypomethylated loci in metastatic OSCC involved in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling. EGFR over-expression is an early event in OSCC however therapies targeting EGFR have had dismal results. Our studies showed hypomethylation of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) correlates with metastatic OSCC. ALK and EGFR signaling drive glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Furthermore, NSCLC that develop resistance to ALK inhibition demonstrate activation of EGFR bypass signaling. Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that simultaneous targeting of both ALK and EGFR in OSCC will yield greater anti-tumor activity than single drug therapies. Our objective was to assess expression and activation of EGFR and ALK signaling pathways in response to therapies targeting EGFR and/or ALK in vitro and in mouse OSCC xenograft models. Expression of total and activated EGFR and ALK was analyzed in HSC3 cells (invasive) and SCC4 cells (non-invasive) using western blot analysis. Effects on downstream signaling molecules (AKT, STAT3, and RAS) were also evaluated following treatments with TAE684 (ALK inhibitor) and/or Gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor). Anti-tumor effects of TAE684 and/or Gefitinib were evaluated in mouse OSCC xenograft models using HSC3 and SCC4 cell lines. This study revealed that HSC3 and SCC4 cell lines have unique growth, invasion, and signaling profiles resulting in varying responses to treatments targeting ALK and/or EGFR. HSC3 cells express ALK and have active EGFR whereas SCC4 cells have low ALK expression and low EGFR activity. Subsequently, HSC3 xenografts were sensitive to Gefitinib and co-targeting ALK resulted in an additive effect. Targeting ALK alone had no effect on tumor growth. Similar to NSCLC, western blot analysis revealed that ALK inhibition alone induces increased activation of EGFR bypass signaling in both HSC3 and SCC4 cells. In contrast SCC4 xenografts failed to respond to TAE684 and/or Gefitinib treatments. Co-treatment with TAE684 and Gefitinib down regulated the already low EGFR activity. Downstream effector molecules AKT and STAT3 had reduced activity in response to co-treatments in both HSC3 and SCC4 cell lines. Conversely, MAPK activity increased with all treatments in both cell lines. Therefore, we conclude that OSCC with active EGFR and ALK signaling are responsive to combination treatments targeting ALK and EGFR resulting in more efficacious anti-tumor effects than single drug therapies. Furthermore, single anti-ALK therapy induces compensatory EGFR activation and has no effect on tumor growth. Additional parallel pathways may account for elevated MAPK activity in response to all treatments and warrants further investigation.']",

The most frequently occurring somatic mutation, ALK F1174L, is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib only at higher doses in vitro, and not at all in in vivo. Moreover, ALK F1174L mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged cancers, posing a therapeutic challenge in these diseases. To identify critical components of ALK F1174L-associated signaling pathways that contribute to neuroblastoma cell survival and whose simultaneous inhibition with ALK F1174L could increase sensitivity to crizotinib, we exposed neuroblastoma cell lines expressing ALK F1174L (Kelly and SHSY-5Y) to crizotinib (at treatment doses and exposures times titrated to abolish ALK phosphorylation, but in the absence of any detectable commitment to apoptosis), and compared their ALK-inactive gene expression signatures with vehicle-treated control cells in which the ALK F1174L signature remained active. We noted differential expression of genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in cells in which ALK F1174L was inhibited with crizotinib, with downregulation of AKT1, 2 and 3 and elevated expression of mTOR. Immunoblotting confirmed that downregulation of pALK upon exposure to crizotinib was accompanied by downregulation of pAKT473, with unchanged or elevated pRPS6. To test the possibility that the cytotoxicity of crizotinib could be enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of this ALK-driven pathway, we tested crizotinib in combination with the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, Torin2, both in cell lines and in xenograft models of neuroblastoma expressing ALK F1174L. Treatment with crizotinib had no standalone activity as demonstrated by lack of effects on tumor volume or survival. Treatment with Torin2 significantly suppressed tumor growth, but this did not translate into a prolongation of survival. Combined treatment with Torin2 and crizotinib resulted in significant attenuation of tumor growth (p<0.001), and prolongation of survival in comparison to control animals, as well as single agent treatment with either Torin2 or crizotinib. RPS6 remained phosphorylated in neuroblastoma xenografts of mice treated exclusively with crizotinib but was downregulated in cells treated with Torin 2, and in those treated with the combination. Together, these results suggest that single agent treatment with crizotinib at standard doses is less efficacious due to persistent activation of mTOR signaling and that mTOR pathway inhibition should augment the activity of crizotinib in the treatment of patients with ALK F1174L-expressing neuroblastomas and may even delay the onset of resistance in ALK-rearranged cancers in which this pathway is activated.']",

Statistical analysis was carried out to identify altered genes in ALK+ NSCLC and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was deployed to uncover their network interactions. To study the resistance mechanism of the ALK+ H3122 human NSCLC cell line against the specific ALK inhibitor TAE684, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), cell viability assay and immunoblotting were performed using standard techniques.Results', ' We identified a set of 1,656 genes that were significantly altered in ALK+ NSCLC, consisting of 662 upregulated and 994 downregulated. The principal component analysis (PCA) based on the top 51 of these dysregulated genes evidently separated ALK+ and normal lung tissue samples, implicating that these genes could represent potential genomic signature of ALK+ NSCLC. The IPA analysis revealed 35 canonical pathways linked to ALK signaling, including beta-adrenergic and angiopoietin signaling pathways. The results of qRT-PCR, cell viability assay and immunoblotting showed that in translocated ALK+ H3122 human NSCLC cell line, HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) overexpression could activate ALK downstream signaling via activation of MET receptor kinase pathway, thus potentially bypassing the oncogenic ALK signaling under ALK inhibitor TAE684 treatment. Hence, alternative direct activation of ALK downstream signaling molecules via MET/HGF axis activation may potentially contribute to ALK inhibitor drug resistance.Conclusion', ' Using bioinformatics data-mining, we have identified dysregulated genes and pathways in ALK+ NSCLC, many of which are novel biomarkers not previously reported.

Methods', '  To further understand the full therapeutic potential of Crizotinib, we undertook a genomic survey of ALK, ROS1, MET and MST1R across 1,000s of patients from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine.  Results', '  We confirmed the presence of EML4-ALK fusions in both lung and colorectal cancer (CRC), and also identified a novel ALK fusion in CRC. ALK hotspot mutations and focal amplifications were confined to neuroblastoma, as previously described. Our survey of ROS1 identified rare novel fusions in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and high-level amplifications in liposarcoma (2%) and rarely in breast cancer (0.2%). No fusions were identified for MET, however high-level amplifications were observed in 1-5% of papillary renal cell carcinoma, the intestinal subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma, oliogodendroglioma, glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Hotspot mutations were frequently observed in squamous head and neck (11%), and more rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung and ovarian cancers.   Conclusions', '   These results leverage all available genomic profiling data to provide a broadened scope of therapeutic opportunity for inhibitors like crizotinib. With the growing availability of next-generation sequencing, such surveys can support hypothesis-driven development of targeted therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. One of its hallmarks is high histological heterogeneity. The primary tumors are composed of neuroblastic cancer cells, Schwannian stroma and some infiltrating immune cells. The origin and functions of Schwannian stroma still remain controversial. It is suggested that they are tumor-infiltrating normal cells. Studies using Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) or Schwann cells to mimic Schwannian stroma have shown both tumor promoting or suppression effects. An alternative hypothesis is that Schwannian cells are derived from cancer stem-like cells since they shared the same genetic lesions with neuroblastic tumor cells. Our laboratory had reported that in the SK-N-SH cell line, both N-type cells (neuroblastic cells) and S-type cells (Schwann-like cells) shared almost identical genetic background. These cell lines may serve as relevant models to study NB tumor heterogeneity. Genome-wide sequencing for driver oncogenes in familial NB uncovered mutations in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. ALK point mutations have been found in 8-12% of all NB patients, and are restricted to the kinase domain. Aberrant activation of ALK signaling, and its downstream target, PI3K/AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2, can contribute to NB tumorigenesis. Thus, ALK is an intensely studied therapeutic target. Sublines of N-type and S-type cells were isolated from an early passage of SK-N-SH. Surprisingly, over 90% have cell morphology that resembled S-type cells. Sequencing analysis revealed that all harbored the same ALK F1174L mutation, indicating they were tumor-derived. Western blotting analysis showed that N-type cells, but not S-type cells, expressed ALK protein. This may explain the insensitivity of S-type cells towards ALK inhibitor, TAE684. Next, co-culture experiments showed that S-type cells protected N-type cells from apoptosis induced by TAE684. Western blotting analysis showed that ALK, AKT and STAT3 signaling were stimulated in the co-culture. Furthermore, conditioned medium (CM) from Schwann-like cells activated these downstream signaling molecules in N-type cells, indicating secreted factors from S-type cells contributed to the pathway stimulations. As AKT and STAT3 were ALK downstream targets, ALK ligand could be a potential factor. We further confirmed these results in two additional ALK WT N-type cell lines, IMR 32 and BE (2)-M17. Co-cultivation and CM experiments had demonstrated robust STAT3 activation even without ALK stimulation. Overall, tumor-derived S-type cells could prevent N-type cells from apoptosis via secreted factors. The signaling involved could be separated into an ALK-independent STAT3 activation and a ligand-activated ALK-AKT pathway. Future work will focus on identifying STAT3 stimulators and ALK ligands in CM of S-type cells.

To assess whether such genetic coalterations affect overall survival (OS) in these patients, we did a cohort study comparing survival outcomes in advanced patients with such coalterations, EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements during the same time period.  Methods', '  We examined OS in 11 patients with advanced, EGFR/ALK-coexisting NSCLC who received EGFR TKI, crizotinib or both of them sequentially from August 2009 to July 2011. For comparators, we identified 23 ALK-positive patients receiving second or further-line crizotinib from the two trials PROFILE 1005 and 1007, and 84 EGFR-mutant patients receiving first-line EGFR TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib.

Previously, CH5424802, a highly selective, second-generation ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile (ESMO 2012). Here we report the updated results of this study.  Methods', '  Patients (Pts) with ALK-positive NSCLC and no prior ALK inhibitor therapy were treated with CH5424802 at 300 mg bid until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity to investigate the efficacy and safety.  Results', '  As of the cut-off date of Dec. 14, 2012, 58 pts have been treated with CH5424802', ' median age 49.5 years, M/F 25/33, ECOG PS 0/1 26/32, never-smoker 60.3%, 2 prior chemotherapy regimens 62%. Among the 46 pts in phase II part of this study, the overall response rate was 93.5% (95% CI', ' 82.1%, 98.6%) with 2 CRs and 41 PRs. Tumor shrinkage by 30% (PR) was achieved quickly with 65% occurring within 3 weeks of treatment and 87% within 6 weeks. With a median follow-up period of 12.6 months, 47/58 pts (40/46 pts in phase II part) were still on study treatment, and the median treatment duration has passed 10.3 months. The major treatment-related AEs were dysgeusia (21/58, 36%), rash, AST increased, blood bilirubin increased (19/58, 33% each), constipation and blood creatinine increased (17/58, 29% each), mostly grade 1-2. The major treatment-related grade 3 AEs were neutrophil count decreased (4/58, 7%). No grade 4 or fatal AEs were observed. Treatment-related visual disorders, vomiting and nausea were rare and mild.  Conclusions', '  In patients with ALK-positive NSCLC but nave to any ALK inhibitor therapy, treatment with CH5424802 demonstrated generally mild toxicity and lead to high response rate of 93.5% and durable treatment beyond 10 months, expecting that treatment duration can be longer than that of crizotinib.

It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for treatment of patients in late-stage (locally advanced or metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene as detected by an FDA-approved test, as it confers improved progression-free survival comparison with chemotherapy. Methods', ' This is a retrospective chart review study of patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC who attended the medical oncology department of Kuwait Cancer Control Centre (Kuwait) and King Fahad Specialist Hospital (Saudi Arabia) between January 2013 and May 2016. The efficacy and safety of crizotinib (250 mg orally, twice daily, with or without food.) were evaluated based on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), Objective response rate (ORR), time to objective response, duration of response, and dose reduction or cessation because of crizotinib toxicity. Results', ' Twenty-three patients were involved in this study with a median age of 55.5 years and male-to-female ratio of 2.4', '1 The median OS from initiation of crizotinib has not been reached; 1-year overall survival was 71.2%.

        "Background":"['Background', '    Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions cause a variety of malignancies (e.g. NSCLC and NHL).  Patients with ALK fusion-driven cancers treated with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, currently in clinical trials, have had marked antitumor responses. There are 15+ ALK fusions reported in NSCLC and other cancers, and testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has shown ALK gene amplification in cancers as well. The clinical significance of amplification is currently undetermined. We report results from a novel RT-qPCR assay (Insight ALK Screen) that is unbiased toward fusion partners and also detects wild-type upregulation. Results were compared to FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the accuracy of the qPCR assay and to correlate mRNA expression with gene amplification.    Methods', '    Twenty-three NSCLC FFPE specimens were blinded and analyzed by the qPCR assay. ALK mutation status was independently determined by FISH and IHC. FISH studies used the ALK break-apart probes (Abbott); IHC used the D5F3 antibody (Cell Signaling). The qPCR method amplifies two regions corresponding to the ALK extracellular and intracellular kinase domains. EML4-ALK and other ALK fusion events result in a change in threshold cycle increase in transcripts encoding the ALK kinase domain over wild-type ALK expression levels.  Results', '    The qPCR assay was positive for 11 samples from the enriched NSCLC cohort. The assay was 100% concordant with FISH in detecting the 4 samples with ALK fusions. The qPCR assay was also positive for 3 cases that were below (13%, 10% and 8%) the widely accepted criterion for being FISH-positive (>15% of tumor cells with split ALK 5 and 3 probe signals or with isolated 3 signals) for fusions. Four other samples were both positive by qPCR and showed some level of gene amplification by FISH.  Conclusions', '    Insight ALK Screen is a highly sensitive assay for detecting any ALK fusion regardless of the fusion partner. Detecting ALK mRNA expression by qPCR in cases below the FISH criterion for fusion positivity or that showed gene amplification suggests that more NSCLC patients could potentially qualify as candidates for ALK inhibitor therapy; further work is investigating this possibility.']",

Methods', '  In this surgical series, 104 resected lung adenocarcinomas from nonsmoker females were analyzed concurrently for the EGFR mutation, ALK rearrangement status and mRNA expression of ERCC1, RRM1, TS and BRCA1 genes. EGFR mutation detection was performed by the method of ADx-ARMS, ALK rearrangement was detected by PCR and the mRNA expression of different genes were tested using the method of real-time PCR.  Results', '  73 (70.2%) patients harbored EGFR mutations and 10 (9.6%) had ALK rearrangement. The ERCC1 mRNA level in patients with EGFR mutation was 3.441.9410-3 , which is significantly lower than in the patients with ALK positive and both negative(4.601.9510-3 and 4.952.3310-3 respectively, P=0.010).
