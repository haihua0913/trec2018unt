        "Background":"['The T315I gatekeeper mutation confers resistance to majority of approved ABL1 inhibitors, with only ponatinib demonstrating efficacy in BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven disease. However, vascular adverse events and selection of resistant compound mutations limit its clinical utility. Hence, there is an unmet need for novel therapies for patients with gatekeeper-mutated Ph+ leukemia. In this study we integrated comprehensive drug sensitivity testing with structural analysis to characterize the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a putative novel therapy for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemias.To address this we profiled BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven CML/Ph+ ALL patient samples against 300 anti-cancer compounds (approved and investigational drugs). Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing of primary cells derived from a Ph+ ALL patient revealed a marked and cancer-selective response to the VEGFR inhibitor axitinib. Strikingly, axitinib exhibited higher sensitivity in T315I positive Ph+ patient samples in comparison to T315I negative CML and ALL patient samples. In line with the ex vivo drug response data, axitinib inhibited the kinase activity of ABL1(T315I) with similar potency as its primary target VEGFR2, while the potency to non-mutated ABL1 was 30-fold lower. Analogously, in engineered Ba/F3 cells, axitinib showed a 10-fold higher inhibition of T315I than non-mutated ABL1-driven autophosphorylation and cell growth. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the BCR-ABL1(T315I) selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of axitinib in complex with ABL1(T315). The structure revealed that axitinib bound to a mutation induced active conformation of ABL1(T315I), different than the binding mode in non-mutated ABL1, likely explaining the increased potency towards ABL1(T315I). Moreover, axitinib occupied a distinct binding space than all approved ABL1 inhibitors, signifying that axitinib will have a unique mutation vulnerability profile. Compassionate two week treatment of a CML patient harboring the T315I mutation with axitinib, resulted in a 5-fold reduction of T315I transcript levels in the bone marrow, further suggesting that axitinib can produce specific and effective responses in patients with BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia.In conclusion, we demonstrate that axitinib potently inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) via a gatekeeper mutant-selective mechanism. Since axitinib is in clinical use for treatment of refractory renal cell carcinoma with a manageable safety profile, our data provide a sound basis for readily repurposing axitinib for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia. Finally, the distinct mechanism of inhibition by axitinib serves as an exemplar for development of even more effective gatekeeper-mutant selective inhibitors targeting ABL1 as well as other clinically important kinases, such as EGFR and KIT.']",

        "Background":"['The use of ABL1 kinase inhibitors has dramatically improved the outcome for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. However, resistance after treatment still poses a major clinical challenge. The most common resistance mechanism following treatment with first or second line therapy is the occurrence of a T315I mutation in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1. Only one clinically available ABL1 inhibitor, ponatinib, has been shown to target this gatekeeper mutation, but has recently been associated with significant adverse effects. Hence, there is an unmet need for new and improved therapies for patients with T315I BCR-ABL1 leukemias.In this study we set out to functionally and molecularly profile BCR-ABL1 T315I-driven CML/Ph+ALL patient samples to understand the disease pathogenesis and identify novel therapies with a drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) platform covering 306 approved and investigational oncology compounds. Mononuclear cells isolated from patient bone marrow were plated with drugs on 384-well plates. Each compound was tested for its effect on cell growth and survival in a 10,000-fold concentration range enabling the generation of dose response curves and by comparing to healthy donor mononuclear cells, selective drug sensitivity scores (sDSS).Ex vivo DSRT results of one CML and two Ph+ALL patient samples with the T315I mutation revealed a marked and specific sensitivity (IC50 30-40nM) to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, originally developed as a VEGFR inhibitor. Strikingly, sensitivity to axitinib was higher in these T315I positive patient samples than in T315I negative CML or ALL patient samples or any other leukemic samples. Supporting the notion that axitinib is a direct T315I BCR-ABL1 inhibitor we observed that Ba/F3 cells transformed with T315I BCR-ABL1 were sensitive to axitinib while the same cells transformed with wild type BCR-ABL1 were not. Finally, we discovered that axitinib has been described to have selective binding towards T315I ABL1 compared to the wild type kinase (Kd 1.5 nM vs. 36 nM, respectively, Davis et al. 2011, Nat. Biotechnol. 29', '1046-1051). Based on this information, the T315I CML patient mentioned above was compassionately treated with axitinib for 2 weeks resulting in a rapid 4-fold reduction of the mutated transcript levels in blood suggesting targeted in vivo activity of the drug.In summary, we demonstrated that axitinib is a potent BCR-ABL1 T315I inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. In light to the fact that axitinib is currently approved as a second line therapy for renal cell carcinoma and is well tolerated in patients, there is an opportunity to repurpose axitinib for Ph+ leukemia patients with T315I mutations with significantly shorter clinical development time.']",

        "Background":"['Deletions and dominant-negative mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding Ikaros transcription factor, are found in 85% of Ph+ B-ALL and in some cases of Ph B-ALL, and are associated with poor prognosis. Genomic studies of high-risk Ph or Ph-like B-ALLs have revealed frequent mutation and activation of TK genes and signaling pathways. While ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib and ponatinib have been incorporated into chemotherapy regimens for Ph+ B-ALL, the majority of patients still relapse, which correlates with residual bone marrow disease following induction therapy. New therapeutic strategies are needed for patients with Ikaros-mutant, high-risk Ph+ and Ph B-ALL.Using mice with a conditional Ikzf1 mutation (Ike5fl) that mimics the dominant-negative Ik6 mutant found in human B-ALL, we demonstrated that loss of Ikaros DNA-binding function arrests B-lymphoid development at a large pre-B cell stage that can give rise to B-ALL. Survival and proliferation of Ikaros mutant pre-B cells is dependent on increased integrin-mediated stromal adhesion and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK is a non-receptor TK downstream of integrins and growth factor receptors that plays important roles in cancer stem cell biology and the tumor microenvironment.Here, we show that dysregulated tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL1, cooperate with Ikaros mutation to accelerate the development of B-lymphoblastic leukemia in mice, correlated with a striking (30-fold) increase in the frequency of engrafting leukemia-initiating or leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Ikzf1-mutant BCR-ABL1+ lymphoblasts exhibit relative resistance to ABL1 TKIs including dasatinib that is dependent on the presence of stroma. VS-4718 is a potent, orally bioavailable FAK inhibitor that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical models, and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials in patients with various solid tumors. VS-4718 treatment abolished stromal adhesion and induced apoptosis of Ikzf1-mutant B-ALL and synergized with dasatinib, but had little effect on Ikzf1 WT B-ALL cells. Primary human Ph+ B-ALL samples showed a correlation between IKZF1 mutation status, stromal adherence, and sensitivity to FAK and ABL inhibitors in vitro, and BM tropism in vivo in xenografted NSG mice. Results from ongoing in vivo therapy experiments will be presented.Together, these results suggest a new model for the pathogenesis of high-risk B-ALL and its resistance to conventional therapy. B-ALLs with IKZF1 mutations may be resistant to TKIs and to chemotherapy by virtue of their stromal adhesion phenotype, resulting in failure to eliminate BM leukemic stem cells. Inhibition of FAK signaling in Ph+ or Ph IKZF1-mutant B-ALL may reverse the stromal-mediated resistance to ABL1 TKIs and/or chemotherapy. FAK inhibitors represent a promising new approach for the treatment of high-risk IKZF1-mutant B-ALL patients.']",

A pilot next-generation sequencing study identified kinase activating alterations in 15 Ph-like ALL cases. The goals of this study were to define the genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL in children and young adults, and to examine the utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients harboring genetic alterations activating kinase signaling.We studied 1665 B-ALL cases, including 309 childhood standard risk (10.8% Ph-like), 826 childhood high risk (14% Ph-like), 370 adolescent (16-21 years, 21% Ph-like) and 160 young adult (21-39 years; 26% Ph-like) cases. Approximately 50% of Ph-like cases harbored a CRLF2 rearrangement (IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2). Next-generation sequencing was performed for 160 non-CRLF2 expressing Ph-like cases, including mRNA-seq (141 cases), whole genome sequencing (30 cases) and/or exome sequencing (12 cases). Fusion transcripts were identified using CICERO, a novel mRNA-seq assembly-based structural variation detection method.Over 100 chimeric in-frame fusions were identified, including 29 involving 12 tyrosine kinase or cytokine receptor genes, 15 of which were recurrent', ' JAK2 (10 partners), ABL1 (6), ABL2 (3), PDGFRB (3), CSF1R, TYK2, NTRK3, PTK2B, IL2RB (1 partner each), and rearrangements of EPOR into the IGH and IGK loci. Together, these rearrangements were present in 30% of Ph-like ALL cases. Additional sequence and structural alterations activating kinase signaling were identified in 10% of cases (e.g IL7R, FLT3, SH2B3).Despite the diversity of kinase alterations, the majority are predicted to respond to a limited number of TKIs, but many are novel or have not been tested in suitable preclinical models of ALL. We show that expression of RCSD1-ABL1, RANBP2-ABL1, ZMIZ1-ABL1, RCSD1-ABL2, SSBP2-CFS1R and PAX5-JAK2 in Ba/F3 and primary mouse pre-B cultures induces cytokine-independent proliferation and constitutive activation of JAK/STAT signaling. Furthermore, the ABL1, ABL2 and CSF1R fusions were sensitive to dasatinib (IC50 range 1-2nM), whilst PAX5-JAK2 only responded to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Notably, we show efficacy of dasatinib (20mg/kg/day p.o) in a xenograft model of ETV6-ABL1, with reduction of circulating human CD45+ cells (17.4 vs 88.2%; p<0.0001) and spleen weight (117 vs 321mg; p<0.0001) in dasatinib treated mice (n=5) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=5).These data define the genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL and show that the majority of cases harbor genetic alterations that activate a limited number of kinase signaling pathways. These results provide the basis for prospective precision medicine clinical trials that identify and direct patients with Ph-like ALL to logical TKI therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Molecularly targeted therapies have been exceptionally successful in the treatment of some malignancies, most notably chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However in other cancers, e.g. Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), drug resistance is a frequent occurrence. Resistance mutations may pre-exist as a consequence of intra-tumor heterogeneity; thus the extent of heterogeneity may determine the likelihood of treatment failure. Intra-tumor heterogeneity is challenging to quantitate, as heterogeneous mutations are likely to occur below the background error rate of conventional approaches for mutation detection. To overcome this limitation and explore the relationship between intra-tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in Ph+ leukemias, we utilized single-molecule Duplex Sequencing (DS) of the ABL1 gene. DS eliminates sequencing errors by independently tagging the two strands of individual DNA molecules; true mutations are present at the same position in both strands, while PCR and sequencing errors are only present in one strand. DS has an error rate below 0.00001%, and thus enables quantitation of heterogeneous mutations with unprecedented resolution. We find that CP-CML, a disease that is often well controlled with targeted therapy, has an extremely low burden of intra-tumor heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis, with a sub-clonal mutation burden similar to that of normal individuals. Simulations which take into account the low cancer stem cell fraction of CP-CML and the sub-clonal mutation burden we measured reveal that only a minority of CP-CML patients will harbor pre-existing drug resistance, which may explain the unusual success of targeted therapy in this setting. Next, we studied patients with advanced Ph+ leukemias (refractory BP-CML and Ph+ ALL), which have a high rate of treatment failure and poor outcomes. We find that patients with BP-CML and Ph+ALL have a significant elevation in sub-clonal heterogeneity relative to those with CP-CML. We demonstrate that the higher extent of intra-tumor heterogeneity correlates with a significantly higher rate of drug resistance mutations and compound resistance (i.e. two concurrent resistance mutations) in patients. Unlike CP-CML, pre-existing mutations conferring resistance to targeted therapy are nearly certain in refractory BP-CML and Ph+ ALL as a consequence of the load of intra-tumor heterogeneity and high cancer stem cell fraction. We support this concept by three distinct approaches', ' (i) detection of pre-existing sub-clones that drive treatment failure; (ii) modeling the growth kinetics of resistant clones; and (iii) extrapolation of the mutation burden measured by DS. Our results suggest that intra-tumor heterogeneity influences the likelihood of resistance to molecularly targeted therapy. Quantitation of sub-clonal mutation load may be broadly applicable in other malignancies for predicting the likelihood of response to targeted therapy and monitoring disease progression.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm initiated in hematopoietic stem cells by expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene and its protein product, which enhances ABL1 kinase activity. Targeted BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as Imatinib, and the second generation TKIs like Nilotinib as well as the dual specific SCR and ABL inhibitor Dasatinib have significantly slowed disease progression by eradicating the bulk of BCR-ABL1 expressing cells in the circulation. However, progression to a therapeutically resistant blast crisis (BC) phase is driven by CD34+CD38+Lin- progenitors that co-opt stem cell properties, such as enhanced self-renewal and survival, albeit in a deregulated manner. These BC leukemia stem cells (BC LSC) harbor enhanced BCL2 and beta-catenin expression. Seminal research shows that a key Wnt/beta-catenin target gene, CD44, plays a vital role in cancer stem cell survival and retention in the malignant microenvironment. Because alternative mRNA splicing in humans generates many CD44 isoforms, we investigated CD44 variant expression and retention of human BC LSC in specific hematopoietic niches.Methods and ResultsWe performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) of FACS sorted progenitors (Lin-CD34+CD38+) from chronic phase (CP)(n=8) and blast crisis (BC)(n=8) CML patients as well as from normal cord blood (CB) (n=7) and adult peripheral blood (NPB)(n=4). A number of CD44 transcript variants were detected', ' 3, 4 (CD44s), 5, 6, 7, 8 plus additional variants. RNA seq analysis uncovered a higher overall CD44 expression in BC compared to CP progenitors. Notably, one isoform of CD44, variant 3, was highly upregulated in BC compared to CP progenitors and minimally expressed by their normal counterparts. Moreover, BC progenitors that engrafted in RAG2-/-c-/- harbored CD44v3 expression in the bone marrow and the splenic niche and this differential BC LSC isoform expression was reduced after dasatinib treatment. In addition, BC LSC in the spleen showed a reduction of migration specific markers, such as RHAMM, ICAM-1 and Osteopontin, compared with the bone marrow resident BC LSC. Furthermore, a comparative splice isoform specific qRT-PCR analysis of CD44 variants expression in young versus old bone marrow showed no correlation with aging. In fact, human embryonic stem cells harbored variant 3 expression.ConclusionsThese data suggest that CD44 transcript variant 3 upregulation occurs following malignant reprogramming of hematopoietic progenitors that enables them to adopt features of an embryonic transcriptional program in select microenvironments. Detection of CD44 variant 3 has the potential to more precisely identify patients at risk for relapse and progression, suggest that combined therapeutic strategies involving a BCR-ABL specific TKI and a CD44 monoclonal antibody may decrease relapse and BC transformation rates.']",

Addition of the targeted BCR-ABL inhibitors (TKI) to standard cytotoxic therapy has greatly improved upfront treatment, yet relapse remains common with a median survival of just 4.5 months. Therefore identification of targeted agents that could enhance the activity of TKIs is urgently needed. ABT 199 is a BCL-2 inhibitor which has shown pre-clinical activity against a variety of B cell malignancies. Here we evaluate the combination of ABT199 across a panel of TKIs to explore potential mechanisms of synergy in hopes to better define the optimal combination for future clinical studies.  Methods', '  Drug efficacy in vitro was determined using the Ph+ALL cell line SupB15. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib or ponatinib in combination with ABT199 for 72 hours. Cell viability was assessed using a colorimetric MTS assay, and cell apoptosis was assessed with annexin V staining. Combination effects were calculated using Calculsyn software. Standard immunoblots were used to assess inhibition of downstream pathways.  Results', '  The combination index (CI) values for each of the TKIs with ABT199 ranged between 0.13  1.4 for Imatinib, 0.4  1.05 for Nilotinib, 0.06  0.33 for Ponatinib, and 0.07  0.64 for Dasatinib, where CI < 1 predicted synergy. As a single agent, ABT199 induced the highest degree of apoptosis, enhanced preferentially by dasatinib and ponatinib. Evaluation of key phosphorylated kinases showed that all four TKIs effectively inhibited the downstream ABL1 target pCRKL. In addition, both dasatinib and ponatinib inhibited pLYN while dasatinib also inhibited pBTK.  Conclusions', '  Combination of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL targeting in Ph+ALL is synergistic in vitro. The enhanced synergy seen with dasatinib and ponatinib may be due to the ability of these agents to target additional pathways active in leukemic cells. The addition of ABT-199 as part of TKI therapy for adult Ph+ALL warrants further clinical investigation, particularly in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.']",

Many of these patients (pts) display a Ph-like gene expression profile (GEP), but lack canonical BCR-ABL1 fusion. We have identified alternate kinase fusions in Ph-like ALL that induce cell proliferation sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (Roberts, NEJM 2014). We report retrospective analyses of 1390 B-ALL pts, 885 NCI high risk and 505 standard risk B-ALL pts with elevated minimal residual disease.Methods', ' Cases were screened using an 8-gene Taqman low-density array (LDA) PCR assay to identify the Ph-like GEP (Harvey, ASH 2013).

JAK mutations in CRLF2-R cases were tested by Sanger sequencing. Ph-like cases without CRLF2-R were tested for previously identified kinase fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, NTRK3, and PDGFRB by RT-PCR. Ph-like cases without detected fusions underwent RNA-sequencing, either using standard Illumina library preparation or a customized kinome capture kit (Agilent).Results', ' 339 (24%) pts were Ph-like. BCR-ABL1 (N = 45) and ETV6-RUNX1 (N = 11) were excluded from further analyses, as the former already receives TKI therapy and ETV6-RUNX1 ALL lacks targetable kinase fusions (unpublished). Of the remaining 283 Ph-like cases, 153 were CRLF2high (defined by CRLF2 expression levels on the LDA card). 61 (40%) had P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion, and of the remaining 91 CRLF2high cases, 56 of 69 tested had CRLF2-R (55 to IGH, 1 to an unknown partner). Thus, 117/130 (90%) CRLF2high Ph-like cases had a documented CRLF2 genomic lesion and 52 (44%) of these had a JAK mutation. Of the 130 Ph-like CRLF2low cases, 61 (47%) had a previously reported targetable TK fusion identified by RT-PCR, kinome capture or RNA sequencing.

        "Background":"[\"Reciprocal translocation and fusion of the genes encoding BCR (chromosome 22) and ABL1 (chromosome 9) are typical and causative for approximately 95% of chronic myeloid leukemias (CMLs). Specific and effective drugs targeting the protein products of these gene fusions have been developed and are used in current clinical practice. Molecular diagnostic methods are used for patient identification, for tracking drug effectiveness, and monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). However, the use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) for this purpose has been problematic, particularly for determination of low limits of detection (LOD) and for comparing results between labs. International standards have been developed to ameliorate these issues, but there are significant ongoing challenges with these efforts. Here we address these challenges through the development of a multiplexed reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay, and provide a direct comparison between samples run using the International Standardized qPCR and the new multiplexed RT-dPCR method.Digital PCR isolates individual single target molecules into compartments for endpoint PCR, with absolute quantification provided by simply counting the number of PCR-positive compartments. Using the RainDrop dPCR system, we partitioned each sample's target RNA molecules into a single-molecule droplet format, together with a one-step reverse transcription master mix (SuperScript III Platinum Taq, LifeTech) and standard qPCR hydrolysis probes/primers (IDT), for endpoint PCR and absolute quantification. We used a 4-plex multiplexed assay that counts 1) the e13\", 'a2 isoform of BCR', 'ABL; 2) the e14', \"a2 isoform of BCR-ABL; 3) GUSB RNA as an endogenous counting control, and; 4) a synthetic RNA as an exogenous control.Initial characterization of the multiplexed assay's specificity and sensitivity were performed using RNA from cell lines (K562 for e14\", 'a2; Invivoscribe clonal cell line for e13', 'a2 and e1', \"a2; U937 for a negative control). Samples derived from blood were split and quantified using either qPCR together with International Standard Protocols and reagents, or using the 4-plex RT-dPCR assay. Concordance and comparison of the two assay's LODs will be presented. Sensitivity assessment based on control generated data provides evidence of detection as low 1 in 200,000 without hitting a detection limit.The use of dPCR provides significant advantages over standard qPCR methods including absolute quantification which eliminates the need for standard curves, the ability to use RNA directly, the use of an exogenous control (non-ABL) and easy isoform analysis.\"]",
