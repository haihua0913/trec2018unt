We retrospectively collected clinical characteristics and survival data of the patients, and analyzed EGFR expression on tissue microarrays from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of primary tumor tissues by immunochemical staining (IHC). EGFR expression was scored to 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+ based on intensity of reactivity.Results', ' Of total 937 patients, 295 (31.5%) patients, 101 (10.8%) patients and 36 (3.8%) patients showed EGFR 1+, 2+, and 3+ expression by IHC, respectively. EGFR overexpression (2+/3+) is more frequently found in intestinal type than diffuse or mixed type (24.2% vs. 5.1%, P<0.001). In stage III disease according to AJCC 7th edition, unlike other stages, the patients with EGFR overexpression (2+/3+) had longer disease free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.639; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.434-0.938; P=0.022) and longer overall survival (HR, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.445-0.890, P=0.009) than other patients in univariate analysis. Additionally, in 279 patients who had stage III gastric cancer with diffuse type histology and received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based adjuvant chemotherapy, EGFR overexpression was favorable prognostic marker for overall survival (HR, 0.365; 95% CI, 0.161-0.827; P=0.016) in multivariate analysis, while old age and lymphovascular invasion were poor prognostic factors.Conclusion', ' EGFR overexpression was potentially favorable prognostic biomarker for stage III gastric cancer, especially in the patients who received 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy.']",

Methods', ' Two irinotecan-resistant gastric cancer cell lines, OCUM-2M/SN38 and OCUM-8/SN38, were respectively established by stepwise exposure to SN38 from the parent gastric cancer cell lines OCUM-2M and OCUM-8. The combination effects of two EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and lapatinib, with SN38 on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell-cycle on gastric cancer cells were examined.

Gefitinib is a specific and effective EGFR inhibitor that has shown antitumor activity in clinical trials against gastrointestinal cancers. Gastric tumors can become resistant to gefitinib. However, molecular mechanisms that mediate resistance to gefitinib remain poorly understood. Methods', ' The expression of DARPP-32 in the multi-step carcinogenesis cascade was examined using IHC analysis. Cell survival was determined by clonogenic survival and ATP-Glo assays. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin-V and immunoblot analyses. The association between DARPP-32 and EGFR was evaluated by immunofluorescence and co-IP assays. Results', ' The composite expression score progressively increased significantly from normal or gastritis to adenocarcinoma (p<0.001). Overexpression of DARPP-32 in MKN-28 cells blocked gefitinib-induced apoptosis and increased the drugs IC50 10-fold, compared to that of control cells (P<0.01). And DARPP-32 expressing MKN-28 cells had activated the PI3K-AKT pathway as compared to control cells. The three-way co-IP experiments demonstrated the existence of DARPP-32, EGFR, and ERBB3 in the same protein complex. DARPP-32 enhanced EGFR-ERBB3 heterodimerization promoting phosphorylation of ERBB3, and then activated the PI3K-AKT pathway. Following treatment with gefitinib (25 M) overnight, MKN-28 cells expressing DARPP-32 displayed stable protein levels of EGFR. The knockdown of endogenous DARPP-32 by DARPP-32 shRNA in SNU-16 cell lines reversed these signaling effects and increased sensitivity to gefitinib (p<0.01).  Conclusions', ' Our results suggest that DARPP-32 overexpression may participate in the progression to neoplasia. DARPP-32 also plays a role in increasing the stability of EGFR protein; DARPP-32 promotes resistance of gastric cancer cells to gefitinib by promoting interaction between EGFR and ERBB3 and activating PI3KAKT signaling.

        "Background":"['Gastric cancer is the world third leading cause of cancer mortality. In spite of the significant therapeutic advances, the overall clinical outcome for patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor, with 5-20% 5-year survival. The only targeted therapy approved so far are trastuzumab, and Ramucirumab which have given unsatisfactory results. Around 50% of gastric tumors bear genetic alterations affecting tyrosine kinase pathways (mainly EGFR, HER3, FGFR2 and MET pathways, besides HER2) but their clinical validation as tumor drivers is missing. The need for new therapeutic options and the possible presence of druggable targets prompted us to investigate potential targeted therapies for this disease.Our project aims at identifying and validating targeted therapeutic strategies in gastric cancer, through the generation of a platform of gastric tumor patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), animal models in which tumor surgical specimens are directly transferred into mice. Upon engraftment, the tumor is split and re-implanted in a cohort of mice, allowing the simultaneous testing of different drugs on the same tumor. Thanks to the establishment of a network of 15 Italian centers for samples collection, we generated around 80 gastric PDXs and successfully derived cell lines and organoids from engrafted tumors. Among the tumors collected so far, we found HER2, EGFR, FGFR2, MET and KRAS amplifications. This gastric PDX platform will be exploited for', ' 1) Validation of candidate oncogenes as relevant targets and identification of efficient therapeutic strategies 2) Identification of novel molecular targets; 3) identification of genetic predictors of response/resistance.In the PDX platform we identified one tumor bearing a high level of MET gene amplification (26 gene copies). We thus performed a preclinical study on a cohort of patient-derived xenografts generated from the MET-amplified gastroesophageal tumor. Despite the high amplification level, MET inhibitors induced only a partial response, while the combined anti-MET/EGFR treatment led to complete tumor regression. Most important, the combo treatment also prevented resistance onset. This data represent the proof of concept that a combined anti-MET/EGFR therapy can be more effective than anti-MET treatment alone in MET-amplified gastroesophageal tumors, in the absence of EGFR genetic lesions.']",

        "Background":"['Despite an overall decline, gastric cancer incidence remains high in Asian countries including China, Japan and South Korea. Five-year survival rates continue to improve in early stage disease through an aggressive combination of surgery and chemo/radiotherapy, primarily using fluoropyrimidine and platinum agent combinations. In advanced disease, the TOGA trial provided clinical validation of a role for HER2 in driving tumor progression in a subset of gastric cancer (GC) patients. However, recent clinical studies with EGFR targeting antibodies in GC have failed to show promise (EXPAND and REAL3 trials). Nonetheless, the dismal prognosis associated with late stage disease and the frequent implication of dysregulated HER family signaling in GC necessitate further investigation.AZD8931 is an orally bioavailable, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 signaling(1).To evaluate the potential utility of this agent in clinical GC, we examined HER family gene amplification and expression in GC tissue samples and sought to correlate these profiles with response to AZD8931 in GC tumor xenograft models. High Her2 expression (IHC3+ or IHC2+/FISH+ve) was confirmed in 17.4% of tumours (20/115). Importantly, high level EGFR (44.4%, 48/108) and HER3 (89.3%, 92/103) protein expression was also detected in our cohort of Chinese GC samples. Gastric cancer cell panel screening (n=25 lines) identified a number of AZD8931-sensitive cell lines with a range of HER family expression profiles (GI50 range 0.02 to 0.35M). In the NUGC3 xenograft model (high EGFR expression), twice-daily oral dosing of AZD8931 elicited potent, dose-responsive anti-tumour activity at well-tolerated doses (98% TGI at 6mg/kg/bid, 108% TGI at 12.5mg/kg/bid, all P<0.0001) and anti-tumour efficacy correlated well with pharmacodynamic modulation of phospho-HER signaling. To investigate the translational relevance of these data, primary GC models with varying HER family protein expression profiles were identified and established. Within these models, AZD8931 anti-tumor efficacy correlated broadly with strong HER pathway activation (0 to 83% TGI at 12.5mg/kg/bid). We further evaluated the activity of AZD8931 in combination with cisplatin/5-FU, 1st line standard of care chemotherapies commonly used in the treatment of gastric cancer. Using a primary GC xenograft model, AZD8931 demonstrated additive benefit when used at well tolerated doses (minimal body weight loss). These data support the potential clinical utility of AZD8931 for the therapeutic treatment of gastric cancers exhibiting strong HER pathway signaling.1 Hickinson et al.

        "Background":"['The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) are receptor tyrosine kinases that each plays a key role in cancer signaling.Co-expression and activation of MET and EGFR are found in a number of tumor types, including non-small cell lung, colorectal, gastric, and head and neck cancers (Nanjo et al. 2013). Blocking one receptor tends to up-regulate the other, leading to resistance to single-agent treatment (Engelman et al. 2007). Amplification of MET and/or high levels of HGF expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with intrinsic or acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR (Engelman et al. 2007; Yano et al. 2011). Conversely, MET-amplified lung cancer cells exposed to MET-inhibiting agents for a prolonged period develop resistance via the EGFR pathway (McDermott et al. 2010). The crosstalk between the MET and EGFR pathways suggests that dual inhibition of these targets may lead to improved outcomes for patients with MET- and EGFR-positive cancers, and that simultaneous inhibition may overcome or delay resistance compared to the blockade of just a single pathway. LY3164530 is an engineered mAb-scFv bispecific antibody that consists of an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody to MET and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to EGFR fused to the N-terminus of each heavy chain (HC). LY3164530 binds to extracellular domains of MET and EGFR with high affinity and inhibits signaling via both MET and EGFR receptors by blocking ligand binding and internalizing and degrading both receptors. In tumor cells, it binds and co-immunoprecipitates both receptors. LY3164530 has increased avidity binding to MET in cells expressing higher level of EGFR. This increased avidity binding leads to better neutralization of HGF compared to parental MET antibody in these cells. Surprisingly, LY3164530 has superior activity in internalizing/degrading EGFR (wild type and mutant forms) in vitro and in vivo relative to the combination of LY2875358 (i.e., emibetuzumab) and cetuximab in cells expressing high MET and EGFR. In addition, LY3164530 has superior activity in overcoming HGF-mediated resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, or vemurafenib as compared to the combination of individual monoclonal antibodies targeting these receptors in cell-based assays. In vivo, administration of LY3164530 results in dose-dependent antitumor activity in multiple cell line-derived NSCLC and gastric xenografts. The antitumor activity of LY3164530 is equivalent, and in some cases superior to the combination of emibetuzumab and cetuximab in NSCLC and gastric tumor models.

Results', '  Among the 130 patients treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, 47 were receiving AS (AS group), while the remaining 83 patients were not receiving AS (non-AS group). The overall response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) in the subject population were 60.9% and 10.0 months, respectively. In the sub-analysis carried out in the AS and non-AS groups, the ORR was 61.7% in the AS group and 60.5% in the non-AS group (p = 0.89), and the median PFS was 8.7 in the AS group and 10.7 months in the non-AS group (p = 0.13). Thus, no significant difference in the ORR or PFS was observed between the AS and non-AS groups. The median overall survival in the subject population was 31.2 months. In regard to the toxicity, the frequencies of rash (83% vs. 86%, p = 0.60) and diarrhea (34% vs. 29%, p = 0.55) were similar in the AS and non-AS groups.

HDAC6 has been shown to be involved in carcinogenic transformation and to modulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in several cancers by way of the regulations of several critical cellular functions, but the biological roles in gastric carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that HDAC6 is aberrantly over-expressed in a subset of gastric cancer, and that targeted-inactivation of HDC6 caused cell cycle and cell death pathways-independent growth inhibition. Additional experiments evidenced that ectopic overexpression of HDAC6 sustains epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in EGF-stimulated gastric cancer cells. In addition, we found that HDAC6 inactivation recovered rabaptin 5, a Rab5 interacting protein potentiating Rab5, a small GTPase that regulates early endocytic events. These findings suggest that aberrant overexpression of HDAC6 confers gastric cancer cells to sustain EGF-signaling by retardation of EGFR degradation by way of repression of rababtin-5, and HDAC6 is a bona fide target for therapeutic intervention in gastric cancers.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Epiregulin (EREG), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induces cell growth by binding to the EGFR. Expression of EREG affects sensitivity to cetuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway. The mechanism through which EREG is regulated is largely unknown, but a methyl-array study performed by our group revealed that EREG is methylated in gastric cancer cells. In the present study, we found that EREG gene expression was low in seven out of 11 gastric cancer cells and this down-regulation was mediated by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG promoter. Treatment with 5-aza-CdR restored EREG expression and demethylated the CpG sites in the EREG promoter. Compared to DNMT1, knockdown of DNMT3b significantly increased the expression of EREG mRNA and led to the demethylation of specific CpG sites in the EREG promoter, suggesting that DNMT3b primarily regulates the CpG methylation and silencing of EREG gene. EREG methylation was observed in 30% (4/13) of human primary gastric tumor tissues. In addition to DNA methylation, results from a ChIP assay demonstrated that transcriptional levels of EREG were associated with the enrichment of active histone markers (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and of a repressive marker (H3K27me2). Treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased the low occupancy of H3K4me3 and AcH3, while decreasing the high enrichment of H3K27me2, indicating that dynamic histone modifications contribute to EREG regulation in addition to DNA methylation. Lastly, the combination of 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results of our study demonstrated for the first time that EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells by aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification.']",

        "Background":"['Signaling by the Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activates multiple downstream signaling pathways that promote cell migration and invasive growth. Cells that overexpress and are addicted to Met also require Met signaling to sustain cell survival. Thus, a number of specific small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to target Met in the clinic. Although several successes of RTK-targeted therapies are acknowledged, several have limited long-term success clinically, due to development of drug resistance. Initiation of RTK signaling cascades leads to the activation of a number of downstream signaling molecules, but prolonged activation also triggers negative feedback loops that function in part to abrogate this signaling. Hence, targeted inhibition of Met, in addition to suppressing Met-dependent signaling, may also release cells from negative feedback mechanisms and allow the reactivation of signaling pathways, that may promote resistance to Met inhibition. As MET amplification occurs in 10-20% of gastric cancers, to identify core Met dependent signaling pathways activated in Met dependent cancers we have used four different gastric cancer cell lines that exhibit amplification, overexpression, and constitutive activation of Met. Upon inhibition of Met with a small-molecule inhibitor, we observe abrogation of several downstream signaling pathways at both the protein phosphorylation and transcript level. Interestingly, as Met has been demonstrated to cross-talk with the EGF receptor family, we also observe a decrease in the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3 upon treatment with Met inhibitor, and a decrease in expression of EGFR ligands. Conversely, Met inhibition results in an elevation in expression of HER3 transcript and protein in all 4 cell lines, implicating Met signaling in HER3 repression, and inhibition of Met may release HER3 from this negative regulation. As increases in HER3 phosphorylation and expression occur in other models (such as breast or lung cancer cell lines) upon treatment with EGFR, HER2, or AKT inhibitors, and high HER3 expression is strongly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer; hence, the loss of negative regulation of HER3, downstream from Met, may ultimately contribute to clinical efficacy, or lack thereof, of Met inhibitors.']",

Informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment. Results', ' Computed tomography (CT) scan evaluation revealed that partial response (PR) occurred in 25% (2/8) patients and other 75% (6/8) showed stable disease (SD). There was no progressive disease (PD) occurred. Hypertension is one of the most frequent adverse reactions, which appeared in 50% (4/8) patients who were getting to be normal under antihypertensive agent. Others like hand-foot syndrome, anergy and temple elevated urine protein also appeared and could be better controlled. Conclusions', ' Apatinib is a safe and effective oral targeted drug on EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with TKI resistance. It could provide a new therapy strategy for them before taking osimertinib. To further investigate the role of Apatinib in drug resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC, large sample and additional clinical trials are needed. Table1. Clinicopathologic Characteristics of Patients.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Gastric cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, notably in Asia. Though targeted therapies have been under clinical evaluation, the biological complexity of this cancer type may confer resistance to single-targeted therapies. Especially, scirrhous phenotype is known to be affected by multiple growth factors. To overcome this biological complexity, multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (MTKIs) have been clinically tested and were reported to be effective in a subset of patients. We wanted to elucidate the kinase activity signature of gastric cancer and to explore predictive biomarkers of MTKIs using gastric cancer cell lines by tyrosine kinase activity profiling.Material and methods', ' The growth-inhibitory effect of the MTKIs sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 was evaluated by the MTT assay. 11 scirrhous and 14 non-scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines were grown until semi-confluent, lysed, aliquoted and stored at -80C until use. The basal tyrosine kinase activity of the lysates was measured on PamChip peptide micro-arrays, containing 144 peptides derived from known human phosphorylation sites. Quantification of peptide phosphorylation and data analysis were performed using BioNavigator and SIMCA P+ software.Results', ' HSC-39, HSC-40A, KATO-III and HSC-43 scirrhous cells and SNU-16 non-scirrhous cells were sensitive to all three MTKIs with IC50 values < 1 mol/L. Orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of basal tyrosine kinase activity profiles showed a clear segregation between sensitive cell lines and insensitive cell lines. Levels of putative target proteins such as PDGFR, VEGFR, Raf and Kit did not correlate with the sensitivity. All sensitive cell lines turned out to harbor an FGFR2 amplification suggesting that FGFR2 amplification may be a predictive biomarker of response to MTKI treatment. Kinases such as EGFR, EPHA, FGFR, IGF1R, INSR and Src contributed to this segregation suggesting that these are relevant to the sensitivity to MTKIs. MET overexpressing cell lines were resistant to treatment with the four inhibitors. Scirrhous cells were segregated from non-scirrhous cells by OPLS-DA among cell lines with signet-ring cell carcinoma cytology with R2, 0.994; Q2, 0.615. EGFR, ERBB2, 3, 4, EPHAs, FAK, IGF1R, INSR, MAP2Ks, RET and SRC seemed to be responsible for the segregation suggesting that they play an important role in scirrhous gastric cancer biology.Conclusions', ' Kinase activity profiles reflect the biological complexity of gastric cancer. FGFR2 status correlates with sensitivity to sunitinib, pazopanib and sorafenib, whereas MET status does not. These data imply that tyrosine kinase activity profiling with PamChip peptide arrays can be utilized to identify molecular targets and predictive biomarkers in gastric cancer and this should be further explored.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of death from cancer globally. Sigma-2 Receptor/Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (S2R/Pgrmc1) is a cytochrome-related protein and it is upregulated in multiple types of cancer. S2R/Pgrmc1 binds to several proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and regulates the EGFR signaling in lung and breast cancer cells, as we previously showed. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), a member of EGFRs family, has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic target for GC due to an identified link between expression of HER2 and severity of GC. Several HER2 inhibitors are currently under investigation in Phase I and II clinical trials. Most of them inhibit ligand binding or kinase activity of HER2. Here, we suggest that HER2 is a novel molecular target of S2R/Pgrmc1, thus, inhibiting S2R/Pgrmc1 can be a potential therapeutic strategy for GC.Results', ' We found that the protein expression of S2R/Pgrmc1 is elevated in human gastric cancer tissue array and in multiple gastric cancer cell lines such as AGS, NCI-N87, and Hs 746T. Approximately 60% of GC cells have moderate to strong staining of S2R/Pgrmc1 as compared to weak staining noted in normal gastric cells, suggesting an association of S2R/Pgrmc1 with pathogenesis of GC. We also found that S2R/Pgrmc1 was inhibited by AG205, an inhibitor of PGRMC1, in concentration-dependent manner in NCI-N87 GC cell line. Consistently, AG205 inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner (p-value = 0.025). HER2 is a prognostic marker in GC and overexpression of protein level of HER2 is associated with tumor growth. We found that HER2 expression was decreased in AG205 treated NCI-N87 in concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that AG205 enhanced the sensitivity of Herceptin, an anti-HER2 antibody that inhibits tumor growth. Akt, a downstream target of HER2, is overexpressed in GC, and regulates tumorigenic properties of cancer cells including tumor growth and survival. Here, we demonstrated that concomitant treatment of the GC cells with Herceptin and AG205 significantly decreased Akt protein level as compared to control cells or cell treated with Herceptin alone. Consistently, the viability of the cells was significantly lower in combination treatment group (p-value = 0.009), as compared to groups treated with Herceptin or AG205 alone.Conclusion', ' We have demonstrated that S2R/Pgrmc1 promotes proliferation of GC cell line and regulates the expression of HER2.

        "Background":"['Background & Aims. Tumor-associated macrophages, predominantly polarized to M2 phenotype, produce mediators, such as EGF and HB-EGF, to promote tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. It is clear that activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) in tumor cells accelerates tumorigenesis. However, therapy to inhibit EGFR activity is not universally efficacious, suggesting possible resistance of EGFR inhibition in tumor cells or different functions of EGFR in other cell types for tumor cell growth. We have demonstrated that activation of EGFR in macrophages down-regulates IL-10 and up-regulates TNF production in response to inflammatory stimuli. This study was designed to determine the roles of EGFR activation in M2 polarization of macrophages and proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric epithelial cells. Methods. Mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages and peritoneal macrophages isolated from wt and kinase-defective Egfrwa5 mice were treated with IL-4 (10 g/ml), to induce M2 polarization, for 15 min to 24 h in the presence or absence of an EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478. EGFR activation and expression of M2 markers, Arg1 and YM1 were detected by Western blot and real time PCR, respectively. Conditioned media from IL-4 treated macrophages was used to treat mouse conditionally immortalized stomach epithelial cells (ImSt) and ImSt with EGFR knock out (EGFR/ImSt). Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay and EdU labeling and EMT by real time PCR analysis of Snail and vimentin expression. Results. IL-4 transactivated EGFR in RAW 264.7 and peritoneal macrophages from wt mice. Inhibition of EGFR kinase activity by AG1478 enhanced IL-4-stimulated Arg1 and YM1 expression in RAW 264.7 cells. IL-4-stimulated Arg1 and YM1 expression in peritoneal macrophages from Egfrwa5 mice was significantly higher than those from wt mice, which suggests that EGFR activation suppresses M2 polarization. Conditioned-media from IL-4-reated RAW 264.7 cells stimulated EGFR activation, cell proliferation, and Snail and vimentin expression in ImSt, but not in ImSt EGFR/ cells, which suggests that EGFR in gastric epithelial cells is required for M2 macrophahe-producted factors to promote growth and EMT. IL-4 treatment of ImSt did not show any of these effects, Furthermore, proliferation in ImSt by conditioned media from IL-4-treated peritoneal macrophages from Egfrwa5 mice was significantly higher than that by macrophages from wt mice, indicating that activation of EGFR in macrophages suppresses production of factors for promoting gastric epithelial cell growth. Conclusion. EGFR activation in macrophages inhibits M2 polarization and production of growth factors for gastric epithelial cell growth and EMT. These results provide novel information to understand cell-type specific (epithelial vs macrophage) EGFR activation in regulation of tumorigenesis.']",

The positive rate of Hsp90beta in gastric cancer (GC) tissue was approximately 30%, and was higher than non-cancerous gastric mucosa. Hsp90 inhibitors should have great potentials in the exploration for treatment strategy in gastric cancer (GC). NYP-AUY922-AG (AUY922), kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG, is a novel resorcinylic isoxazole amide Hsp90 inhibitor. Using 72-hour MTT colorimetric assay, we have demonstrated that AUY922 has highly active growth inhibitory effects as a single agent of IC50 in the nanomolar ranges between 8.1  0.2 and 14.7  0.8 nM in the gastric cancer cell line panels (except c-met-overexpressing KATO-III cells with a IC50 of 158.1  5.1 nM). In the gastric cancer MKN45 xenograft model, MKN45 cells (2  106) were injected subcutaneously in 100 l of Matrigel/Hanks balanced salt solution to the flank of nude mice. AUY922 50 mg/kgw and 100 mg/kgw intraperitoneal weekly injection (i.p.) were used. Tumor inhibitory effects of AUY922 in the MKN45 human gastric cancer xenograft model were statistically evident in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Several important growth factor receptors are overexpressed in GC, namely EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor, HER1), HER-2/neu, and c-met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor, HGF receptor), etc. By immunohistochemical staining of xenograft tumor tissues using specific antibodies, AUY922 100 mg/kgw i.p. weekly significantly down regulates multiple growth factor receptors and oncoproteins, including c-met, HER-2/neu, IGF1-R, EGFR, Akt, and notably thymidylate synthase (TS), etc. While the effects of AUY922 50 mg/kgw are less statistically significant. Up to date, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or oral fluoropyrimidines are the current mainstay agents for first-line treatment in gastric cancer. By combining AUY922 100 mg/kgw i.p. and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 40 mg/kgw i.p. weekly (wk), tumor inhibitory effects of AUY922 and 5-FU were synergistically effective. Combining AUY922 50 mg/kgw or 100 mg/kgw i.p. weekly and other relevant chemotherapeutic agents has been also actively exploring. Our data indicate that AUY922 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inhibits tumors synergistically in gastric cancer MKN45 xenograft via down regulation of multiple pivotal growth factor receptors and oncoproteins.

It induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in all three cell lines, together with the related markers affected significantly. Mechanistically, ganetespib caused pronounced decrease of expression of classic HSP90 client proteins. Specifically, it greatly affected EGFR signaling cascades by dramatically decreasing levels of total EGFR and EGFR on cell membranes. EGFR knockdown also induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis accompanied with a decrease of several EGFR downstream proteins. These results strongly support EGFR signaling greatly contributes to the ganetespib inhibitory effects. Besides, we found the responses of GC cell lines to ganetespib correlated well with their EGFR expression levels', ' MGC-803, as well as AGS and BGC-803, with higher EGFR expression responded to ganetespib better, while SGC-7901 and MKN-28 with lower EGFR levels were much less sensitive to ganetespib. Though SGC-7901 and MKN-28 were not very sensitive to ganetespib, ganetespib worked synergistically with radiation and cisplatin in killing them. Importantly, ganetespib significantly inhibited growth of xenograft tumors in vivo as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. Results of H&E staining, TUNEL assays, and immunohistochemistry staining of pCDK1, EGFR, and Ki-67 revealed significant differences in ganetespib-treated tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that ganetespib, as a new potent treatment option, can be used for the molecularly targeted therapy of GC patients according to their expression profiles of EGFR.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway due to receptor overexpression, gene amplification, point mutations or fusions/chromosomal translocations is associated with cancer development and progression. In gastric cancer, alterations of FGFR2 are observed in a subset of patients, overexpression being more frequently observed as compared to FGFR2 amplifications. In addition, FGFR2 amplification and ERBB2, EGFR, MET and KRAS amplifications are mutually exclusive suggesting that FGFR targeted therapy would be most effective in the FGFR2-amplified subgroup of patients. Debio 1347 (CH5183284) is an oral selective FGFR inhibitor currently in clinical development. The aim of the study was to investigate the preclinical activity of Debio 1347 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models harboring diverse FGFR alterations in multiple indications, including gastric cancer.The mouse trial was conducted in 39 different PDX models selected according to FGFR1, 2 and 3 alterations status. Debio 1347 was administered orally once daily and tumor volume was monitored for 14 consecutive days. PDX tumors were extensively characterized using FISH, RNAseq, nCounter Gene Expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and FGFR molecular alterations were correlated with Debio 1347 efficacy. The level of tumor heterogeneity for FGFR2 amplification and expression and its impact on drug response were also assessed.In gastric cancer, Debio 1347 induced tumor regression in models harboring the commonly found FGFR2 amplification. Interestingly, Debio 1347 was also highly effective in models with high FGFR2 expression but without FGFR2 amplification, indicating that not only gene amplification drives the activity of Debio 1347 in this indication, but also the expression level of FGFR2.Altogether, these data demonstrate that Debio 1347 could be highly effective in gastric cancer patients harboring FGFR2 amplification and/or high FGFR2 expression.

Moreover, we detected 7 PDXs harboring PIK3CA activating mutations (E545K, Q546K, H1047R) and 2 PDXs with PTEN loss. Whether PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors could turn over the primary or acquired resistance of anti-HER2 therapies remains further researches. Genes in the cell cycle pathway altered in 70% of the 50 PDXs. The mutation rates of TP53, BRCA1 and BRCA2 were 28%, 8% and 14%. We also detected amplifications of CCNE1, CCND1 and MYC in 16%, 6% and 20% of the xenografts.

The molecular makeup of tumors of the same type can also vary. When developing drugs for the treatment of stomach cancer it is important to study tumors in both Asian and Caucasian backgrounds. In East Asia stomach cancer is the 2nd most common malignancy. The development of patient derived xenografts (PDX) from patients of East Asian origin is therefore critical. Oncotest established xenografts from stomach cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of their cancer at the Seoul National University, South Korea. These Asian gastric cancer xenografts (GXA) were utilized for the investigation of molecular characteristics and sensitivity to anticancer agents.Material and Methods', ' 78 gastric tumor samples from SNU were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and sequentially passaged. Tumor material was collected for molecular profiling, including mutational analysis by Sanger sequencing and OncoCarta panels I, II, III.

The majority of tumors from which GXA xenografts were derived were poorly or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. The panel also includes mucinous adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. The morphological features of the tumors (degree of differentiation) were preserved throughout serial passages.Mutational analysis for 18 established models revealed that TP53 (13/18, 72%), PTEN (6/9, as well as one with PTEN RNA levels too low for RT-PCR), KRAS (5/18, 28%) and PIK3CA (4/18, 22%) were frequently mutated in these gastric cancers. Mutations in EGFR, MLH1 and APC were also detected, but no mutations in NRAS (0/18) or BRAF (0/17) were found.Regarding sensitivity to anticancer agents, the response of the tumors varied strongly. Tumors were considered sensitive if the optimal treatment / control (T/C [%]) value was lower than 30%. 6 of 18 (33%) tumors were sensitive to 5-fluoruracil, 5 of 18 (28%) to paclitaxel and 3/18 (17 %) to cisplatin. Some gastric PDX were responsive to more than one chemotherapy, whereas 7 of 18 (39%) were not sensitive to any of these standard of care therapies.These results demonstrate (i) that standard of care therapies are not the therapy of choice for a large proportion of these tumors and (ii) great heterogeneity within the 18 analyzed gastric Asian patient- derived xenografts.Conclusion', ' In this study we developed a panel of Asian patient-derived gastric cancer xenografts with diverse molecular characteristics and responses to standard of care drugs.']",

        "Background":"['Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most common used assay for detecting/quantifying defined protein biomarkers in specific tissue location in clinical/preclinical settings as prognostic/drug-predictive biomarker assays. However, IHC suffers from several key drawbacks, limiting its applications, including semi-quantitative nature, inconsistence, low sensitivity, narrow dynamic detection range and inadequacy for multi-target analysis, etc. An alternative method is immunofluorescence (IF), but with even lower usage for its disadvantageous photo-instability. A sensitive, quantitative and robust assay is thus an urgent/unmet need. We have recently developed a novel fluorescence nanoparticle (PID, phosphor integrated dye) with highly compact phosphor inside. PID has several key advanced features', ' 1) enhanced fluorescence (30,000x brighter over the conventional fluorescence and significantly above tissue auto-fluorescence), 2) enhanced photo-stability (stained slide is stable for >2 years); 3) highly quantitative by broadened detection dynamic range through enumeration of the bright fluorescent dots (nanoparticles) instead of signal amplification as in IHC (digital vs. analog); 4) fine subcellular imaging; 5) potentials for multi-color and H&E/bright light imaging. PDX is a well-accepted experimental cancer model mimicking original patients in histo- & molecular pathology(1), as well as drug response. We previously conducted a series of mouse clinical trial (MCT) of Erbitux on PDX cohorts of NSCLC, CRC, gastric and esophageal cancers (2,3), showing specific subsets of high-EGRF-expressing PDXs responded to the drug, where EGFR expression was measured by either RNAseq (mRNA) or IHC (protein). To assess PID-EGFR as a new biomarker assay platform, we analysed and compared its quantification to RNAseq and IHC, particularly in terms of the correlation to the drug efficacy. Our data demonstrates a greatly enhanced correlation of PID scores to mRNA levels in all cancer types, and to the tumor growth inhibition of gastric (3) and esophageal (4) carcinoma, but not in CRC (2) and NSCLC (Li et al., unpublished) as anticipated.

The clinical successes of HER2 directed therapies are well known in breast cancer and more recently, in gastric cancer. However, resistance develops invariably and gastric cancer continues to be a largely unmet disease necessitating novel therapeutic interventions. Recent reports have highlighted HER3 as an emerging target as it is frequently overexpressed, mutated, preferentially dimerizes with HER2 to activate signaling and is induced as a result of de novo or acquired resistance to PI3K-AKT, MAPK and RTK pathway inhibitors. We explored the utility of an ADCC and CDC enhanced potent anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody (GSK2849330) as a single agent or in combination with a selective small molecule AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of gastric cancer.A panel of 15 HER3 mutant and 4 HER3 wildtype PDX models was screened in vivo for responses to GSK2849330 as measured by% tumor growth inhibition (%TGI). Several models were characterized for other molecular alterations (e.g. HER2, PTEN, HER3, etc.) and represented various subsets of gastric cancer. As a single agent administered at 25mg/kg IP BIW, GSK2849330 was modestly effective (TGI  50%) in 2/15 mutant and 2/4 wildtype models. While context is likely to matter to drive dependence on HER3, no obvious predictive markers were observed. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) administered at 60mg/kg PO QD in a HER3 wildtype, PTEN deficient model. This resulted in significant durable tumor growth inhibition (94% TGI) with improved survival and noticeable tumor regression in a few mice in the combination treatment group relative to either single agent groups. Tumor samples collected at the end of the study showed pronounced pharmacodynamic modulation of p-AKT and p-HER3, demonstrating on target activity of these agents.Taken together, our findings suggest that modest anti-tumor activity was elicited by GSK2849330 as monotherapy in select gastric PDX models with no clear associations between response and HER3 mutations or other known markers. However, robust durable activity was observed upon combination with GSK2110183. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence supporting the rational combination of a selective AKT inhibitor (GSK2110183) and an anti-HER3 therapeutic antibody (GSK2849330), both of which are actively undergoing clinical trials and warrant further investigation in gastric cancer.']",

The genetic alternations of ABL and EGFR are classical examples of RTK-dependent oncogenesis. Recent data suggest that non mutated RTK signaling can form feedback pathways to serve as resistant mechanism against targeted therapies. Here, we examined the regulation of RTK signaling by a potent cMET inhibitor, INC280 (enzymatic EC50 against c-MET = 0.13 nM), in a cMET-dependent human gastric tumor model Hs746.T.Hs746.T is a heavily cMET dependent cell line with both cMET amplication (12.9 copies) and mutation (G-T mutation at slice donor site to cause juxtamembrane domain deletion). This model is exquisitely sensitive to cMET inhibitor, INC280 in vitro (GI50 = 9 nM) and in vivo. The treatment of INC280 lead to significant inhibition of pcMET. Furthermore, the treatment of INC280 resulted in the suppression of pEGFR, though INC280 does not actively inhibit EGFR (enzymatic EC50 against EGFR > 10 microM). This result supports prior reports that cMET and EGFR can form physical complex, with cMET modulating EGFR activation. Consequently, INC280 inhibited downstream signaling nodes of pAKT, pS6RP, pMEK and pERK in Hs746.T.To examine the RTK signaling underlying possible treatment relapse, we treated Hs746.T cells chronically in vitro under increasing concentrations of INC280. After 8 weeks of treatment, Hs746.T-R cells were generated that grew at 600 nM of INC280. RTK signaling was examined in Hs746.T-R cells under treatment of INC280. As expected, cMET signaling was significantly curtailed in Hs746.T-R cells, as was pEGFR. Interestingly, pPDGFRb was elevated in Hs746.T-R, compared to the parental cell line. We hypothesize that the increased signaling through PDGFRb may serve as resistance mechanism to INC280 in Hs746.T-R cells.In summary, we have examined RTK signaling in the cMET-dependent Hs746.T cell line. Our finding supported the notion of RTK cross-talk between cMET and EGFR in this setting.

These genetic mutations are generally linked to particular types of cancer. Oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is essential for NSCLC development and growth. However, the precise roles of EGFR in lung cancer metabolism are still unclear. Here we show that glucose (Glc) metabolism is critical for EGFR stability required for tumor growth and survival. EGFR mutation leads to a robust increase in Glc uptake, lactate production and glycolytic flux. Moreover, EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines are much more sensitive than EGFR WT to inhibition of Glc metabolism through EGFR degradation, suggesting that EGFR mutant NSCLCs rely more heavily than EFGR WT on aerobic glycolysis. Knockdown of EGFR in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs results in a decrease in expression level of genes that encode glycolysis enzymes, indicating that EGFR mutation leads to an increase in Glc metabolism and Glc dependence for growth and survival. Furthermore, inhibition of Glc metabolism shows a significant decrease in intracellular ATP, oxygen consumption and level of TCA cycle intermediates. Indeed, the addition of pyruvate dramatically rescues apoptotic cell death caused by EGFR degradation upon inhibition of Glc metabolism, suggesting that Glc to fuel the TCA cycle is essential for tumor survival. In addition, the inhibition of Glc metabolism overcomes T790M-mediated resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Together, our data suggest that the EGFR mutation mediates the reprogramming of Glc metabolism and this metabolic alteration represents an attractive target for new therapy of EGFR-mutated NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' EGFR and IGF1R are implicated in the tumorigenesis of a broad panel of human cancers. Both receptors share common downstream pathways. Blocking the signaling pathway of either receptor can lead to compensatory activation of the other receptor pathway. In consequence, dual targeting of both molecules should lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity. The generation of a bi-specific, antibody-based molecule allows targeting both receptor pathways simultaneously with a single agent. We previously described Fv-based bi-specific DART (Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting) molecules for effector cell recruitment to specific tumor targets (Johnson et al., 2010 and Moore et al., 2011). Here we introduce the IgDART, a novel bi-specific IgG like antibody format anchored in the DART platform that supports the incorporation of two independent Fv while retaining an intact Fc region. We chose the EGFR-IGF1R pathways to demonstrate the IgDARTs potency in simultaneous targeting multiple signaling pathways in cancer cells. Methodology', ' Independent EGFRxIGF1R IgDART molecules comprising varying EGFR and IGF1R Fv regions were expressed in CHO cells, efficiently assembled and purified to homogeneity. IGF1R mAb specificities with different IGF1R binding and anti-cancer properties were evaluated to determine how effectively that range in properties could be supported in the IgDART structure. The binding properties of the IgDART molecules were evaluated on a cellular and protein level. The biological activity was determined across a panel of cell lines derived from human colon, lung, pancreatic, gastric, renal and breast cancer. Results', ' Analyses of the EGFRxIGF1R IgDART binding properties revealed they maintain those exhibited by the parental mAbs. This maintenance of binding properties was also reflected in the ability of independent EGFRxIGF1R IgDART molecules to correspondingly block growth of cancer cell lines dependent on either the EGFR or IGF1R growth pathways. A subset of colon cancer cell lines were identified that were particularly sensitive to the combined EGFR and IGFR growth inhibition by the EGFRxIGFR IgDARTs in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with the relative activity of the parental mAbs, the EGFRxIGF1R IgDARTs display corresponding effects on ligand dependant receptor activation and degradation, as well as inhibition of downstream signaling events as determined in multiplexed assays. Conclusion', ' The data support the utility of the IgDART platform for targeting the EGFR and IGF1R pathways. The interchangeable nature of the IgDART architecture makes it ideal for building molecules that simultaneously interfere with two independent signaling receptors with oncogenic potential.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induce oncogenic addiction in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). However, the linkage between oncogenic mutated EGFR and cancer metabolism has not yet been clearly elucidated. In this study, we measured extracellular lactate production, glucose consumption and the glucose-induced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) after the inhibition of EGFR signaling in LAD cell culture. Using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolomic techniques, the major intracellular metabolites in EGFR-mutated LAD cells were quantified in the absence or presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) erlotinib. The molecular profile regulating the metabolic enzymes at the transcriptional and post-translational levels was characterized by RT-PCR, Western blotting and flow cytometry. We demonstrated that EGFR signaling was required for lactate production, glucose consumption and glucose-induced ECAR, indicating that EGFR signaling promoted the Warburg effect in LAD cells. Moreover, comprehensive metabolomic analysis revealed that the levels of key intermediate metabolites in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were decreased after treatment with EGFR inhibitors. The glucose transport carried out by GLUT1 and GLUT3 was the most rapid and critically regulated function of glucose metabolism linked to EGFR signaling, although the expression of MYC-dependent glycolytic genes and the phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM2) were down-regulated by EGFR inhibition at a later time point. A modest down-regulation of both total and membrane-bound GLUT3 was also observed after EGFR inhibition. Despite an equivalent total amount of GLUT1 in LAD cells, the levels of membrane-bound GLUT1 was decreased by EGFR-TKI treatment, suggesting that EGFR signaling controlled GLUT1 function through post-translational modification. We concluded that EGFR signaling regulated aerobic glycolysis in EGFR-mutated LAD cells. Our data suggests that the glycolytic pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is a strong predictor of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, response duration is variable. The predictive value of EGFR mutation for response is superior to previously reported clinical predictors, namely female gender, Asian ethnicity, smoking status, and histology. It is unclear, however, whether any clinical characteristics have additive predictive value for duration of response to EGFR-TKI. Here, we attempted to identify clinical predictors of response duration to EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Methods', ' Review of a prospectively collected lung cancer patients database at a tertiary care hospital was performed. Stage IV EGFR-mutant patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 who received EGFR-TKI for  3 months, at any line of treatment, were included. The following variables were collected for purpose of analysis', ' age, gender, smoking status, tumor histology, specific EGFR mutation (exon 19 versus 21 mutation), ECOG PS, line of TKI treatment, and serum CRP levels. Chi square and t-test were used where appropriate. Univariate and mutivariate modeling was used to explore the predictive power of covariates. Results', ' One hundred ten patients with EGFR mutant stage IV lung cancer were included in this study. Patients were predominantly female (77%), never or light smokers (57%), with non-squamous histology (93%) and an exon 19 mutation (66%). Mean duration of treatment with EGFR-TKI was 14.4 (range 3-86) months. In univariate analysis, never-smoking status, exon 19 mutation and low serum CRP were predictive of a longer EGFR-TKI treatment duration. However, in multivariate analysis only exon 19 and CRP level were significantly associated with longer duration of response to EGFR-TKI. Conclusions', ' Gender, smoking status and ethnicity- although initially identified as predictors of response to EGFR-TKI in an unselected population- do not confer additional predictive potential of treatment response duration in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients.

[Results] Suppression of HSP70 by siRNA increased gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivities and enhanced gefitinib binding to this receptor, in 293_p15 cells. Same phenomena were observed when HSP70 was inhibited by HSP70 specific inhibitor, 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES). PES inhibits HSP70 binding to the mutant EGFR. Interestingly, this compound enhanced the EGFR autophosphorylation and c-Cbl binding to the receptor in 293_p15 cells.

        "Background":"['Although epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is a rational targeted drug with dramatic survival benefit in lung cancer, susceptibility to the drug is restricted in lung cancer with activating mutations of EGFR. Nevertheless, the EGFR-TKI still remains an attractive anticancer drug in lung cancer with wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate unknown mechanism which can contribute to response of the EGFR targeted therapy using gefitinib, a well-known EGFR-TKI, in eight lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. We first examined differential effects of gefitinib on cell survival, morphology, motility, cell cycle and EGFR signaling between the TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells. As a result, although the TKI-resistant cells did not show any changes in cell phenotype by gefitinib treatment, phosphorylation of EGF induced EGFR and downstream effectors was inhibited by the drug treatment as if those in the TKI-sensitive cells. Additionally, we found difference in cellular distribution of EGF induced EGFR after gefitinib treatment between the TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells and it was associated with EGFR endocytosis. Based on our results, we next investigated that regulation of EGFR endocytosis could affect on the response of gefitinib in lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. Inhibition of EGFR endocytosis by combination treatment with gefitinib and two endocytosis inhibitors, dynasore and dynole 34-2, led to significantly decreased cell viability in the TKI-resistant cells compared with treatment of these drugs alone. Moreover, the reduced cell survival after the combination treatment was concerned with increased apoptotic cell death, accompanying by elevated cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Survivin and Livin among anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, we found differentially expressed Rab25, a member of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases, between the TKI-sensitive and-resistant cells through genome-wide gene expression analysis. The expression status of Rab25 was partially associated with response of gefitinib in lung cancer cells with wtEGFR. Furthermore, the silencing of Rab25 in the TKI-sensitive cells with its normal expression reversed sensitivity to gefitinib treatment. In conclusion, our results provided molecular evidences that EGFR endocytosis might contribute to cell survival and response to the EGFR-TKI as a bypass survival mechanism in lung cancer with wtEGFR. Thus, targeting EGFR endocytosis could help us to overcome therapeutic limitation of EGFR-TKI in lung cancer with wtEGFR and Rab25 expression may be an important tool for predicting efficacy of the drug treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Triple-negative breast cancers have a poor prognosis and lack an effective targeted therapeutic. Even though 50% of triple-negative breast cancers express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), they are resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Although the activation of several tyrosine kinases including Met, c-Src, and IGF-IR have been found to correlate with EGFR TKI resistance, the mechanism of this de novo resistance is still being elucidated. The BT20 breast cancer cell line has amplified EGFR expression yet is resistant to EGFR TKIs. Phospho-proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins that remain phosphorylated after gefitinib treatment. These proteins included Raptor, PDK1, and GSK3, implicating the Akt and mTOR pathways in EGFR TKI resistance. Despite activation of these pathways, BT20 cells were resistance to the mTOR antagonist temsirolimus. However, temsirolimus was able to sensitize BT20 cells to gefitinib which led to a synergistic decrease in cell survival. Similar results have been observed by others using different inhibitors; however, the mechanism of this synergistic decrease in cell survival has not been identified. These data suggest that EGFR and mTOR activation regulate cell survival through parallel signaling pathways and that both pathways need to be inhibited to abrogate growth and survival. This is supported by the observation that the PI3Kinase/Akt signaling pathway was unaffected by gefitinib or temsirolimus treatment alone. In addition, the combination of EGFR and mTOR inhibitors had no effect on PI3Kinase/Akt or Ras/MAPK signaling, despite the synergistic decrease in cell survival. However, further immunoblotting showed a pronounced inhibition in activation of the eIF4 family in the mTOR translational control pathway with dual treatment of gefitinib and temsirolimus, an abrogation not significantly observed with either treatment alone. These results suggest that inhibiting mTOR signaling alone is insufficient to modulate the translational control pathway in BT20 cells and that EGFR signals independent of mTOR to activate this pathway. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation and subsequent regulation of these translational control molecules may be critical to the survival of BT20 cells. Indeed, the combination of gefitinib and temsirolimus stimulated apoptosis in BT20 cells, supporting the idea that inhibiting the mTOR pathway will sensitize breast cancers expressing EGFR to gefitinib inhibition. In summary, these data provide strong evidence for the presence of a de novo EGFR TKI resistance pathway in breast cancers that occurs through the activation of the mTOR pathway and therapy for EGFR positive breast cancers could be improved with dual treatment of EGFR TKI and an mTOR antagonist.']",

        "Background":"['EGFR mutant lung cancers are highly sensitive to first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; gefitinib and erlotinib), but resistance invariably develops. In the majority of patients, such acquired resistance is mediated by a second-site T790M mutation in EGFR. Second generation EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib, have minimal efficacy in patients with acquired resistance; by contrast, combinations of afatinib with cetuximab or panitumumab - anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies - are synergistic in pre-clinical models, and afatinib/cetuximab has shown a 30% response rate in a phase Ib trial for patients with acquired resistance. Sym004, currently in phase II trials, is a novel mixture of two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies binding non-overlapping epitopes in the extracellular domain III of EGFR. The primary mechanism of action of Sym004 is thought to be EGFR cross-linking, internalization and degradation of the EGFR from the cell surface. To determine if the combination of afatinib and Sym004 shows greater efficacy against TKI-resistant EGFR mutant lung cancer than afatinib combined with individual anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, we are investigating mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to afatinib plus Sym004 in EGFR mutant TKI-resistant lung cancer. Similar to cetuximab, Sym004 has minimal effect on the growth of EGFR mutant cells in 2D culture. However, Sym004 induces growth inhibition of TKI-resistant PC-9/BRc1 cells (EGFR exon 19 deletion/T790M) in soft agar and xenograft models, and afatinib plus Sym004 is more effective at inhibiting growth than either drug alone. In immunoblotting studies, the combination induces greater decrease of total EGFR than either drug alone or afatinib plus cetuximab. Using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Sym004 and confocal microscopy, the drug induces more efficient internalization and degradation of EGFR than cetuximab in H1975 cells (L858R/T790M). Additional confocal studies will be performed in other TKI-resistant EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. We are also assessing whether addition of Sym004 to TKIs can prevent or delay the acquisition of T790M-mediated resistance in vitro. Finally, we are developing cell lines from PC-9/BRc1and HCC827/R1 (exon 19 deletion/T790M) xenografts that develop resistance to either Sym004, cetuximab, or combinations with afatinib.

However, the potential molecular mechanism that expands the therapeutic benefit of EGFT-TKI in patients who have wild-type EGFR non-small cell lung cancer (wtEGFR NSCLC) remains unclear. Recently, several studies revealed EGFR endocytosis mechanism could mediate signal transductions that influence in cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, our previous study demonstrated that EGFR endocytosis is related to gefitinib sensitivity in wtEGFR NSCLC and EGFR endocytosis could be a novel therapeutic target in lung cancer with wtEGFR (Oncotarget. 2014 15;5(5)', '1265-78). In this study, we investigated whether EGFR-TKI resistance could be restored in wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines by endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (PAO). To investigate effects of PAO in vitro, we analyzed EGF-induced EGFR internalization and performed Annexin V and propodium iodide (PI) staining by flow cytometry. As a result, EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis is decreased and apoptotic cell death is induced accompanied by G0/G1 arrest after PAO treatment. In addition, we observed that cell viability is reduced significantly when PAO and EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) treated together. Furthermore, we verified signaling transduction that associated with proliferation and apoptosis by western blot. To confirm combination effects of PAO and EGFR-TKI in vivo, we established xenograft mouse model using gefitinib-insensitive SNU1327 cell lines. After Tumor sizes reached 100-200mm3, mice were treated with PAO or gefitinib alone, or combined treatment for 3 weeks. We observed that tumor sizes of combination group were more decreased than other groups.In these result, we validate endocytosis inhibitor PAO is potential drug for overcoming therapeutic limitation of EGFR-TKI in gefitinib-insensitive wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines, though further experiment is needed to explain more accurate mechanism.

For common mutations in EGFR, treatment with 1st generation TKIs results in approximately 70% overall response rate, increased progression free survival, and increased quality of life compared to chemotherapy alone. However, resistance to 1st generation TKIs typically develops within ~12 months, and approximately 55% of patients acquire a secondary mutation in EGFR Exon 20, T790M. To overcome resistance, 2nd and 3rd generation covalently binding TKIs targeting T790M mutations have been developed. Recent studies show that approximately 40% of acquired resistance to 2nd and 3rd generation TKIs can also occur via a third acquired EGFR mutation at the site of covalent binding, C797S. To date, there are no standard approved targeted therapies for treating EGFR C797S mutant NSCLC. Moreover, with proposed increased use of covalent inhibitors in the first line setting, C797S mutations are expected to become more prevalent and new strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance will be required. To this end, we have generated stable Ba/F3 and HCC827 NSCLC cell lines expressing C797S mutant EGF receptors with common mutations in EGFR including, L858R/T790M/C797S, and Ex19del/T790M/C797S. EGFR mutant cell lines expressing C797S were screened against 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation EGFR TKIs and cell viability was determined using Cell Titer Glo.

        "Background":"['In lung adenocarcinomas, targeted therapy with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib is associated with longer progression free survival (PFS). However, despite the initial success, all patients progress with a median PFS of 12 to 16 months. Acquired resistance is driven by the occurrence of a secondary EGFR mutation (T790M) in about 50% of the cases and by c-Met amplification in 5 to 10 % of the cases. We report the activity of a new reversible and ATP-competitive c-Met inhibitor, EMD1214063, in the setting of primary lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR activating mutations and in two models of acquired resistance. EMD1214063 showed to be specifically active in c-Met amplified and c-Met dependent cells in a large panel of genotypically characterized lung cancer cell lines. In the context of acquired resistance, we studied the effect of EMD1214063 alone and in combination of afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, in PC9 cells (EGFR Exon19del), H1975 cells (EGFR L858R and T790M), HCC827 (EGFR Exon19del, not c-Met amplified) and in HCC827GR cells (EGFR Exon19del and c-Met amplified). Treatment of HCC827GR cells with EMD1214063 resulted in substantial growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. The in vitro results showed a significant synergistic effect of the combination of EMD121039 and afatinib in the induction of growth inhibition in the context of c-Met amplification and EGFR T790M mutation. Combination treatment robustly suppressed expression of downstream pErk and pAkt, showing efficient suppression of PI3K and MAPK signaling. To determine whether the antitumor activity of the combination observed in vitro might also be apparent in vivo, we injected these cells in nude mice to elicit the formation of solid tumors. Mice were treated with EMD121043 (25mg/kg), afatinib (10mg/kg) or the combination of both. In H1975 xenografts only the combination therapy could significantly reduce tumor growth, thus confirming the results obtained in vitro. In the c-Met amplified setting, we treated mice harboring HCC827, HCC827GR and mixed xenografts. HCC827-driven tumors strongly responded to both afatinib monotherapy and to the combination, leading to complete remission within 40 days of therapy. HCC827/HCC827GR mixed xenografts containing 0.1%, 1% and 10% of HCC827GR cells partially responded to afatinib monotherapy; however, growth was completely abolished by combination therapy. Treatment with EMD1214063 led to significant growth reduction in mice harboring HCC827GR tumors. In this model, only the combination therapy led to massive tumor shrinkage. Assessment of cell proliferation in vivo by [18F]FLT-PET showed a decline in FLT-uptake of 40% in both the combination therapy and the EMD1214063 monotherapy. In conclusion, the combination of EMD1214063 and afatinib promote tumor regression in erlotinib acquired resistant lung cancers driven by EGFR L858R/T790M or EGFR Exon19 del/c-Met amplification.']",

Mutant selective irreversible pyrimidine EGFR kinase inhibitor, WZ4002, is effective in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models harboring EGFR T790M (Zhou Nature 2009). We aimed to determine potential mechanisms of resistance to WZ4002 and explore alternative strategies to overcome acquired resistance to pyrimidine based EGFR inhibitors. Methods and Results', ' We performed an ENU mutagenesis screen in Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR L858R, L858R/T790M, Del E746_A750 and Del E746_A750/T790M followed by culture in the presence of WZ4002 (100 nM or 1 M). Using RT-PCR, we sequenced resistant clones for secondary EGFR mutations. No EGFR T790M mutations were identified. We detected novel secondary EGFR L718Q (9/27; 33%) or L844V (1/27; 3%) mutations in the drug resistant cells. We also recovered the EGFR C797S (1/27; 3%) mutation previously known to prevent covalent binding and decrease potency of WZ4002. Unlike EGFR T790M, EGFR L718Q and EGFR L844V did not lead to constitutive EGFR phosphorylation, were not transforming in Ba/F3 cells and required EGF for proliferation and survival. The EGFR L858R/L844V Ba/F3 cells were resistant to WZ4002 (IC50 0.7 M) but sensitive to irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors CL-387,785, HKI-272 (neratinib) and BIBW2992 (afatinib) (IC50 values all < 10 nM). Similar findings were observed with the EGFR L858R/L718Q cells although the IC50 values were slightly higher (100 nM or less) and with the Del E746_A750/L718Q and Del E746_A750/L844V cells. All triple mutants harboring EGFR T790M (e.g. L858R/T790M/L844V) were resistant to WZ4002 and irreversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors. EGFR L858R/L844V and L858R/L718Q Ba/F3 cells were growth inhibited by clinical concentrations (1 M) of gefitinib and the combination of 1 M gefitinib and 100 nM WZ4002 completely prevented the emergence of resistant clones in our ENU assay. Using structural modeling, both the L718Q and L844V mutations likely lead to steric hindrance and could impact WZ4002 binding. To verify this hypothesis, we developed a biotinylated-WZ4002 compound and used it to assay binding to different EGFR mutant proteins. This agent effectively bound to EGFR L858R and DelE746_A750 (with or without T790M). However, in the presence of a concurrent L718Q or L844V mutation, protein binding was significantly reduced, consistent with the reduced in vitro efficacy in the Ba/F3 cells. Conclusions', ' We identify novel EGFR mutations that confer drug resistance to irreversible pyrimidine but not quinazoline EGFR kinase inhibitors. Our findings have implications for understanding drug resistance mechanisms and for the development of combinations of EGFR kinase inhibitors as therapies for cancer patients.']",

Moreover, clinical trials demonstrated survival benefit of combination with cytotoxic agents and EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In contrast, the IMPRESS study showed that continuation of gefitinib in addition to cisplatin and pemetrexed didn't show survival benefit in patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib.Several basic studies reported that efficacy of targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy is schedule dependent. We, therefore, conducted an in vitro study to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC with EGFR mutations. Methods\", ' In vitro effects of docetaxel and an EGFR-TKI, gefitinib (AstraZeneca) or AZD9291 (Selleckchem), were examined in five lung cancer cell lines (PC9, PC9GR, HCC827, HCC827GR, and H1975) using a 3D culture model (PrimeSurface 96, SUMITOMO BAKELITE CO.). The NSCLC cells were treated with the combinationeither concurrently or sequentially (EGFR-TKIs after docetaxel or docetaxel after EGFR-TKIs).

Aim', ' To evaluate the effect of an allosteric AKT inhibitor (AKTi 1/2) in combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib on cell proliferation, apoptosis and signalling output in EGFR mutant/wt NSCLC cell lines. Methods', ' Four NSCLC cell lines were selected', ' NCI-H522 and NCI-H1651 (EGFR wt and K-RAS wt), PC9 and HCC827 (EGFR mutant). The 96hr sulphorhodamine assays was used to assess the effect of gefitinib and AKTi 1/2 on growth inhibition, and median effect analysis to calculate combination indices (CIs) to assess the effect of both drugs in combination. The expression of p-EGFR, p-AKT, p-S6, p-ERK and cleaved PARP were studied by Western blotting in the EGFR wt NCI-H522 and the EGFR mutant PC9 cell lines. Results', ' EGFR wt cell lines NCI-H522 and NCI-H1651 were relatively resistant to gefitinib (IC50 values of 7.0  2.5 uM and 8.8  0.9 uM, respectively) compared with the EGFR mutant cell lines PC9 and HCC827 (IC50 values of 0.07  0.03 uM and 0.004  0.0005 uM, respectively).

Incremental induction of cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis, was seen in PC9 cells treated with the combination of gefitinib and AKTi 1/2. Conclusions', ' These results demonstrate synergistic growth inhibition of EGFR wt and mutant NSCLC cell lines by the combination of gefitinib with AKTi 1/2.

Given the efficacy of EGFR TKIs in advanced EGFR-mutant lung cancer, adjuvant therapy with EGFR TKIs is also biologically appealing. However, there are conflicting findings to date regarding the potential benefit of adjuvant TKI in patients (pts) with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations (Janjigian JTO 2010; Goss ASCO 2010) To better understand these results, we studied the natural history of EGFR-mutant lung cancers which recurred despite adjuvant TKI.  Methods', ' Pts with recurrent EGFR-mutant lung cancer were identified from an institutional database of pts who received adjuvant/neoadjuvant TKI using an IRB approved waiver. Recurrent cancer specimens, when available, were tested for the T790M resistance mutation. Sensitivity to retreatment with EGFR TKI was evaluated.  Results', ' 23 pts were identified; all cases had an EGFR mutation (61% exon 19 deletion, 35% L858R, 4% other). Pts received adjuvant/neoadjuvant TKI for a median of 19 total months (range 1-39 months); median time to progression (TTP) was 29 months. 8 pts recurred while receiving TKI; 7 of these cases were tested for T790M, which was detected in 4 (57%). 15 pts recurred after stopping TKI (median of 13 months off TKI); however, T790M was not detected in any of the 8 cases tested (p=0.026, Fishers exact test). 13 pts who recurred after stopping TKI were retreated with a median TTP of 10 months.

Conclusions', ' Pts with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who develop recurrence after stopping adjuvant TKI do not harbor T790M and commonly remain sensitive to TKI treatment.

In the majority of patients with this type of cancer, EFGR inhibition leads to a dramatic reduction in tumor size coupled with an abatement of symptoms. These responses are temporary, and in most cases the cancers become resistant after an average of one year. Recently, we and others have found that a subset of these cancers transform from NSCLC to SCLC as they acquire resistance to EGFR TKI. Details underlying this novel resistance mechanism are largely undiscovered. To assess the genetic changes associated with NSCLC to SCLC transformation, we carried out next generation sequencing analysis on NSCLC and SCLC resistant tumors. The sequencing results revealed that Rb, along with p53 and PIK3CA were specifically altered in the SCLC transformed tumors. An IHC assay to detect Rb indicated that while 10 out of 10 SCLC transformed cases have loss of Rb, resistant cancers that maintained an NSCLC histology largely retained Rb. To address the mechanism underlying the resistance to EGFR inhibition in these tumors, we demonstrated that upon the transformation to SCLC there is a marked reduction in EGFR expression, suggesting that in transforming to SCLC these cells become a cell type that no longer requires EGFR for their survival. Finally, utilizing cell lines generated from biopsies taken from resistant cancers, we identify the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor Abt-263 as a potential therapeutic approach to treat these resistant patients.

Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or/and the downstream RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway may be a potential treatment for metastatic EPC since EGFR is expressed in more than 81% of skin adnexal tumors. Methods', ' Immunohistochemical analyses (IHC) of ten primary EPCs and of skin metastases derived from one patient with EPC were performed. EGFR and the downstream signal transduction molecules ERK, p-ERK, AKT and p-AKT were analysed. To study the in vitro effects of EGFR or/and MEK inhibition in EPC, we isolated tumor cells from a skin metastasis of a patient with EPC who was resistant to chemotherapy. Results', ' All primary tumors and metastases were highly positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor and positive for the signal transduction molecules ERK, p-ERK and AKT but negative for p-AKT. Isolated cutaneous metastatic EPC cells strongly expressed p-EGFR and p-ERK. Treatment of these cells with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or the MEK inhibitor trametinib inhibited tumor growth and moderately induced apoptosis. Moreover, combined EGFR and MEK inhibition significantly enhanced the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. This patient underwent surgery for rapidly progressing skin and lymph node metastases and was treated with cetuximab. The patient remained progression-free for 6 months. Conclusions', ' These data suggest that EPC cells express high levels of EGFR that activates the MAPK pathway thus rendering tumor cells susceptible to EGFR or/and MEK inhibition. Our data provide a strong rationale for targeting EGFR or/and MEK in patients with metastatic EPC.']",

        "Background":"['Repebody is a binding scaffold based on variable lymphocyte receptors which are nonimmunoglobulin antibodies composed of leucine-rich repeat modules in jawless vertebrates. Repebody can be developed against variety of epitopes by module engineering. In this study, EGFR-specific repebody (RBEGFR) was developed to visualize the status of receptor expression and to prevent ligand binding that may inhibit autophosphorylation and downstream intracellular signaling.We developed RBEGFR by phage display. H1650, HCC827, A549 (human non-small cell lung cancer) and HT29 (human colon cancer) were selected as EGFR expressing cell lines. MDA-MB-435 (human melanoma) and SW620 (human colon cancer) was selected as a negative control. Specific binding of RBEGFR to cells and cancer tissue was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining and/or FACS analysis. In vivo imaging was done by i.v. injection of FNR-675 labeled RBEGFR (30 g/mouse) or 64Cu-NOTA- RBEGFR (7.4 MBq/mouse) in H1650, HCC827 and HT29-bearing mouse models using cooled CCD camera or microPET, respectively. Orthotopic colon cancer mice were generated by i.p. injection of Azoxymethane (AOM; 10 mg/kg) and oral administration of 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). In vivo imaging was done by i.v. injection FNR-675 labeled RBEGFR (30 g/mouse) in AOM/DSS mouse models using cooled CCD camera or fluorescence microendoscopy.In vitro and in vivo IF staining demonstrated that strong binding of RBEGFR to H1650, HCC827 and HT29, but not to MDA-MB-435 and SW620. In vivo near infrared (NIR) imaging demonstrated specific targeting of FNR-675-RBEGFR to grafted H1650, HCC827 and HT29 tumor in mice. The 64Cu-NOTA- RBEGFR was detected at the implanted tumor from 1 h (SUVmax', ' 1.340.12) after the injection, peaked at 6 h (1.750.18), maintained to 24 h (1.330.17). The radioactivity significantly decreased by blocking with cold form of 50 M nave RBEGFR 1 day before injection of 64Cu-NOTA- RBEGFR, indicating specific binding of RBEGFR to EGFR in vivo. Optical NIR imaging after i.v. injection of FNR-675-RBEGFR showed specific signal in the abdomen of AOM/DSS mice, but not in control mice. Correlation with surgical/necropsy imaging, fluorescence endoscopy and pathology revealed strong accumulation of FNR-675-RBEGFR in malignant dysplasia, but weak or no accumulation in low grade tumor or benign lesion.In conclusion, the RBEGFR could be developed for specific targeting of cancer overexpressing EGFR. The fluorescence-labeled RBEGFR could be developed for imaging agent for detecting colonic dysplasia and assessing EGFR status. In particular, this agent may have a potential as an imaging companion diagnostics to predict therapeutic outcome of targeted therapy with monoclonal antibody for EGFR through pre-therapeutic visualization of EGFR status. Our work provides a basis to develop potential strategy of targeted immune-detection of cancers which may replace monoclonal antibodies.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '   AUY922 is a synthetic HSP90 inhibitor that degrades client onco-proteins including EGFR.  Preclinical studies demonstrate HSP90 inhibitors are effective agents against models of AR in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring the gatekeeper mutation EGFR T790M.  Pts with EGFR mutations who develop AR often continue E with 2nd-line therapies to avoid disease flare associated with discontinuing TKI.  This phase II study combines AUY922 and E for the treatment of pts with EGFR-mutant lung cancer and RECIST-progression on 1st-line EGFR TKIs.      Methods', '   Eligible pts had EGFR mutations and developed AR (Jackman, JCO 2010) after treatment with EGFR TKIs.  Pts underwent tumor biopsies after developing AR and prior to study entry.  Pts received AUY922 70 mg/m2 IV weekly and E 150 mg oral daily in 28-day cycles.  Response assessment occurred at 4 weeks (wks), 8 wks, and every 8 wks thereafter.  The primary objective was overall response rate (ORR, CR+PR) at 8 wks.  A Simon mini-max design determined sample size (stage I', ' 16 pts (2 responses needed to proceed to stage II), stage II', ' 9 pts; =10%, =10%, p0=10%, p1=30%).  Tumor tissue from re-biopsy at study entry was analyzed for EGFR T790M.  Results', '  Sixteen pts have been treated (10 women, median age 58 [range 47-76]).   The median time on EGFR-TKI prior to the development of AR was 12 mo (range 2-42 mo).  Seven pts had EGFR T790M confirmed by tumor re-biopsy. ORR was 2/16 (13%, 95% CI 2-37%). Both pts with PR had EGFR T790M.  Four other pts had stable disease for at least 8 wks, two remain on study after more than 12 wks. Adverse events reported in 20% of pts were diarrhea, fatigue, myalgias, nausea, and transient flashing lights or night blindness.  One pt each experienced grade 3 diarrhea and cardiac abnormalities.   Conclusions', '   AUY922 and E is a well-tolerated regimen for pts with EGFR-mutant lung cancer and AR to EGFR TKIs.  Two pts remain on study and 9 additional pts will be accrued in stage II; final response rate and survival outcomes will be reported.  Supported by Novartis, Inc.

        "Background":"['Activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the high sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like erlotinib. However, acquired resistance limits the clinical efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, which is the most commonly caused by T790M mutation in EGFR. Second generation EGFR-TKIs such as afatinib are able to inhibit T790M mutation but the clinical efficacy in T790M positive patients is limited due to severe side effects associated with wild type (WT) EGFR inhibition.ASP8273 is a mutant-selective irreversible EGFR inhibitor currently in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier', ' NCT02113813,  NCT02192697). We have previously reported that ASP8273 covalently binds to mutant EGFR via C797 and inhibits kinase activity of mutant EGFR, which results in anti-tumor activity in xenograft models. To further explore the selectivity and the activity of ASP8273 on mutant EGFR, we evaluated effects of ASP8273 and other EGFR-TKIs on EGFR signal pathway, cell growth and anti-tumor activity.Phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK and Akt was determined by Western blot after treatment with EGFR-TKIs at 10, 100 and 1000nM. Apoptosis induction was analyzed by detecting caspase activity after 24h treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Anti-tumor activity of ASP8273 was evaluated in mice xenografted with HCC827 (deletion in exon 19 [del ex19]), NCI-H1975 (T790M/L858R), A431 (WT), and a patient derived LU1868 (T790M/L858R).ASP8273 selectively inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and its down-stream signal pathway, ERK and Akt from 10nM in HCC827 and NCI-H1975 while inhibitory effects were only detected at 1000nM in A431.In NCI-H1650 (del ex19), ASP8273 inhibited cell growth with an IC50 value of 70nM while other EGFR-TKIs were only partially effective. ERK and Akt phosphorylation were diminished after ASP8273 treatment at 1000nM, however, other EGFR-TKIs only partially reduced the phosphorylation levels of these proteins. ASP8273 potently enhanced the caspase activity in NCI-H1650 after 24h treatment, which is concordant with signal and cell growth inhibitory effect.In HCC827 and NCI-H1975 xenograft models, ASP8273 induced tumor regression at 10, 30 and 100mg/kg without affecting body weight. ASP8273 also produced tumor growth inhibition from 10mg/kg in the NSCLC patient derived tumor xenograft, LU1868 which express T790M/L858R. On the other hand, ASP8273 did not produce significant tumor growth inhibition at 10 and 30mg/kg in A431 xenograft model.ASP8273 selectively inhibited mutant EGFR compared to WT EGFR in preclinical models, showing activity in mutant EGFR cell line which is resistant to other EGFR-TKIs including AZD9291 and CO-1686. These results indicate the potential of ASP8273 to induce tumor shrinkage in patients with mutant EGFR positive tumors including those that do not respond to other EGFR-TKIs despite EGFR mutation.']",

        "Background":"['EGFR is one of key driver pathways of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR inhibitors have shown significant response in patients with EGFR mutation. However, patients develop resistance in short period of time, which results from secondary EGFRT790M mutation and other mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that activating mutations of EGFR significantly activated IKBKE, an IB kinase family member previously shown to activate Akt and NF-B pathways. Furthermore, we showed that EGFR directly interacts with and phosphorylates IKBKE on tyrosine 153 and tyrosine 179 residues. IKBKE-Y153F/179-F, a mutant that could not be phosphorylated by EGFR, largely reduced its kinase activity and failed to activate Akt and NF-B as well as inhibited EGFR signaling. Furthermore, phospho-IKBKE-Y153 correlated with EGFR activation in NSCLC patients. Notably, depletion of IKBKE by either small molecule inhibitor amlexanox or shRNA selectively inhibited cell viability in NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations. Moreover, we observed that inhibition of IKBKE led to feedback activation of the MAPK pathway. Combination of amlexanox with MEK inhibitor AZD6244 significantly inhibits cell survival and tumor growth in NSCLC cells driven by activating EGFR mutations including EGFRT790M. Thus, our findings not only identify IKBKE as a direct downstream target of EGFR but also provide a potential therapeutic strategy for EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC driven by secondary EGFR mutation.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' There are limited treatment options for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who fail intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The use of light as a means of therapy for bladder cancer (BC) has a long history but has been hampered by a lack of tumor specificity and toxicity. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugates represent an emerging therapeutic approach for malignancies that improves upon tumor specificity. The use of a mAb-photo-absorber (PA) conjugate is a more selective method of delivering light therapy and has been termed photoimmunotherapy (PIT). In this report, PIT is used to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a good tumor-specific target as it is enriched in the basal molecular subtype of BC. In the present study, anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab (pan) was labeled with the PA, IRDye 700Dx (IR700), to create a pan IR700 mAb-PA conjugate which is activated by near-infrared radiation (NIR). Methods', ' BC tissue microarray (TMA) and BC cell lines were analyzed for expression of EGFR. Mechanism of PIT induced cell death was studied using proliferation assays, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and production of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the in vivo effect was studied in xenografts. Results', ' EGFR staining of TMAs showed that while most BCs have expression of EGFR to some degree, squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) have the highest expression of EGFR. Pan IR700 activated by NIR light rapidly killed UMUC-5 cells, a bladder SCC line. Pan alone, pan IR700 without NIR, or NIR alone had no effect on cells. TEM demonstrated that cell death is due to necrosis. Singlet oxygen species contributed towards cell death. NIR-PIT with pan IR700 reduced growth compared to only pan IR700 treated UMUC-5 xenograft tumors. Conclusions', ' PIT is a new targeted treatment for BC. Our data demonstrate that pan IR700-induced PIT selectively kills EGFR-expressing bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and hence warrants further studies in orthotopic models and in patients. We suspect that EGFR-directed therapy with PIT is a viable strategy for the basal molecular subtype of BC and will be testing this hypothesis in the future.']",
