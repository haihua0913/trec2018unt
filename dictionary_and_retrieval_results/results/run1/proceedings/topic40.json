        "Background":"['Breast cancers display a remarkable phenotypic diversity that is exploited to promote both tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies in several types of cancer have highlighted the significance of intratumoral heterogeneity on both innate and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Tumor plasticity is supported by the heterogeneous expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the robustness that the overlapping signaling networks provide. Therefore a thorough understanding of the intratumoral heterogeneity is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor patient outcome. Previously, we determined that high MET expression correlated with ERneg/ERBB2neg and basal-like breast cancers. These results and the efficacy of MET inhibitors in other cancers suggest that MET may be an effective clinical target for aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Recent studies have exposed interactions between MET and the ERBB receptor family in the progression and therapeutic resistance of several cancers. Since MET, ERBB2, and EGFR are known to be highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer subtypes, it is critical that we understand the relationships between these receptors in order to develop effective treatment strategies.In this study, we interrogated the relationship between MET expression/activity and the expression/activity of the ERBB receptor family in human breast cancers and a breast cancer cell line. Using coimmunostaining and quantitative multispectral analysis, we observed that a significant percentage of ERBB2+ tumors coexpress MET and ERBB2. These tumors display significant heterogeneity and have subpopulations of cells that are METhigh/ERBB2low, METlow/ERBB2high, and METhigh/ERBB2high. In a METhigh/ERBB2high breast cancer cell line, we observed that MET depletion results in increased ERBB2 activation and conversely ERBB2 depletion results in increase MET activation. Neither EGFR or ERBB3 compensated for MET or ERBB2 knockdown. The loss of both MET and ERBB2 led to a decrease in PI3K/AKT signaling and increased dependency on MAPK. MET and ERBB2 knockdown did decrease proliferation but neither alone was able to abolish all cell growth. These results in addition to the heterogeneous expression of MET and ERBB2 in breast cancers have significant clinical implications on potential therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.']",

        "Background":"['In spite of clinical advancements, tumors that no longer depend on ER/PR and ERBB2 signaling are clinically aggressive and have the poorest prognosis. Few effective treatment options exist for basal or trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2 breast cancers. Understanding the signaling pathways that drive these aggressive breast cancer subtypes is critical to the development of successful therapeutics. The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor patient outcome, independent of ERBB2 expression. Previously, we determined that MET is expressed in the majority of breast cancers. Most importantly, we determined that high MET expression correlated with ERneg/ERBB2neg tumors and the basal subtype. These studies indicate that MET may serve as a novel therapeutic target for those patients with the most aggressive tumors and currently, the fewest therapeutic options. We are utilizing breast cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models to examine how MET and ERBB2 uniquely influence breast cancer progression. To investigate the effects of MET and/or ERBB2 inhibition we are utilizing lentiviral shRNA knockdown in both basal and luminal cells. We observed that both MET and ERBB2 depletion decrease cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, we have profiled the effects of MET and ERBB2 knockdown on the phosphorylation of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and 44 tyrosine kinases. We observed that downstream signaling at the tyrosine kinase level is minimally affected by downregulation of MET or ERBB2; however, there is significant signaling compensation that occurs at the RTK level through the ERBB family members, EGFR and ERBB3. Currently, we are examining the interaction between MET and the ERBB family in both basal and luminal breast cancer cell lines. In addition, we are measuring the effect of MET or ERBB2 depletion on growth of breast cancer cells in 3D culture. In addition, we have evaluated MET and ERBB2 expression in human invasive breast carcinomas using coimmunostaining and quantitative analysis with the CRi Nuance multispectral imager. We observe that a significant percentage of tumors coexpress MET and ERBB2. Many tumors have significant heterogeneity of MET and ERBB2 expression and have patterns of cells that are METhigh/ERBB2low, METlow/ERBB2high, and METhigh/ERBB2high. We hypothesize that breast cancer cells expressing both MET and ERBB2 (METhigh/ERBB2high) are highly tumorigenic and have an increased proliferative capacity, metastatic potential and chemoresistance. Currently, fresh primary human breast cancer tissue is being transplanted into mammary glands of NOD-SCIDIL2R mice to determine the impact of MET and ERBB2 expression on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These studies will reveal whether MET and ERBB2 have synergistic or exclusive roles in breast cancer progression and how these oncogenes can be targeted for successful therapy.']",

        "Background":"['We have demonstrated that Notch1 is required for trastuzumab resistance in ErbB2 positive breast cancer. This indicates that ErbB2 suppresses Notch1 in breast cancer and therapeutic intervention targeting ErbB2 might have an unintended consequence which is aberrant up regulation of Notch1 which is a breast oncogene.However, the mechanism of action by which ErbB2 restricts Notch1 activation is unknown. In this current study, we investigated the role of cis- and trans-activation of Notch signaling by Notch ligands which are developmentally conversed to tightly regulate Notch activation. To address this hypothesis, we performed co-culture studies using fibroblasts expressing no Notch ligands or over-expressing human Jagged1 or Deltalike1 and ErbB2 positive breast cancer cells. We performed flow cytometry to isolate breast cancer cells after co-culture and extracted RNA to measure expression of Notch gene targets as a measure of Notch activity. The results showed that trastuzumab, Lapatinib, or ErbB2 knockdown increased overall Notch activition. Similarly, Co-culture with Jagged1-expressing fibroblasts increased overall Notch activation. However, Knocked down of Jagged1 in the breast cancer cells had little effect on ligand-induced Notch activation relieving the possibility of cis-inhibition. In contrast, Jagged1 knocked down abrogated trastuzumab-induced Notch activation in the breast cancer cells. These results suggest that ErbB2 might restrict Notch activation by preventing Jagged1-mediated trans activation of Notch and not by promoting cis-inhibition. Confocal immunofluorescence showed that Jagged1 is localized with Notch1 when ErbB2 is hyperactive but is trafficked to the cell surface in response to trastuzumab. K44ADynamin abrogated Jagged1 expression on the cell surface as measured by IF and surface biotinylation studies. Furthermore, K44ADynamin expression abrogated trastuzumab-induced Notch1 activation. Importantly, we measured growth consequences of Jagged1-mediated Notch activation in response to trastuzumab and found that Jagged1 is necessary for survival of ErbB2 positive breast cancer cells and trastuzumab resistance as measured by cell cycle analysis and Annexin V staining. These results taken together indicate that ErbB2 restricts Notch by limiting Jagged1-mediated trans-activation.']",

        "Background":"['DNA copy number amplification at the ERBB2 locus on 17q12-21 is a frequent genomic event, present in 10-15% of breast tumors. This gene-dense amplicon contains several genes that are aberrantly overexpressed in ERBB2+ breast cancer. We hypothesized that a subset of amplicon genes with minimal expression in normal tissue could serve as candidates for shared tumor-specific antigens. We eliminated from consideration other amplicon genes with high expression in specific tissues or broad expression in normal tissues due to the potential for autoimmune toxicity. Immunohistochemistry of a breast tumor microarray showed expression of MIEN, GRB7, PGAP3 proteins specifically in ERBB2+ tumor cells but not in stroma or in ERBB2 non-amplified breast tumor samples. We tested several peptide epitopes with predicted high affinity for HLA-A2 (<50 nM) and confirmed that these could stabilize MHC expression on T2 cells. In vitro sensitization of normal donor lymphocytes with the predicted epitopes led to production of IFN-. Moreover, Dendritic cells pulsed with lysate from SKBR3 (ERBB2 amplified) but not MCF7 breast cancer cells could sensitize autologous lymphocytes to epitopes from amplicon proteins. This suggests that the natural abundance of the amplicon proteins in ERBB2 positive tumors is sufficient to provide cross-priming. To test whether the amplicon proteins could serve as tumor-rejection antigens we used the murine TM15 breast cancer cell line which has amplification of a syntenic region surrounding the murine Her2/neu gene. Quantitative PCR showed 50-fold overexpression of the amplicon gene pnmt in TM15 cells. Mice vaccinated with recombinant murine or human PNMT protein, but not ovalbumin, rejected challenge with TM15 tumor without any overt toxicity and developed memory against delayed re-challenge.These data indicate that normal host genes which are in immediate proximity to the oncogene ERBB2 are abnormally expressed at high levels in ERBB2+ breast tumor cells. Although the molecular mechanism leading to aberrant expression is unknown, analysis of several breast cancer microarray databases as well as TCGA data also show a very high correlation between ERBB2 overexpression and high expression of these passenger genes so this seems to be a general phenomenon. T lymphocytes normally have tolerance to non-mutated host proteins however tolerance can be reversed with proper sensitization conditions. Antigen overexpression in tumor cells might allow effector T cells to surpass an activation threshold while preserving tolerance for normal tissue. DNA copy number amplification of specific oncogenes is a frequent genomic event in cancer so the general strategy of targeting passenger genes on amplicons may have broader use in cancer immunotherapy.']",

Pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma represents a unique histologic subset of breast cancer with poorer outcomes as compared with classic invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. With the recent finding of ERBB2 alterations in recurrent invasive lobular carcinoma, the goal of this study is to define the relationship of ERBB2 alterations in the distinct subset of pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinomas.Methods. Using the provisional invasive breast cancer data set of 962 cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), all breast cancers with CDH1 alterations were identified and pathologic review was performed. Independent identification of ERBB2 genomic alterations was done. The frequency and nature of genomic alterations in ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA, and TP53 were determined. FFPE specimens from an additional 18 cases from our own institution have been evaluated using the combination of the RainDance ThunderBolts Cancer Panel for validation.Results. Of 116 TCGA breast cancers with CDH1 alterations, 86 were invasive lobular breast cancer. Within this subset, 21 pleomorphic lobular breast cancers were identified based on morphologic review. Nine ERBB2 mutations (42.9%) and three amplifications (14.3%) were found in pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma, but none in classic invasive lobular carcinoma (p value 1.92e-9). There were no significance differences in the frequency of TP53, PTEN or PIK3CA alterations in pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma as compared to classic invasive lobular carcinoma. Data from the additional 18 validation cases will be presented.Conclusions. Genomic alterations in ERBB2 strongly associate with the finding of pleomorphic invasive lobular but not classic invasive lobular histology. The presence of ERBB2 alterations has therapeutic implications specific to this rare breast cancer subset that could impact outcomes. Comprehensive genomic profiling identifies ERBB2 mutations that are not detected with standard clinical immunohistochemistry or FISH.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic breast cancer remains a major hurdle to the successful treatment of this disease. Overexpression of the HER2/ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase in breast cancer is associated with metastatic disease and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Growing evidence demonstrates that TGF can potentiate ErbB2 signaling to enhance the invasive and metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the synergy between TGF and ErbB2 signaling pathways remain to be elucidated.We previously identified Lipoma Preferred Partner (LPP) as an indispensable mediator of TGF-induced migration, invasion and focal adhesion turnover of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we established domains within LPP that are required for its localization to focal adhesions and for its interaction with -Actinin, an actin cross-linking protein, to promote cell migration and invasion.Herein, we examine the requirement of LPP in tumorigenesis and metastasis formation. We observe that LPP is dispensable for primary tumor growth. Nonetheless, the loss of LPP leads to decrease in spontaneous lung metastasis formation of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells injected into the mammary fat pads of mice. Furthermore, we observe that LPP is a critical determinant for efficient dissemination of breast cancer cells. We show that shRNA-mediated reduction of LPP significantly impairs pulmonary metastasis formation in experimental metastasis tail vein assay.Overall, we have identified LPP as a novel mediator that integrates TGF and ErbB2 signaling to promote the migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. We identify LPP as a pro-metastatic mediator of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells and a potential new biomarker of metastatic breast cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Repeated DNA segments (Low Copy Repeats, Segmental Duplications) are highly homologous sequences within the human genome. They are typically 10-300 kb in length, and bear >95% sequence identity. In germline, repeated DNA segments mediate recurrent DNA rearrangements and thus cause specific genetic disorders called genomic disorders. Repeated genomic segments could also be prone to rearrangements in somatic cells and thus could mediate recurrent rearrangements in cancer. However, the important role of repeated genomic segments in genome instability in cancer remains elusive, mainly because such regions are less accessible by current genomic technologies due to the difficulty in assembling and interrogating sequences. Gene amplification is a cellular process characterized by the production of multiple copies of a particular gene through DNA rearrangements. ERBB2, an epidermal growth factor receptor gene, is amplified in 15-20% of breast tumors. Due to excessive cell growth signaling, this recurrent amplification is associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis. Despite the clinical importance, the mechanisms giving rises to recurrent ERBB2 amplification remains unclear. We hypothesized that, similar to the recurrent rearrangements for genomic disorders, repeated genomic segments cause DNA rearrangements for ERBB2 amplification. To test the hypothesis and understand the mechanism of ERBB2 amplification, we mapped a common copy-number breakpoint for primary ERBB2-amplified (HER2-positive) breast tumors. Copy number breakpoints were examined at every 300-kilo bases (kb) from the location of ERBB2 to its telomeric region using real-time PCR based assays. The breakpoint that marked a region between normal copy number and low level amplification resided within a 300-kb complex genomic region at the 1.5 mega-bases telomeric side of ERBB2. The region contains many repeated segments from two gene families. Furthermore, the HapMap SNPs, a set of SNPs that tag haploblocks in the human genome, are less well-defined, indicating the difficulty in interrogating the genomic region by current genomic technologies. Normal copy-number variations seem common, as there is several deletion polymorphisms reported in the region. Two sub-regions, each covering 40-kb region, are particularly complex due to a number of direct and inverted repeats. The prevalence of this copy number breakpoint in HER2-positive breast tumors was also shown in a study by Sircoulomb et al.,(BMC Cancer 2010), in which common amplifications and deletions were determined for 54 HER-2 positive breast tumors. Defining (1) the copy-number breakpoint with very high resolution and (2) critical DNA sequences for ERBB2 amplification will lead to better understanding the amplification mechanism underlying this aggressive type of breast cancer.']",

Furthermore, knockdown of DBNL reduces cell surface levels of ErbB2 and decreases Akt phosphorylation.

This compound has shown excellent activity in numerous SC mouse tumor models including breast (BT-474, MDA-MB-453), ovarian (SK-OV-3) and gastric (N87) carcinoma models. In breast cancer patients, brain metastases are a serious unmet medical need. Patients with ErbB2+ breast cancer have a significantly increased incidence of brain metastases following trastuzumab therapy. Here we demonstrate significant single agent activity of ARRY-380 in two ErbB2+ intracranial mouse xenograft models. For these studies, female nude mice received intracranial implantations of tumor cells (either NCI-N87 or BT-474) by direct injection into the brain parenchyma (via the sagittal suture). In pilot studies, we demonstrated that the blood brain barrier was not disrupted by mechanical injections and that increasing tumor burden correlates negatively with neurologic outcome, body weight and survival. In the N87 studies, animals received treatments beginning on Day 2 post-implantation and continuing for up to 6 weeks. Dose groups (n=12/group) were vehicle, ARRY-380 at MTD (75 mg/kg, PO, BID) or lapatinib at MTD (50 mg/kg, PO, BID). All animals in the vehicle- or lapatinib-treated groups did not survive beyond Day 22. In the ARRY-380-treated-group, 75% of the animals were alive on Day 43. Brain PK/PD was also evaluated in the N87 model. ARRY-380 and its active metabolite caused a significant reduction in brain pErbB2 (80%). In the BT-474 model, animals received treatments beginning on Day 2 post-implantation and continuing for up to 8 weeks. Dose groups (n=13/group) were vehicle, ARRY-380 at MTD (75 mg/kg, PO, BID), lapatinib at MTD (50 mg/kg, PO, BID) or neratinib at MTD (40 mg/kg, PO, QD). On Day 56, survival in the ARRY-380 group was 69% while survival rates in the vehicle, lapatinib or neratinib-treated groups were 23%, 8% and 23%, respectively. Thus ARRY-380 treatment significantly enhances survival in two ErbB2 driven intracranial tumor xenograft models, with superior activity compared to other ErbB2 agents in these studies. Additionally, ARRY-380 has demonstrated durable clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients with ErbB2+ MBC.

        "Background":"['The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is composed of four members', 'EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4; these are membrane bound proteins that control important cell functions through the activation of signaling cascades such as the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinoditol3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways. Deregulated expression of the ErbB family by gene amplification and/or protein over-expression is associated with the development and progression of a variety of cancer types.Notably, ErbB2 over expression is observed in approximately 25% of human breast tumors. The negative regulator, LRIG1 is a transmembrane protein that can directly interact with all members of the ErbB family leading to receptor degradation. In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that loss of LRIG1 is sufficient to drive an increase in ErbB2 protein levels and signaling while ectopic expression of LRIG1 decreases ErbB protein expression and signaling.Recently, a group of ErbB2 C-terminal fragments (CTFs) collectively known as p95HER2have captured the attention of the scientific community becausea) they are capable of inducing more aggressive tumors compared with those expressing full length ErbB2 and because b) they have been directly implicated in therapeutic resistance to Herceptin, the standard of care for ErbB2-positive breast cancer. ErbB2 CTFsare generated by two independent mechanisms; 1) initiation of translation at alternative methionine codons, producing two fragments known as 611-CTF and 687-CTF; 2) Proteolytic shedding of full length ErbB2, generating 648-CTF and 676-CTF fragments. Clinical data indicate that p95HER2 positive patients have lower survival rates compared with those expressing low p95HER2 levels.Among the p95HER fragments, 611-CTF is the most interesting because it is hyperactive and has been associated with increased cell migration, tumor progression and metastasis. Currently, nothing is known of the mechanisms which govern p95HER2 down-regulation. Insight into these mechanisms could ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutics which may improve the response rate of p95HER2-positive breast cancer. In this study we examined whether 611-CTF is susceptible to LRIG1-mediated down-regulation. We find that these proteins interact and that ectopic expression of LRIG1 is sufficient to decrease 611-CTF protein expression in three different cell lines. Furthermore, LRIG1 is capable of reducing 611-driven tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results are surprising because LRIG1 is thought to recognize its targets through mutual ecto-domain interactions and 611-CTF lacks a large portion of the ErbB2 ecto-domain.Citation Format', ' Maria E.

In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion.

In addition, the ErbB2/3 heterodimer forms the most potent mitogenic receptor in vitro and is key to the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Despite the importance of this heterodimer in breast cancer progression, the negative regulation of these ErbB tyrosine kinases is still poorly understood. We demonstrate here for the first time that the ErbB3/4 ligand Heregulin (HRG) reduces mRNA and protein levels of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 in human breast cancer cell lines. We have found that after 24h of HRG treatment, ErbB2 expression decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in ErbB2 overexpressing AU565, BT474 and LTLT-Ca breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, EGFR levels were unaffected by HRG treatment. An initial decline in steady state mRNA levels was first noted at 1 hour after HRG treatment. ErbB3 levels also decreased in LTLT-Ca cells after HRG treatment. Lapatinib, which inhibits ErbB2 and EGFR kinase activity and HRG induced-ErbB3 phosphorylation, diminished the HRG- induced decrease in ErbB2 and ErbB3 in AU565 and LTLT-Ca cells. This finding suggests that the kinase activity of EGFR/ErbB2 may be involved in the HRG-induced down-regulation. HRG did not change the activity of ErbB2 promoter reporter constructs spanning 215 kb to 6007 kb upstream of the ErbB2 transcription start site as indicated by luciferase assays. An ongoing study suggests that HRG could be involved in decreasing ErbB2 mRNA stability. Our findings suggest that resistance to Lapatinib may be due in part to the fact that inhibition of ErbB2/ EGFR kinase activity dampens the negative effect of HRG on ErbB2 expression, resulting in elevated levels of ErbB2 in breast cancer cells.']",

Deep sequencing was performed on primary leukemia patient samples and point mutations were identified within the extracellular receptor binding domains and the intracellular C-terminal region of ErbB2. Expression of these mutations in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts exhibited a transformed morphological phenotype and in Ba/F3 pro-B cells led to IL-3-independent growth and differential signaling within the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Further characterization of the mutations will assess migration properties, differential sensitivity to ErbB-family drug inhibitors, and heterodimer formation using bimolecular fluorescence complementation microscopy.

        "Background":"['Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and highly invasive type of breast cancer, and patients diagnosed with IBC often face a very poor prognosis. IBC is characterized by the lack of primary tumor formation and the rapid accumulation of cancerous epithelial cells in the dermal lymphatic vessels. Given that normal epithelial cells require attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for survival, a comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying IBC cell survival in the lymphatic vessels is of paramount importance to our understanding of IBC pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that in contrast to normal mammary epithelial cells, IBC cells evade ECM-detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) and maintain ATP levels following ECM detachment. Exogenous ErbB2 overexpression leads to increased ATP production and soft agar growth in IBC cells that normally lack ErbB2 amplification. Additionally, ErbB2 knockdown in KPL-4 cells, an IBC cell line characterized by high levels of ErbB2, resulted in diminished ATP levels, decreased colony growth, and increased caspase activation following ECM detachment. Further studies reveal that the protection from anoikis in IBC cells is dependent on activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, but does not depend on modulation of the levels of the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. These results demonstrate that ErbB2 is necessary and sufficient for IBC cell survival in the absence of ECM attachment. Understanding the molecular mechanism utilized by IBC cells to survive in matrix-detached conditions could lead to more specific and effective therapeutics to prevent IBC metastasis from occurring and to treat patients in which metastasis has already occurred.']",

        "Background":"['Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2), often accompanied by ERBB2 gene amplification, is present in 25% of early-stage breast cancers. In a relatively small subset of breast cancer patients (4,000 cases each year in the US) ERBB2 is alternatively activated by gain-of-function mutations without gene amplification and receptor overexpression. These somatic mutations frequently occur in the kinase domain of ERBB2 and induce receptor phosphorylation, PI3K/AKT pathway hyperactivation, and malignant transformation. Breast cancer patients bearing ERBB2-mutated tumors are candidates for treatment with the irreversible kinase inhibitor neratinib. Although this therapeutic strategy is showing remarkable activity in a significant proportion of patients, emergence of acquired resistance inevitably occurs. The aim of this study is to identify the possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to neratinib therapy in ERBB2-mutated breast cancers. As part of the ongoing phase II SUMMIT basket study of neratinib in ERBB2-mutant cancers (NCT01953926), we have identified a common genomic alteration in tumors from three patients that progressed following initial benefit from neratinib treatment. Targeted exome sequencing of biopsies collected at time of disease progression revealed increased copy number of the ERBB2-mutant allele. In one case, the resistant lesions were confirmed to be avid for zirconium-89-trastuzumab and the patient responded to subsequent antibody-based anti-ERBB2 therapy. In an attempt to confirm that increased expression of the mutant allele was sufficient to limit neratinib sensitivity, we measured the antitumor activity of this agent in MCF10A cells stably expressing several activating mutations of ERBB2 compared to cells expressing equal levels of the wild type receptor. We found that higher concentrations of neratinib were needed to inhibit the proliferation of ERBB2-mutant cells compared to wild-type. Further, enhanced receptor activity in the ERBB2-mutant cells correlated with increased formation of ERBB2/ERBB3 dimers, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and in vivo tumorigenic potential. Combined ERBB2 and ERBB3 inhibition efficiently inhibited phosphorylation of ERBB2/ERBB3 and cell proliferation. We plan to overexpress the ERBB2-mutant allele in cell lines/organoids obtained from ERBB2-mutant patient-derived xenografts, phenocopying our results from the clinical specimens. We hypothesize that this manipulation will be sufficient to induce increase ERBB2/ERBB3 dimerization and resistance to neratinib. In summary, we believe that amplification of mutated ERBB2ERBB2 promotes increased ERBB2/ERBB3 dimerization, ERBB3 activation, and subsequent downstream signaling activation. Dual ERBB2/ERBB3 blockade may be a potential strategy to delay or prevent resistance to neratinib in ERBB2-mutant breast tumors.']",

To establish the function of Paks in ErbB2 driven transformation, we used a three-dimensional tissue culture system of human mammary epithelial cells that stably co-express a chemically-activatable form of ErbB2 and doxycycline (DOX) inducible shRNAs against Pak1 or Pak2. We observed that silencing of Pak1 but not of Pak2 has a dramatic effect in cell proliferation and apoptosis. As expected, activation of ErbB2 induced growth factor-independent proliferation and disruption of 3D acinar-like structures via ERK and Akt signaling. In contrast, silencing of Pak1 compromised activation of ERK, resulting in reversion of the malignant phenotype and restoration of normal acinar architecture. Surprisingly, silencing of Pak2 also compromised ERK activation, but cannot restore normal morphology. Further, we found that ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells expressing a DOX inducible shRNA against Pak1 formed significantly smaller tumors than cells expressing either GFP or a DOX inducible shRNA against Pak2 in SCID mice as the result of the inhibition of ERK. A phosphoproteomic analysis showed that several signaling pathways, e.g. Wnt and Mdm2-p53, are down regulated in our Pak1 deficient cell line. We found that the shPak1 cell line, but not the shPak2 deficient cell line has a dramatic reduction in total -catenin levels, and that blocking -catenin with chemical inhibitors restored normal acinar architecture. Finally, we found that targeting Pak and/or -catenin in combination with trastuzumab sensitized trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells to trastuzumab, suggesting the potential clinical application of this strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.']",

Glutaminolysis represents the first and rate-limiting step of glutamine utilization and is catalyzed by glutaminase. Previous studies have shown that c-Myc regulates glutaminolysis by increasing glutaminase expression in tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether other oncogenic signaling pathways promote glutaminolysis. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death for women in the United States and ErbB2 activation is one of the major causes of breast cancer. Using MCF10A and MCF10A-derived NeuT cells, we studied the effect of ErbB2 activation on glutaminase expression, and found that ErbB2 activation increased glutaminase 1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of ErbB2 decreased glutaminase 1 expression in several human ErbB2-positive cell lines. Consistently, blocking ErbB2 signaling pathway by trastuzumab repressed glutaminase 1 expression. We further showed that in these cells, ErbB2-mediated up-regulation of glutaminase 1 was independent of c-Myc expression. In addition, we found that activation of PI3K/Akt or MAPK pathway was not sufficient to up-regulate glutaminase 1 expression. Instead, inhibition of NF-B down-regulated glutaminase 1 expression whereas stimulation of NF-B induced glutaminase 1 expression, suggesting a PI3K/Akt-independent activation of NF-B signaling pathway up-regulates glutaminase 1. Finally, inhibition of glutaminase activity significantly decreased human breast cancer cell proliferation.

We expressed cDNAs harboring these mutations in NIH-3T3 cells and found that the mutants support anchorage-independent proliferation. We furthermore found that substitution of any one of a number of amino acids in this region of the protein is oncogenic. We sought to biochemically characterize the extracellular domain mutations of ERBB2 and found that they cause oncogenic transformation by one of two mechanisms', ' elevation of C-terminal tail phosphorylation, or reduction-sensitive covalent dimerization unaccompanied by increases in C-terminal phosphorylation. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in the cell by stable isotope labeling followed by mass spectrometry (SILAC) revealed that both classes of mutant receptor phosphorylated the same set of proteins to effect transformation. The most prominent targets were proteins involved in cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics, controlling cell motility. STAT3 was also phosphorylated to a limited extent in ERBB2-transformed cells. Interestingly, STAT3 phosphorylation was mediated solely by a JAK-dependent autocrine loop in cells transformed by the ERBB2 mutants activated by reduction-sensitive dimerization; whereas both ERBB2 and JAK family kinases contributed to STAT3 phosphorylation in cells transformed by ERBB2 mutants exhibiting increased C-terminal phosphorylation. In order to characterize inhibitor sensitivity, we transformed Ba/F3 cells to IL-3 independence with the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants.

Several trials have shown the prognostic relevance of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in early and metastatic breast cancers. As it appears that the CTC, and consequently the metastatic cells, may have a very different receptor status than the related primary tumors, it is of the highest relevance to analyze ER and ErbB2 expression of the CTC. Experimental procedures', ' We developed a triple fluorescence technique to visualize simultaneously cytokeratin (8/18, 8/19), ER and ErbB2 on each individual cell. Using this protocol, we analyzed ER and ErbB2 expression in various breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, Cama-1, ZR75, SK-Br-3, HCC 3153, MDA-MB-231), and compared ER expression in the different cell lines using also immunostaining. We were then able to test the CTC presence (CK positivity) and ER and ErbB2 expressions on blood samples (cytospins) collected from 15 metastatic breast cancer patients. Results', ' The 2-step triple fluorescence protocol was optimized to visualize CK in green (DyLight488 conjugate), ER in red (cy3 conjugate) and ErbB2 in blue (AMCA conjugate). Using in parallel this triple fluorescence protocol and the reference immunostaining technique, we could analyze that ER-positive cell lines express very different levels of ER and within one cell line, cells can express low, moderate and/or high levels of ER. The identification of cells that express a very low level of ER is compulsory as the CTC from one unique patient can potentially express differently ER. Consequently, ER-positivity and -negativity have to be clearly defined. CTC analysis from patient blood samples was then performed with an individual assessment, for each single isolated cell, of cytokeratin (epithelial marker that peripheral blood cells should not express) and of ER and ErbB2 expressions. We were able to identify, among the CTC positive patients, changes between primary tumor status and CTC status, e.g. ER-positive primary tumors with both ER-positive and ER-negative CTC. Those ER-negative CTC may direct towards tamoxifen resistance and have to be identified among other ER-positive cells, similarly as any ErbB2 negative CTC. Conclusion', ' We demonstrated that triple immunofluorescence is very relevant, first to identify CTC, and then to allow an individual assessment of ER and ErbB2 expression, at the protein level. Moreover, the approach we developed allows to characterize a population of CTC with a very low expression of ER. Large multicentric cohorts of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant therapy should now be analyzed for both ER and ErbB2 status of the CTC, compared to the primary tumor profile.

Unfortunately, only a fraction of patients treated with trastuzumab durably respond to the treatment. Moreover, patients that are treated long term with this antibody develop resistance. One of the proposed mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance is the expression of 611-CTF, a C-terminal fragment of ErbB2 which lacks most of its extracellular domain. Remarkably, 611-CTF is hyperactive and has been associated with increased cell migration, tumor progression and metastasis.Currently nothing is known regarding mechanisms which lead to 611-CTF down-regulation. This represents a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of 611-CTF and receptor fragments in general. Since 611-CTF is associated with poor clinical outcome and therapeutic resistance, it is essential to clarify the mechanisms by which this ErbB2 fragment is regulated.

        "Background":"['ErbB2 expression is observed in 25 - 30 % of invasive breast cancers and is associated with reduced response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to relapse and reduced overall survival of breast cancer patients. Malignant mammary epithelial cells that overexpress ErbB2 exhibit enhanced proliferation, invasion of mammary tissue and metastasis. The stability of overexpressed mature ErbB2 at the plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells is critically dependent on its interaction with the chaperone protein, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Thus, Hsp90 promotes the proliferation and survival of malignant mammary epithelial cells and interruption of this interaction is expected to inhibit the growth of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. 17-AminoAllyl-Geldanamycin (17-AAG), an Hsp90 inhibitor, is a semi-synthetic ansamycin antibiotic currently in phase II clinical trials for breast cancer treatment (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Because it preferentially binds to Hsp90 of the chaperone complex in malignant mammary epithelial cells, treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer with 17-AAG is expected to destabilize ErbB2 and inhibit tumor growth. While a number of Hsp90 client proteins have been identified, ErbB2 is amongst the most sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition. These facts provide strong rationale for using 17-AAG as a part of the targeted therapy against ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. However the cellular machinery responsible for 17-AAG induced degradation of ErbB2 is not completely understood. At present it is unclear whether internalization of ErbB2 occurs via Clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytosis. Furthermore it is unresolved if the degradation of ErbB2 is dependent upon proteasomal or lysosomal proteolysis. And although C-terminus of Hsp70 Interacting Protein (CHIP) and Cullin 5 were identified as E3 ligases responsible for the ubiquitination of ErbB2, it is unknown if these ligases are the sole E3s responsible for the ubiquitnation of ErbB2. Also vague is if the rerouting of ErbB2 from the recycling pathway to the degradative pathway in response to 17-AAG is exclusively dependent upon ubiquitnation. In this current work we attempt to bridge these critical gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of 17-AAG induced degradation of ErbB2 using an automated microscopy-based analysis to identify genes whose siRNA-dependent suppression reduces 17AAG-induced ErbB2 degradation. We expect that this work will identify additional targets for therapeutic intervention and potential biomarkers of response to breast cancer drug therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors.']",

The penetrance of the multiacinar phenotype is incomplete and random, and dimerization with other ErbB family members gives rise to quantitative differences in penetrance. Our goal is to understand the mechanism by which a multiacinus initiates and why only a random fraction of the cultured acini exhibit the morphogenetic defect when ErbB2 is activated. Our working hypothesis is that acute differences (dichotomies) in gene expression develop among acini and give rise to the distinct 3D phenotypes induced by ErbB2. The transcriptional dichotomies that exist before the appearance of the multiacinar phenoptype will be the ones most likely to control it. We are using a new technique, called stochastic profiling, that our lab developed for discovering transcriptional dichotomies in a seemingly uniform cell population. We have established single ErbB2 dimer clones with similar expression levels of ErbB2 and its dimerization partner. Expression of the ErbB2 constructs was also validated at the single-cell level in frozen acinar sections by RNA FISH. Laser capture microdissection was used to select a small number of cells (10-100 cells) from the fresh frozen 3D sections followed by RNA extraction and small-sample cDNA amplification. The amplification parameters were optimized for the ErbB2 clones in different culture formats. We observed good quantitative linearity and amplification efficiencies for a wide range of high- and low-abundance targets in a 2D-culture format. We are working to improve the amplification efficiency of samples microdissected in the 3D-culture format. The long-term goal is to link upstream acinus-specific expression programs to downstream morphogenetic heterogeneities.

In contrast, active immunotherapy through therapeutic vaccination has yet to be proven clinically effective for breast cancer. One potential means of improving vaccine therapy is by delivering breast cancer antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) for enhanced antigen presentation. To achieve this in vivo, we have pseudotyped lentiviral vector vaccines with a modified Sindbis Virus glycoprotein that targets the C-type lectin DC-SIGN, which is expressed on DCs. We hypothesized that utilizing these DC-targeting lentiviral vectors as a breast cancer vaccine could lead to an improved immune response against self antigens found in breast cancer tumors. Such an improved immune response may help to prevent or slow tumor growth in breast cancer models. To test these hypotheses, we have constructed lentiviral vectors encoding each of the breast cancer antigens, human Her2 (ERBB2) and mouse alpha-lactalbumin (Lalba). Single injections were able to amplify antigen-specific CD8 T cells to 1.6% of total CD8 T cells in BALB/cJ mice and 0.7% in transgenic ERBB2 mice. This compares favorably with recently published vector vaccines, which have elicited 0.9% and <0.1% antigen-specific CD8 T cells under similar conditions. In addition, DC-targeted immunization of these mice completely inhibited tumor growth in a foreign antigen environment (ERBB2 + wt BALB/cJ), while it significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth in a self-antigen environment (Lalba + BALB/cJ or ERBB2 + FVB/Tg.MMTV.f.huHER2 #5). Our data show that these vectors alone can provide an effective therapy. Future studies may be able to improve these responses by combining DC-targeted immunization with established methods of reducing cancer immunosuppression.

Neratinib is a HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor being evaluated for use in ERBB2 mutated breast cancer. Neratinib has been found to have clinical activity on heavily pre-treated ERBB2 mutant breast cancer patients. We are evaluating the response and genomic profiles of 3 postmenopausal patients with metastatic ERBB2 mutant/non-amplified breast cancer receiving neratinib and fulvestrant NCT01953926, NCT01670877. Methods', ' Samples were collected at different points during treatment and CTCs were identified. Other representative cells were tracked but not classified as CTCs. CD45-CK+ cells with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear apoptosis were defined as CTC-Apoptotic. CD45- cells expressing little to no CK but otherwise meeting morphological criteria for CTCs are CTC-LowCK. CD45-CK+ cells with small nuclear size are CTC-SmallCK. Single CTCs will be analyzed using whole genome copy number variation to determine chromosomal alterations. Results', ' The patients had an average of 4.7 lines of therapy for metastatic disease before neratinib. Two had stable disease and one had progression. The patient who progressed had a rise in the number of CTCs from 37 to 52 cells/ml and drop in apoptotic cells from 5 to 0 cells/ml. Conclusions', ' The high CTC count of the patient who progressed may suggest more aggressive disease. The drop in the apoptotic cell count may correlate with a failure to respond to therapy. Samples have been sent for copy number variation profiling. The goal is to identify any genomic amplifications or deletions associated with clinical response and progression after targeted therapy.

        "Background":"['The generation of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Integrated data sets may lead to more efficient and specific approaches for the elucidation of therapeutic targets and biomarkers and for the identification of specific small molecule inhibitors. However, the power of these computational methods to study human cancer from an unbiased global perspective is severely compromised by the low through-put approaches necessary to functionally validate the in silico predictions. During the last years, RNA interference (RNAi) emerged as a very powerful genetic strategy to functionally interrogate the entire genome by loss-of-function studies. This cellular process can be experimentally controlled to knock down the expression of any specific gene. Our group has pioneered the development of RNAi-based genetic tools to translate RNAi studies to mammalian systems generating a shRNA-mir pooled lentiviral library that allows performing functional studies at genome-wide level. ErbB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase found overexpressed in 20-40% of breast tumors correlating with a malignant phenotype and worse prognosis. Different targeted therapies have been developed to specifically inhibit its activity such the monoclonal antibody Herceptin, or the small tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib. Despite of the success of these inhibitors in the treatment of tumors that overexpress ErbB2, about 30% of them become resistant making necessary to look for alternative targets in these cases. The combination of the state-of-the-art computational analysis and RNAi-based technology toward system biology studies must represent a powerful tool to dissect the regulatory networks that govern the homeostasis of breast tumors. Applying this combined approach to an overexpressing ErbB2 breast cancer model we have identified the genes that are critical in those cells.']",

We analyzed copy number alterations in a discovery set of 48 EBCs using oligoarray-comparative genomic hybridization. In addition, the recurrently altered regions (RARs) associated with poor prognosis were validated using an independent set of 97 EBCs. A total of 23 RARs were defined in the discovery set.

        "Background":"['In a recent report (Paroni et al, Oncogene, 31', '3431-43, 2012), we demonstrated that 25% of all ERBB2+ breast cancers present with a co-amplification of the RARA locus, encoding the nuclear retinoic acid receptor, RAR. ERBB2+/RARA+ breast cancer cell lines, like SKBR3 and AU565, are sensitive to the anti-proliferative and cyto-differentiating effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), whereas the ERBB2+/RARA counterparts are refractory. Simultaneous targeting of RAR with ATRA and ERBB2 with lapatinib in SKBR3 and AU565 cells leads to synergistic interactions as to growth inhibition and cyto-differentiation. In addition, combinations of ATRA and lapatinib exert an apoptotic effect, which is not observed with the single components. This suggests that ERBB2+/RARA+ breast cancer patients may benefit from lapatinib+ATRA regimens and represent the rationale of an ongoing clinical trial.The use of lapatinib and ATRA for the stratified therapy of ERBB2+/RARA+ patients requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between the two compounds. We evaluated the effects of lapatinib and/or ATRA on the expression profiles of more than 1,000 microRNAs in SKBR3 cells using an appropriate microarray platform. Both lapatinib and ATRA caused up- and down-regulation of numerous microRNAs. The combination of the two compounds enhanced the action of the single components of the mixture and resulted in the up- and down-regulation of novel target microRNAs as well. We integrated these results with microRNA-target-gene prediction algorithms and whole-genome gene-expression data looking for significant correlations between microRNA and potential/established target mRNA levels. Network analysis led to the identification of two highly interconnected microRNA/target-mRNA modules controlled in opposite directions by lapatinib+ATRA. The first one consists of six microRNAs (miR-1207-5-p, miR-874, miR-134, miR-762, miR-1181 and miR-320c) which are up-regulated by lapatinib+ATRA and control a common set of down-regulated target mRNAs in a coordinate fashion. Most of the mRNAs of the module control cell proliferation in a positive fashion. The second network consists of seven microRNAs (miR-203, miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-5p, miR-210, miR-362-5p, miR-532-5p and miR-342-3p) which are down-regulated by lapatinib+ATRA and control a series of up-regulated target-mRNAs. In this case, the majority of regulated genes is involved in negative regulation of cell proliferation. Coordinated regulation of microRNA sets controlling a common group of genes and functions represents a new concept that deserves further studies. Currently, we are in the process of establishing the functional significance of the identified microRNA modules for the anti-tumor effects of lapatinib and ATRA.']",

Mutations are tracked in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) to examine the clonal selection of tumor cells evoked by therapy. Here we report the results from a patient with metastasizing HER2 negative and estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (Luminal A) previously exposed to seven lines of chemotherapy as well as ER antagonists and aromatase inhibitors. After enrollment in the program, examination of liver metastases by whole exome sequencing, RNA-Seq and microarray expression analysis revealed high expression of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) as well as a mutation in the ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (H524L). Moreover, somatic variants in ERBB2 and PIK3CA were identified, including an activating mutation in ERBB2 (S310Y), and consequently the patient treated with neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER (EGFR/ERBB2/ERBB4) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, through a compassionate use program (Puma Biotechnology Inc.). Neratinib caused a rapid decrease in the allelic frequency of ERBB2 (S310Y) cfDNA after 2 days with a continuous decline during the next 7 days. Consistent with this neratinib treatment effect, MRI scans showed regression of the liver metastases. In contrast, the PIK3CA mutation showed an increase in the allele frequency, indicating the existence of a subclone that was insensitive to neratinib. Two months later, the total amount of cfDNA increased and continued to do so. After 5 months on neratinib, the patient progressed with the appearance of brain metastases which were surgically removed and subject to WES. The vast majority of the mutations, including the ERBB2 mutation, observed in the liver metastasis could not be identified in the brain metastases, except for the PIK3CA mutation. More than 300 new variants were exclusively identified in the brain metastases, among these, ERBB3 as well as new PIK3CA, and ESR1 mutations, that were not present in the pre-treatment cfDNA samples. After 4 months of treatment, an increase in the mutation frequency of the liver metastasis specific ESR1 and ERBB2 mutations was observed. In conclusion, neratinib was able to suppress an activating ERBB2 mutation in a heavily pre-treated ER+ breast cancer patient. However, refractory tumor clones harboring ERBB3, PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations developed in brain. These data indicate that combining neratinib with fulvestrant or inhibitors of the HER3/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway might prove beneficial to overcome potential resistance mechanisms to therapy.The two first authors contributed equally.']",

        "Background":"['ERBB2 kinase domain mutations were recently reported in some solid cancers. Moreover, certain ERBB2 mutations were shown to cause lapatinib resistance in vitro thus predicting their emergence in treated patients. We have recently shown that ERBB2-L755S, ERBB2-L755P and ERBB2-T798M mutants cause lapatinib resistance by stabilizing the active kinase conformation (DFG-in), which is incompatible with lapatinib binding (DFG-out). Using an in vitro cell-based drug resistance screen we also showed that these lapatinib resistant mutations might cause secondary resistance in patients treated with lapatinb. Thus, it is important to search for alternate treatment strategies to overcome lapatinib resistance. ERBB2 kinase is a client for HSP90 and is degraded by HSP90 inhibitor treatment. We thus tested if targeting ERBB2 mutant stability by inhibiting HSP90 overcomes lapatinib resistance. Since the kinase domain is important for the ERBB2 interaction with HSP90, we tested whether ERBB2 kinase domain mutants retained their interaction with the chaperone. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the interaction of ERBB2 mutants with HSP90 is intact. Importantly, HSP90 inhibitor treatment resulted in the degradation of lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutants as observed with the wild type ERBB2 kinase. Thus, HSP90 inhibitors may offer an alternative treatment option to overcome primary or secondary lapatinib resistance in patients harbouring ERBB2 mutations. Moreover, combined targeting of different physiological aspects (enzyme activity and protein stability) may prevent the emergence of secondary drug resistance due to kinase domain mutations.']",

In order to determine why these cell lines were resistant to Cmab we performed genome wide copy number analyses and analysis of ERBB family ligands. We analyzed the growth of Cmab sensitive and resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we obtained clinical specimens from colon cancer pts treated with Cmab based therapy. Specimens obtained prior to therapy and at the time of Cmab resistance were evaluated. <Result> Genome-wide copy number analysis detected the localized genomic amplification in HCC 827CR, which was identified as ERBB2 and confirmed using FISH. Amplification of ERBB2 was also detected in the GEO CR cells. ERBB2 inhibition, with either trastuzumab or lapatinib, restored the Cmab sensitivity in those cell lines. In drug sensitive cell lines, Cmab effectively inhibited growth and ERK1/2 signaling both of which were inhibited in presence of ERBB2 amplification. In contrast, despite detecting ERBB2 activation in the A431 CR cells we did not identify ERBB2 amplification. Instead we detected increased levels of the ERBB3 ligand heregulin. The disruption of ERBB2/ERBB3 herterodimerization using pertuzumab restored Cmab sensitivity in A431CR in vitro and in vivo. CRC patients with ERBB2 amplification (n=13) treated with Cmab based therapy survived significantly shorter than pts without ERBB2 amplification (n=220) (The median OS 89 vs 149 days, p=0.0013; log-rank test). We also identified evidence of ERBB2 amplification at the time of acquired drug resistance using either tumor biopsies or by analyzing serum HER2 extracellular domain (ECD). We further analyzed plasma heregulin from CRC patients and the concentrations ranged widely (Median, 1622 pg/ml; range 0-18,045 pg/ml). Pts who achieved response to Cmab therapy (n=16) had significantly lower heregulin concentration than pts without response (n=49) (Mean, 1,050 vs 3,601 pg/ml, p<0.001; unpaired t test). In addition we identified a significant increase in plasma heregulin levels obtained at the time of clinic cetuximab resistance compared to pre-treatment specimens (p=0.0313). <Conclusion> We identify activation of ERBB2 signaling, either through ERBB2 amplification or through heregulin upregulation, as a mechanism of both de novo and acquired cetuximab resistance.

        "Background":"['According to a 2012 study by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American women had a 41% higher rate of breast cancer mortality during 2005-2009 than did Caucasian women. Although overall cancer mortality rates have declined significantly in the U.S. since the early 1990s, the black-white mortality gap has been steadily growing. The underlying causes of this racial disparity are likely diverse, and include factors such as lower quality of care and reduced access to mammographic screening. However, more aggressive tumor biology may also contribute significantly to racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes.Recently, a low frequency single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, W452C, which occurs predominantly in African-American women (about 10% frequency), was significantly correlated with breast cancer. This study reported that tumors from patients harboring W452C do not amplify the erbB2 (HER2) gene or overexpress the protein, suggesting that this variant may contribute to breast cancer development through a mechanism distinct from the amplification common to HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Understanding the structural and functional differences associated with W452C will allow us to identify new strategies for customized breast cancer treatments for African American women.To address the role of the W452C SNP in breast cancer we applied a cell-free in vitro reconstitution system that uses nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) to solubilize and support functional membrane proteins. Cell-free produced wild type HER2 and W452C were tested for tyrosine phosphorylation as well as specific binding to therapeutic anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Our results showed comparable tyrosine phosphorylation levels for both wild type and W452C HER2, suggesting that the variant itself might not alone be a driver of cancer. We observed a decreased binding affinity of trastuzumab for W452C compared to wild type HER2, suggesting that W452-positive patients might not respond to trastuzumab treatment. On the other hand, we found that W452C has a higher affinity for pertuzumab. Overall, our studies suggest that the W452C variant may be differentially sensitive to clinically pertinent therapeutic agents. Further characterization of this variant will be important for the development of more effective and precise therapeutic interventions. This in turn could lead to targeted measures that help address racial disparity problems in breast cancer mortality.']",

        "Background":"['Local mammary estrogen production may be vital for breast cancer development because about 70% of breast cancers occur in postmenopausal women. Aromatase is a key enzyme essential for estrogen biosynthesis, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the most effective endocrine treatment for estrogen-responsive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. However, they are also accompanied a number of severe side-effects on bone and joints. Many researchers are currently focusing on developing the novel mammary-specific AIs to prevent or treat breast cancer to minimize the side effects of treatment. Phenformin, an antidiabetic drug, lowers serum glucose levels via activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival in non-small cell lung cancers. In vitro studies show that activated AMPK inhibits human mammary adipose tissue aromatase expression via suppression of binding of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) to aromatase promoters I.3/II, leading to decreased estrogen formation. We hypothesized that phenformin will be an effective adipose-specific AI for prevention and treatment of breast cancer. However, one of the major obstacles to define in vivo effects of phenformin on mammary aromatase expression is the lack of suitable mouse models because aromatase expression, present in the human breast, is absent in the mouse mammary gland. We developed a unique humanized aromatase mouse model (Aromhum) to mimic the human aromatase expression pattern and physiology in the mouse. We observed that tumorigenesis was accelerated in the mice overexpressing ERBB2 that were crossed with Aromhum mice (AE mice). Phenformin treatment (i.p., 70 mg/kg /day for 14 days) significantly decreased blood glucose levels by 37% in AE mice as compared to vehicle treatment. Phosphorylation of CREB, a downstream effector of the AMPK pathway, which mediates aromatase expression, was significantly decreased. Furthermore, after phenformin administration, mammary aromatase mRNA expression in AE mice was significantly decreased by 58% and estrogen response genes (SUSD3 and cyclin D1) were also reduced by about 65%. Real-time PCR showed that mammary AMPK1 mRNA expression is 10-fold higher compared with AMPK2 mRNA. Moreover, phenformin treatment significantly decreased AMPK1 mRNA levels by 53% but not AMPK2 mRNA expression in AE mice. Interestingly, daily oral phenformin treatment for 7 days significantly reduced mammary tumor volume of AE mice by 76%. In conclusion, phenformin decreased mammary aromatase expression and possible estrogen production, and reduced tumorigenesis via upregulation of the AMPK pathway in breast tissue of AE mice. This study provides justification for future testing of the adipose-specific preventive and therapeutic potential of the metabolic drug phenformin in postmenopausal breast cancer with minimal side-effects.']",

        "Background":"['ErbB2 overexpression gives rise to a highly invasive, aggressive phenotype associated with an increased activity of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins B and L and with a pericellular accumulation of lysosomes at the close vicinity of the cell membrane, enabling lysosomal exocytosis and secretion of lysosomal contents to the extracellular space. We recently showed that ErbB2 expression level correlates positively with cysteine cathepsin B and L levels in primary breast cancer and that ErbB2 regulates the expression of cathepsins B and L leading to their increased activity in several ErbB2-positive breast cancer cell lines. We found that the increased cysteine cathepsin activity is essential for the invasion of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells in 3-dimensional (3D) Matrigel cultures and that it is mediated by a novel signaling network that involves TGFR, ERK2-MAPK, PAK4, PKC and CDC42bp kinases and two transcription factors, Myeloid Zinc Finger 1 (MZF1) and ETS1, which regulate the ErbB2-induced expression of cathepsins B and L.We currently work on understanding the mechanisms that increase the transcriptional activity of MZF1 in breast cancer. Thus far we have identified two basic mechanisms that can increase MZF1 target gene expression', ' cancer-induced, increased levels of MZF1 and ErbB2 signaling-induced, increased transcriptional activity of MZF1. Our results thus far show that the level of MZF1 can be directly downregulated by specific, non-coding RNAs. The cancer-induced increase in the MZF1 level is most likely due to changes in the expression of these non-coding RNAs. Preliminary data employing two-dimensional SDS-PAGE as well as the factual involvement of several kinases downstream of ErbB2 for its transcriptional activity, suggests that MZF1, a prominent phosphoprotein, is activated by phosphorylation in response to ErbB2 signaling. Towards this end we have set up various experiments to verify the phosphorylation of MZF1 in response to ErbB2 signaling. We now aim at the identification of the ErbB2-regulated phosphorylation sites. With this work we expect to collect more information about the molecular mechanisms underlying ErbB2-induced invasion.

        "Background":"['Long-term cumulative exposure to estrogen increases the breast cancer risk in women. Breast tissue must have a normal complement of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PGR) for the normal development of breast tissue. Clinically, about 22% of patients with breast cancer overexpress the ERBB2 (HER2/neu) receptor tyrosine kinase. However, many HER2/neu-positive mammary tumors do not express ER or PGR by the time they are clinically recognizable. So far, the role of estrogen in the development of ER-negative breast cancers is not clearly defined. Aromatase is a key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis and its expression pattern between human and mouse is drastically different. We generated transgenic humanized aromatase (Aromhum) mice to mimic the human aromatase distribution pattern in the mouse. Aromhum mice exhibited an increased incidence of lobuloalveolar breast hyperplasia associated with increased estrogen levels locally in mammary glands but not in the circulation. To demonstrate the important role of ER signaling in ER-negative breast tumor development and eventually to test a prevention strategy using aromatase inhibitors in this mouse model, Aromhum mice were crossed with ERBB2 transgenic mice to generate wild-type (WT), Aromhum, ERBB2 and Aromhum/ERBB2 (AE) mice. WT or Aromhum transgenic mice were free of tumors during the 26 week of follow-up. On the other hand, 56% of ERBB2 (only) mice developed mammary tumors, as expected. Interestingly, AE mice had a significantly higher (86%, p<0.05) tumor incidence compared with ERBB2 mice. Thus, it appeared that the human aromatase transgene increased the rate of ERBB2induced mammary tumor growth. The tumors that arose in either ERBB2 or AE mice were histological adenocarcinomas as was previously reported for the ERBB2 transgenic mice. Levels of ER and PGR in benign mammary epithelial cells were higher in Aromhum and AE mice as compared to WT and ERBB2 mice. We further measured the dynamic change of sex hormone receptor status from normal mammary epithelial cells to fully developed tumors. Different stages of mammary tumors were chosen from nonpalpable microscopic visible early stage tumor to various sizes of late stage tumors. ER and PGR were present in early stage tumor but gradually decreased and eventually were absent in late stage tumors. The estrogen response gene, cyclin D1 was higher in benign and malignant mammary epithelium of Aromhum and AE mice compared with WT mice. Cell proliferation evaluated by Ki67 staining was significantly higher in benign mammary epithelium and tumors of AE mice as compared to those of ERBB2 mice. In conclusion, estrogen expedited the early development of ER-negative mammary tumors caused by a primary genetic hit (HER2/neu) via increasing cell proliferation through ER-mediated signal transduction.

Moreover, elevated expression of erbB3 potently stimulated activation of Stat3, which has been validated to act as a promoter of tumor invasion and metastasis in many type cancers. Suppression of Stat3 signaling via its inhibitor, S3I-201, significantly alleviated EMT and cell motility/migration that were triggered by activation of erbB3.

The p21 regulated serine/threonine kinase PAK1, implicated in tamoxifen resistance, phosphorylates EBP1 in vitro and in vivo at T261. Phosphorylation of EBP1 at this site induces tamoxifen resistance. We thus postulated that inhibition of PAK1 activity, by restoring EBP1 function, could ameliorate the hormone refractory phenotype of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. Transient transfection studies indicated that an EBP1 T261E mutant, which mimics EPB1 phosphorylated by PAK1, increased ErbB2 protein levels. An EBP1 T261A mutant, unable to be phosphorylated by PAK1, ameliorated PAK1-induced tamoxifen resistance, suggesting that phosphorylation of EBP1 by PAK1 contributes to tamoxifen resistance. We then tested if pharmacological inhibition of PAK1 activity might render hormone resistant cells, which endogenously overexpress PAK1 and ErbB2, tamoxifen sensitive. Transfection of EBP1 sensitized cells to tamoxifen. The T261A EBP1 mutant more potently sensitized cells to tamoxifen than wild type EBP1. IPA-3, a specific small MW PAK1 inhibitor, sensitized cells to tamoxifen only when EBP1 was ectopically expressed. However, IPA-3 did not further affect sensitivity of T261A overexperssing cells, suggesting that the phosphorylation of EBP1 by PAK1 played a role in the EBP1-induced hormone sensitivity. IPA had no effect on tamoxifen resistance in T47D cells in which EBP1 protein had been ablated by shRNA. The IPA-induced increase in tamoxifen sensitivity was accompanied by a decrease in ErbB2 levels in EBP1 overexpressing, but not vector control cells. These studies suggest that phosphorylation of EBP1 may be a novel additional mechanism of PAK1-induced hormone resistance. In addition, strategies that increase the pool of functional EBP1 and decrease PAK1 activity may affect hormone resistant cell growth. Our results also suggest that PAK1 directed therapies may be more effective in patients that express high levels of EBP1.*contributed equally to this work']",

        "Meeting_name":" Hypoxia induces lapatinib resistance in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells via regulation of DUSP2",
        "Background":"['Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. Many factors are associated with this disease including overexpression/amplification of the tyrosine kinase HER2/ErbB2. ErbB2 belongs to the EGFR-family of receptor tyrosine kinases and its overexpression can activate multiple signaling pathways that can promote tumor progression via regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Breast cancer patients with ErbB2 amplifications are currently treated with lapatinib, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that blocks the active site of ErbB2 to inhibit EGFR/ErbB2 downstream signaling. While lapatinib has displayed clinical efficacy in breast cancer patients, acquired resistance has been reported and the mechanism of this resistance is poorly understood.Hypoxia or low oxygen tension occurs in many breast cancers and is associated with poor patient survival. One of the major players in the cellular response to hypoxia is stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. As a result, hypoxic tumors often exhibit weak response to chemotherapeutic agents and are associated with poor prognosis.Here, we show that hypoxia, via HIF-1, blocks lapatinib-mediated effects on ErbB2-expressing mammary epithelial and ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells. Lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in three dimensional (3D) cultures are decreased under hypoxic conditions (1%O2) Consistent with these results, we find that hypoxia can maintain activation of signaling pathways downstream from ErbB2 including AKT and ERK in the presence of lapatinib. This protective effect depends on HIF-1 expression as cells expressing HIF-1 RNAi no longer are resistant to lapatinib treatment. Moreover, overexpression of stable HIF-1 in ErbB2-expressing cells under normoxic conditions is sufficient to inhibit lapatinib-mediated effects on proliferation and survival and maintain ERK and AKT signaling. Moreover, hypoxia-mediated activation of ERK signaling, but not AKT, is required for lapatinib resistance as MEK inhibitors (including clinically approved tramatinib) reverses hypoxia-mediated lapatinib resistance in standard and 3D cultures. HIF-1 may bypass lapatinib-treated inhibition of the ERK pathway via its regulation of dual-specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2). DUSP2 is a negative regulator of the ERK pathway and we show that cells exposed to hypoxia contain decreased DUSP2 levels and correlate with increased Erk activation. Indeed, reducing DUSP2 expression via RNAi in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells is sufficient to reduce lapatanib-mediated effects under normal oxygen. Thus, hypoxia, via HIF-1, causes lapatinib resistance in ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells and suggests that targeting MEK/ERK pathway in hypoxic breast cancer may increase sensitivity to ErbB2-targeted therapy.']",

EMMPRIN is implicated in development of therapy resistance by forming a functional transporter complex through interaction with CD44 and monocarboxylate transporter 4. Presence of EMMPRIN transporter protein complexes may therefore be a better predictor for therapy resistance and a direct target for drugs. In this study, we aimed to identify EMMPRIN-CD44 protein interactions in a large panel of breast cancer cell lines. EMMPRIN-CD44 protein interaction was investigated in a panel of 41 breast cancer cell lines, which represent the luminal (n=12), ErbB2 (n=13), basal (n=7), and normal-like (n=9) intrinsic subtypes, using in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (isPLA). In addition, protein expression of both EMMPRIN and CD44 in the cell lines was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC and isPLA read-out was performed by bright field microscopy and 0-1-2-3 scoring was applied to none-weak-moderate-strong staining (IHC) or interaction (isPLA), respectively. Moderate and strong EMMPRIN expression was observed in 50% of luminal, 36% of ErbB2, 86% of basal, and 100% of normal-like cell lines, and moderate to high CD44 expression was detected in 64%, 83%, 86%, and 100% in luminal, ErbB2, basal, and normal-like cell lines, respectively.

Our results indicate that EMMPRIN-CD44 protein complexes are formed exclusively in basal and normal-like breast cancer cell lines.

The purpose of this study is to describe the molecular profile of ILC and compare it to the one of invasive ductal cancer (IDC).Methods', ' Three-hundred and thirty nine pure ILC specimens profiled from January 2012 - November 2015 were evaluated (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). Multiplatform profiling consisted of gene sequencing (next generation sequencing [NGS]), gene amplification (CISH or FISH), and protein expression (immunohistochemistry [IHC]). Molecular characteristics of estrogen receptor (ER) positive and human epidermal growth receptor factor 2 (HER2) negative pure ILC (n = 236) and IDC (n = 286) were compared.Results', ' By IHC, ER expression was present in 87.7% (277/316), progesterone receptor in 59.6% (198/313), HER2 in 3.5% (11/313), androgen receptor in 87% (262/301), PD-L1 in 8.1% (12/148) and PTEN in 63.3% (198/313).

Profiling of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) could more accurately define actionable genomic alterations and reveal novel alterations that arise under the selective pressure and clonal evolution of prior therapy. Utilizing a 410-gene targeted capture-based sequencing platform (MSK-IMPACT), we analyzed 920 tumors (62% metastatic, 38% primary) from 874 MBC patients for somatic mutations, DNA copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements (planned final analysis 1000 patients). Detailed clinical data including treatment outcomes was collected for all patients. The cohort was representative of the well characterized clinical subtypes of breast cancer with 71% ER+ or PR+ and HER2-, 17% HER2+, and 12% triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).Our analysis revealed recurrent alterations in multiple pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR (56%), cell cycle regulation (42%), RTK signaling (40%), epigenetic regulation (33%) and MAPK/ERK (19%) pathways. The most frequent actionable alterations include', ' PIK3CA mutation (36%), ERBB2 amplification (15%), FGFR1 amplification (12%), ESR1 mutation (11%), PTEN mutation/deletion (10%), AKT1 mutation (6%), and ERBB2 mutation (5%). The genomic landscape was significantly different across breast cancer subtypes. For example, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was altered in ER+ MBC mainly through activating PIK3CA mutations whereas PTEN deletion/mutations were most common in TNBC. We also identified significant differences in the genomic profiles of metastatic and primary tumor samples. Gene enrichment analyses revealed a subset of genes more frequently altered in metastatic tumors (STK11', ' 13 vs 2; ROS1', ' 14 vs 2; FGFR4', ' 15 vs 1) suggesting that mutations in these genes may play a role in breast tumor metastasis and/or therapy resistance. ESR1 mutations were predominantly present in metastatic tumors (88%) and were significantly associated with duration of prior hormonal therapy (P<0.0001). ESR1 mutations were also associated with a poor response to the ER degrader fulvestrant (median PFS', ' 4.8 vs 13.7 months, mutated vs wild type; P = 0.01).

While identified previously in other tumors, RHOA G17 has never been implicated in breast cancer.In summary, our genomic analyses of this large cohort of MBC patients revealed actionable alterations in over 60% of the patients. 29% of patients with these alterations were enrolled in clinical trials of matched targeted therapies to date (PIK3CA 27%, AKT1 30%, ESR1 23%, ERBB2 39%) suggesting that prospective genomic characterization can accelerate enrollment of patients with MBC onto therapeutic clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['Gene expression profiles of human breast tumors have greatly expanded our understanding of the genes and pathways that underlie breast cancer. Profiling studies have also supported a molecular classification of breast cancer. The resulting molecular subtypes Luminal, Basal-like, ERBB2+, and Normal-like were shown to have different prognostic and predictive characteristics. Related studies have led to a proliferation of multigene prognostic and predictive diagnostic tests. Two independent multigene tests, OncoType Dx and MammaPrint, have been shown to be helpful in predicting the risk of recurrence of patients with early stage breast cancer. Current multigene tests consistently prioritize the proliferation, estrogen receptor (ER), and ERBB2 pathways. An alternative approach to identifying key molecular variables within breast cancer is based on a definition of objectively defined tumor co-expression patterns. To this end, we defined co-expression patterns within 56 independent breast cancer molecular profiling datasets representing >5,000 unique patients. We then performed a meta-analysis across datasets to define the most robust, consistently occurring co-expression patterns. These patterns, termed modules, recapitulate the proliferation, ER, and ERBB2 pathways, but also monitor expression of other important variables including core cancer cell growth pathways, immune signaling and microenvironment, and hallmark genomic aberrations. An important feature of co-expression patterns is that a small number of genes serve as an effective surrogate for each module. Thus, we created a single multigene qPCR test that measures the expression of 18 distinct breast cancer modules and validated the test for use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. In retrospective microarray scoring analyses with key clinical datasets, and with analysis of FFPE specimens from breast cancer cohorts, we demonstrate that breast cancer modules can be used to recapitulate the molecular subtypes of breast cancer and to have prognostic and predictive properties similar to the current multigene tests.

        "Background":"['Progesterone receptors (PR) are emerging as important breast cancer drivers. Elevated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) signaling is common in breast cancer and these kinases drive direct PR-B, but not PR-A, Ser294 phosphorylation. Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and SUMOylation, dramatically impact PR transcriptional activity. Phospho-Ser294 PRs are less SUMOylated on Lys388 (i.e. a repressive modification). Thus, active mitogenic kinase signaling provides a mechanism for PR derepression (i.e. transcriptional activation) during breast cancer progression. A broad range of PR protein expression is observed clinically; PR-negative tumors are generally more aggressive. However, clinical (IHC) assays do not measure phospho-PRs, which turnover rapidly and may appear undetectable, confounding the true level of activated PR within tumors. A PR gene signature would provide a valuable marker of PR contribution to breast cancer progression. Global gene expression patterns were measured in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing either wild type or K388R (SUMOylation-deficient) PRs and subjected to pathway analysis. Target genes sensitive to changes in PR SUMOylation included those required for proliferative and pro-survival signaling. DeSUMOylated K388R receptors were preferentially recruited to enhancer regions of derepressed genes. SUMO-deficient (i.e. phospho-Ser294) PR gene signatures were significantly associated with human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2)-positive luminal breast tumors and predictive of early metastasis and shortened survival. Furthermore, treatment with antiprogestin or MEK inhibitors abrogated expression of SUMO-sensitive PR target-genes and inhibited progestin-driven proliferation in BT-474 (estrogen receptor (ER)+/PR+/ERBB2+) breast cancer cells. Similarly, treatment of T47D cells expressing deSUMOylated PR with ERBB2 inhibitors blocked progestin-dependent growth. Potential mechanisms of differential promoter selection were investigated. Notably, genes preferentially up-regulated by SUMO-deficient PR contain RUNX binding motifs located near their transcriptional start sites. Herein, we demonstrated that RUNX2 directly interacts with PR. Further, RUNX2 knockdown in breast cancer cells reduced SUMO-deficient PR dependent gene expression. Our studies suggest that deSUMOylated PR cooperates with RUNX2 to mediate promoter selective gene expression. We conclude that reversible PR SUMOylation/deSUMOylation profoundly alters PR target gene selection in breast cancer cells, in part via regulation of PR interactions with gene-specific co-factors, such as RUNX2. Patients whose ER+/PR+ tumors are driven by hyperactive phospho-PRs may benefit from endocrine (antiestrogen) therapies that also contain an antiprogestin.']",

About 25% of the breast cancer overexpress Her2 (ErbB2) proto-oncogene resulting in aggressive tumor phenotype and is associated in poor prognosis in patients. Though Her2 targeted therapies are being used hugely in clinical practice, a significant fraction of the Her2 positive tumors develop mechanisms to evade the targeted therapies of Her2 inhibition.

The sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SET) index measures transcriptional activity of the ER genomic pathway (165 ER-related genes). We investigated whether expression of genes for receptors ER (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), or HER-2 (ERBB2), the SET index, or a housekeeper gene (GAPDH) vary by stage of ER-positive breast cancer. Methods', \" We evaluated gene expression profiles (Affymetrix U133 microarrays, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) from 956 patients' clinical samples of ER-positive breast cancer, including 290 new samples profiled at MDACC and 666 samples from published datasets. Microarray data were uniformly normalized, log-transformed, and expression levels for single genes and the SET index were compared to pathologic AJCC stage (315 patients were stage I, 362 stage IIA, 151 stage IIB, 29 stage III, 27 stage IV at initial presentation, and 72 stage IV previously treated and/or at relapse) using a median ordered regression analysis (p < 0.05 was significant). Results\", ' SET index significantly decreased with advancing pathologic stage (p < 0.001), and PGR expression levels showed a similar, but lesser, effect (p = 0.014). However, expression levels of ESR1 and ERBB2 did not vary by stage. Overall, GAPDH gene expression increased with stage (p < 0.001), but that effect was only observed in stages III and IV. Expression of these genes was not significantly different between stage IV disease at initial presentation or at relapse. Conclusions', ' Expression levels of ESR1 and ERBB2 receptor genes did not vary, but ER-related genomic transcription (SET index and, to a lesser extent, PGR) declined significantly with increasing pathologic stage. This suggests that ER-positive breast cancer tends to have less transcriptional dependence on estrogen with increasing pathologic stage.

Similarly, increased expression of lysosomal proteases, cysteine cathepsins, is observed in several cancers and correlates with enhanced angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. We recently showed that ErbB2 level correlates positively with cysteine cathepsin B and L levels in primary breast cancer and that ErbB2 regulates the expression of cathepsins B and L leading to their increased activity in several ErbB2-positive breast cancer cell lines. The increased cysteine cathepsin activity is essential for the invasion of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells in 3-dimensional (3D) Matrigel cultures and is mediated by novel signaling network that involves TGFR, ERK2-MAPK, PAK4, PKC and CDC42bp kinases and two transcription factors, MZF1 and ETS1.With a pharmacological protein kinase inhibitor screen, using the ErbB2 inhibitor Lapatinib as positive control, we have now identified three inhibitors putatively targeting this novel ErbB2-induced signaling network. Our data shows that the treatment of ErbB2-positive, highly invasive breast or ovarian cancer cells with any of these inhibitors specifically reduces cysteine cathepsin expression, activity and invasion of these cancer cells in 3D Matrigel cultures. It also reverses lysosomal distribution from the invasion supporting pericellular position to less-invasive perinuclear position, where the lysosomal exocytosis and secretion of lysosome contents to extracellular space to assist extracellular matrix proteolysis becomes less likely.

        "Background":"['BackgroundInflammatory breast Cancer (IBC) is a rare aggressive breast cancer in which cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. IBC tumors have a high rate of ERBB2 positivity and response to ERBB2 targeted therapies. Due to the rarity of this cancer, the molecular etiology of this disease is poorly understood.Materials & MethodsA 208 gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel was used to analyze 20 IBC patient tumor and matched normal samples. Tissues were stained for cell signaling proteins and immune-markers. Cell line studies were performed to understand the impact of genomic variants on therapeutic selection.ResultsCommon pathway alterations reoccur among IBC samples that influence genome stability, PI3K signaling, and ERBB signaling. NGS revealed alterations in both the ERBB/PI3K pathways, including', ' ERBB2 amplification, ERBB3 mutations, and activating PI3K mutations. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for pS6 and pERBB3 identified ERBB/PI3K pathway activity in IBC samples. Cell line studies using siRNA and neutralizing antibodies demonstrate that mutant ERBB3 signaling contributes to IBC proliferation.IBC tumors with high levels of CD8+ immune infiltrate have a significantly higher somatic mutation rate than other IBC tumors. A proposed score (iScore) based on the somatic mutation rate and the average mutant allele frequency, showed greater correlation with the level of CD8+ immune infiltration. Furthermore, tumors with high CD8+ infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with a higher frequency of alterations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. IHC revealed high levels of the immune checkpoint signaling molecule PD-L1 in the inflammatory infiltrate of IBC tumors.ConclusionsThis study identifies a higher level of ERBB3 mutations than reported in other cancers and an important role for ERBB3 mutation in IBC. ERBB3 targeted therapies in combination with ERBB/PI3K drugs may be important for IBC treatment. Furthermore, high somatic mutations rates in a subset of IBC tumors harboring MMR mutations lead to greater levels of PD-L1+ immune infiltrates, which suggests a possible benefit from immunotherapies such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies. iScore, a more predictive value of immune infiltration in tumors, may be indicative of the level of neoantigen exposure to the immune system. The utility of the newly proposed iScore is currently being investigated as a method to predict immune cell infiltrates and immunotherapy response in other tumor types.']",

        "Background":"['Elevated expression of erbB3 interacts with erbB2 in breast cancer cells to confer chemo-resistance via induction of Survivin. However, the underlying mechanism of erbB3 signaling-induced upregulation of Survivin remains elusive. Ectopic expression or downregulation of erbB3 in erbB2-positive breast cancer cells did not alter Survivin mRNA levels and had no significant effect on Survivin protein stability. We thus hypothesize that the erbB3 signaling modulates certain miRNAs that target Survivin to influence its protein translation. Here we showed that overexpression of erbB3 decreased and specific knockdown of erbB3 enhanced expression of two Survivin-targeting miRNAs, miR-203 and miR-542-3p in breast cancer cells. While the specific inhibitor of either miR-203 or miR-542-3p clearly attenuated an anti-erbB3 antibody (Ab)-mediated reduction of Survivin, a more profound effect on Survivin expression was observed with inhibition of miR-542-3p than miR-203 inhibition. Consistently, miR-542-3p mimic was much more effective than miR-203 mimic not only to downregulate Survivin, but also to enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in the otherwise paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells. Moreover, using a murine tumor xenografts model established from a human breast cancer cell line expressing both erbB2 and erbB3, we discovered that the combinations of miR-542-3p mimic and paclitaxel, as compared to either agent alone, significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the erbB3 signaling upregulates Survivin via inhibition of miR-203 and miR-542-3p in erbB2-positive breast cancer cells. Since miR-542-3p has three binding sites on the 3’UTR of erbB3 mRNA, the miR-542-3p mimic serves as an excellent replacement therapeutic agent to downregulate Survivin, and thereby significantly enhances the antitumor activity of paclitaxel against erbB2-positive breast cancer.']",

        "Background":"['A major contributor to carcinogenesis is the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 regulates the proper folding and stabilization of several client proteins, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). ErbB2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor-proteins, and is a clinical target for the treatment of metastatic cancer, while HIF-1 is often stabilized and overexpressed in several cancers. The ability for Hsp90 to become a mature complex and to properly fold client proteins is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding with the co-chaperone, p23. Specific Hsp90 inhibitors, like geldanamycin, target the Hsp90 ATP-binding site to prevent formation of the mature complex. Although supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22', '6 n-3) has not been shown to specifically target the Hsp90 ATP-binding site, the current study demonstrates a similar effect by DHA causing a reduction in available intracellular ATP levels. DHA is the longest, most unsaturated omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) existing in biological membranes and has been shown to possess anti-cancer activity in several cancer models. Studies from our laboratory have shown that DHA enrichment can reduce cancer cell metabolism and intracellular ATP levels in both breast and lung cancer models. In this study, a novel mechanism for the ability of DHA to inhibit the Hsp90 chaperone complex is defined. In vitro analyses of BT-474 human breast ductal carcinoma, as well as the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were used to determine the impact of DHA-induced decreases of intracellular ATP levels. We found that the reduction in ATP levels by DHA treatment resulted in significant decreases in the association of Hsp90 and p23 in both cell lines. The decreased association of the Hsp90-p23 complex led to decreased levels of ErbB2 and HIF-1 client proteins, suggesting that DHA can modify Hsp90 chaperone function and attenuate client protein levels. Additionally, similar results were found when employing 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, which confirms that DHA and 2-DG can disrupt Hsp90 molecular chaperone function by decreasing cellular ATP levels. Consistent with these observations, when using a dose of DHA that did not significantly reduce intracellular ATP levels, no change in the Hsp90-p23 chaperone complex or protein levels of ErbB2 and HIF-1 were seen. These results demonstrate a potential use for dietary intervention to improve cancer therapy in tumors that overexpress Hsp90 client proteins.']",

To date, only a small number of ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations have been reported and biologically characterized. Moreover, the therapeutic impact of ERBB2 or ERBB3 mutant alleles and their value as an actionable target in patients has not been validated. While ERBB2 itself cannot bind ligand, it is a potent receptor that integrates growth signals via homo- or heterodimerization with other ERBB family members.Genomic alterations increase ERBB2 kinase activity by constitutively activating the kinase domain, enabling ligand-independent receptor activation, by promoting enhanced dimerization or other mechanisms that have yet to be elucidated. Although ERBB3 has limited inherent kinase activity and cannot homodimerize, ligand stimulation promotes dimerization with active kinases like ERBB2 and EGFR that can phosphorylate ERBB2 which then promotes transformation.Thus genomic alterations in ERBB3 may be a key means of promoting oncogenic signaling despite the protein lacking robust enzymatic activity. We performed an analysis of 100 large-scale next generation sequencing datasets newly generated by our group (bladder), our institution (MSKCC-IMPACT), or found in recently published repositories (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Broad, Genentech, Sanger, etc) to characterize the distribution and spectrum of mutations in the ERBB2 and ERBB3 genes. Data generated suggests that ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations are highly prevalent in bladder cancer (each 10%), and recurrent, but with less frequency (<5%), in stomach, breast, colon and lung cancers. Hotspots include mutation of S310F and a cluster of residues in the kinase domain in ERBB2 and the V104M mutation in ERBB3. Preliminary analysis of 300 tumors demonstrated that ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations present in a typically in a mutually exclusive pattern suggesting that these may be driver events with overlapping biologic effects. Generation and expression of several of these ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutants induced receptor activation, cell transformation and tumor growth in isogenic cell line and xenograft models. Treatment with the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, neratinib, in isogenic cell lines abrogated colony formation in soft agar and receptor activation and downstream signaling. We hope to correlate the in vitro potency of specific ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations with drug response in patients on ongoing or future clinical trials of targeted ERBB therapies and determine the whether lineage, subclonality and co-altered genes, if present, predict for drug resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Overexpression/amplification of the tyrosine kinase ErbB2 is often observed in breast cancers. ErbB2 expression activates EGFR signaling pathway promoting tumorigenesis. Breast cancer ErbB2-positive patients are treated with lapatinib, a dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor. Despite lapatinib clinical efficacy, acquired resistance has been reported and its mechanism is poorly understood. Another factor that is associated with mammary tumors is hypoxia. Hypoxia stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. As a result, hypoxic tumors are often chemoresistant.Here, we show that hypoxia decreases lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in three-dimensional cultures. In agreement with this data, hypoxia also promotes activation of signaling pathways downstream from ErbB2/EGFR including AKT and ERK in the presence of lapatinib. This protective effect depends on HIF-1 and can be abrogated by HIF-1 RNAi. Moreover stable overexpression HIF-1 in ErbB2-expressing cells under normoxic conditions is sufficient to rescue cell proliferation and survival and maintain ERK and AKT signaling in the presence of lapatinib. We also show that activation of ERK signaling is required for hypoxia-mediated lapatinib resistance and inhibition of MEK (a kinase upstream of Erk) reverses hypoxia protective effect on ErbB2-expressing cells. One potential mechanism of how hypoxia/HIF-1 may lead to activation of ERK pathway is via regulation of dual-specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2). DUSP2 is a negative regulator of ERK pathway. Here we demonstrate that cells exposed to hypoxia have decreased levels of DUSP2 and it correlate with increased activation of Erk signaling. Moreover, reducing DUSP2 expression alone in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells is sufficient to reduce lapatinib-mediated effects. And DUSP2 overexpression abrogates hypoxia-mediated protective effect on ErbB2-expressing cells treated with lapatinib.All these data suggests that targeting MEK-Erk signaling pathway may reverse hypoxia mediated lapatinib resistance and might be a viable option for lapatinib resistant ErbB2-posive tumors. Indeed, a combination of lapatinib and an FDA approved MEK inhibitor trametinib abrogates hypoxia protective effect on cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in three dimensional (3D) cultures. Thus targeting MEK/ERK pathway in hypoxic breast cancer may improve an anti-ErbB2 therapy in breast cancer.']",

Although the efficacy of trastuzumab depends on the HER2/neu status of the tumour, the single-agent response rate ranges from 12 to 30% and ew patients respond to trastuzumab monotherapy largely due to various resistance mechanisms. Amplifeid In Breast Cancer3 (AIB3) is a transcriptional coactivator. AIB3 plays an important role in embryonic development, adipocyte differentiation, metabolism.

Our previous data using knockout mouse mode combined cell culture indicate that AIB3 plays important role in breast tumorigenesis. Here we report that AIB3 can be phosphorylated by MAPK at S884 site and phosphorylation at S884 of AIB3 dramatically reduced ligand-dependent AIB3 interactions with estrogen receptors when compared with the wild-type unphosphorylated form, although there was a significant increase of interactions with the unliganded receptor.

        "Background":"['Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is the master regulator of the heat shock responses in eukaryotes. Upon exposure to a variety of stresses, HSF1 activates its target genes, subsequently activating the heat shock responses. Although not well understood, the functions of HSF1 are far beyond the classical induction of heat shock responses. Recent reports have shown that HSF1 plays an important role in cancer development. We investigated the role and mechanism of HSF1 in regulating oncogene-mediated dysregulated cellular metabolism and cell growth in cancer cells. We found that oncogene ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells possessed significantly higher level of glycolysis when compared to ErbB2-low expressing cells, and the downregulation of ErbB2 markedly decreased glycolysis. Overexpression of ErbB2 increased the expression of HSF1 and two critical glycolysis-regulating molecules, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and Hexokinase (HK). ErbB2 activated HSF1, indicated by the increased HSF1 trimer formation and DNA binding activity, and promoted the rate of HSF1 protein translation. HSF1 bound to the promoter of LDH-A and transcriptionally activated LDH-A. Meanwhile, the downregulation of HSF1 reduced the expression of LDH-A and subsequently decreased cancer cell glycolysis and growth. These results demonstrate that in cancer cells, ErbB2 promotes glycolysis and cell growth through HSF1-mediated upregulation of LDH-A. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and Paclitaxel (Taxol) are important drugs in treatment of breast cancers when used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients, necessitating alternate treatment strategies. Increased aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer and inhibition of glycolysis may offer a promising strategy to preferentially kill cancer cells. We investigated the antitumor effects of trastuzumab and Taxol in combination with glycolysis inhibitors in breast cancer. We found that trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via downregulation of HSF1 and LDH-A in ErbB2-positive cancer cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, increased glycolysis via HSF1 and LDH-A contributes to trastuzumab and Taxol resistance. Strikingly, we found that combining trastuzumab or Taxol with glycolysis inhibition synergistically inhibited both drug-sensitive and -resistant breast cancers in vitro and in vivo, due to more efficient inhibition of glycolysis. These results show how glycolysis inhibition can dramatically enhance the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab in ErbB2-positive breast cancers, potentially useful as a strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.

        "Background":"['Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and highly invasive type of breast cancer, and patients diagnosed with IBC often face a very poor prognosis. IBC is characterized by the lack of primary tumor formation and the rapid accumulation of cancerous epithelial cells in the dermal lymphatic vessels. Given that normal epithelial cells require attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for survival, a comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying IBC cell survival in the lymphatic vessels is of paramount importance to our understanding of IBC pathogenesis. Due to the inherent invasive nature of IBC cells, we hypothesized that IBC cells could evade detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis), and rely on tightly regulated intracellular signaling pathways to do so. Here we demonstrate that in contrast to normal mammary epithelial cells, IBC cells robustly survive in ECM-detached conditions. ErbB2 and EGFR knockdown in KPL-4 and SUM149 cells, respectively, causes decreased colony growth in soft agar and increased caspase activation following ECM detachment, suggesting overexpression/hyperactivation of these oncogenes is vital for IBC evasion of anoikis. Downstream of ErbB2 and EGFR, ERK/MAPK signaling was found to protect cells from anoikis by phosphorylating Bim-EL at serine 59. This phosphorylation of Bim-EL results in a physical interaction between Bim-EL, LC8, and Beclin-1 and prevents Bim-EL from localizing to the mitochondria and promoting cell death. Mutation of the serine 59 site results in increased cell death and a diminished capacity to form a protein complex with LC8 and Beclin-1. Bim-EL knockdown also rescued ECM-detachment-induced death in IBC cells, suggesting Bim-EL is necessary for the induction of anoikis in IBC cells. Interestingly, Bim-EL levels were found to be elevated in ECM-detached IBC cells and present in a significant percentage of IBC patient samples, despite their evasion of anoikis. Therefore, the sequestration of Bim-EL away the mitochondria provides a compelling rationale for how IBC cells survive in the presence of high Bim-EL levels. Furthermore, this mechanism provides a unique and novel opportunity for chemotherapeutic approaches aimed at freeing the already elevated Bim-EL levels from sequestration to specifically induce cell death in IBC cells.']",

In addition, ErbB2/T/T2-DKO cells formed mammospheres of similar appearance with that of ErbB2 cells in HEMA-coated plates. However, after dispersion of the mammospheres into single cells, ErbB2/T/T2-DKO cells formed dead cell aggregates, while ErbB2 and ErbB2/T-KO cells formed secondary mammospheres, suggesting that the self-renewal capacity of ErbB2/T/T2-DKO cells is impaired. Mechanistic studies reveal that ErbB2/T/T2-DKO cells are sensitive to death caused by ER stress but not by TRAIL or DNA damage, and that this sensitivity is significantly inhibited by knockdown of RIP1.

        "Background":"['Background', '    The triple-negative (TN) immunohistochemical (IHC) definition for basal-like breast cancer lacks specificity. This aggressive subtype is best identified with the addition of EGFR and CK5/6 biomarkers; however, the subgroup of TN breast cancers that lack expression of these biomarkers (5NP) is mostly uncharacterized. Recently, an additional intrinsic subtype, claudin-low, was identified using microarray-based gene expression data. These tumors are characterized by the low expression of ERBB2, ESR1, and cell-cell adhesion proteins such as claudins 3/4/7 and E-cadherin.  Methods', '    Microarray gene expression and IHC data were collected from two independent cohorts', ' Washington University (WU, n=114) and University of North Carolina (UNC, n=98). Tumors were assigned as claudin-low or not using a genomic predictor. An IHC surrogate for the claudin-low subtype was developed, and applied to a tissue microarray (TMA) from the University of British Columbia (UBC, n=3473) linked with extensive clinicopathological and outcome data.  Results', '    Against a gene expression gold standard, an IHC combination of ER(-), Her2(-), and E-cadherin(-) best identified claudin-low tumors (PPV=24% WU, 67% UNC; NPV=94% WU, 87% UNC).  This IHC panel identified 226 claudin-low tumors (6.5%) from the UBC TMA. Compared to the basal-like tumors, claudin-low tumors had a similar distribution for patient age, tumor size and lymph node status. However, the claudin-low tumors were less often grade 3 (88% vs. 80%, p = 0.036) or high expressors of Ki67 (61% vs. 82%, p <0.001). Claudin-low subgroup had superior breast cancer specific survival when compared to the basal-like (10-yr BCSS 69% vs. 60%) with a multivariate HR of 0.69 (p = 0.030), adjusted for clinicopathological variables and adjuvant treatment.  Conclusions', '    The ER(-)/Her2(-)/E-cadherin(-) IHC definition identified the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, although with a PPV insufficient for clinical use. The addition of this definition to the standard IHC panel for intrinsic breast cancer subtypes (ER, PR, Her2, Ki67, EGFR and CK5/6) isolates a subgroup of TN tumors that are clinically distinct from basal-like breast cancers.']",

        "Background":"['One of highly pathogenic breast cancer cell types are the SLUG-high claudin-low triple negative (negative in the expression of estrogen, progesterone and ERBB2 receptors) breast cancer (TNBC) cells. These cells are highly metastatic and have low levels of the motility regulatory catenin plakoglobin. In order to link high levels of the transcriptional repressor SLUG in the TNBC cells with low levels of plakoglobin we found that SLUG inhibits the expression of plakoglobin gene directly in these cells and thus, among other downstream effects, help disseminating these tumor cells. Overexpression of SLUG in the SLUG-deficient cancer cells significantly decreased the levels of mRNA and protein of plakoglobin. On the contrary, knockdown of SLUG in SLUG-high cancer cells elevated the levels of plakoglobin. Overexpression of SLUG in the SLUG-deficient cells elevated the invasiveness and motility of these cells. On the other hand, knockdown of plakoglobin in these low motility non-invasive breast cancer cells did not affect the ability of the cancer cells to penetrate Matrigel matrix but increase the growth and migration rates of these cells. This study thus implicates high levels of SLUG and low levels of plakoglobin as determinants in the progression of highly disseminating breast cancer.
